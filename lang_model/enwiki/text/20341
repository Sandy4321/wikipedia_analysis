'''State Route 190''' (SR 190) is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] that is split into two parts by the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]]. The western portion of begins at [[Tipton, California|Tipton]] at a junction with [[SR 99 (CA)|SR 99]] and heads east towards [[Porterville, California|Porterville]] before ending at [[Quaking Aspen, California|Quaking Aspen]] in the [[Sequoia National Forest]]. The eastern portion begins at [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|US 395]] at [[Olancha, California|Olancha]], heads east through [[Death Valley National Park]], and ends at [[California State Route 127|SR 127]] at [[Death Valley Junction, CA|Death Valley Junction]]. The 43.0-mile<ref name=traversible>[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/TravHwy02.pdf Traversible Highways Report 2002] [sic]</ref> (69.2 km) portion over the Sierra Nevada remains unconstructed, and the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) has no plans to build it through the [[wilderness]] areas.<ref name=district9/>

The route east of [[SR 136 (CA)|SR 136]] near [[Keeler, California|Keeler]] is on the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], but is a two-lane road. Except west of [[SR 65 (CA)|SR 65]] in [[Porterville, CA|Porterville]], SR 190 is eligible for the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]]; the part within Death Valley National Park, known as the '''Death Valley Scenic Byway''', has been added to the system and is a [[National Scenic Byway]].<ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], California Scenic Highway Mapping System: [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LandArch/scenic_highways/tulare.htm Tulare County] and [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LandArch/scenic_highways/inyo.htm California Scenic Highway Mapping System: Inyo County], accessed January 2008</ref>

==Route description==
State Route 190 begins at [[SR 99 (CA)|SR 99]] just south of downtown [[Tipton, CA|Tipton]] in [[Tulare County, CA|Tulare County]] and heads straight east along the flat [[San Joaquin Valley]] on Avenue 144. There is a short [[expressway]] segment in [[Porterville, CA|Porterville]], including a [[cloverleaf interchange]] at [[SR 65 (CA)|SR 65]] and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the [[Tule River]], passing the south side of [[Lake Success (California)|Lake Success]], as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of [[County Route J37 (California)|County Route J37]], an access road to [[Balch Park]] in the [[Mountain Home State Forest]], at the forks of the river near the community of [[Springville, California|Springville]]. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near [[Camp Nelson, California|Camp Nelson]], where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many [[hairpin curve]]s in order to rise to [[Quaking Aspen, California|Quaking Aspen]], the source of the South Fork Middle Fork and the end of the western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained [[Western Divide Highway]] continues south to a point west of [[Johnsondale, California|Johnsondale]], where traffic can turn east to reach [[US 395 (CA)|US 395]] via [[Sherman Pass (California)|Sherman Pass]] and [[County Route J41 (California)|County Route J41]].<ref name=district6>[[California Department of Transportation]] District 6, [http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist6/planning/tcrs/sr190tcr/sr190fulldoc.pdf State Route 190 Transportation Concept Report], February 2007</ref><ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed January 2008 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref>

From Quaking Aspen across the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] to [[Olancha, CA|Olancha]], Caltrans has adopted a proposed alignment, but is unlikely to build it, in part due to two protected [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness areas]] - the [[Golden Trout Wilderness]] and [[South Sierra Wilderness]] - along the route. The unconstructed routing heads northeast from Quaking Aspen, cresting a small summit before following Freeman Creek easterly past the [[Freeman Creek Grove]], crossing the [[Kern River]] near its forks, and then using the path of Rattlesnake Creek and Beach Creek to the Beach Meadows area. Crossing several ridges to the northeast, SR 190 would make its way to the [[South Fork Kern River]] near [[Monache Mountain]], then heading southeast along that waterway to the vicinity of [[Haiwee Pass]]. That pass, elevation about 8200 feet (2500 m) [[above sea level]], would take the highway over the [[Sierra crest]] into [[Inyo County, CA|Inyo County]], dropping for 12.0 miles (19.3 km) in a north-northeasterly direction to [[US 395 (CA)|US 395]] at Olancha (elevation 3650 feet/1100 m).<ref name=traversible/><ref name=district9>[[California Department of Transportation]] District 9, [http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/fus/Planning/TCR/SR_190_TCR.pdf State Route 190 Transportation Concept Report], 2003</ref>

[[Image:SR 190 in Panamint Valley.jpg|thumb|left|SR 190 in [[Panamint Valley]]]]
The eastern section of SR 190 begins at [[Olancha, CA|Olancha]] in the [[Owens Valley]], at the intersection with [[US 395 (CA)|US 395]]. The route heads northeast along the southeast side of [[Owens Lake]] to the junction with [[SR 136 (CA)|SR 136]] southeast of [[Keeler, California|Keeler]], where it turns southeast and east around the south side of the [[Inyo Mountains]]. After passing the turnoff to [[Darwin, CA|Darwin]], SR 190 enters [[Death Valley National Park]] and becomes curvier as it heads down into the [[Panamint Valley]]. The highway crosses the valley and then turns northeast over [[Towne Pass]] and into the northern part of [[Death Valley]] at [[Stovepipe Wells, CA|Stovepipe Wells]]. Within the valley, at the intersection with North Highway, which leads to [[Scotty's Castle]] and [[Beatty, Nevada]], SR 190 turns southeast through Death Valley, which it remains inside until the turnoff to [[Badwater Basin]], the lowest point in North America, near the settlement of [[Furnace Creek, CA|Furnace Creek]]. It leaves the valley to the southeast alongside [[Furnace Creek Wash]], where the highway is usually closed at least once a year by [[flash flood]]s. SR 190 turns east away from the wash at the turnoff to [[Dante's View]], and soon leaves the park, after which it follows a mostly straight alignment to its end at [[SR 127 (CA)|SR 127]] at [[Death Valley Junction, CA|Death Valley Junction]].<ref name=district9/><ref name=maps/>

==History==
The path of SR 190 east of the [[Panamint Range]] in [[Death Valley National Park]] was followed in late 1849 and early 1850 by the [[Death Valley '49ers]], a group of [[California Gold Rush|'49ers]] that had left the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] at [[Enterprise, Utah]] to look for a shortcut to [[Walker Pass]]. The pioneers crossed the state line from [[Nevada]] near [[Ash Meadows]], following the general route of present SR 190 from [[Death Valley Junction, CA|Death Valley Junction]] into [[Death Valley]], which they left to the west into [[Panamint Valley]]<!--some by Towne Pass and some by Emigrant Canyon; see http://www.deathvalley.com/gold/goldarticle15.shtml--> and then turned south towards present [[SR 178 (CA)|SR 178]].<ref>Roger Brandt, [[National Park Service]], [http://www.nps.gov/deva/historyculture/the-lost-49ers.htm The Lost '49ers], accessed January 2008</ref> After [[ore]] was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road,<ref name=oldtopos>[[United States Geological Survey]], [http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/EART/CA/CA_125k/ Ballarat 1913 and Furnace Creek 1910] (scale 1:250000)</ref> though most travel into the valley, such as the [[twenty mule team]] [[borax]] route, was from the south.<ref>[[National Park Service]], [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/deva/section3a5.htm Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Wingate Wash], March 1981</ref>

The second boom in Death Valley was [[tourism]], started in the 1920s by [[Herman Eichbaum]]. After several failures in getting a [[toll road]] approved from [[Lida, Nevada]] or over [[Towne Pass]], he scaled back plans to include only the part of the latter route between southeast of [[Darwin, California|Darwin]] and his resort at [[Stovepipe Wells, CA|Stovepipe Wells]]. The new [[Eichbaum Toll Road]] was certified complete on [[May 4]], [[1926]], and toll rates were set: $2 per motor vehicle and 50&cent; per person. In 1933, the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system, including a new (unsigned) '''Route 127''', connecting [[Tipton, CA|Tipton]] with [[Baker, CA|Baker]] via [[Lone Pine, CA|Lone Pine]] and [[Death Valley Junction, CA|Death Valley Junction]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2038}}: "State Highway Route 31 to Death Valley and connection to California-Nevada State line."

(c) Route 31 to Death Valley."</ref> The [[Death Valley National Monument]] was created on [[February 11]], [[1933]], and in December 1934 the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] paid $25,000 for the 30.35-mile (48.84 km) road, giving the 17 miles (27 km) east of the park boundary at the pass to the [[National Park Service]]<!--then or in 1937? district9 says 1937-->.<ref>[[National Park Service]], [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/deva/section3d2.htm Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Stovepipe Wells Hotel], March 1981</ref> The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon [[paved road|paved]]<!--NPS says mostly paved, but http://usautotrails.com/CaliforniaPage/DeathValleyPage/image2.html (1941) shows completely paved; the NPS may be talking about pre-Darwin cutoff--> the route from Lone Pine (on [[US 395 (CA)|US 395]]) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to [[Baker, CA|Baker]] (on [[US 91 (CA)|US 91]]).<ref>[[National Park Service]], [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/deva/section3d3.htm Death Valley Historic Resource Study: Furnace Creek Inn], March 1981</ref> The work was completed in October 1937, including the 17.5-mile (18 km) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of [[Panamint Springs, CA|Panamint Springs]].<ref>Fitzhugh L.

At that time, maintenance was given back to the state, which rebuilt the destroyed segment.<ref name=district9/>

When the state sign route system was created in 1934, '''Sign Route 190''' was assigned to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction, while the remainder to Baker became part of [[SR 127 (CA)|Sign Route 127]].<ref>[[California Highways and Public Works]], [http://www.gbcnet.com/roads/ca_routes_1934.html State Routes will be Numbered and Marked with Distinctive Bear Signs], August 1934</ref> However, the highway was not continuous, with the roadway from Tipton (which had been built by [[Tulare County, CA|Tulare County]]<ref>Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 ([http://www.archive.org/details/californiahighwa00blowrich Archive.org] or [http://books.google.com/books?id=osgNAAAAYAAJ Google Books]), pp. 278-279</ref>) ending at [[Quaking Aspen, California|Quaking Aspen]] (east of [[Camp Nelson, California|Camp Nelson]]) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine.<ref name=map-1941>[[Automobile Club of Southern California]], [http://usautotrails.com/CaliforniaPage/DeathValleyPage/image2.html Mojave & Colorado Deserts], 1941</ref> In 1923, [[Tulare County, CA|Tulare County]] businessmen had begun to push for a new trans-Sierra highway connecting [[Porterville, CA|Porterville]] with [[Lone Pine, CA|Lone Pine]],<ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Trail Over Mountains Supported, [[June 15]], [[1923]], p.

I18</ref> The first piece, which would turn out to be the only one built, opened in early July 1931 to [[Quaking Aspen, California|Quaking Aspen]] (and became a state highway in 1933).<!--presumably the county built it? did they improve the existing road at the same time?--><ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Mountain Road Opened, [[July 5]], [[1931]], p. 5</ref> Grading of the 15-mile (24 km) [[Western Divide Highway]], a [[county road]] that was supposed to continue south to [[SR 155 (CA)|SR 155]] at [[Greenhorn Summit]],<ref>[[Fresno Bee Republican]], Western Divide Party Urges Road Work At Once, [[August 23]], [[1954]]</ref> was completed from Quaking Aspen south to near [[Johnsondale, California|Johnsondale]] in July 1962.<ref>[[Fresno Bee Republican]], Grading is All Finished on Scenic Divide Highway, [[July 20]], [[1962]]</ref> A new road from Johnsondale across [[Sherman Pass (California)|Sherman Pass]], maintained by the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and Tulare and [[Inyo County, CA|Inyo]] Counties (the latter as [[County Route J41 (California)|County Route J41]]), was completed in 1976, allowing traffic on the western segment of SR 190 to reach US 395, though via a longer route than the proposed SR 190.<ref name=J41>[[Fresno Bee]], See It All in the Sierra, [[October 24]], [[1976]]</ref>

In March 1959, Tulare County approved a change in location of the proposed highway to [[Olancha Pass]]<ref>[[Reno Evening Gazette]], Olancha Pass Road Approved, [[March 13]], [[1959]]</ref> ([[Haiwee Pass]], just to the south, was soon considered for a possible alternate location<ref>[[Nevada State Journal]], Inyo Group Seeks Fund for Olancha Pass Route, [[April 22]], [[1962]]</ref>), and the legislature moved the main line of Route 127 south to that location, crossing [[US 395 (CA)|US 395]] at [[Olancha, CA|Olancha]], later that year. The old route from southeast of [[Keeler, California|Keeler]] to Lone Pine remained as a branch,<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1355|p=3627}}</ref> and was still signed as SR 190.<ref>[[H.M. Gousha Company]], California, 1963</ref> Also in 1959, the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker was added to the proposed [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], though no parts have been upgraded as such.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1062|p=3114}}: "Route 127 from Route 23 to Route 31 via Death Valley."</ref> The east-west piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], and the north-south part became State Route 127, which it had been signed as; the branch to Lone Pine became a new [[State Route 136 (California)|State Route 136]].<ref name=law-renumbering>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1185}}: "Route 190 is from Route 99 near Tipton to Route 127 near Death Valley Junction via the vicinity of Porterville, Camp Nelson, Olancha, and Death Valley."</ref> By the mid-1970s, the [[environmental movement]] had essentially killed the planned connection,<ref name=J41/> and the designation of the [[Golden Trout Wilderness]] in 1978 and [[South Sierra Wilderness]] in 1984 were the final blow, though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass.<ref name=district9/>
