"'''Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)'''", sometimes referred to as just "'''Stronger'''", and originally known as "'''What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)'''", is a song by American pop rock singer [[Kelly Clarkson]]. It was written by [[J<U+00F6>rgen Elofsson]], Ali Tamposi, [[David Gamson]], and [[Greg Kurstin]]; with Kurstin handling the production. It was sent to mainstream radio on January 17, 2012 by [[RCA Records]] as the second single from Clarkson's fifth album, ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]'' (2011). The song is an uptempo pop rock song that uses a vibrant beat pulsating with synth and electric guitar. According to Clarkson, the song was inspired by a [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] quote, translated to "That which does not kill us makes us stronger", and its lyrics contain the theme of empowerment. The song has been received as an anthem for empowerment and recovery.

Critical reception for "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" was mostly positive. Critics were impressed with the song's catchy hook and strong chorus although some of them panned the lyrics for being too clich<U+00E9>d. The song is a commercial success worldwide. In the United States, it became Clarkson's third song to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for three non-consecutive weeks, surpassing "[[A Moment Like This]]" and "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]" as her longest number one and her best-selling single in the US. The song also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], [[Adult Pop Songs]], [[Pop Songs]], and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, making her the first artist ever to have topped the Hot 100 and each of ''Billboard'''s Dance/Club Play Songs, Country Songs, Adult Contemporary, Pop Songs, and Adult Pop Songs charts. Internationally, the song topped the charts in Poland and the airplay chart of Denmark; it charted inside the top-ten in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Hungary, New Zealand, Scotland, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom; and attained a top-twenty position in Australia, Brazil, Norway, and Switzerland. The song also became Clarkson's first song to chart in Finland, and her second song to chart in France, following "[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]".

The song's accompanying music video was directed by Shane Drake. It incorporates the theme of a global flash mob. The music video garnered positive reception from critics who felt that its overall impact was exuberant. Clarkson has performed "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" during several live appearances, notably during the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 1)|first season]] of the American singing competition ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'', the ''[[VH1 Divas#VH1 Divas 2011|2011 VH1 Divas]]'' special, and on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|37th season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|Saturday Night Live]]''. Clarkson also included the song in the [[set list]] of her [[Stronger Tour]].

==Background and release== 
"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" was written by [[J<U+00F6>rgen Elofsson]], Ali Tamposi, [[David Gamson]], and [[Greg Kurstin]]. Elofsson also co-wrote "[[A Moment Like This]]", which was released as a non-album single by Clarkson in 2002 after winning the inaugural season ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref name="about">{{cite web| url=http://top40.about.com/b/2011/10/05/kelly-clarkson-shifts-to-uptempo-on-what-doesnt-kill-you-stronger.htm|title=Kelly Clarkson Shifts To Uptempo On "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)"| first=Bill| last=Lamb |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=2011-10-05|accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Tamposi stated that the song was inspired by her mother telling her that "what doesn't kill you is going to make you stronger and its not going to kill you" on a particularly bad day. Although Tamposi found the phrase a bit cheesy, it stuck in her mind and she brought it to songwriter Elofsson in a writing session. Tamposi also stated that Clarkson rewrote part of the lyrics before the single was recorded and that the finished version exceeded Tamposi's expectations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Waterman |first=Doug |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/03/the-story-behind-the-song-kelly-clarkson-stronger-what-doesnt-kill-you/ |title=The Story Behind The Song: Kelly Clarkson, <U+201C>Stronger<U+201D> |publisher=American Songwriter |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]] prior to the song's release, Clarkson remarked that she could not wait to perform the song live. She commented, "We've already rehearsed it, and it's so much fun. It's like this big dance anthem.
