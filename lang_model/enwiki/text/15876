'''Richard Barre''' (born around 1130-died around 1202) was a medieval English justice, clergyman, and writer. He was educated at the law school of Bologna, and entered royal service under King [[Henry II of England]], later serving Henry's son and successor [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. For Henry, he served as a diplomat, being involved in a minor way with the king's quarrel with [[Thomas Becket]], which earned Barre a condemnation from Becket. Barre also briefly served King Henry's son [[Henry the Young King]]. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal justice during Richard's reign, and was one of the main judges in the period 1194<U+2013>1199, but when King [[John of England|John]] became king, Barre was no longer employed as a judge, due to earlier disagreements with John. Barre was the author of a work of Biblical extracts that was dedicated to a later patron, [[William Longchamp]], who was the [[Bishop of Ely]] and [[Chancellor of England]].

==Early life==

Whether Barre was a native of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his surname appears to derive from the Norman village of Le Barre, near [[Lisieux]], in the present day department of Eure. Barre had a relative, Hugh Barre, who was [[Archdeacon of Leicester]] in the 1150s, and other relatives were the Sifrewast family, knights in [[Berkshire]]. Barre attended the law school at [[Bologna]] before 1150, and was a student there with [[Stephen of Tournai]], who later became [[Bishop of Tournai]] in 1192. Barre's first service after school was with either [[Robert de Chesney]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] or with Nicholas, [[Archdeacon of Huntingdon]], as Barre witnessed charters for both men in the period 1160 though 1164. By 1165, Barre joined the household of King [[Henry II of England]].<ref name=Barre182>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 182<U+2013>185</ref>

==Service to King Henry==

Barre served King Henry during the king's quarrel with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who had gone into exile in 1164 over the dispute about the limits of royal authority over the Church.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192<U+2013>195</ref> Because of Barre's close ties to King Henry, Becket considered Barre one of the king's "evil counselors", and was the subject of denunciations by the archbishop. During January and February 1170, Barre was sent by the king to Rome on a diplomatic mission to the pope connected with the Becket dispute.<ref name=Barre186>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 186<U+2013>187</ref>

After the murder of Becket in December 1170,<ref name=Huscroft192/> Barre was sent to Rome by King Henry, along with the archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Evreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, in order to plead the royal case with the papacy.<ref name=HenryII305>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 305</ref> Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy to not impose an [[Papal interdict|interdict]] on England or to [[excommunicate]] the king.<ref name=Barre186/> Shortly after this, Barre was rewarded with the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts at the papacy.<ref name=Barre186/> He was a royal justice at Oxford in 1172, for he was named a justice "in curia domini Regis" in September.<ref name=Sharpe128>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compedium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 128</ref> He was named [[chancellor]] to King Henry's eldest living son, [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile, and returned to the king's service. Barre brought with him the younger Henry's seal.<ref name=Barre186/>

Besides the Lisieux archdeaconry, Barre held the [[prebend]] of Hurstborne and Burbage in the [[Diocese of Salisbury]] from 1177,<ref name=Hurst>Greenway ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34256 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 4: Salisbury: Prebendaries of Hurstborne and Burbage]''</ref> and the prebend of Moreton and Whaddon in the [[Diocese of Hereford]] from 1180 through 1184.<ref name=Moreton>Barrow ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34443 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 8: Hereford: Prebendaries of Moreton and Whaddon]''</ref>  He continued to hold the archdeaconry at Lisieux until 1188,<ref name=ArchEly>Greenway ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33865 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Ely: Archdeacons of Ely]''</ref> and was at Lisieux for most of the late 1170s and 1180's.<ref name=Sharpe129>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 129</ref> In 1187, Barre was once more employed on a diplomatic mission by King Henry, being sent to the continent with letters to the German Emperor, the King of Hungary and the Emperor at Constantinople to secure aid for King Henry's projected crusade.<ref name=HenryII>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 607</ref>

==Later years and death==

After the death of King Henry, Barre joined the service of [[William Longchamp]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as [[Archdeacon of Ely]],<ref name=Barre188/> and he held the office by 4 July 1190.<ref name=ArchEly/> Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. Longchamp's exile in 1191 meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] returned to England in 1194.<ref name=Barre188/> Although Barre returned to England, Longchamp did not return to his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.<ref name=Sharpe134/> 

Barre  was one of the main royal justices for the period 1194<U+2013>1199.<ref name=Barre188>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref> He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, [[Eustace (Bishop of Ely)|Eustace]].<ref name=Sharpe129/> However, Barre had encurred the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince [[John of England|John]], and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202,<ref name=Barre190/> when he was servicing as a judge-delegate for [[Pope Innocent III]],<ref name=Sharpe129/> but he may have been alive as late as 1213.<ref name=Barre190>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 190</ref> Barre retained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.<ref name=Barre196>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 196</ref>

==Literary work==

Barre wrote a work on the Bible entitled ''Compendium de veteri et novo testamento'', which he dedicated to William Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the work with marginal notations such as were done with [[gloss]]es on [[Roman law]].<ref name=Barre196/> It is still extant in two manuscript copies, MS [[British Library]] [[Harleian Collection|Harley]] 3255, and [[Lambeth Palace]] MS 105.<ref name=DNB>Rigg "Barre, Richard (b. c.1130, d. in or after 1202)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript, which in the words of Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied the work, "provides [a] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible." Because of the dedication to William Longchamp, and the fact that Longchamp, who is named as "bishop, legate, and chancellor" but was driven into exile in October 1191, it is likely that the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191.<ref name=Sharpe134>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 134</ref> The prologue to the work describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work, instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.<ref name=Sharpe135>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' pp. 135<U+2013>138</ref>

A third copy of Barre's ''Compendium'' may have existed at [[Leicester Abbey]], where a late 15th century library catalogue records a work by Barre on the testaments, and is titled "Compendium Ricardi Barre super utroque testamento", which makes it likely to be a copy of the ''Compendium''. The same catalog also records that five books once owned by Barre were owned by the Abbey <U+2013> copies of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'',  [[Justinian]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex]]'', [[gloss|glossed]] copies of the [[Psalter]] and some of the ''[[Pauline Epistles|Letters]]'' of [[St. Paul]], as well as [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]''. Also, another Leicester Abbey manuscript records some satirical verses that were said to be Barre's.<ref name=Sharpe135/>
