==Biography and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Placidodomingo.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo (1979)]]
Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo was born on 21 January 1941, in the [[Retiro (Madrid)|distrito de Retiro]]<ref>[http://zonaretiro.com/gente/placido-domingo-barrio-retiro-calle-ibiza/ Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo: <U+201C>Nac<U+00ED> a diez minutos del Real, en la calle Ibiza<U+201D>] (spanish)</ref> section of [[Madrid, Spain]], and in 1949 moved to [[Mexico]] with his family, who ran a [[zarzuela]] company. He studied piano at first privately and later at the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]].

In 1957, Domingo made his first professional appearance, performing with his mother in a concert at [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n]]. He made his [[opera]] debut performing in Manuel Fern<U+00E1>ndez Caballero's zarzuela, ''Gigantes y cabezudos'', singing a baritone role. At that time, he was working with his parents' zarzuela company, taking baritone roles and as an accompanist for other singers. Among his first performances was a minor role in the first Mexican production of ''My Fair Lady'' where he was also the assistant conductor and assistant coach. The company gave 185 performances, which included a production of [[Franz Leh<U+00E1>r|Leh<U+00E1>r]]'s ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in which he performed alternately as either Camille or Danilo.

In 1959, Domingo auditioned for the [[Mexico National Opera]] as a baritone, but was then asked to sight-read some arias and lines in the [[tenor]] range. Finally he was accepted in the National Opera as a tenor comprimario and as a tutor for other singers. He provided backup vocals for ''Los Black Jeans'' in 1958, a rock-and-roll band led by [[C<U+00E9>sar Costa]]. He studied [[piano]] and [[conducting]], but made his stage debut acting in a minor role in 1959 (12 May) at the Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara as Pascual in ''Marina''. It was followed by Borsa in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (with [[Cornell MacNeil]] and [[Norman Treigle]] also in the cast), Padre Confessor (''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]'') and others.

He played piano for a ballet company to supplement his income as well as playing piano for a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, [[operetta]]s, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], and [[Anton Chekhov]].

===1960s<U+2013>1980s===
In 1961, Domingo made his operatic debut in a leading role as Alfredo in ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[Monterrey]] (Maria Teresa Montoya theater) and, later in the same year, his debut in the United States with the [[Dallas Opera|Dallas Civic Opera]], where he played the role of Arturo in [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' opposite [[Joan Sutherland]] in the title role.

In 1962, he returned to Texas to play the role of Edgardo in the same opera with [[Lily Pons]] at the Fort Worth Opera.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/domingo_p.html American Masters]</ref> At the end of 1962, he signed a six-month contract with the Israel National Opera in [[Tel Aviv]], but later extended the contract and stayed for two and a half years, singing 280 performances of 12 different roles.

In June 1965, after finishing his contract with Israel National Opera, Domingo went for an audition at the [[New York City Opera]] and scheduled to make his New York debut as Don Jose in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', but his debut came earlier when he was asked to fill in for an ailing tenor at the last minute in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. On 17 June 1965, Domingo made his New York debut as B. F. Pinkerton at the New York City Opera. In February 1966, he sang the title role in the U.S. premiere of [[Alberto Ginastera|Ginastera]]'s ''[[Don Rodrigo]]'' at the [[New York City Opera]], with much acclaim. The performance also marked the opening of the City Opera's new home at [[Lincoln Center]].

His official debut at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York occurred on 28 September 1968 when he substituted for [[Franco Corelli]], <!-- a tenor famous for cancelling at the last minute according to [[Schuyler Chapin]],--> in [[Francesco Cilea|Cilea]]'s ''[[Adriana Lecouvreur]]'' singing with [[Renata Tebaldi]]. Before ''Adriana Lecouvreur'', he had sung in performances by the Metropolitan Opera at Lewisohn Stadium of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' in 1966. Since then, he has opened the season at the Metropolitan Opera 21 times,<ref>[http://www.operainfo.org/broadcast/operaBio.cgi?person=268&language=1 Metropolitan Opera International Radio Broadcast Information Center <U+2014> 2007<U+2013>08 Broadcasts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> surpassing the previous record of [[Enrico Caruso]] by four. He made his debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] in 1967; at the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1968; at both [[La Scala]] and [[San Francisco Opera]] in 1969; at the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1970; and at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1971. He has now sung at practically every other important [[opera house]] and festival worldwide. In 1971, he sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'' at the Metropolitan Opera, and continued to sing that part for many years, singing it, in fact, more than any other role.<ref>[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/domingo_p.html American Masters: Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo]</ref>

Domingo has also conducted opera <U+2014> as early as 7 October 1973, ''La traviata'' at the [[New York City Opera]] with [[Patricia Brooks]] <U+2014> and occasionally symphony orchestras as well. In 1981 Domingo gained considerable recognition outside of the opera world when he recorded the song "[[Perhaps Love (song)|Perhaps Love]]" as a duet with the late American [[Country music|country]]/[[folk music]] singer [[John Denver]]. In 1987, he and Denver joined [[Julie Andrews]] for an [[Emmy Award]]-winning holiday television special, ''The Sound of Christmas'', filmed in [[Salzburg]], Austria.

On 19 September 1985, the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|biggest earthquake in Mexico's history]] devastated part of the Mexican capital. Domingo's aunt, uncle, his nephew and his nephew's young son were killed in the collapse of the Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n apartment block in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] housing complex. Domingo himself labored to rescue survivors. During the next year, he performed [[benefit concert]]s for the victims and released an album of one of the events.

===1990s <U+2013> present===
[[File:Statue of Placido Domingo in Mexico City.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A statue in Mexico City as a recognition to his contributions to [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] victims and his artistic works]]
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s until today, Domingo has continued performing, singing many of the same roles, but adding new roles as well <U+2014> among them the title roles in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]''; [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' as Figaro; Wagner's ''[[Die Walk<U+00FC>re]]'' as Siegmund; [[Franz Leh<U+00E1>r|Leh<U+00E1>r]]'s ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' as Danilo; and [[Franco Alfano|Alfano]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (Alfano)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' as Cyrano. From the middle 1990s to early in 2008 alone, he added 38 new roles to his repertoire, covering opera in six different languages (English, Italian, French, German, Russian and Spanish). The latest was the Italian opera by [[George Frideric Handel]], ''[[Tamerlano]]''.

Giving him even greater international recognition outside of the world of opera, Domingo participated in [[The Three Tenors]] concert at the eve of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final]] in Rome with [[Jos<U+00E9> Carreras]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. The event was originally conceived to raise money for the Jos<U+00E9> Carreras International Leukemia Foundation and was later repeated a number of times, including at the three subsequent World Cup finals ([[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|1994]] in Los Angeles, [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998]] in Paris, and [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|2002]] in [[Yokohama]]). Alone, Domingo again made an appearance at the final of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|2006 World Cup]] in Berlin, along with rising stars [[Anna Netrebko]] and [[Rolando Villaz<U+00F3>n]]. On 24 August 2008, Domingo performed a duet with [[Song Zuying]], singing ''<U+00C0>i de Hu<U+01D2>y<U+00E0>n (The Flame of Love)'' at the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] in Beijing.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/beijing_olympics/story/0,27313,24234672-5017607,00.html Curtain closes on unforgettable Beijing Games]</ref><ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90779/90867/6485497.html Domingo and Chinese singer Song perform together at Beijing Olympics closing]</ref><ref>[http://en.beijing2008.cn/ceremonies/photos/closingceremony/carnival/n214584160.shtml Beijing 2008: Singers Domingo and Song perform]</ref> The Beijing Olympics was the second Olympics at which he performed; he sang the [[Olympic Hymn]] at the closing ceremonies of the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=zAJ_mhr6Il0|title=Placido Domingo - Olimpic Closing Ceremony Barcelona 1992}}</ref> At the [[1994 Winter Olympics|Olympic games that followed that]], he would meet [[Sissel Kyrkjeb<U+00F8>]], who performed the Olympic Hymn at both the opening and closing ceremonies at those games.

Since 1990 Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo has received many awards and honors for his achievement in the field of music and in recognition of his many benefit concerts and contributions to various charities.

In 2002, Domingo wrote "Himno del Centenario del Real Madrid". The song was presented live at the Bernabeu Stadium during celebrations of the football club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s 100 years anniversary.

During the visit of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at [[Nationals Park]] and at the Italian embassy in [[Washington D.C.]] Domingo sang on 16 and 17 April 2008 while, on 15 March 2009, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] paid tribute to Domingo's 40th anniversary with the company with an on-stage gala dinner at the Met's 125th anniversary, commemorating his debut in [[Adriana Lecouvreur]] as Maurizio opposite Renata Tebaldi on 28 September 1968.<ref>[http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/news_flash.aspx Domingo's 40th Anniversary with The MET]</ref>

On 29 August 2009, he sang ''[[Panis Angelicus]]'' at the funeral mass of [[Ted Kennedy|Senator Ted Kennedy]] in the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.<ref>James Rowley and Alison Fitzgerald, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=apfaXe71Ia70 "Nation<U+2019>s Political Elite Gathers for Kennedy Farewell"], ''Bloomberg News'', 29 August 2009. Accessed 29 August 2009.</ref>

Ever a sympathetic colleague, in March 2011 he refused to sing in Buenos Aires until the city settled a bitter musicians strike at the [[Teatro Col<U+00F3>n]].<ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/03/hot_topic_domingo_refuses_to_s.html Breaking: Domingo refuses to sing until Buenos Aires settles musicians strike].

Domingo sang Neptune in the Metropolitan Opera's World Premiere performance of ''[[The Enchanted Island (opera)|The Enchanted Island]]'' on 31 December 2011. A pastiche of Baroque opera with story and characters drawn from [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', a performance of the production was telecast on PBS' ''[[Great Performances at the Met]]''.

On 13 May 2012, Domingo performed during Real Madrid CF's season-ending celebrations, the team having won their 32nd league title. Domingo is a fan of Los Merengues.

====Domingo as opera company director====
Domingo began an affiliation with the [[Washington National Opera]] in 1986, when he appeared in its world premiere production of Menotti's ''Goya''.  This was followed by performances in a production of ''[[Tosca]]'' in the 1988/89 season. Beginning in the 1996/97 season, he took on the role of Artistic  Director, bringing new life to the company's productions through his many connections to singers throughout the world and his own annual appearances in one role each season.<ref>Phillips-Matz, p. 53</ref>  One example of his ability to bring new singers to the stage were those by the then up-and-coming [[Anna Netrebko]] as Gilda in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' during the 1999/2000 season. In 2003 Domingo became General Director and his contract was extended through the 2010-2011 season.

Parallel to Domingo's management of the Washington company, he had been Artistic Director of the [[Los Angeles Opera]] since 2000, assumed the position of General Director in 2003, and on 20 September 2010, he announced that he would renew his contract as General Director of that company through 2013,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/09/placido-domingo-renews-contract-with-la-opera-through-2013.html|title=Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo renews contract with L.A. Opera through 2013|work=L.A. Times|date=20 September 2010|authors=David Ng and Mike Boehm|accessdate=13 November 2010}}</ref> A week later he announced that he would not renew his contract as General Director of the Washington National Opera beyond its June 2011 expiration date, and reaction to this included ''The Washington Post'' 's comments on his accomplishments: 
:Domingo's goal was to make the WNO an internationally regarded company. At the beginning of his tenure, he lifted the opera to a new level, bringing in more international stars and big-name productions - including Jos<U+00E9> Carreras in Wolf-Ferrari's ''[[Sly (opera)|Sly]]'', Mirella Freni singing opposite Domingo in ''[[Fedora (opera)|Fedora]]'', and Ren<U+00E9>e Fleming in ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]''. And his commitment to American opera meant that the WNO presented the second or third productions of a number of important works: Maw's ''Sophie's Choice'', Bolcom's ''A View From the Bridge'', Previn's ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''.<ref>[[Anne Midgette]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706891.html "Domingo will not renew D.C. opera contract"], ''The Washington Post'', 28 September 2010</ref>

Domingo attempted to quash criticism in East Coast newspapers that he was taking on too much when the singer gave an interview in the [[Los Angeles Times]] in which he stated, "When I rest, I rust".<ref>Reed Johnson, [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/21/entertainment/la-ca-placido-domingo21-2010feb21 "Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo's juggling act: The superstar rejects recent suggestions that his busy life is affecting L.A. Opera and his other commitments"] ''The Los Angeles Times'', 21 February 2010</ref>

====Taking on baritone roles====
In what has been called his "final career move" {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}, Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo announced on 25 January 2007 that in 2009 he would take on one of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s most demanding baritone roles, singing the title role in ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. However, he would not be giving up tenor roles.

The debut performance was at Berlin State Opera on 24 October, followed by 29 other performances during 2009/2010 at major opera houses around the world, including the Met and the [[Royal Opera House]] in London.<ref>[http://www.placidodomingo.com/inhalt.php?id=847&menu_level=1&id_mnu=847&id_kunden=196 Domingo's performance calendar]</ref>

Domingo has performed other baritone roles including the character of Rigoletto in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in August 2010 at Reignwood Theatre in Beijing. In March 2012, for the first time he sang the baritone role of the Cenobite monk Athana<U+00EB>l in [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]'s ''[[Tha<U+00EF>s (opera)|Tha<U+00EF>s]]'', his 139th role.  Again, in 2011 he took on Rigoletto in a live broadcast in Europe shot in real locations in [[Mantua]].

He appeared as Doge Foscari in Verdi's ''[[I due Foscari]]'' for the Los Angeles Opera in September 2012, a production directed by [[Thaddeus Strassberger]], and again in Valencia in early 2013.
In March 2013, at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], he appeared for the first time as Giorgio Germont in Verdi's ''[[La Traviata]]''.<ref>[http://www.metoperafamily.org/PageFiles/41061/Mar%2014%20Traviata.pdf   Metropolitan Opera, 14 March 2013, performance information (PDF)]</ref>
He took on the title role of Verdi's ''[[Nabucco]]'' at Covent Garden in March/April 2013,<ref>Hugo Shirley, "Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo's Operalia Winners", ''Opera'', London, September 2012, pp. 1153 - 1154.</ref><ref>[http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/nabucco-by-daniele-abbado Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Nabucco production 2013]</ref> and since reprised it in [[St. Petersburg]],<ref>[http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/playbill/playbill/2013/5/4/1_2030/ Mariinsky Theatre, 4 May 2013, performance information]</ref> [[Beijing]], and [[Verona]].<ref>[http://www.arena.it/en-US/spettacolo.html?idperformance=1387#.UdBBD1P6jeb Arena di Verona, 4 July 2013, performance information]</ref>

===Family and personal life===
He was born to Pl<U+00E1>cido Francisco Domingo Ferrer (8 March 1907 <U+2013> 22 November 1987) <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED71F3EF935A15752C1A961948260 "Placido Domingo Ferrer, Baritone, 80", (obit.)] ''The New York Times'', 26 November 1987</ref> and Pepita Embil Echan<U+00ED>z (28 February 1918 <U+2013> 28 September 1994),<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E6D71738F932A3575AC0A962958260 "Pepita Embil Domingo; Soprano and Tenor's Mother, 76"] (obit.), ''The New York Times'', 1 September 1994</ref> two Spanish [[zarzuela]] stars who nurtured his early musical abilities. Domingo's father was half [[Catalan people|Catalan]] and half [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], while his mother was a [[Basque people|Basque]]. His father was a [[violin]]ist performing for [[opera]] and [[zarzuela]] orchestra. He was a baritone and actively took roles in zarzuela; however, his promising singing career ended after he damaged his voice by singing while suffering from a cold. Domingo's mother was an established singer who made her zarzuela debut at the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in Barcelona. She met her husband at age 21 while performing in [[Federico Moreno Torroba]]'s ''Sor Navarra''. In 1946 Moreno Torroba and Domingo's parents formed a zarzuela company and travelled frequently to Mexico. His parents later stayed permanently in Mexico and established their own zarzuela troupe, the Domingo-Embil Company.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/placido-domingo/ Domingo biography at bookrags.com]</ref> In addition to their son, they also have a daughter, Maria Jos<U+00E9> Domingo de Fernandez.

On 29 August 1957 at age 16, Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo married a fellow piano student, Ana Mar<U+00ED>a Guerra Cu<U+00E9> (1938<U+2013>2006) and his first son, Jos<U+00E9> Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo Guerra (Pepe), now a noted photographer,<ref>[http://www.educacioncontracorriente.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60361:expone-fotografias-jose-placido-domingo-hijo-del-tenor-en-la-ciudad-de-mexico&catid=22:articulistas Expone fotograf<U+00ED>as Jos<U+00E9> Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo, hijo del tenor, en la Ciudad de M<U+00E9>xico].

==Recordings==
{{See also|Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo discography}}
Domingo has made well over 100 [[Sound recording|recordings]], most of which are full-length operas, often recording the same role more than once. Among these recordings is a boxed set of every tenor aria [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] ever wrote, including several rarely performed versions, in different languages from the original operas, which Verdi wrote for specific performances.

In August 2005, EMI Classics released a new studio recording of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in which Domingo sings the title role of Tristan. A review of this recording, headlined "Vocal perfections", that appeared in the 8 August 2005 issue of ''[[The Economist]]'' begins with the word "Monumental" and ends with the words, "a musical lyricism and a sexual passion that make the cost and the effort entirely worthwhile". It characterized his July 2005 performance of Siegmund in Wagner's ''[[Die Walk<U+00FC>re]]'' at Covent Garden as "unforgettable" and "luminous". The review also remarks that Domingo is still taking on roles that he has not previously performed.

Recordings that were released in 2006 include studio recordings of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Edgar (opera)|Edgar]]'', [[Isaac Alb<U+00E9>niz]]'s ''[[Pepita Jim<U+00E9>nez]]'', as well as a selection of Italian and [[Canzone Napoletana|Neapolitan songs]], titled ''Italia ti amo'' (all three with Deutsche Grammophon). Domingo appeared as the star act in the [[New Orleans Opera]] Association's ''A Night For New Orleans'' with [[Frederica von Stade]] and [[Elizabeth Futral]], in March 2006. The concert was to raise funds for the rebuilding of the city. In September 2011, aged 70, he signed an exclusive record contract with Sony Classics.<ref>[[Norman Lebrecht]], [http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/09/now-hes-a-baritone-hes-got-a-new-record-contract.html "Now he<U+2019>s a baritone, he<U+2019>s got a new record contract"].

===''Christmas in Vienna''===
{{Further|Christmas in Vienna (album)|Christmas in Vienna II|Christmas in Vienna III|Christmas in Vienna VI}}
In 1990, the idea for a [[Christmas]]-themed concert, involving the collaboration of Domingo, fellow operatic tenor and friend [[Jos<U+00E9> Carreras]], and pop music legend [[Diana Ross]] was first brought up. [[Vienna]] was chosen in 1992 to host the event due to its reputation as a capital of music and the particular charm of Austria during Christmas time. The [[Wiener Symphoniker]] under the direction of maestro [[Vjekoslav <U+0160>utej]] provided the orchestral music, and the Gumpoldskirchen Children's Choir provided choral vocals. On 23 December 1992, the first in what would turn out to be a series of ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts was seen worldwide by several hundred million people. Pl<U+00E1>cido Domingo returned to Vienna for many more ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts, performing with stars and friends of both pop and classical music, including [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Sissel Kyrkjeb<U+00F8>]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Riccardo Cocciante]], [[Patricia Kaas]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tony Bennett]] and others.
