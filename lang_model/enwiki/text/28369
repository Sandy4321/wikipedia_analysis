== Research ==
Although widely discussed, there has been scant information in the medical research literature<ref> {{cite book |last= Komisaruk |first= Barry R. |coauthors= Beverly Whipple, Sara Nasserzadeh, Carlos Beyer-Flores |title= [[The Orgasm Answer Guide]] | url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/57696975/The-Orgasm-Answer-Guide | page = 70 |publisher= [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year= 2009 |month= November |isbn= 978-0-8018-9396-4}} </ref> until an article by Chalett and Nerenberg in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' 2000, which found little formal data regarding the condition but concluded that "The treatment is sexual release, or perhaps straining to move a very heavy object."

== Common forms of treatment ==
The easiest way to relieve the symptoms of blue balls is ejaculating<ref name="chalett" />. The resultant ejaculation jump-starts the sympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow through the penis area, dissipating the fluid buildup<ref name="chalett" />. Even without ejaculation, the symptoms of blue balls usually subside within an hour of onset, but they can also last much longer, up to 24<U+2013>48 hours or longer.{{fact|date=May 2012}} Simply lying down can also sometimes help the pain associated with blue balls.

One [[folk medicine|folk remedy]] for blue balls is the cold shower. Putting cold substances on the [[crotch]] supposedly helps stimulate the muscles that control blood flow.
