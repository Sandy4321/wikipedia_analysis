'''Howgrave''' is a [[civil parish]] in the [[Hambleton]] district of [[North Yorkshire]], England.  It is a very small parish, with an area of only {{convert|323|acres}} and a population in 1961 of only 10.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10436291/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain: Howgrave population table]  In recent censuses Howgrave has been included with [[Kirklington cum Upsland]] parish.</ref>  There is no modern village in the parish.  The site of the [[deserted medieval village]] of Howgrave lies in the west of the parish, {{convert|0.3|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Sutton Howgrave]].<ref name=dmv>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1019382 English Heritage:  List entry for Howgrave deserted medieval village]</ref>

Despite its small size Howgrave has a complicated geography and history.  Today Howgrave is divided between two civil parishes, Howgrave itself and Sutton with Howgrave, which, despite its name, includes only part of Howgrave.  Until the 19th century both parishes were [[Township (England)|townships]] in the ancient parish of [[Kirklington, North Yorkshire|Kirklington]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Kirklington/Kirklington90.html GENUKI. Kirklington: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1890.]</ref> but small parts of Howgrave were [[detached part]]s of two other townships and parishes.  A farm and a house were detached parts of the township of [[Nunwick cum Howgrave]] in the parish of [[Ripon]], and another house was a detached part of the township of [[Holme, North Yorkshire|Holme cum Howgrave]] in the parish of [[Pickhill]].<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Kirklington/more.html GENUKI: Places in the parish of Kirklington in 1822]</ref>

The toponym is derived from the [[Old English]] ''hol gr<U+0101>f'', meaning "grove in the hollow".<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Howgrave  | year = 2010  | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names  | editor-last = Watts | editor-first = Victor  | volume =   | page =  | place =   | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | id =|isbn=978 0 521 16855 7 }}</ref>  Howgrave was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] (as ''Hograve''), when different [[carucate]]s were held by three different owners, the [[Earl of Richmond]], the [[Archbishop of York]] and the [[Bishop of Durham]].<ref name=vch>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64770 |title=Parishes: Kirklington |author=William Page (editor)|authorlink=William Henry Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1914 |work=[[Victoria County History]]: A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 1 |accessdate=24 June 2013 }}</ref>  It was considered a separate manor of Kirklington in the 16th century,<ref name=vch/> but by 1640 it was recorded that there were no inhabitants in the township.<ref name=dmv/>  Howgrave became a separate civil parish in 1866.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10436291 Vision of Britain: Howgrave CP]</ref>  The detached parts of Nunwick cum Howgrave, a total of {{convert|118|acres}},<ref>See parish areas in 1891 and 1901 in [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10457579/census Vision of Britain: Nunwick cum Howgrave census reports]</ref> became detached parts of the new civil parish of Nunwick cum Howgrave.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10457579/boundary Vision of Britain:  Nunwick cum Howgrave boundary map]</ref>  In the late 19th century {{convert|33|acres}} of the detached parts of Nunwick cum Howgrave were transferred to the civil parish of Howgrave,<ref>See parish areas in 1891 and 1901 in [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10436291/census Vision of Britain: Howgrave census reports]</ref> and {{convert|85|acres}} of Nunwick cum Howgrave were transferred to the civil parish of Sutton Howgrave.<ref>See parish areas in 1891 and 1901 in [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10470717/census Vision of Britain: Sutton Howgrave census reports]</ref>

In 1974 Howgrave was transferred to Hambleton district in the new county of North Yorkshire.  Since 1978 it has shared a [[grouped parish council]], Kirklington with Sutton Howgrave, with the parishes of [[Kirklington cum Upsland]] and Sutton with Howgrave.
