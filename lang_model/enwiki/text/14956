'''[[Germany]]''' committed [[war crimes]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The most notable of these is [[the Holocaust]], where millions of people, of which 43% (6 million out of 14 million) were Jews, were murdered. However, millions also died as a result of other German actions in those two conflicts.

==World War I==
{{main|Rape of Belgium}}
According to the [[Schlieffen plan]], the German Army needed a quick victory in the West (as in 1870, and again in 1940), before engaging the Russian Empire in the East. The price for this was an attack on neutral [[Belgium]], which, in connection with reports about alleged German atrocities, caused [[anti-German sentiment]] in many countries.

The Great War is possibly the first occasion in which the question of misbehaviour by one of the combatants became a significant ''political'' issue, an issue deeply tied up with the emergence of [[propaganda]] as a weapon, more effective, in its own way, than guns and bombs.  Indeed, the British might have been said to have been carried into the war on a wave of propaganda, centering on the rape of 'Gallant little Belgium.'  As practitioners of the new art they were far more adept than the Germans, and this weapon was to be used time and again to explain Prussian barbarism, from the execution of [[Edith Cavell]] and the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]].  Whereas the early campaign had been for the consumption of a domestic audience, later activities were aimed at influencing public opinion in the [[United States]].  Many of the main accusations against the "[[Huns]]" were summarised in [[The Bryce Report|''The Bryce Report'']] of 1915.  As a political tactic the whole thing was quite masterly, later earning the respect of [[Adolf Hitler]] in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.  

It was only after the war that doubts began to set in; and, as the attitude towards Germany began to change in the inter-war period, many of the accusations were considered to be outright fabrications, including arguably the most infamous of all, the alleged crucifixion of a Canadian soldier by the name of [[Harry Band]].  In Britain a strong pacifist mood took shape in the 1920s, which argued that 'atrocity propaganda', as it was called, had been used to manipulate people into supporting the mass slaughter on the Western Front.  A classic example of this is ''[[Falsehood in Warfare]]'' by [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]], published in 1928.  In Germany, a commission set up by the [[Reichstag]] to examine the issue, published a report in 1927, denying that any atrocities had ever taken place.  And so the matter passed into popular consciousness, making it difficult to get people in the Allied nations to accept the truth of the stories that filtered through from occupied Europe during the Second World War.  

Regardless, the [[Rape of Belgium]] was not just fabrication, propaganda and lies, as the Germans tacitly admitted themselves in the ''[[White Book]]'' of 1915, which justified actions in Belgium against what was described as [[Francs-tireurs]], alleged irregular forces.  The simple fact is that Belgian resistance was tougher, and more prolonged, than the Germans had expected.  The invading army became ever more anxious as it advanced, often attributing enemy fire to civilian irregulars.  Because of this they began to take pre-emptive measures against an imaginary enemy.  Civilians were shot on suspicion alone.  The Kaiser himself justified the actions of his troops in a note to [[Woodrow Wilson]] of September 1914, "My generals were finally compelled to take the most drastic measures in order to punish the guilty and to frighten the blood-thirsty population from continuing their work of vile murder and horror."  

Over 6000 Belgian civilians were shot, sometimes in large groups by machine gun, in a brief ten-day period during the second half of August 1914. Whole villages were destroyed.  In [[Louvain]] alone 248 people were killed by nervous German soldiers, convinced that they faced a civilian uprising.  On the basis of these very real incidents it became possible to weave stories of mass rape and mutilation; of murdered nuns and disfigured children.  Allied propaganda, in other words, may have exaggerated, but it was not without substance.

==German acknowledgment of war crimes==
===World War I===
The Germans had to accept the Treaty of Versailles which outlined many clauses the main being the fact that the Germans had to take the guilt for causing the war and pay out 6,6 billion in ramifications for its damages.

===World War II===
Germany's response to its war crimes has been largely lauded by the former [[Allies]].  The Government of the ''Federal Republic of Germany'' (''West'' Germany until 1990) offered official apologies for Germany's role in the Holocaust. Additionally, German leaders have continuously expressed repentance, most notably when former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] fell on his knees in front of a Holocaust memorial in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], also known as the ''[[Warschauer Kniefall]]'' in 1970. Germany has also paid extensive reparations, including nearly $70 billion to the state of [[Israel]]. It has given $15 billion to Holocaust survivors and will continue to compensate them until 2015. Additionally, the government of Germany coordinated an effort to reach a settlement with German companies that had used slave labor during the war; the companies will pay $1.7 billion to victims. Germany also established a National Holocaust Memorial Museum in [[Berlin]] for looted property.

Germany's treatment of war criminals and war crimes has also met with approval. Germany help track down war criminals for the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and opened its wartime archives to researchers and investigators. Additionally, Germany verified over 60,000 names of war criminals for the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] to prevent them from entering the [[United States]] and provided similar information to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. On the other hand numerous war criminals were never brought to justice and lived their lives as respected citizens and even state officials, despite numerous pleas for their extradition or trial, stated by countries invaded by Germany. For instance, this was the case of [[Heinz Reinefarth]] and [[Erich von dem Bach]], each of them responsible for death of dozens of thousands of civilians in [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

The German education system focuses on teaching about the Holocaust and the [[Third Reich]] and denounces the crimes committed during World War II. Additionally, German legislation outlaws Nazi works like ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and makes [[Holocaust denial]] a criminal offence. Furthermore, even other symbols of [[Nazism]], like the [[Swastika]] and so-called "Hitler Salute", are illegal in Germany. 

However, Germany is still criticized by some regarding its response. The German government never apologized for the invasions or took responsibility for World War II. [[Poland]] still insists that Germany must offer an apology for the suffering of its people during the war. Additionally, the emphasis for blame is often placed on individuals like [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] instead of the government itself, so no restitution has been made to any other national government by Germany. Even after [[German reunification]] in 1990, Germany rejected claims to reparations made by Britain and [[France]], insisting that all reparations had already been resolved. Additionally, Germany has been criticized for waiting too long to seek out and return looted property, some of which is still missing and possibly hidden within Germany. Germany has also had trouble dealing with stolen property in private hands because of the need to compensate the owners.
