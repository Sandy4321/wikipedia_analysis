The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has led the PRC under a [[single-party system]] (excluding [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) since the state's establishment in 1949. The PRC is involved in a long-running dispute over the [[political status of Taiwan]].  The CPC's rival, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) ,  retreated to [[Taiwan]] and [[list of islands of the Republic of China|surrounding islands]] after [[Chinese Civil War|its civil war defeat in 1949]], and continues to claim legitimacy over [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] as the [[Republic of China]] (ROC or Taiwan).  The PRC regards the ROC claims as illegitimate.  The term "[[Mainland China]]" is sometimes used to denote the areas under PRC rule, but usually excludes its two [[Special Administrative Region (China)|Special Administrative Region]]s: [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

The [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with the Communist Party of China in control of the mainland, and the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) retreating to [[Taiwan]] and some outlying islands of [[Fujian]]. On [[October 1]], [[1949]] [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China, declaring "the Chinese people have stood up."<ref>[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE STOOD UP!].

Following a series of dramatic economic failures, Mao stepped down from his position as chairman in 1959, with [[Liu Shaoqi]] as successor. Mao still had a huge influence over the Party, but was removed from day-to-day management of economic affairs, which came under the control of Liu Shaoqi, and [[Deng Xiaoping]].

In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] which led to a major upheaval in Chinese society.

[[Image:DengXiaoping.jpg|thumb|left|150px|In 1978, the late [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated China's market-oriented reforms.]]
After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], Deng Xiaoping quickly wrested power from Mao's anointed successor [[Hua Guofeng]]. Although Deng never became the head of the Party or State himself, his influence within the Party led the country to economic reforms.  The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over people's personal lives and the [[People's Commune|commune]]s were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a [[mixed economy]]. The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on [[December 4]], [[1982]].

Despite market reforms, the Communist Party of China remains in sole control, requiring the registration and supervision of all civic organizations. The CPC suppresses groups that it claims are threats to social stability and national unity, such as [[Falun Gong]] and the separatist movement in [[Tibet]]. Supporters of these policies claim that they safeguard stability in a society that was torn apart by class differences and rivalries, has no tradition of civil participation, and limited rule of law. Opponents claim that these policies severely curtail [[human rights]] and that they have resulted in a [[police state]], creating an atmosphere of fear and ignorance.

[[Image:Tianasquare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] was an attempt to bring political reforms and [[democracy]] to [[mainland China]].]]
In 1989 the death of the pro-reform official, [[Hu Yaobang]], helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for democratic reform and freedom. The protests were soon put down on [[June 4]] when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and tanks entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in hundreds of deaths and casualties, thousands according to the [[Red Cross]]. This event was [[tank man|famously videotaped]] and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the PRC government. The [[June 4th Incident]] has been a taboo subject within the government, though the dictatorship did defend its actions by saying that it was necessary for the continued stability and economic development of the country.

[[Image:prcflagphogel.jpg|thumb|right|The Chinese flag before a modernizing [[Shanghai]].]]
President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of [[Shanghai]], led post-Tiananmen China in the 1990s, bringing unprecedented wealth and international standing to the country. Under Jiang Zemin's ten years of administration, China pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual GDP growth rate of 11.2%. The country formally joined the [[WTO]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm Nation bucks trend of global poverty] ([[July 11]] [[2003]]).

People's Daily Online.</ref>

Although China needs economic growth to spur its development, the government has begun to worry that rapid economic growth could negatively impact the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that many people are not benefiting from China's economic miracle. As a result, the PRC, under current President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], have initiated policies to address these issues, but the outcome remains to be seen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm "China worried over pace of growth"]. BBC. Accessed [[16 April]] [[2006]].</ref> For much of China's population, living standards have seen extremely large improvements, and freedom continues to expand, but political controls remain tight.

While the PRC is regarded as a [[communist state]] by many [[Political science|political scientists]], simple characterizations of China's political [[structure]] are controversial.<ref>Boum, Aomar (1999). [http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/ej/jpe/volume_6/goodmanonoivol6.htm Journal of Political Ecology: Case Studies in History and Society]. Retrieved [[April 18]] [[2006]].</ref> The PRC government has been variously described as [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[communism|communist]], and [[socialism|socialist]], with heavy restrictions remaining in some areas, most notably on [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|the Internet]] and in [[freedom of the press|the press]]. The country is ruled under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. Its incumbent [[Paramount Leader]] is President [[Hu Jintao]] and [[premier]] is [[Wen Jiabao]] with people's congress and [[Communist Party of China]].

[[Image:Hu Jintao during a defense meeting held at the Pentagon, May 2002, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Hu Jintao]] is [[President]] of the PRC.]]
The country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, referred to in China as "democratic parties" (<U+6C11><U+4E3B><U+515A><U+6D3E>), which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] and the [[National People's Congress]], while serving mainly to endorse CPC policies. There have been some moves toward political liberalisation, in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels,<ref name="poll">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/08/content_288018.htm|title=Beijingers Get Greater Poll Choices|accessdate = 2007-02-18|publisher=China Daily|year=2003|author=Unknown Author|format=Web}}</ref> and that legislatures have shown some assertiveness from time to time; however, the Party retains effective control over governmental appointments. This is because, in the absence of meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default in most electorates.<ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib775/aib775n.pdf "Does China<U+2019>s Land-Tenure System Discourage Structural Adjustment?" by Bryan Lohmar and Agapi Somwaru].

''URL accessed [[3 May]] [[2006]].''</ref> The CPC has been enforcing its rule by clamping down on political dissidents while simultaneously attempting to reduce dissent by improving the economy and allowing public expression of personal grievances so long as they are not organized. Current political concerns in China include lessening the growing gap between rich and poor and fighting corruption within the government leadership.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/WTO/China-Wealth-Gap11may02.htm China sounds alarm over fast-growing gap between rich and poor]. Retrieved [[April 16]] [[2006]].</ref> The support that the Communist Party of China has among the Chinese population in general is unclear because there are no consistently contested national elections.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/08/content_288018.htm</ref> Also, private conversations and anecdotal information often reveal conflicting views. However, according to a survey conducted in Hong Kong, where a relatively high level of freedom is enjoyed, the current CPC leaders have received substantial votes of support when residents were asked to rank their favourite Chinese leaders from the mainland and Taiwan.<ref>[http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/release/release361.html "HKU POP SITE releases the latest ratings of the top 10 political figures in Mainland China and Taiwan as well as people's appraisal of past Chinese leaders"].

For much of China's history, the state had been ruled by some form of [[Chinese Empire|centralized imperial monarchy]], which was followed by a chaotic succession of largely [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] governments as well as [[warlord]]-[[Military occupation|held]] administrations since the last few years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1912.

{{main|Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China}}
{{seealso|China and the United Nations}}
The PRC maintains diplomatic relations with most major countries in the world. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative for "China" in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang ([[August 22]] [[2004]]). [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/08/22/2003199768 Perseverance will pay off at the UN] The Taipei Times.</ref> It is considered a founding member of the UN, though the PRC was not in control of China at the time. The PRC was also a former member and leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

Under the [[One-China policy]], the PRC has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to [[Taiwan]] and sever any official ties with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) government. The government actively opposes foreign travels by former and present Taiwanese officials, such as [[Lee Teng-hui]] and [[Chen Shui-bian]], and other politically controversial figures, such as [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the current [[Dalai Lama]] of [[Tibet]], in an official context. 

China has been playing an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, China proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html "China<U+2019>s Quest for Asia"], ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134. Accessed [[22 April]] [[2006]].</ref> The EAS, which includes [[ASEAN Plus Three]], [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), with [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] republics.

Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful rise]]. However, conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy]] in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[U.S.-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001. Also, its foreign relations with many other Western nations suffered for a time following the Tiananmen Square Incident in 1989, sometimes referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or [[June 4]] Incident. The relationship between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]] has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its war-time past to the satisfaction of the PRC, e.g. [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient attention paid to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in some [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which enshrines thousands of World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convicts.  Relations with China and Japan also have been strained by the [[Anti-Japanese Riots]] that occurred in spring of 2005.  However, Sino-Japanese relations have warmed considerably since [[Shinzo Abe]] became the new Japanese Prime Minister in September 2006.  A joint historical study to be completed by 2008 of WWII atrocities is currently being conducted by China and Japan.

Bordering the most countries in the world, the PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]].  China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, the PRC and Russia signed the [[Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] ([[March 21]] [[2006]]). Retrieved [[April 16]] [[2006]].</ref> which paved the way in 2004 for Russia to transfer Yinlong Island as well as one half of Heixiazi Island to China, ending a long-standing [[Sino-Russian relations|Sino-Russian]] border dispute.  Other territorial disputes include islands in the [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s, and undefined or disputed borders with [[India]], [[Tajikstan]] and [[North Korea]].

While accompanying a rapid economic rise, the PRC seeks to maintain a policy of quiet diplomacy with its neighbors. Steady, economic growth, while participating in regional organizations and cultivating bi-lateral relations will ease suspicion over China's burgeoning military capabilities.

===Population policy===
{{main|One-child policy}}
With a population of over 1.3 billion, the PRC is very concerned about its population growth and has attempted with mixed results to implement a strict family planning policy. The government's goal is [[one-child policy|one child per family]], with exceptions for ethnic minorities and flexibility in rural areas, where a family can have a second child if the first is a girl or physically disabled. The government's goal is to stabilize population growth early in the twenty-first century, though some current projections estimate a population of anywhere ranging from 1.4 billion to 1.6 billion by 2025.

The policy is resisted, particularly in rural areas, because of the need for [[agricultural]] labour and a traditional preference for boys. Families who breach the policy often lie during the census. Official government policy opposes forced abortion or sterilization, but allegations of coercion continue as local officials, who are faced with penalties for failing to curb population growth, may resort to forced abortion or sterilization, or manipulation of census figures.

The decreasing reliability of PRC population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult. Estimates by Chinese demographers of the [[Total fertility rate|average number of children for a Chinese woman]] vary from 1.5 to 2.0. The government is particularly concerned with the large imbalance in the [[sex ratio]] at birth, apparently the result of a combination of traditional preference for boys, family planning pressure, and the wide availability of [[ultrasound]], which led to its ban for the purpose of [[sex-selective abortion]].

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[Property|property rights]]<ref name="Constitution" />. However, [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|censorship]] of political speech and information is openly and routinely used to protect what the government considers national security interests.<ref name=right>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sdc/hr_facts.html China Human Rights Fact Sheet] (March 1995). Retrieved [[April 16]] [[2006]].</ref> In particular, press control is notoriously tight: Reporters Without Borders considers the PRC one of the least free countries in the world for the press<ref>http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554</ref>. The government has a policy of limiting some protests and organizations that it considers a threat to social stability and national unity, as was the case with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].  The Communist Party has had mixed success at controlling information: a very strong media control system faces very strong market forces, an increasingly educated citizenry and cultural change that are making China more open. In some cases, especially on environmental issues<ref>[http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/chplca.htm 1998 U.S. Embassy Beijing report "The Fading of Environmental Secrecy"]. Accessed [[February 4]] [[2007]]</ref><ref>[http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/ngo3.htm 1997 U.S. Embassy Beijing report "Environmental NGO's in China: Green is Good, But Don't Openly Oppose the Party"], Accessed [[February 4]] [[2007]]</ref>, China's leaders see expressions of public dissatisfaction as a catalyst for positive change.

At times, the PRC is faced with criticism from foreign governments and [[NGO]]s concerning allegations of gross human rights violations. These criticisms allege that there existed a widespread practice of lengthy detentions without trial, forced confessions, torture, mistreatment of prisoners, as well as allegations of restrictions on freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|the press]], and [[workers' rights]].<ref name=right>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sdc/hr_facts.html China Human Rights Fact Sheet] (March 1995).</ref> Furthermore, China leads the world in [[capital punishment]], accounting for roughly 90% of total death-penalty executions in 2004.<ref>http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0405-07.htm [[5 April]] [[2005]]. Accessed [[23 June]] [[2006]]. ''The Independent/UK'' article, republished.</ref> These issues remain one of the driving forces behind independence movements in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. The PRC government responds to these criticisms by arguing that the notion of human rights should factor in standards-of-living. It views the rise in China's standard-of-living as an indicator of improvement in the human rights issue.<ref>[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/first%20beginning/t56058.htm "China's reform and opening-up promotes human rights, says premier"]. [[11 December]] [[2003]]. Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States. Accessed [[28 April]] [[2006]].</ref>

In [[Reporters Without Borders]]' Annual World Press Freedom Index of 2005,<ref>http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554</ref> the PRC ranked 159 out of 167 places.  PRC journalist [[He Qinglian]] in her 2004 book Media Control in China <ref>[http://hrichina.org/public/contents/article?revision%5fid=29582&item%5fid=29576 Media Control in China] published 2004 by Human Rights in China, New York.

==Political divisions==
{{main|Political divisions of China}}
The People's Republic of China has administrative control over twenty-two provinces (<U+7701>); the government of the PRC considers [[Taiwan Province (People's Republic of China)|T<U+00E1>iw<U+0101>n]] (<U+53F0><U+6E7E>) to be its twenty-third province.<ref>Gwillim Law ([[April 2]] [[2005]]). [http://www.statoids.com/ucn.html Provinces of China]. Retrieved [[April 15]] [[2006]].</ref> (See [[Political status of Taiwan]] for more information). Apart from provinces, there are five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] (<U+81EA><U+6CBB><U+533A>), each with a designated minority group; four [[Municipality|municipalities]] (<U+76F4><U+8F96><U+5E02>); and two [[Special Administrative Region]]s (<U+7279><U+522B><U+884C><U+653F><U+533A>) that enjoy considerable autonomy.

The twenty-two provinces, five autonomous regions and four municipalities can be collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]", a term which usually excludes Hong Kong and Macau.

{{main|Geography of China}}
The PRC is the largest [[country]] in [[area]] in [[East Asia]] (excluding Russia) and the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third or fourth largest]]<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1018965313021 "The People's Republic of China"] ([[September 7]] [[2005]]). Foreign & Commonwealth Office</ref> in the world by land-and-sea area. The dispute over size is due to both the validity of claims by the PRC on territories such as [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] (both territories also claimed by India), and a recent change in the method used by the [[United States]] to calculate its surface area.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html "Rank Order - Area"] ([[March 29]] [[2006]]). CIA World Factbook.</ref> It borders 14 nations (counted clockwise from south): [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma), [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]],<ref>China's border with Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] province. The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.</ref> [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[North Korea]].

The territory of the PRC contains a large variety of landscapes. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, grasslands can be seen. Southern China is dominated by hill country and low [[mountain range]]s. In the central-east are the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Huang He]] and [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang). Other major rivers include the [[Xijiang River]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur]].

To the west, major mountain ranges, notably the [[Himalaya]]s with China's highest point [[Mount Everest]], and high [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes such as the [[Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].

A major issue is the continued expansion of deserts, particularly the [[Gobi Desert]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm "Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm"]. BBC news. Accessed [[17 April]] [[2006]].</ref> Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of [[sandstorm]]s, prolonged [[drought]] and poor agricultural practices result in [[dust storm]]s plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Dust from the northern plains has been tracked to the [[West Coast of the United States]].  Water, [[erosion]], and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries.

China has some relevant environmental regulations: the 1979 Environmental Protection Law, which was largely modelled on U.S. legislation. But the environment continues to deteriorate.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ma Xiaoying |coauthors=Leonard Ortalano |title=Environmental Regulation in China |origyear=2000 |origmonth=May |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers}}</ref> While the regulations are fairly stringent, the are frequently disregarded by local communities while seeking economic development. Twelve years after the law, only one Chinese city was making an effort to clean up its water discharges.<ref>Sinkule, Barbara J., ''Implementing Environmental Policy in China'', Praeger Publishers, 1995, ISBN 0-275-94980-X</ref> This indicates that China is about twenty years behind the U.S. schedule of environmental regulation and twenty to thirty years behind Europe.

[[Water pollution]] has increased as an issue along with industrial production.  The Chinese government has chosen a discharge standard measuring the concentration of a pollutant rather than the total pollutant load (as is done in the [[USA]] and many western countries).  As a result many industrial dischargers in China simply dilute the effluent with river water taken from the same source as the receiving waters.  Consequently the outcome has been to create considerable water pollution in many of the country's rivers. 

With regard to carbon emissions, China was exempted from the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and since that treaty was signed, China has become one of the world's top emitters of carbon gases, adding to the threat of [[global warming]].

Part of the price China is paying for increased prosperity is damage to the environment. Leading Chinese environmental campaigner [[Ma Jun]] has warned that [[water pollution]] is one of the most serious threats facing China. According to Ma the drinking water of 300 million peasants is unsafe and water quality in one fifth of the cities is not up to standard. This makes the crisis of water shortages more pressing, with 400 out of 600 cities short of water.<ref name="water">{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/392-Tackling-China-s-water-crisis-online |title=Tackling China's Water Crisis Online |accessdate = 2007-02-18 |publisher=www.chinadialogue.net |year=2006 |author=Ma, Jun, Li, Naomi |format=Web}}</ref>

The PRC, despite possession of [[nuclear weapon]]s and delivery systems, is widely seen by military researchers both within and outside of China as having only limited [[power projection]] capability, so it is not yet considered to be a [[superpower]], though it is widely regarded as a major [[regional power]] and an emerging superpower.<ref>Nolt, James H.

{{main|Economy of the People's Republic of China|Economy of Hong Kong}}
Beginning in late 1978, the Chinese leadership has been [[Chinese economic reform|reforming the economy]] from a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style centrally planned economy to a more [[market]]-oriented economy that is still within a rigid political framework under Party control. The reforms replaced [[collectivization]] with privatization of farmlands, increased the responsibility of local authorities and industry managers, allowed a wide variety of small-scale enterprises to flourish, and promoted foreign investment. Price controls were also relaxed. These changes resulted in mainland China's shift from a [[planned economy]] to a [[mixed economy]]. China became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916768 Five Years of China<U+2019>s WTO Membership.

China was finally able to convince WTO members that without China, the WTO is only partially a worldwide trade organization. The road to the signature of the final agreement of accession was long, but these difficulties pale in comparison to the problems that have not yet been tackled in terms of achieving real implementation of its provisions throughout the territory of the [[People<U+2019>s Republic of China]] (PRC). China<U+2019>s accession surely presents the world trading system with opportunities, but also poses the challenge of integrating a market with strong structural, behavioural and cultural constraints.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=629289 Ibid]</ref>

The government emphasizes personal income and consumption by introducing new management systems to help increase productivity. The government also focuses on foreign trade as a major vehicle for economic growth, which led to 5 [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ: Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, Hainan Province) where investment laws are relaxed so as to attract foreign capital. Since the 1990s, SEZs and similar concepts have been expanded to major Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.  The result has been a 6-fold increase of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] since 1978. Chinese economic development is among the fastest in the world, and has been growing at an average annual GDP rate of 9.4% for the past 25 years.<ref>Malik, Khalid ([[December 16]] [[2005]]).

Mainland China has a reputation as being a low-cost manufacturer, which caused notable disputes in global markets. This is largely because Chinese corporations can produce many products far more cheaply than other parts of Asia or Latin America, and because expensive products produced in [[developed countries]] like the United States are in large part uncompetitive compared to European or Asian goods. Another factor is the unfavorable [[exchange rate]] between the [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]] and the [[United States dollar]] to which it was [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]].

On [[July 21]] [[2005]] the [[People's Bank of China]] announced that it would move to a [[managed float|floating peg]], allowing its currency to move against the [[United States dollar]] by 0.3% a day, while 3% a day against other currencies.<ref>[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t213645.htm China widens yuan, non-dollar trading range to 3%] ([[September 23]] [[2005]]).

Today, a rapidly declining 10 percent of the Chinese population is below the poverty line. 98.9% of the youth population is literate, compared to 69.9% in the 1980s. The life expectancy in China is the third highest in East Asia, after Japan and South Korea. There is a large wealth disparity between the coastal regions and the remainder of the country. To counter this potentially destabilizing problem, the government has initiated the [[China Western Development]] strategy (2000), the [[Revitalize Northeast China]] initiative (2003), and the [[Rise of Central China]] policy (2004), which are all aimed at helping the [[interior]] of China to catch up.

China is currently undergoing major reforms in its financial sector, which has been plagued by nonperforming loans made in the 1980s and early 1990s to inefficient [[state-owned enterprises]].  The government has spent five years and more than US$400 billion cleaning bad loans off the books of the big four state-owned banks, helping prepare them to become shareholder corporations.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/21/business/bank.php China will list the Agricultural Bank of China, once restructured] David Barboza, ''International Herald Tribune''.

After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China started to develop its own indigenous [[nuclear deterrent]] and delivery systems, successfully detonating its first surface nuclear test in 1964 at [[Lop Nor]]. A natural outgrowth of this was a satellite launching program, which culminated in 1970 with the launching of [[Dong Fang Hong I|Dongfang Hong I]], the first Chinese satellite. This made the PRC the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite. In 1992, the [[Shenzhou]] manned spaceflight program was authorized.<ref>[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26079.htm China's First Man-made Satellite] (2003).

Transportation in the mainland of the People's Republic of China has improved remarkably since the late 1990s as part of a government effort to link the entire nation through a series of [[Expressways of China|expressways]] known as the [[National Trunk Highway System]] (NTHS).The total length of expressway is 45,000&nbsp;km at the end of 2006, second only to the United States.

Private car ownership is increasing at an annual rate of 15%, though it is still uncommon due to government policies that make car ownership expensive, such as taxes and toll roads.<ref> [http://www.earlywarning.com/articles/2005_06_13_china_cars_drive "China's Car Drive"] ([[June 13]] [[2005]]).

Air travel has increased, but remains too expensive for most.  Long distance transportation is still dominated by railways and charter bus systems. The railways are still the vital carrier in China, and until this year steam locomotives were still a common sight. It is thought that some are still in use, especially on industrial networks. 

Cities such as [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] are building [[Subway (rail)|subways]] or [[light rail]] systems.  [[Transportation in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] has one of the most developed transport systems in the world.

With economic reform after 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly due to better nutrition despite the disappearance, along with the People's Communes, of much of the free public health services provided in the countryside.

For centuries, opportunity for economic and social advancement in China could be provided by high performance on [[imperial examinations]]. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the view that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and literati painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. China's traditional values were derived from various versions of [[Confucianism]] and [[conservatism]]. A number of more [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[rationalism|rational]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]]. There was often conflict between the philosophies, such as the [[individualism|individualistic]] [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucians]], who believed [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. [[Examination]]s and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian "Asian values."<ref>Bary, Theodore de. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm "Constructive Engagement with Asian Values"]. Columbia University.</ref>

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born in the old society but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and a Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and obedience to the state. Many observers believe that the period following 1949 is a continuation of traditional Chinese [[dynastic]] history, while others say that the CPC's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]], where many aspects of traditional culture were labeled 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of feudalism' by the regime. They further argue that many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese art]], literature, and performing arts like [[Beijing opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and communist propaganda. The institution of the [[Simplified Chinese]] orthography reform is controversial as well. 

Today, the PRC government has accepted much of traditional [[Chinese culture]] as an integral part of Chinese society, lauding it as an important achievement of the [[China|Chinese civilization]] and emphasizing it as vital to a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese national identity]].  Modern Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have become increasingly ready to incorporate various degrees of traditional Chinese culture into their works.

China has one of the [[Sports in China|oldest sporting cultures]] in the world, spanning the course of several millennia. There is, in fact, evidence that a form of [[football (soccer)|football]] was first played in [[China]] around 1000 AD, leading many historians to believe that the popular sport originated from China.<ref>[http://athleticscholarships.net/history-of-soccer.htm Origins of the Great Game]. 2000. Athleticscholarships.net. Accessed [[23 April]] [[2006]].</ref> Besides soccer,<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=370457&cc=5901 ESPN Soccernet]. 2002. ESPN Soccernet. Accessed [[26 January]] [[2006]]</ref> some of the most popular sports in the country include [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], [[swimming]], [[basketball]], and more recently, [[golf]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]]. [[Board games]] such as [[Go (board game)|Go]] (Weiqi), and [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) and recently [[Chess]] are also commonly played and have organised competitions.

[[Physical fitness]] is widely emphasized in [[Chinese culture]]. Morning exercises are a common activity and often one can find the elderly practicing [[qigong]] and [[Tai Chi Chuan]] in parks or students doing stretches on school campuses. Young people are especially keen on [[basketball]], especially in urban centres with limited space and grass areas. The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] has a huge following among Chinese youths, with [[Yao Ming]] being the idol of many.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yao_ming.html |title=Yao Ming |accessdate=2007-03-30 |last=Beech |first=Hannah |year=2003 |format=HTML |work=Asian Heros |publisher=Time Magazine  }}</ref>  The [[2008 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the ''Games of the XXIX Olympiad'', will be held in [[Beijing, China]], and as a result the country has put even more emphasis on sports.

Many traditional sports are also played. The popular Chinese [[dragon boat]] [[dragon boat racing|racing]] (<U+9F99><U+821F>) occurs during the [[Duan Wu festival]]. In [[Inner Mongolia]], sports such as Mongolian-style wrestling and [[horse racing]] are popular. In [[Tibet]], [[archery]] and [[equestrian sports]] are a part of traditional festivals.<ref>Qinfa, Ye. [http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm Sports History of China].
