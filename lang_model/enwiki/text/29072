After understudying in several productions at the Springfield Theatre Centre, Aylesworth was cast in the role of Consuelo in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', while her family was preparing to move to [[Seattle, Washington]]. When her family left for Seattle, she remained in Springfield with family friends for the duration of the play's run.<ref name="Nick Rogers 2003">Nick Rogers, "All in a Day's Work; '24' Actress Landed Her First Role in Springfield," ''State Journal-Register'', February 6, 2003, Entertainment Section.</ref>

After joining her family in Seattle, Aylesworth  attended the [[University of Washington]] and studied [[neuroscience]] with the intention of becoming a [[neurosurgeon]].<ref>Dollarhide, Barbara. "Faces to Watch <U+2013> Hot New Talents Make Contributions to the Arts." ''Seattle Times''. (3 January 1993).</ref> While attending the University of Washington, Aylesworth participated in several local theatre productions including ''Invisible Friends'' at the [[Seattle Children's Theatre]]<ref>Misha Berson, "Invisible Friends is All too Transparent," ''The Seattle Times,'' September 18, 1992, Tempo Section.</ref> and the [[Intiman Playhouse|Intiman Theatre Company]]'s production of [[Peter Pan]] where she played [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]].<ref>Joe Adcock, Intiman Saves 'Peter Pan" from Excessive Sweetness, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', November 13, 1992, What's Happening Section.</ref> 

Aylesworth's performance in ''Peter Pan'' brought her to the attention of talent scouts at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], leading to the beginning of her television and film career as [[Rebecca Lewis]] on the soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]''.<ref>Marla Hart, "Midwest Roots - Shows Subvert Values Even as They Maintain Them," ''Chicago Tribune'', September 2, 1993, Tempo Section.</ref> After her character was written out of ''One Life to Live'', she appeared in the independent film ''Childhood's End'' and the final episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Lifestories: Families in Crisis]]''. During this time Aylesworth also appeared in at least three [[Off Broadway]] productions.

Following a guest appearance on ''[[Law & Order]]'' and a supporting role in the miniseries ''[[A Will of their Own|A Will of Their Own]]'', Aylesworth had minor appearances in the movies ''[[Random Hearts]]'' and ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' followed by a guest star role in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Now and Again]]''. Soon after [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] cast Aylesworth as Becca Coltrane in the pilot for the series ''Sherman's March,'' however, it was not picked up and aired as a standalone television movie.

Aylesworth continued her work on television with guest appearances in ''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', and ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'' as well as being cast in a lead role in the supernatural hospital drama ''[[All Souls (TV series)|All Souls]]''. When ''All Souls'' failed to be continued, Aylesworth joined the cast of ''[[The American Embassy]]'' in the second episode, although she was also credited in the pilot.

Following the cancellation of ''The American Embassy'', Aylesworth auditioned for the part of [[Nina Myers]] on [[Fox Network]]'s ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' but the role went to [[Sarah Clarke]]. When casting began for 24's [[24 (season 2)|second season]], Aylesworth again auditioned, this time for the part of [[Kate Warner]], but the role went to [[Sarah Wynter]]. However, the producers were impressed with her and asked her to join the cast for a ten episode recurring role as [[Michelle Dessler]], a [[Counter Terrorist Unit|CTU]] agent.<ref>Terry Armour, "Armour & Co." ''Chicago Tribune'', March 21, 2004, Arts & Entertainment Section.</ref> Despite being credited as a guest star for the entire season, she appeared in all 24 episodes.<ref>Tara Dilullo, ''24: The Official Companion: Seasons 1 & 2'', (London: Titan Books, 2006), 91.</ref>

Director [[Jon Cassar]] quickly noticed the "chemistry" between Aylesworth and her costar [[Carlos Bernard]], which led to a decision allowing the actors to develop their characters' onscreen relationship.<ref>Tara Dilullo, ''24: The Official Companion: Seasons 1 & 2'', (London: Titan Books, 2006), 107.</ref> The relationship between [[Tony Almeida]] and Michelle quickly became popular with many fans<ref>Reiko Aylesworth, <U+201C>Meeting Michelle,<U+201D> Interview by Tara DuLullio, (Titan Magazines), ''24: The Official Magazine'', (January/February 2007), 49.</ref> and later would resurface as one of the driving forces in ''24'''s [[24 (season 7)|seventh season]].

While on hiatus from ''24'' after season two, Aylesworth filmed an episode for the second season of [[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]], playing a love interest for [[Anthony Michael Hall]]'s [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/07/05/2003-07-05__zone__star_foresees_success.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title='Zone' Star Foresees Success | date=July 5, 2003}}</ref> By 24's [[24 (season 3)|third season]], Aylesworth had become a main cast member with Tony and Michelle now married and holding leadership positions at CTU. However, when the season concluded, the writers announced only the characters of [[Jack Bauer]], [[Chloe O'Brian]] and [[John Keeler]] would return, with the remainder of the cast being dropped.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907915.html | work=Variety | title=New faces for '24' | first=Josef | last=Adalian | date=July 18, 2004}}</ref> Upon being released from ''24'', Aylesworth was cast as Chandra Moore in ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', the lab's new DNA analyst, and while the role was intended to be recurring, it only lasted for the first episode of CSI's fifth season.<ref>Gail Pennington, "TV Dramas Use Conflict -- Lots of Conflict to Gain an Edge," ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', September 30, 2004, Everyday Magazine Section.</ref>

During [[24 (season 4)|''24'' season 4]], it was decided some of the cast from previous seasons would return including [[Carlos Bernard]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], and Reiko Aylesworth. In the twelfth episode, Aylesworth returned, with Michelle Dessler now a high level bureaucrat within the CTU hierarchy. Michelle served as CTU Director for the remainder of the season and resigned shortly thereafter in order to remarry [[Tony Almeida]].<ref>Kevin McDonough, "The Bodies Pile up as '24' Intensifies - Only Half the Series' 24-hour 'Day' Remains; Who Will be Left Alive?

Mason, "Studio Backs ' 3 Lbs.'

It is unknown whether she declined the ''3&nbsp;lbs'' role or she was not offered it again.

Soon after the conclusion of [[24 (season 5)|24's fifth season]], Aylesworth and her ''24'' costar [[D. B. Woodside]] filmed the [[short film|short]], ''First'' which was also written, produced, and directed by Woodside.

In [[2006]] Aylesworth filmed roles for two feature movie along with an independent production. In the [[Kevin Costner]] movie, ''[[Mr. Brooks]],'' Aylesworth portrayed a divorce lawyer, Sheila, who was representing the husband of [[Demi Moore]]'s character, Detective Tracy Atwood. Departing from her previous type of characters, Aylesworth played the [[femme fatale]] Audrey Levine in the Gideon Raff independent thriller, [[The Killing Floor]].<ref>Daniel Pike, "'24' Questions," ''The State Journal-Register'', February 1, 2007, Entertainment Section.</ref>

On 25 September 2006, it was announced that Aylesworth was chosen for one of the two lead roles in ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950639.html | work=Variety | title=Duo boards 'Alien' ship | first=Nicole | last=LaPorte | date=September 24, 2006}}</ref> Her character, Kelly O'Brien, an Army pilot and soldier returning home after being deployed overseas, arrives in [[Gunnison, Colorado]] the day before the [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Aliens]] and [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] invade the town.

In January 2007, Aylesworth had a guest role in two episodes of the ABC comedy, ''[[The Knights of Prosperity]]'', where she played the head of [[Mick Jagger]]'s security company, Simone Cashwell. The Knights attempt to seduce her character in order to obtain the necessary security codes to access [[Mick Jagger]]'s apartment and later trick Simone in order to get her thumbprint which is also needed to open the door.<ref>David Bianculli, "ABC Heist Sitcom's Stealing the Show", ''New York Daily News'', January 3, 2007, Television Section.</ref> Soon after she filmed a supporting role in Hannah Davis and David Conolly's ''The Understudy'' where she played Police Chief Kinsky.

Her role was extended for two additional episodes, but concluded due to the suspension of filming resulting from the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007-2008 WGA Strike]]. In May, 2008 Aylesworth filmed a supporting role in the Steve Morris, independent, comedy ''The Assistants,'',<ref>[http://www.pressrelease365.com/pr/arts-entertainment/movies/assistants-independent-photography-indy-2445.htm ''The Assistants'' Wraps Principal Photography]</ref> which tells the story of a group of [[Hollywood]] assistants who are scheming to have their script turned into a feature film.

Since filming ''The Assistants,'' Aylesworth has focused on television work starting with a recurring role on the ABC series [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']].

Soon after her role on ''Lost'' concluded, it was announced that Aylesworth had joined the cast of [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]'s new ABC crime drama, ''[[The Forgotten (TV series)|The Forgotten]]''. When first made public, ''The Forgotten'' was to focus on a group of amateur detectives, The Identity Network, who are led by Linda Manning (Aylesworth), and focused on identifying murder victims after the police were unable to do so.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i9195894d101675e316a4a0eac727f471</ref><ref name="thefutoncritic.com">http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090331abc05</ref> After the official network [[upfronts]], as well as previews and promotional pictures had been released by ABC, it was announced for reasons as yet unknown that ABC had decided to recast the series and replace the two lead characters, portrayed respectively by [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] and Aylesworth.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i7091575e2b2c21c200d8a26fff08d4a0</ref>
