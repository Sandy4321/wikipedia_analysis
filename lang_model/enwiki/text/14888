'''Timothy Andrew Fischer''', [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]] (born 3 May 1946), is an [[Australia]]n former politician. He served as Deputy Prime Minister in the [[Howard Government]] from 1996 to 1999. He retired from Parliament in 2001, and was the Australian Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] between 2008 and 2012.

==Early history==
Fischer was born in [[Lockhart, New South Wales|Lockhart]], in the [[Riverina]] district of [[New South Wales]], son of a farmer of German descent. He was educated at [[Xavier College (Melbourne)|Xavier College, Melbourne]]. In 1966 he was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Australian Army]], was commissioned at the [[Officer Training Unit, Scheyville]] and served in the [[Vietnam War]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/VeteranDetails.aspx?VeteranId=1257970 |title=Veteran Search Result: Fischer, Timothy Andrew |work=Nominal Roll of Vietnam Roll Veterans |date= |publisher=Department of Veterans' Affairs |accessdate=4 December 2012 }}</ref> - an experience which left him with a lifelong identification with the Australian armed forces, as well as an affinity with Asia.

On his return from Vietnam, Fischer took up farming at [[Boree Creek, New South Wales|Boree Creek]] in the Riverina, and became active in the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], as the party was then called.  He represented [[Electoral district of Sturt (New South Wales)|Sturt]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] from 1971 to 1980 and [[Electoral district of Murray-Darling|Murray]] from 1980 to 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr (Tim) Timothy Andrew Fischer (1946 - ) |work=Members of Parliament |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/72e56bc44fba13e4ca256e2a00050ceb |accessdate=20 February 2010 }}</ref>  He served on the opposition [[frontbench]] from 1978 to 1984.

==Federal political career==
In 1984 Fischer won the federal seat of [[Division of Farrer|Farrer]] for the [[National Party of Australia]] (NPA), as the Country Party had been renamed. Within a year he was on the opposition frontbench, and soon became a popular figure in both the NPA and the Parliament: his sometimes rustic manner and bumbling English concealing a shrewd political brain. In 1990, when an attempt by [[Charles Blunt]] to modernise the NPA's image ended with his losing his seat, Fischer was elected NPA leader, defeating the former leader [[Ian Sinclair]].

Fischer was an enthusiastic supporter of the "Fightback" package of economic and tax reforms proposed by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[John Hewson|Dr John Hewson]] in 1991. But he was unsuccessful in persuading the majority of rural voters, particularly in [[Queensland]], that the proposed changes, particularly the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was in their interests, and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] under [[Paul Keating]] won the 1993 election.

The Liberals finally regained office under [[John Howard]] in 1996. Fischer became Deputy Prime Minister and [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade]].  The Liberals had won a majority in their own right in the 1996 election, leaving the Nationals in a much weaker position compared to previous Coalition governments.  Nonetheless, Fischer was fairly active.  He supported the government introducing tough [[gun control]] measures following the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in April 1996, measures which were opposed by much of his party's rural base.

Fischer also had difficulty with the determination of many Liberals, including the Treasurer, [[Peter Costello]], to carry out sweeping free-market reforms, including abolishing tariff protection for rural industries, deregulating petrol prices and other measures seen as harmful by farmers' organisations. The issue of [[native title]] for [[indigenous Australians]] following the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo]] and [[Wik Decision|Wik]] decisions also caused much political difficulty for Fischer.

Further trouble for Fischer and the NPA came with the rise of [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]], a right-wing populist party led by [[Pauline Hanson]], a disendorsed Liberal candidate who was nonetheless elected member for the [[Queensland]] seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]] at the 1996 federal election. One Nation had its greatest appeal in country areas of New South Wales and Queensland<U+2014>the NPA's traditional heartland.  For much of 1997 and 1998, it looked as though One Nation might sweep the NPA out of existence. In the 1998 election campaign, however, Fischer strongly counter-attacked One Nation, mainly on the grounds of their "flat tax" economic policies, and succeeded in holding the NPA's losses to one [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seat in Queensland.

==Family life and post-political career==

In 1992 Fischer married Judy Brewer, and they had two sons called Dominic and Harrison. 

In 1999 he surprised his colleagues by resigning as party leader and as a minister, and by announcing that he would retire at the election due in 2001. His decision to quit politics was motivated partly by the demands of his family, in particular that his son Harrison has [[autism]] (Fischer himself has "high functioning" autism).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s72724.htm |title=Tim Fischer tells of life with autism  |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=29 November 2010 }}</ref> After his retirement, he returned to farming at Boree Creek, and became involved in charity work, assisting organisations such as the [[St Vincent de Paul Society]], the [[Fred Hollows]] Foundation and Autism New South Wales.

Fisher served as chairman of [[Tourism Australia]] from 2004 until 2007. He was made a Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]] (ATSE) in 2001. He served as Chairman of the ATSE Crawford Fund supporting international agricultural research from 2001 to 2006.

In 2005 Fischer received Australia's highest civilian honour, when he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC).

Fischer is noted as a tireless advocate for [[rail transport]] and is probably Australia's best known [[railfan]]. He had a childhood hobby of studying rail gauges of the world. Since retiring from politics he has continued his association with rail as Special Envoy to the [[Adelaide]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] railway line and travelled on the first freight train and first ''[[The Ghan|Ghan]]'' passenger train to Darwin in 2004.  In 2007 he led the Rail Freight Network Review into [[Rail transport in Victoria|rail freight in Victoria]], as commissioned by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/54E33823FAE1EF29CA2573B7001B1E96/$FILE/RFNR-FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Victorian Rail Freight Network Review |publisher=Victorian Department of Transport |date=December 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2010 }}</ref>

On 21 July 2008 Tim Fischer was nominated by Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] as the first resident Australian [[Ambassador]] to the [[Holy See]] since 1973, when diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Australia were first established.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24049946-5017593,00.html |title=Tim Fischer announced ambassador to the Holy See |work=The Australian
