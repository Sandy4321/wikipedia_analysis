'''''Frost''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[progressive metal|progressive]] [[black metal]] band [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]]. It was released in 1994, through [[Osmose Productions]]. This album in particular is where the band started to incorporate [[Viking metal]] influences into their sound; indeed, the name "Viking metal" appears on the back page of the insert booklet, though the album's material was still speed-laden, black metal.

This would be the last album to feature drummer [[Trym Torson]] before he joined [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]].
