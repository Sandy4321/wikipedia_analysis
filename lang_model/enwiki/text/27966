The ethnic affiliation of the Scordisci has been debated by historians. Some refer to them as [[Celt]]ic,<ref>http://www.caorc.org/programs/mellonpubs/Theodossiev.pdf</ref><ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, Page 140, "...

Andras Mocsy clarifies their ethnic character, suggesting that they were not a Celtic tribe ''per se'', but a "Celtic political creation".<ref>"Pannonia and Upper Moesia. A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire. A. Mocsy. London and Boston, Routledge and Kegan Paul. ISBN 0-7100-7714-9.

Rather quickly, they were subsumed by the numerically superior natives, although the Celtic tribal name was retained, albeit the Illyricized version{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} ''Scordistae''<ref>Strab. 7.3, "And mingled with them are also the Celtic tribes<U+2014>the Boii, the Sorbisci, and the Taurisci.

Extensive [[La Tene culture|La T<U+00E8>ne]] type finds, of local production, are noted in Pannonia as well as northern [[Moesia Superior]], attesting to the concentration of Celtic settlements and cultural contacts. However, such finds south of the Sava river are scarce.<ref>Mocsy. Pg 26 "Recent excavations have produced La T<U+00E8>ne finds in the northern part of Moesia Superior, in the territory of the Scordisci, in the southern part of this province, where the Scordisci were only temporarily in control, the influence of La T<U+00E8>ne culture is not attested."</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Prehistoric Serbia}}
Despite the repulsion from Greece, Celtic power in the Balkans was certainly not at an end. After their formation c. 278 BC, little is heard of the Scordisci for some time. During [[Macedon]]'s zenith, the attention of the Scordisci was focussed on Pannonia, consolidating their control of the region. They controlled the various Pannonian tribes in the region, extracting tribute and enjoying the status of the most powerful tribe in the central Balkans, and they erected fortresses in [[Singidunum]]<ref>Celts and the Classical World by David Rankin, ISBN 0-415-15090-6, 1996, page 188: "...of the survivors of Brenus expedition the Scordisci founded Singidunum in Yugoslavia..."</ref> and [[Taurunum]] (today's city of [[Belgrade]]). The Roman's first siege of [[Sisak|Segestica]], having been under the control of their Pannonian clients, curtailed Celtic control in Dalmatia and south-western Pannonia. This combined with the turmoil following Alexander the Great's death, prompted the Scordisci to turn their attention southward. They subjegated a number of tribes in Moesia, including the [[Dardani]], several west [[Thracian tribes]] and the [[Paeonians]].

[[File:Celts in Illyria & Pannonia.png|thumb|right|350px|Celtic tribes in the Balkans, c. 50 BC]]
In parts of [[Moesia]] (''northeast Central Serbia'') the Celtic Scordisci and [[Thracians]] lived besides each other, which is evident in the archeological findings of pits and treasures, spanning from 3rd century BC to 1st century BC.<ref>http://eprints.jiia.it:8080/148/1/Luca_dacian-warriors.pdf</ref>

From 141 BC, the Scordisci were constantly involved in battles against Roman held Macedonia. In 135 BC they were defeated<ref>The praetorship in the Roman Republic by [[T. Corey Brennan]], 2000, page 229, "For his part, Cosconius campaigned successfully against the Scordisci..."</ref><ref>The central Balkan tribes in pre-Roman times: Triballi, Autariatae, Dardanians, Scordisci and Moesians by Fanula Papazoglu, ISBN 90-256-0793-4, 1978, page 286, "As to where the battle between the Scordisci and Cosconius' troops took place,nothing definite can be said.

A. Crook, [[Andrew Lintott]], and Elizabeth Rawson, 1994, ISBN 0-521-25603-8, Back matter, "M.Minucius Rufius over the Scordisci and the Thracians..."</ref> in 107 BC. Yet, they did not give up claim over Pannonia, since they are mentioned as having battled in the second siege of Sisak in 119 BC. 

They still, from time to time, gave trouble to the Roman governors of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], whose territory they invaded in combination with the [[Maedi]] and [[Dardani]]. They even advanced as far as [[Delphi]] and plundered the temple; but [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus]] finally overcame them in 88 BC and drove them across the Danube. After this, the power of the Scordisci declined rapidly. This decline was more a result of the political situation in barbaricum rather than the effects of Roman campaigns, as their client tribes, especially the Pannonians, became more powerful and politically independent. Between 56 and 50 BC, the Scordisci were defeated by [[Burebista]]'s Dacians, and became subject to him.<ref>Dacia: Land of Transylvania, Cornerstone of Ancient Eastern Europe by Ion Grumeza, ISBN 0-7618-4465-1, 2009, page 51: "... Many Scordisci and Breuci settled in Dacia nevertheless and were eventually absorbed into the local population."</ref> 

They were crushed in 15 BC by [[Tiberius]],<ref>Paterculus: The Tiberian Narrative (Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries) by Velleius Paterculus and A. J. Woodman, ISBN 0-521-60935-6, 2004, page 106, "...that in 12 B.C. Tiberius used the Scordisci tribe as allies, though in 16 they had been enemies pf Rome(54.20.3) .V. has already told us(39-3) that it was he who reconciled these natives to Rome presumably around 15 after his Alpine campaigns..."</ref> and became Roman subjects, playing the part as mercenaries.<ref>Tiberius (Blackwell Ancient Lives) by Robin Seager, ISBN 1-4051-1529-7, 2005, page 21, "Tiberius subdued Pannonia, making good use of a friendly tribe, the Scordisci."</ref> 
Other sources say the Romans made alliance with the Scordisci in Sirmium and Danube valleys following the Alpine campaign under Tiberius in 15 BC, the alliance would be crucial for the victory over the Pannonians (15BC) and later Breuci (12BC).They started receiving Roman citizenship during Trajan's rule.<ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, Page 256, "... reign of Trajan (AD 98-117), does the Roman citizenship begin to appear among the Illyrian communities of southeast Pannonia, the Andizetes, Scordisci and Breuci."</ref> With their Romanization, they ceased to exist as an independent ethno-political unit.<ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, page 145: "Autariatae had vanished long before the Roman conquest, and the Triballi, Scordisci and Moesi all declined to insignificant remnants, the Dardani endured."</ref>
