==Career==
After Brugh signed a seven-year contract with MGM for $35 a week, his name was changed to '''Robert Taylor'''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wayne |first=Jane Ellen |title= The Leading Men of MGM|isbn= 0-7867-1475-1 |pages=167}}</ref> He made his film debut in the 1934 comedy, ''Handy Andy'', opposite [[Will Rogers]] (on a loan-out to [[20th Century Fox]]).

This was followed by ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'', opposite [[Greta Garbo]].<ref name=popculture /> 

[[File:Taylor & Harlow.jpg|thumb|left|Taylor and [[Jean Harlow]], 1937]]Throughout the late 1930s, Taylor appeared in films of varying genres including the [[Musical film|musicals]] ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]'' and ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', and the British comedy ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' with [[Vivien Leigh]]. In 1940, he reteamed with his ''A Yank at Oxford'' co-star Vivien Leigh in [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s drama ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1940 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]''. 

In 1941, Taylor began breaking away from his perfect leading man image and began appearing in darker roles. That year he portrayed [[Billy the Kid|Billy Bonney]] (better known as Billy the Kid) in ''[[Billy the Kid (1941 film)|Billy the Kid]]''. The next year, he played the title role in the [[film noir]] ''[[Johnny Eager]]'' opposite [[Lana Turner]].

By the mid-1950s, Taylor's career began to wane. He starred in a comedy western in 1955 co-starring [[Eleanor Parker]] called ''Many Rivers To Cross''. In 1958, he formed his own production company, Robert Taylor Productions, and the following year, he starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit television series  ''[[The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor]]'' (1959-1962).<ref name=filmref /> Following the end of the series in 1962, Taylor continued to appear in films and television including ''[[A House Is Not a Home (film)|A House Is Not a Home]]'' and two episodes of ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]''. In 1965, after filming ''Johnny Tiger'' in Florida, Taylor took over the role of narrator in the television series ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', when [[Ronald Reagan]] left to pursue a career in politics.<ref name=movieguide>{{cite web |title= Robert Taylor Biography |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:113772~T1 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |author=Erikson, Hal}}</ref> Taylor would remain with the series until 1969 when he became too ill to continue working.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Taylor starred in the film ''[[Above and Beyond (film)|Above and Beyond]]'', a [[Biographical film|biopic]] of [[Enola Gay]] pilot [[Paul Tibbets]].

Taylor learned to fly in the mid-1930s, and served as a [[United States Navy]] flying instructor during [[World War II]]. His private aircraft was a [[Beechcraft Model 18|Twin Beech]] called "Missy" (wife Stanwyck's nickname) which he used on [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] trips. She complained that he spent all his time polishing his [[gun]]s and aircraft, but when airborne could ''"do anything a bird could do, except sit on a [[barbed wire]] fence"''.<ref>Tibbets, Paul W. ''Mission: Hiroshima'', Stein & Day, 1985 ISBN 0-8128-8169-9</ref>
