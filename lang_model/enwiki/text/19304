'''[[Major-General]] Jos<U+00E9> Maria Vasconcelos,''' famously known as '''Taur Matan Ruak''' ([[Tetum]] for "Two Sharp Eyes") is the Commander of the FALINTIL-For<U+00E7>as de Defesa de Timor-Leste (F-FDTL), the [[Military of East Timor]]. He was the last commander of the Armed Forces of National Liberation of East Timor or [[FALINTIL]] (For<U+00E7>as Armadas para a Libera<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Nacional do Timor Leste), the insurgent army which resisted [[Indonesia]]n the occupation from 1975 to 1999.

On December 7, 1975 Indonesia invaded East Timor, and he took to the hills with the recently formed FRETILIN Army, [[Falintil|FALINTIL]]. As a combatant Taur Matan Ruak participated in battles against the Indonesian military in Dili, Aileu, Maubisse, Ossu, Venilale, Uatulari and finally in Laga on the northeastern coast, where he eventually stayed.

Major-General Ruak<U+2019>s first official appointment was at the end of 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he rose through the FALINTIL ranks in the two eastern military sectors, the Central East Sector and the Eastern Point, or the Ponta Leste Sector.  Then he became a company commander.

Taur Matan Ruak and others regrouped the following day at the base of [[Legumau|Monte Legumau]] (''Monte Apara'') and recommenced guerrilla operations after the collapse of the last Timorese resistance base at Matebian Mountain on November 22, 1978. 

Taur Matan Ruak was ordered to carry out guerrilla activities in the east after the death of Commander Nicolau Lobato in December 1978.  During a mission to locate survivors of the annihilation campaign, Taur Matan Ruak was captured in the Viqueque area by Indonesian army forces on March 31, 1979.  After 23 days he managed to escape and rejoin other FALINTIL forces in the mountains.

In March 1981 he was appointed Assistant Chief-of-Staff of FALINTIL, responsible for the operational command of the Eastern Sectors and later the Central Sector.  Taur Matan Ruak was promoted and made responsible for strategic planning of commando operations in the Eastern sector in March 1983.  Between 1984 and 1986 Brigadier Ruak was transferred and served as military adviser for commando operations in the Western Sector.  After nearly 10 years of operational experience he was promoted to Deputy Chief-of-Staff.  After 1986, he was responsible for all commando operations throughout Timor Leste. 

In November 1992, Commander-in-Chief [[Xanana Gusm<U+00E3>o]] was captured in [[Dili]]. Taur Matan Ruak was promoted to Chief-of-Staff.  Mr. Ruak became the Commander of FALINTIL after the death of Commander Konis Santana on March 11, 1998.  On August 20, 2000 Ray Kala Xanana Gusm<U+00E3>o resigned from FALINTIL and Taur Matan Ruak was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of FALINTIL.

With the Restoration of Independence on 20 May 2002 he became the Chefe Estado Maior General For<U+00E7>as Armadas (CEMGFA or Chief of the Armed Forces) and was promoted to Major General in 2009.

General Ruak is married to Mrs. Isabel da Costa Ferreira.
