'''''The Three Caballeros''''' is the seventh [[animated feature]] in the [[Disney animated features canon]]. It was released in [[1944]], made and produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and distributed by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. A sequel to [[1942]]'s ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'', the film is an adventure through parts of [[Latin America]], combining live-action and [[traditional animation|animation]].

Produced as part of the studio's goodwill message for South America, but less obviously propagandistic, the film again starred [[Donald Duck]], who in the course of the film is joined by his old friend [[Jose Carioca]], the cigar-smoking parrot from [[Saludos Amigos]] representing Brazil, and later makes a new friend in the persona of pistol-packin' rooster [[Panchito Pistoles]], representing Mexico.

Several Latin American stars of the period appear, including singers [[Aurora Miranda]] (sister of [[Carmen Miranda]]) and [[Dora Luz]], as well as dancer [[Carmen Molina]].

The film is plotted as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of [[Donald Duck]] opening gifts from his [[Latin America]]n friends.

The film premiered in [[Mexico City]] on [[December 21]], [[1944]].  It was released in the [[United States|USA]] on [[February 3]], [[1945]].

==Film segments==
The film's segments include:

* ''The Cold-Blooded Penguin'' involved a [[penguin]] named Pablo, who is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the [[South Pole]] that he decides to leave for warmer climates.

* ''The Flying Gauchito'' involved the adventures of a little boy from [[Uruguay]] and his winged donkey.

* ''Bahia'' involved a pop-up book trip through the [[Bahia|titular locale of Brazil]] as Donald Duck and Jos<U+00E9> Carioca meet up with some of the locals who dance an interesting samba and Donald starts pining for the females in the group.

* ''Las Posadas'' was the story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated Christmas by re-enacting the journey of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] searching for room at the inn.  "Posada" means "inn", and they are told "no posada" at each house until they come to one where they are offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the pi<U+00F1>ata, which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break the pi<U+00F1>ata as well.
