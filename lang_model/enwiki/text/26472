'''Cecilia Gallerani''' (1473 &ndash; 1536) was one of the mistresses of [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]].  She was the subject of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (c. 1489).  While posing for the painting she invited Leonardo, who at the time was working as court artist for Sforza, to meetings at which [[Milan]]ese intellectuals discussed [[philosophy]] and other subjects.  Cecilia herself presided over these discussions.
==Biography==
Cecilia was born into a large family from [[Siena]]. Her father, Fazio, was not of the nobility, but he occupied several posts at the Milanese court, including the position of ambassador to [[Florence]] and Lucca. Her mother was Margherita Busti the daughter of a noted doctor of Law. She was educated alongside her  six brothers in Latin and literature. In 1483 at the age of ten, Cecilia was bethrothed to Stefano Visconti but it was broken off in 1487 for reasons unknown. In May 1489, she left home for the Monastero Nuovo, and it was possibly there that she met Ludovico. 

Cecilia spoke [[Latin]] fluently and was said to be a gifted musician and singer. She also wrote poetry. Even after Ludovico married [[Beatrice d'Este]], Cecilia continued to keep her apartments in Ludovico's castle.  Cecilia had a son, Cesare, on [[3 May]] [[1491]] by Ludovico il Moro.

When Beatrice d'Este found out about her, Ludovico had to ask her to leave the Porta Giovia castle, the seat of the Ducal court. She was given the Carmagnola Palace in 1492, when she married Ludovico di Brambilla, Count Bergamino. She bore her husband four children. After the death of both her husband and her son (1514-1515), she retired to San Giovanni in Croce, a castle near [[Cremona]]. [[Bandello]] describes her as a patron of the arts. According to others, hers was the first salon in Europe.
