'''Leslie Allen''' (born 12 March 1957 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]) is a retired American professional tennis player.  

Allen was a member of the [[University of Southern California]] national championship team and graduated [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in speech communications.  She joined the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA Tour]] in 1977 and went on to reach a career high ranking on #17 in the world.
