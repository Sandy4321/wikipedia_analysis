'''Ramsden''' is a lunar [[impact crater]] located on the western stretch of the [[Palus Epidemiarum]]. To the east-southeast is the crater [[Capuanus (crater)|Capuanus]], and to the north lies [[Dunthorne (crater)|Dunthorne]].

The floor of the crater has been flooded with [[lava]], and contains several small impact craters. The rim is somewhat oval and irregular in outline, with depressions at the north and south walls. It has a slight [[wikt:rampart|rampart]], but lacks [[wiktionary:terrace|terrace]]s, a central peak, or a [[ray system]].

The crater lies directly across a [[rille|rille system]] named the Rimae Ramsden. These span an area 130 kilometers across, sprawling over the western Palus Epidemiarum. A branch reaches northwest to the [[Mare Nubium]], passing between the craters [[Campanus (crater)|Campanus]] and [[Mercator (crater)|Mercator]].

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Ramsden.
