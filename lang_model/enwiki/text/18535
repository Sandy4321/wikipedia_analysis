{{Cycling in Melbourne}}
'''Bicycle Victoria''' is a self-funded community organisation focussed on [[cycling]], with offices located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Established in [[1975]], it is financially self-supporting and independent of the government. By July 2004 it had grown to 40,000 members. Its principal guiding mission is ''More People Cycling More Often''.

In 2004 the organisation employed around 20 permanent staff and a number of staff on contract for events and special projects, as well as using the services of many volunteers to run cycling events.

Cycling campaigns to improve cycling infrastructure in Victoria are run by Bicycle Victoria by lobbying and negotiating with the [[Government of Victoria]], [[Local Government Areas of Victoria|Local Government]], Vicroads and other organisations and agencies. Local affiliated groups (known as Bicycle User Groups, or BUGs) campaign in local areas for local improvements, organise rides, local bike education and maintenance workshops and provide a grassroots basis for wider bicycle campaigns. 

Infrastructure for [[Cycling in Melbourne]] has been greatly improved by the campaigns of Bicycle Victoria, including the development of many on road bike lanes and shared use [[Cycling_in_Melbourne#Melbourne_Cycle_Trails|Melbourne cycle trails]].

From 1979 the organisation was a member of the peak Australian body representing non-competitive cyclists, the [[Bicycle Federation of Australia]], but discontinued its affiliation during 1998.

=== Great Victorian bike ride ===
Bicycle Victoria campaigns are sustained through an extensive calendar of fully supported bicycle rides and events, which also encourage greater cycling. The ''[[Great Victorian Bike Ride]]'' was first organised in [[1984]] by the Bicycle Institute of Victoria (now Bicycle Victoria) with 2,100 riders. It has become a regular event with several thousand people participating on the 20th anniversary ride in 2004. To celebrate the anniversary a free new bike was given to each ride registrant.

Bicycle Victoria staff and volunteers have developed the facilities and the logistics plans for catering for the needs of several thousand cyclists and volunteers on the move each day. As well as toilets, showers, cooking and washing up facilities, and moving thousands of tents and luggage, an FM radio station broadcasts and a daily news sheet is produced. Hazard and direction signs, water stops and marshals are organised for the route each day.

=== Other events ===
Several other events are also organised during the year including:

* '''[[Around the Bay in a Day]]''': in October 2005, nearly 11,000 riders took part in this ride 
* '''Ride to Work Day''': thousands of first-time riders and regular commuters take part across the state  
* '''Orange Great Melbourne Bike Ride''': in March 2004, 14,000 people participated

Bicycle Victoria say that they have no involvement, nor do they endorse, the regular [[Critical Mass|Critical Mass]] bike ride that occurs on the last Friday of the month in Melbourne.
