The '''Ludendorff Bridge''' was a railroad bridge across the [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]], connecting the cities of [[Remagen]] and [[Erpel]].

The bridge is famous for its capture by [[Allied forces]] in the [[Second World War]].  The bridge was an important strategic point during WWII because it was the only remaining bridge which led over the [[Rhine River]] into Germany and [[Berlin]].

==History==

The bridge had been built in [[1916]] during the [[First World War]] to facilitate transport to the [[Western Front]]. Designed by [[Karl Wiener]], it was 325 meters long, with two rail lines and a walkway.  It was named for the German WWI general [[Erich Ludendorff]], one of the bridge's proponents. This was one of the four bridges guarded during the [[Third United States Army]] occupation at the end of [[World War I]].

==Captured==

During [[Operation Lumberjack]], on [[March 7]], [[1945]], troops of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] reached one of the two intact bridges over the Rhine (a railway bridge in [[Wesel]]  (today [[NRW]]) was the other one), after German defenders failed to demolish it, despite several attempts.  Sgt. Alexander A. Drabik of [[Holland, Ohio]] was the first American soldier to cross the bridge, thereby becoming the first American soldier to cross the Rhine River into Germany; Lt. Karl Timmermann was the first officer over the bridge.  By the Allies, this was hailed as the "Miracle of Remagen."  General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] called the bridge "worth its weight in gold."  It remained intact, but severely weakened, despite several further German efforts to destroy it, such as the first tactical use of a [[V-2]].  8,000 men crossed it in the first 24 hours alone.

A large sign was put up on one of the stone towers reading "CROSS THE RHINE WITH DRY FEET COURTESY OF 9TH ARMD DIVISION." The sign is now on display at the [[Patton Museum]] of Cavalry and Armor at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], above an [[M26 Pershing]] tank, a type used in the battle.

[[Hitler]]'s reaction was to [[court-martial]] five officers, four of whom, Major Hans Scheller, Lieutenant Karl Heinz Peters, Major Herbert Strobel and Major August Kraft, were quickly executed. The fifth one, Captain Willi Bratge, was convicted and sentenced ''[[in absentia]]'', having become an [[United States|American]] [[prisoner of war]] by this time.

Ten days after its capture, the bridge collapsed, killing 28 [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. army engineers]], and wounding 93 others working to strengthen the bridge.  However, by then the Americans had established their position on the far side of the [[Rhine]] and had additional [[pontoon bridge]]s in place.

A Hollywood film, ''[[The Bridge at Remagen]]'' was made in 1969. The surviving towers of the old bridge now house a [http://www.bruecke-remagen.de/index_en.htm museum].
