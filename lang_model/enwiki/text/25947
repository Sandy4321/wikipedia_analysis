'''Honiara''', population 49,107 (1999 census), 78,190 (2009 estimate), is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Solomon Islands]] and of [[Guadalcanal Province]], although it is a separately administered town. The name Honiara derives from ''nagho ni ara'' which roughly translates as "facing the southeast wind" in one of the Guadalcanal languages.

==Geography==
[[Image:Solomon Islands-CIA WFB Map.png|left|thumb|Location of Honiara]]

Honiara is located on the northern coast of the island of [[Guadalcanal]] and includes a sea port at Point Cruz. The town revolves around the Kukum Highway, which connects the [[Honiara International Airport]] (former known as Henderson Field) in the east of Honiara with the settlement of [[White River, Honiara|White River]] in the west, and passes the National Referral Hospital and the Chinatown (burnt down in 2006 election riot). 

== Climate ==
The climate is tropical, the average daytime temperature is about 28 degrees Celsius, the water temperatures between 26 and 29 degrees. Damper periods are predominantly between November and April. The average amount of precipitation per year is about 2,000&nbsp;mm and thus somewhat lower than the average on the entire Solomon Islands (3,000&nbsp;mm).

==Economy ==
[[File:Yot club small.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Honiara Yacht Club]]
Honiara is served by the [[Honiara International Airport]], located about 10 kilometers to the east of the city. The industry is in form of several beverage factories and a cookie factory. Major exports are [[timber]], [[coconut]]s, [[copra]] and [[fish]]. The most important trade partners are [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]].

===Tourism===
[[File:HoniaraHotel.jpg|thumb|left|Honiara hotel]]
Honiara is the Solomon Islands' springboard for tourism activities. The country's tourist office, the Solomon Islands Visitors Bureau,<ref>[http://www.visitsolomons.com.sb VisitSolomons.cm.sb]</ref> is located on Honiara's main thoroughfare, Mendana Avenue. Situated between the shady Yacht Club and the popular Solomon Kitano Mendana Hotel, its officers provide tourist information and can radio ahead to announce visitors' arrivals to guest houses in the remoter areas. Honiara has a harbour from which ferries depart to the various provinces. The gardens of the National Art Gallery are popular for afternoon strolls, while the reconstructed Government House and the National [[Museum]] exist. A botanical garden admits lots of orchids and shrubs. The spectacular Tenaru falls can be found a one hour's drive and a three-hour hike from Henderson International Airport.

==Religion==
Honiara is predominantly Christian and is served by the headquarters of the [[Church of the Province of Melanesia]] ([[Anglican]]), the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Archdiocese of Honiara]], the [[South Seas Evangelical Church]], the [[United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands|United Church]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and other Christian churches. There are many congregations of American and Australian style [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] movements. There are also members of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jehovah's Witness]], [[Mormon]] and [[Muslim]] such as the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].<ref>[http://ahmadiyya.org.au/index.asp?docname=sol/maini.htm Ahmadiyya Solomon Islands]</ref>

==History==
What is now Honiara was close to the site of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in [[World War II]]. It was built to replace the former capital of [[Tulagi]] at the end of that war. Honiara officially became the capital of the Solomon Islands in 1952. After violent rebellions in the year 2000, the protection of the population was promised by Australian units, since the Solomon Islands have no military. In 2006, [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands#Riots following 2006 general election|riots]] broke out following the election of [[Snyder Rini]] as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1000 Chinese residents.<ref>Spiller, Penny: "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4930994.stm Riots highlight Chinese tensions]", [[News.bbc.co.uk]], Friday, 21 April 2006, 18:57 GMT</ref> Three [[National Parliament of the Solomon Islands|National Parliament]] members, [[Charles Dausabea]], [[Nelson Ne'e]], and [[Patrick Vahoe]],<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/third-solomons-mp-arrested-over-riot/2006/04/24/1145730850134.html?page=2 "Third Solomons MP arrested over riot"], [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], April 24, 2006</ref> were arrested during or as a result of the riots.

==Politics==
Honiara is divided into three [[Constituencies in Solomon Islands|parliamentary constituencies]], electing three of the fifty Members of the [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands|National Parliament]]. These constituencies (East Honiara, Central Honiara and West Honiara) are three of only six constituencies in the country to have an electorate of over 10,000. East Honiara, with an electorate of 30,049 in 2006, is the only constituency in the country to consist in more than 20,000 voters. Following the [[Solomon Islands general election, 2006|2006 general election]], the city's representatives are<ref>[http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/149 "Constituencies and their Members of Parliament"], National Parliament of Solomon Islands</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.gov.sb/files/elections/nationalstatistics2006.pdf 2006 election results], National Parliament of Solomon Islands:</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/147 "Listing of Members of Parliament by Political Parties"], National Parliament of Solomon Islands</ref>
