'''''Trachycarpus fortunei''''' ('''Chusan palm''', '''windmill palm''' or '''Chinese windmill palm''') is a [[Arecaceae|palm]] [[native plant|native]] to central China (Hubei southwards), south to northern Burma and northern India, growing at altitudes of {{convert|100|-|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=foc>Flora of China: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200027121 ''Trachycarpus fortunei'']</ref><ref name=kew>WCSP, World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: [http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/synonomy.do?name_id=207159 ''Trachycarpus fortunei'']</ref><ref name=usda/> It is a [[fan palm]], placed in the [[family (biology)|family]] Arecaceae, subfamily [[Coryphoideae]], tribe [[Trachycarpeae]].<ref name=usda/>

==Description==
[[File:Arecaceae-zhejiang2005-1.JPG|thumb|left|Fruit, Zhejiang]]
''Trachycarpus fortunei'' grows to {{convert|12|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall on a single stem up to 15<U+2013>30&nbsp;cm diameter. The trunk is very rough with the persistent leaf bases clasping the stem as layers of coarse fibrous material. It is a [[fan palm]] with the [[leaf|leaves]] with the long petiole bare except for two rows of small spines, terminating in a rounded fan of numerous leaflets; each leaf is 140<U+2013>190&nbsp;cm long, with the petiole 60<U+2013>100&nbsp;cm long, and the leaflets up to 90&nbsp;cm long. It is a somewhat variable plant, especially as regards its general appearance and some specimens are to be seen with leaf segments having straight and others having drooping tips.<ref name=foc/><ref name=rhs>Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening'' 3: 443<U+2013>448, 4: 491. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.</ref>

The [[flower]]s are yellow (male) and greenish (female), about 2<U+2013>4&nbsp;mm across, borne in large branched panicles up to 1 m long in spring; it is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female flowers produced on separate trees. The [[fruit]] is a yellow to blue-black, reniform (kidney-shaped) [[drupe]] 10<U+2013>12&nbsp;mm long, ripening in mid autumn.<ref name=foc/><ref name=rhs/>

Occasionally a male plant of ''T.&nbsp;fortunei'', besides the usual spadices, produces a few other spadices carrying really hermaphroditic flowers. Completely fertile, these are almost exactly like the male flowers, but are a little larger and with the carpels well evolute, the latter about as long as the filaments, furnished with a ring of silvery hairs all round.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Distribution==
[[File:Vancouver palms englishbay.jpg|thumb|Windmill Palms at English Bay ([[Vancouver, British Columbia]])]]
Although not the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world (''[[Chamaerops|Chamaerops humilis]]'' grows further north in the Mediterranean, and ''[[Needle Palm|Rhapidophyllum]]'' and some ''[[Sabal]]'' species further north on the Atlantic coast of North America), it is one of the [[hardy palms|hardiest]], as it grows at much higher altitudes, up to {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the mountains of southern China. This brings it into a [[climate]] not only with cold winters, but also cool, moist summers; while ''Rhapidophyllum'' may possibly tolerate slightly lower temperatures in winter, it needs much greater summer heat to grow successfully.<ref name=rhs/>

==Uses==
''Trachycarpus fortunei'' has been cultivated in China and Japan for thousands of years, for its coarse but very strong leaf sheath fibre, used for making rope, sacks, and other coarse cloth where great strength is important. The extent of this cultivation means that the exact natural range of the species is uncertain.<ref name=foc/><ref name=rhs/>

===Cultivation===
''Trachycarpus fortunei'' is cultivated as a trunking palm in gardens and parks throughout the world in warm temperate and subtropical climates. Its tolerance of cool summers and cold winters makes it highly valued by palm enthusiasts, landscape designers and gardeners. It can be grown successfully in such cool and damp but relatively winter-mild locales as Scotland and British Columbia Canada, as well as in warm temperate climates in parts of the United States, Europe, New Zealand, and Asia. It does not grow well in very hot climates.

The greatest reported cold tolerance is {{convert|-27.5|C|F|abbr=on}} by four specimens in [[Plovdiv]], Bulgaria during a severe cold spell on 6 January 1993, and placing it in [[hardiness zone|USDA Zone 5]];<ref>Polar Palms: [http://www.polarpalm.net/en/plov.html The Polar Palms of Bulgaria]</ref> more commonly lower tolerance limits of &minus;15 <U+00B0>C to &minus;20 <U+00B0>C (5 <U+00B0>F to &minus;4 <U+00B0>F) are cited for mature plants.<ref name=bean4>Bean, W. J. (1980). ''Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles'' 8th ed., vol. 4. John Murray ISBN 0-7195-2428-8.</ref> Young plants are less hardy, and can be damaged by only &minus;8 <U+00B0>C (17.6 <U+00B0>F).<ref name=pfaf>Plants for a Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Trachycarpus+fortunei ''Trachycarpus fortunei'']</ref>

This plant has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Trachycarpus fortunei''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1941|accessdate=06 June 2013}}</ref>

The [[cultivar group]] ''Trachycarpus fortunei'' 'Wagnerianus' is a small-leafed semi-dwarf variant of the species selected in cultivation in China and Japan. It differs in rarely growing to more than {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, with leaflets less than 45&nbsp;cm long; the short stature and small leaves give it greater tolerance of wind exposure.<ref name=rhs/> It has often been treated as a separate species ''T. wagnerianus'' in popular works, but is now included within ''T. fortunei''.<ref name=foc/><ref name=kew/><ref name=usda/>

==Nomenclature==
The species was brought from Japan ([[Dejima]]) to Europe by the German physician [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] in 1830. The common name refers to Chusan Island (now [[Zhoushan Island]]), where [[Robert Fortune]] first saw cultivated specimens of the species that was later named after him. It was first described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1850 in his ''Historia Naturalis Palmarum'' but under the illegitimate name of "Chamaerops excelsa".

The names ''Chamaerops excelsus'' and ''Trachycarpus excelsus'' have occasionally been misapplied to ''Trachycarpus fortunei''; this is correctly a synonym of ''[[Rhapis excelsa]]'', with the confusion arising due to a misunderstanding of Japanese vernacular names.<ref name=bean4/>
