The '''Battle of Iconium''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039C><U+03AC><U+03C7><U+03B7> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+0399><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03C5>, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Konya Sava<U+015F><U+0131>) was an unsuccessful attempt by the Seljuk Turks to capture the city of Iconium, modern day Konya. After sacking Ani and Caesarea in 1063 and 1067 respectively speaking (some sources suggest as early as 1064), the Byzantine army in the East was in too poor a shape to resist the advance of the Turks. Had it not been for the efforts of the co-emperor Romanus Diogenes the Byzantine Empire would have suffered her "[[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]" disaster sooner. From Syria, a successful counter-attack drove the Turks back. Further campaigning was met with some success by Romanus, despite the ill nature of his army which had been poorly led since the death of Basil II. 

The victory was a short respite - sometime after Manzikert, in the midst of the petty and rather thoughtless civil conflict, Iconium fell to the Turks. The city saw a brief return to Christendom during the [[First Crusade]], possibly under Byzantine rule but the Turks counter-attacked at the [[Crusade of 1101]] and Konya would form the capital of Byzantium's most dangerous opponent.
