'''Route 57''' is a [[state highway]] located in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It runs {{convert|21.10|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an interchange with [[U.S. Route 22 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 22]] in [[Lopatcong Township, New Jersey|Lopatcong Township]] to an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 182|Route 182]] and [[County Route 517 (New Jersey)|County Route 517]] in [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]]. The route passes through mostly rural areas of farmland and mountains in Warren County. It also passes through [[Washington, New Jersey|Washington]], where Route 57 crosses [[New Jersey Route 31|Route 31]]. The route is designated a scenic byway, the '''Route 57 Byway''', by the state of New Jersey due to the physical environments it passes through as well as from historical sites along the way such as the [[Morris Canal]].

The current alignment of Route 57 was designated as a part of [[Pre-1927 Route 12 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 12]] in 1917. In 1927, [[New Jersey Route 24|Route 24]] was designated along this route between the [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]] area and Penwell in [[Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey|Mansfield Township]] while a spur of Route 24 called [[New Jersey Route S24|Route S24]] replaced pre-1927 Route 12 between Penwell and [[U.S. Route 46]] in Hackettstown. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, the portion of Route S24 between Penwell and County Route 517 in Hackettstown became a part of Route 24 to complete a gap in that route while Route S24 north of there became Route 57. A never-built segment of Route 57 running from the intersection of Route 24 and Route 57 to U.S. Route 46 east of Hackettstown was legislated in 1965. Around 1970, Route 57 was designated along Route 24 west of Hackettstown while the portion of Route 57 in Hackettstown became Route 182.
