The '''Ivy League''' is an [[athletic conference]] comprising eight private institutions of [[university|higher education]] in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/ivy_league.html |title=Princeton Campus Guide - Ivy League|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> The eight institutions are [[Brown University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University]]. The term ''Ivy League'' also has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social [[elitism]].

The term became official, especially in sports terminology, after the formation of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] {{nowrap|[[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]}} athletic conference in 1954,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivysport.com/history.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060324134404/http://www.ivysport.com/history.php|archivedate=2006-03-24|title=IvySport - History|accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref> when much of the nation polarized around favorite college teams.{{Clarify|date=May 2010|What event[s] does this refer to? Most readers are unaware of any such polarization suddenly happening in 1954, or why. Link to something specific about that, or remove the claim.}} The use of the phrase is no longer limited to athletics, and now represents an educational philosophy inherent to the nation's oldest schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/ivy_league.shtml|title=What is the origin of the term, Ivy League?|accessdate=2006-05-17}}</ref> In addition, Ivy League schools are often viewed by the public as some of the most prestigious universities worldwide and are often ranked amongst the best universities in the United States and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/worlds-best-colleges/2009/06/18/worlds-best-colleges-top-400.html|title=World's Best Colleges|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>

All of the Ivy League's institutions place within the top 15 of the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' [[college and university rankings]]. (All but Brown and Cornell place within the top 10.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings |title=National Universities Rankings - Best College |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> Seven of the eight schools were founded during the [[Thirteen Colonies|United States colonial period]]; the exception is [[Cornell University|Cornell]], which was founded in 1865. Ivy League institutions, therefore, account for seven of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] chartered before the [[American Revolution]]. The Ivies are all in the Northeast geographic region of the United States. All eight schools receive millions of dollars in research grants and other subsidies from federal and state government.

Undergraduate enrollments among the Ivy League schools range from about 4,000 to 14,000,<ref>[[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] respectively</ref> making them larger than those of a typical private [[liberal arts college]] and smaller than a typical public [[state university system|state university]]. Ivy League university [[financial endowment]]s range from Brown's $2.01 billion to Harvard's $25.6 billion, the [[Lists of institutions of higher education by endowment|largest financial endowment]] of any academic institution in the world.

|[[Nonsectarian]],<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: "The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen."[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html]. Jencks and Riesman (2001) write "The Anglicans who founded the University of Pennsylvania, however, were evidently anxious not to alienate Philadelphia's Quakers, and they made their new college officially nonsectarian." Franklin himself was a self-described "thorough [[Deist]]." In Franklin's 1749 founding [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/1749proposals.html Proposals relating to the education of youth in Pensilvania] [http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=franklin_youth&PagePosition=20 (page images)], religion is not mentioned directly as a subject of study, but he states in a footnote that the study of "''History'' will also afford frequent Opportunities of showing the Necessity of a ''Publick Religion,'' from its Usefulness to the Publicks; the Advantage of a Religious Character among private Persons; the Mischiefs of Superstition, &c. and the Excellency of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION above all others antient or modern." Starting in 1751, the same trustees also operated a Charity School for Boys, whose curriculum combined "general principles of Christianity" with practical instruction leading toward careers in business and the "mechanical arts." [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/charitysch.html], and thus might be described as "non-denominational Christian." The charity school was originally planned, and chartered on paper, in 1740, by followers of evangelist [[George Whitefield]], but was not built and did not operate until the charter was assumed by the Academy of Philadelphia in 1751. Since 1895, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the charity school's charter date and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labelled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as "Episcopalian"[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html]). Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called "Quakers," and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the "Quaker Consortium.") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that "Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America."[http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html]</ref> but founded by [[Church of England]] members<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Protestant_Episcopal_Church |title=Protestant Episcopal Church - LoveToKnow 1911 |publisher=1911encyclopedia.org |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

===Origin of the name===
The first usage of ''Ivy'' in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895<U+2013>1965).{{cquote|A proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.|20px|20px|Stanley Woodward, ''[[New York Tribune]]'', October 14, 1933, describing the football season<ref>"Yale Book of Quotations" (2006) [[Yale University Press]] edited by Fred R. Shapiro</ref>}}

According to book ''Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' (1988), author William Morris writes that Stanley Woodward actually took the term from fellow ''[[New York Tribune]]'' sportswriter Caswell Adams. Morris writes that during the 1930s, the [[Fordham University]] [[college football|football]] team was running roughshod over all its opponents. One day in the sports room at the ''Tribune'', the merits of Fordham's football team were being compared to those of [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, saying they were "only ''Ivy League''." Woodward, the sports editor of the ''Tribune'', picked up the term and printed the next day.

Note though that in the above quote Woodward used the term ''ivy college'', not ''ivy league'' as Adams is said to have used, so there is a discrepancy in this theory, although it seems certain the term ''ivy college'' and shortly later ''Ivy League'' acquired its name from the sports world.

The first known instance of the term ''Ivy League'' being used appeared in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' on February 7, 1935.<ref>"The Yale Book of Quotations" (2006) [[Yale University]] Press, edited by Fred R. Shapiro</ref><ref>[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]] entry for "Ivy League"</ref><ref>[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/WhatIsIvy/history.asp Ivy League Sports]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the [[Colonial colleges|colonial era]], together with the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point), the [[United States Naval Academy]], and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions would make efforts to form an athletic league.

[[Image:West College Princeton.jpg|thumb|Ivy covering West College, Princeton University]]

The Ivy League universities are also called the "Ancient Eight" or simply the '''Ivies'''.

A common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numerals for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed "IV League" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a 4th school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the "IV League" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the "IV League" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

In addition, representatives from four schools: [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], Princeton, Yale, and Columbia, met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in [[Manhattan]] on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate athletic competition, and particularly to codify the new game of college football (which at the time, largely resembled what is currently called [[Rugby union|rugby]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp |title=Rutgers - The Birthplace of Intercollegiate Football |publisher=Scarletknights.com |date=1938-11-05 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> Though invited, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] chose not to attend. While no formal organization or conference was established, the results of this meeting governed athletic events between these schools well into the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/print?tocId=201027&fullArticle=false Encyclopedia Britannica]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}.

===Before there was an Ivy League===
Seven of the Ivy League schools are older than the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven provided the overwhelming majority of the higher education in the Northern and Middle Colonies; their early faculties and founding boards were largely, therefore, drawn from other Ivy League institutions; there were also some British graduates<U+2014>more from the [[University of Cambridge]] than [[University of Oxford|Oxford]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} but also from the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere. Similarly, the founder of [[The College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. The founders of [[Rutgers University]], in 1766, were largely Ivy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]], and most of Stanford's initial faculty members were Cornell professors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The founders of the [[University of California]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are [[Yale Blue]], and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

Some of the Ivy League schools have identifiable Protestant roots, while others were founded as nonsectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and "full liberty of conscience", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.

"Ivy League" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This sense dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first = Joseph |last = Epstein | year=2003 |publisher = Houghton Mifflin | isbn = 0-618-34073-4}} p. 55, "by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them."</ref> Novels<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin}} p. 179, "he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 "''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption.... It is completely Ivy League &mdash; a Vassar/Columbia J-School dumping ground... I will always be excluded, regardless of how many Ivy League degrees I acquire, because of the next level of hurdles: family connections and money."</ref> attest this sense, as a social elite; to some degree independent of the actual schools.

After the Second World War, the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>

===History of the athletic league===
The Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Boat clubs from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], [[New Hampshire]], in 1852. As an informal [[American football|football]] league, the Ivy League dates from 1900 when [[Yale University|Yale]] took the conference championship with a 5-0 record. For many years Army (the [[United States Military Academy]]) and Navy (the [[United States Naval Academy]]) were considered members, but dropped out shortly before formal organization. For instance, Army traditionally had a rivalry with Yale, and Rutgers had rivalries with Princeton and Columbia, which continue today in sports other than [[American football|football]].

The first formal league involving Ivy League teams was formed in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the '''Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League'''. They were later joined by Penn, Dartmouth and Brown.

[[Image:Palestra interior.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palestra]], Penn's basketball arena]]

Before the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an "unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations". In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:{{quotation|The athletic authorities of the so-called "Ivy League" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|The New York Times<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | publisher = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-6}}</ref>}}

Despite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:{{Cquote|I can say with certainty that in the last five years<U+2014>and markedly in the last three months<U+2014>there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.

Please do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic 'Ivy League.' That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment."<ref>{{cite news | author = Robert F. Kelley | title = Cornell Club Here Welcomes Lynah | publisher = The New York Times | page = 22 | date = 1936-1-17}}</ref>}}

Within a year of this statement and having held one-month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of "the formation of an Ivy League" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'', ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' and the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' would simultaneously run an editorial entitled "Now Is the Time", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.<ref>{{cite news | title = Immediate Formation of Ivy League Advocated at Seven Eastern Colleges | publisher = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1936-12-3}}</ref> Part of the editorial read as follows:{{quote|The Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association. The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=456169 |title=The Harvard Crimson :: News :: AN EDITORIAL |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=1936-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>}}

The proposal did not succeed<U+2014>on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the "possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track." However, they noted that the league "has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration."<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | publisher = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-1-12}}</ref>

In 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first '''Ivy Group Agreement''', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of [[athletic scholarships]]. Athletes shall be admitted as students and awarded financial aid only on the basis of the same academic standards and economic need as are applied to all other students.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gwertzman |first=Bernard M. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=128992 |title=The Harvard Crimson '&#39;Ivy League: Formalizing the Fact'&#39; Saturday, October 13, 1956 |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=1956-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>}}

In 1954, the date generally accepted as the birth of the Ivy League, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports. Competition began with the 1956 season.

As late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become [[coeducation]]al. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] [[women's college]]s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at [[Barnard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]], which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie ''[[Animal House]]'' includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet [[Smith College|Smith]] and [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, "The '[[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters']] was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League men<U+2019>s colleges."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Archived: Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |publisher=Ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women's athletic teams, which replaced the women's teams previously sponsored by Barnard.

==Cohesiveness of the group==
The Ivy League schools are highly selective, with acceptance rates ranging from about 7 to 18 percent.<ref>[http://www.uwire.com/Article.aspx?id=583116 ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

These universities engage in a heated competition to attract students, illustrated by a 2002 incident in which admissions officers at Princeton logged into the Yale admissions website fourteen times to view the admissions status of cross-applicants, using the names, birth dates, and social security numbers indicated on their [[Princeton University|Princeton]] applications; Princeton later asserted that it had been considering a similar system of early Internet notification, and was surprised to find that Yale had used no password besides the Social Security number. Yale's administration notified the FBI about the actions after conducting its own investigation. Princeton moved one admissions official to a different department over the incident and the university's Dean of Admissions retired soon thereafter, though Princeton president [[Shirley Tilghman]] said that the dean's decision to retire was unconnected to the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/05/17/news/5201.shtml |title=Princeton removes LeMenager from admission office for violations |publisher=The Daily Princetonian |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

Collaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led [[Ivy Council]] that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school.

===Social elitism===
The phrase ''Ivy League'' historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence, but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportwriter John Kieran noted that student editors at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]] were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider "[[United States Military Academy|Army]] and [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and [[Fordham University|Fordham]] and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] and [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pitt]]" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:

:"It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not 'exclusive' as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose".<ref>Kieran, John (1936), "Sports of the Times", ''The New York Times'', December 4, 1936, p. 36. "There will now be a little test of the "the power of the press" in intercollegiate circles since the student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth and Penn are coming out in a group for the formation of an Ivy League in football. The idea isn't new.... It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not "exclusive" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose." He recommended the consideration of "plenty of institutions covered with home-grown ivy that are not included in the proposed group. [such as ] Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt, just to offer a few examples that come to mind" and noted that "Pitt and Georgetown and Brown and Bowdoin and Rutgers were old when Cornell was shining new, and Fordham and Holy Cross had some building draped in ivy before the plaster was dry in the walls that now tower high about Cayuga's waters."</ref>

The Ivy League has sometimes been specifically associated with the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] establishment.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first = Joseph |last = Epstein | year=2003 |publisher = Houghton Mifflin | isbn = 0-618-34073-4}} p. 55, "by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern prep schools, the Ivy League colleges, and the Episcopal Church among them." and {{cite book | title=The Ideal of the University | first = Robert Paul |last = Wolff | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year=1992 | isbn = 1-56000-603-X}} p. viii: "My genial, aristocratic contempt for Clark Kerr's celebration of the University of California was as much an expression of Ivy League snobbery as it was of radical social critique."</ref> Phrases such as "Ivy League snobbery"<ref>{{cite book | title=The Ideal of the University | first = Robert Paul |last = Wolff | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year=1992 | isbn = 1-56000-603-X}} p. viii: "My genial, aristocratic contempt for Clark Kerr's celebration of the University of California was as much an expression of Ivy League snobbery as it was of radical social critique."</ref> are ubiquitous in nonfiction and fiction writing of the twentieth century. A [[Louis Auchincloss]] character dreads "the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> A business writer, warning in 2001 against discriminatory hiring, presented a cautionary example of an attitude to avoid (the bracketed phrase is his):

:"We Ivy Leaguers [read: mostly white and Anglo]<!--This bracketed phrase is part of the quotation and is in the original, not an editorial interpolation.---> know that an Ivy League degree is a mark of the kind of person who is likely to succeed in this organization."<ref>{{cite book|title=The 10 Lenses: your guide to living and working in a multicultural world|first=Mark|last=Williams|year=2001|publisher=Capital Books|id=ISBN The 10 Lenses: your guide to living and working in a multicultural world}}, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1892123592&id=bkiuOG-k2vUC&pg=RA1-PA85&lpg=RA1-PA85&sig=_uGkwxQd3tP0Zxf65xZ96ls3HSw#PRA1-PA85,M1 p. 85]</ref>

Aspects of Ivy stereotyping were illustrated during the 1988 presidential election, when [[George H. W. Bush]] (Yale '48) derided [[Michael Dukakis]] (graduate of Harvard Law School) for having "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarpley.net/bush22.htm|title=George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography: Chapter XXII Bush Takes The Presidency|author=Webster G.

Bush explained however that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism" and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent "a philosophical enclave" and not a statement about class.<ref>Dowd, Maureen (1998), "Bush Traces How Yale Differs From Harvard." ''The New York Times,'' June 11, 1998, p. 10</ref> Columnist [[Russell Baker]] opined that "Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their [[undershirt]] no matter how hot the weather gets."<ref>Baker, Russell (1998), "The Ivy Hayseed." ''The New York Times,'' June 15, 1988, p. A31</ref> Still, the last four presidents have all attended Ivy League schools for at least part of their education<U+2014>George H.W. Bush (Yale undergrad), Bill Clinton (Yale Law School), George W. Bush (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), and Barack Obama (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School).

==Cooperation==
Up until recently, seven of the eight schools (Harvard excluded) participated in the Borrow Direct [[interlibrary loan]] program, making a total of 88 million items available to participants with a waiting period of four working days.<ref>Columbia's [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/requestit/borrow_direct.html Borrow Direct] website</ref> This [[Interlibrary loan|ILL]] program is not affiliated with the formal Ivy arrangement. Harvard and MIT joined the Direct Borrow partnership in January 2011, together contributing over 70 million books to the existing collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.brown.edu/libnews/2011/01/24/harvard-and-mit-libraries-join-borrow-direct-20-million-additional-books-available-to-brown-borrowers/ |title=<U+00BB> Harvard and MIT Libraries Join Borrow Direct <U+2013> 20 Million Additional Books Available to Brown Borrowers Brown University Library News |publisher=Blogs.brown.edu |date=2011-01-24 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

The governing body of the Ivy League is the [[Council of Ivy Group Presidents]]. During their meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives.

==Competition and athletics==
[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Cornell Big Red]] [[college baseball]] player from 1908.]]
Ivy champions are recognized in 33 men's and women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other. (For example, the six league members who participate in [[ice hockey]] do so as members of [[ECAC Hockey]]; but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year.) Unlike all other Division I [[basketball]] conferences, the Ivy League has no tournament for the league title;<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/75007 May The Madness Begin] by Mark Starr [[Newsweek|Newsweek.com]]; March 14, 2002. Retrieved January 25, 2008.</ref> the school with the best conference record represents the conference in the [[Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament]] (with a playoff, or playoffs, in the case of a tie).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2002/03/06/yale-basketball-shares-ivy-league-title/ |title=Yale basketball shares Ivy League title |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2002-03-06 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref> Since its inception, an Ivy League school has yet to win either the men's or women's [[Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament]].

On average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools.
Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based ([[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]]).<ref>[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/whatisivy/index.asp Ivy League Sports]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Ivy League teams non-league games are usually against the members of the [[Patriot League]], which have similar academic standards and athletic scholarship policies.

In the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 24 recognized national championships in [[college football]] (last in 1911), and Yale won 19 (last in 1927). Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], which has won 13, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], which has won 12, and [[USC Trojans football|USC]], which has won 11. Yale, whose coach [[Walter Camp]] was the "Father of American Football," held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] on November 10, 2001. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 17.

Beginning with the 1982 football season, the Ivy League has competed in [[Division I-AA]] (renamed  [[Division I Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] in 2006).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/sports/ncaafootball/17ivy.html?ei=5088&en=eef43e83c884e0f3&ex=1321419600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print New York Times] - 2006-11-17</ref> The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion receives an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA. Through the 2009 season, all eligible teams have declined the invitation, citing rules governing the league's academic concerns posed by the extended December schedule. The Ivy League plays a strict 10 game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 or 12 regular season games, plus post-season, which was expanded in 2010 to five rounds with 20 teams, with a bye week for the top 12 teams.  Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.

[[Image:Yale-Harvard-Game.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Yale Bowl]] during [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|The Game]].]]
Although no longer as successful nationally as they once were in many of the more popular college sports, the Ivy League is still competitive in others. One such example is [[college rowing (United States)|rowing]]. All of the Ivies have historically been among the top crews in the nation, and most continue to be so today. (Other historical top crews include [[California Golden Bears|Cal]], [[Washington Huskies|Washington]], [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] and [[Navy Midshipmen|Navy]]). Most recently, on the men's side, Harvard won the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] Championships in 2003, 2004, 2005, and on the women's side, Harvard and Brown won the 2003 and 2004 [[NCAA Rowing Championships]], respectively. Additionally, Cornell's men's lightweight team won back to back to back IRA National Championships in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Ivy League schools are also very competitive in men's lacrosse and both men's and women's hockey.

The Ivy League is home to some of the oldest [[college rugby]] teams. These teams meet annually to compete in a tourney. The 2006 Ivy League Tournament was hosted by Yale, and the 2005 tournament was hosted by Penn. Though the women's rugby teams at the Ivy League schools are much younger, they too compete in an annual Ivy League Tournament, often hosted by Brown.

===Internal rivalries===
Rivalries run deep in the Ivy League. For instance, Harvard and Yale are celebrated [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|football]] and [[Harvard-Yale Regatta|crew]] rivals.

Princeton and [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn]] are longstanding men's basketball rivals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/02/12/sports/4317.shtml |title=The game: the tables are turned <U+2013> Penn hoops travel to Jadwin tonight for premier rivalry of Ivy League basketball |publisher=The Daily Princetonian |date=2002-02-12 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> and "Puck Fenn", "Puck Frinceton", and "Pennetrate the Puss" t-shirts are worn at games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/02/12/sports/4318.shtml |title=The rivalry?

Penn has won 21 outright, Princeton 18 outright. Princeton has been a co-champion 7 times, sharing 4 of those titles with Penn (these 4 seasons represent the only times Penn has been co-champion). Cornell is the reigning (2010) Ivy League men's basketball champion, achieving its third consecutive league title.

Rivalries exist between other Ivy league teams in other sports, including [[Cornell-Harvard hockey rivalry|Cornell and Harvard in hockey]] (the only two League members to have won the NCAA tournament), Harvard and Princeton in swimming, and Harvard and Penn in football (Penn and Harvard have each had two unbeaten seasons since 2001).<ref>[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/ivy-champs.asp?intSID=3 Ivy League Football]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> In [[field lacrosse|men's lacrosse]], [[Cornell Big Red men's lacrosse|Cornell]] and [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|Princeton]] are perennial rivals, and they are the only two Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament. In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA tournament]].<ref>[http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20090516/SPORTS03/905160373/1128/New+wrinkle+to+Cornell-Princeton+lacrosse+rivalry New wrinkle in the Cornell Princeton lacrosse rivalry], ''[[The Ithaca Journal]]'', May 16, 2009.</ref>

Furthermore, no team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men's swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time.

==Other Ivies==
Marketing groups, journalists, and some educators sometimes promote other colleges as "Ivies," as in [[Little Ivies]], [[Public Ivies]] or [[Southern Ivies]]. These uses of ''Ivy'' are intended to promote the other schools by comparing them to the Ivy League. For example, in the 2007 edition of Newsweek's ''How to Get Into College Now'', the editors designated twenty-five schools as "New Ivies."<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2006/08/20/25-new-ivies.html |title=America's 25 New Elite 'Ivies' |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>
