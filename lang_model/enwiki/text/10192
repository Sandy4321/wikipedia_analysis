'''''Animal''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American pop singer [[Kesha]]. The album was released January 5, 2010 by [[RCA| RCA Records]]. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[David Gamson]], [[Greg Kurstin]], [[Max Martin]] and others. Lyrically, the majority of the albums songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences influenced by love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. Musically, Animal draws from the [[dance-pop]] genre, while also incorporating elements of [[electro]] and [[electropop]] in its production and beats.

The album received mixed reviews from music critics upon release. Some appreciated the fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and claimed that it came off as insincere. The album attained chart success by debuting at number one in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Greece]]. Worldwide, the album has sold more than one million copies. <ref name="1Million"/>

Three singles have been released from the album. The album's [[lead single]], "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]" was released August 7, 2009. The single reached number one in twelve countries including the  [[Billboard Hot 100]] and the [[Canadian Hot 100]]. On February 19, 2010 the album's second single "[[Blah Blah Blah (song)|Blah Blah Blah]]" was released. Before being announced as a single the song debuted at number seven in the United States and number three in Canada as a result of digital sales from the album's release. "[[Your Love Is My Drug]]" was released as the third single and has reached the top ten in two countries.

==Background==
Kesha had been working on ''Animal'' for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The abundance of material extended it from its planned twelve track length to fourteen tracks.<ref name="Meet">{{cite web|url=http://www.seventeen.com/fun-stuff/17-buzz/kesha-interview|title=Meet "Tik Tok" Singer Ke$ha|date=11 January 2010|work=[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> The album's title came from a diving experience Kesha had, where a [[barracuda]] was chasing and trying to attack her. She explained,

{{quote|I've done research on animals because I'm a diver, and I used to wear gold bikinis and had eye piercings and stuff, and then I almost got eaten by a barracuda once, and I was like 'Why does he keep chasing me? Why does he want to eat me?' And then I was researching and found out that animals are really attracted to shiny things, especially gold and silver, so I feel like if I cover my body and the audience with glitter then they'll like it.|Kesha|<ref name="Meet"/>}}

She felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," she said. "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing <U+2013> makeup, their clothes, music, live shows <U+2013> anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously."<ref name="Meet"/>

==Composition==
Musically, ''Animal'' is of the [[dance-pop]] genre, while incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in its production and [[Beat (music)|beats]].<ref name="Jeffries">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fifixz9sld0e~T1|title=Animal > Review|last=Jeffries|first=David|work=''[[Allmusic]]''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Some of its songs are reminiscent of [[1980s in music|1980s music]], such as "Party at a Rich Dude's House", which [[Allmusic]] reviewer David Jeffries noted could have appeared on the soundtrack to the 1982 film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.<ref name="Jeffries"/> ''Animal'' also uses [[Auto-Tune]] and [[vocoder]]s to alter Kesha's voice, and includes [[Sampling (music)|samples]].<ref name="Jeffries"/>

Jeffries noted that the album lyrically revolves around avoiding reality with a preference for a "garbage chic" one, with lyrics such as, "Maybe I need some [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], or maybe just need some sleep" from the opening song "Your Love Is My Drug".<ref name="Jeffries"/> "Tik Tok" was written about an experience Kesha had where she woke up in her house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California]], surrounded by several of her attractive female friends. She compared the experience to feeling like rapper [[Sean Combs|Diddy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/12/11/kesha-tik-tok-interview|title=Ke$ha: A Music Mix Q&A on her Top 5 hit 'Tik Tok,' the origin of her name, and why she's not welcome in Paris Hilton's home|last=Lynch|first=Joseph Brannigan|date=11 December 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> who contributed two lines to the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1628052/20091210/puff_daddy.jhtml|title=Ke$ha Dishes On Her 'Bizarre' Collaboration With Diddy For 'Tik Tok'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 December 2009|work=''[[MTV]]''|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> The song "Kiss n Tell" was written about Kesha's discovery that her boyfriend was cheating on her with a female [[Pop music|pop]] singer.<ref name="Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.keshasparty.com/us/biography|title=Ke$ha biography|work=''KeshasParty.com''|publisher=Sony Music Entertainment|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>

The writing of "Party at a Rich Dude's House" came about from an incident where Kesha vomited in [[Paris Hilton]]'s closet during a party held at Hilton's home,<ref name="Biography"/> while "Backstabber," according to Kesha, was written about "some dumb [girl who] fronted like she was my friend but then secretly tried to bring me down."<ref name="Biography"/> "Boots & Boys" is a "lusty" song reminiscent of [[INXS]]'s "[[Suicide Blonde]]", but from a female point of view.<ref name="Jeffries"/> Jeffries concluded that, overall, ''Animal'' portrays Kesha as "a gum-snapping, [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol-abusing]] [[Facebook]] jockey straight out of the suburbs who spits sophomoric but fun putdowns, come-ons, and [[Signature block|sig files]] all over electro beats".<ref name="Jeffries"/>

''Animal'' generated mixed reviews from music critics upon its release. According to the music review aggregator [[Metacritic]] the album currently holds a 58 out of 100 based on 17 critical reviews.<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/kesha/animal?q=ke$ha |title=Ke$ha <U+2013> Animal - Metacritic |accessdate=2010-04-30 |work=Metacritic}}</ref> Andrew Burgess of [[musicOMH]] was impressed with Kesha calling her an "auto-tuned talk-singing, gum-smacker" that may well be "a pop-genius, a gutter-glam [[Jonathan Swift]]." As for the album he described it as "an infectiously good dance-pop album" thats a "a towering triumph" for the artist.<ref name=Burgess>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/kesha_0110.htm|title=Ke$ha - Animal|last=Burgess|first=Andrew|date=1 February 2010|publisher=musicomh.com|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> Daniel Brockman of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' called the album "a clear subversion of pop norms" with working "effortless hooks".<ref name="Brockman">{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/music/95211-kesha-animal-2010/|title=Kesha <nowiki>|</nowiki> Animal|last=Brockman|first=Daniel|date=8 January 2010|work=''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]''|publisher=The Phoenix Media/Communications Group|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> [[Ann Powers]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that Kesha's ability to "effortlessly shift from half-singing to half-talking" is a technique that makes her vocals "carom like shiny pinballs against the crazy beats and sound effects that make up these tracks" while never sounding "like she's trying too hard". Her final conclusion of Kesha and the album was that "she should stick to the wisecracks and the slapstic", that's truly "where her power really lies." <ref name="Powers">{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-kesha5-2010jan05,0,4048424.story|title=Ke$ha is a wisecracking 'Animal'|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=5 January 2010|work=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref>

David Jeffries of [[Allmusic]] was not impressed with the album's ballads calling them "completely unsatisfying" and should be avoided. The album as a whole he was more impressed with, noting "that with so many fun, 'TiK ToK'-type tracks, the album has plenty for both brats and the bratty at heart."<ref name="Jeffries"/> James Reed of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' postulated that Kesha's "personality [was] completely missing from [the songs]," resulting in her sounding "vapid and faceless."<ref name="Reed">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/cd_reviews/articles/2010/01/04/kehas_time_is_up/|title=Ke$ha's time is up|last=Reed|first=James|date=4 January 2010|work=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|publisher=[[The New York Times|NY Times Co]]|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Ailbhe Malone of ''[[NME]]'' met ''Animal'' with a mixed review stating that "Beneath the patina of skeezy Freshers<U+2019>-Week-LOLZ lyrics (<U+201C>got a water-bottle of whiskey in my handbag<U+201D>)" it seems there "lies a talent." <ref name="Malone">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/keha/11029|title=Ke$ha - Animal - Album Review|last=Malone|first=Ailbhe|date=3 January 2010|work=''[[NME]]''|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> Monica Herrera of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the prevalent use of [[Auto-Tune]] on Kesha's vocals made it difficult to tell if the "California cutie can actually sing", citing the song "Take It Off" as an example of "how easily individuality can get lost in a sea of AutoTune". Herrera though, was impressed with other songs stating that she has "choruses that stick with the listener for days", from the blissful "Your Love Is My Drug" to the catty "Backstabber."<ref name="Herrera">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/new-releases#/new-releases/ke-ha-animal-1004056550.story|title= Ke$ha, "Animal"|last=Herrera|first=Monica|date=5 January 2010|work=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Jonathan Keefe of [[Slant Magazine]] was extremely negative of the album and of Kesha's stating that her attempts to sing and rap are "pitiful".
