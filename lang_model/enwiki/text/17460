{{History of Bengal}}

'''Nawabs of Bengal''' were the hereditary ''nazim''s or ''[[Subahdar]]s'' (provincial governors) of the ''[[Subah (province)|subah]]'' (province) of [[Bengal]] during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] and later became the rulers of the province. The last Nawab of Bengal, [[Mansur Ali Khan]] abdicated on November 1, 1880 in favour of his eldest son.

'''Nawabs of Murshidabad''' succeeded the Nawabs of Bengal as Nawab of Murshidabad, after the last Nawab of Bengal, [[Mansur Ali Khan]] abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son, [[Hassan Ali Mirza]], who succeeded him with the lesser title of the Nawab of Bahadur Murshidabad after the title of the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1881. Nawabs of Murshidabad were the representatives of the former ruling house of the Nawabs of Bengal. The last Nawab of Murshidabad was [[Waris Ali Mirza]]. He left three sons and three daughters but before declaring a successor Waris Ali passed away. So, since Waris Ali's death there has been no clear successor to the title of Nawab of Murshidabad.

==Bengal==


[[Image:Location-Bangla01.png|thumb|150px|left|Location of modern [[Bengal]] ([[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]].)]] 


{{Main|Bengal}}
At present [[Bengal]] is mainly divided between the sovereign land of [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]] (previously [[East Bengal]] / [[East Pakistan]]) and the [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]], although some regions of the previous kingdoms of Bengal (during local monarchical regimes, like the Nawabs' rule and [[British Empire|British rule]]) are now part of the neighbouring Indian states of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[Orissa]]. So sometimes the Nawabs are mentioned as "Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa" or "Nawab Nazim of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa" - where ''[[Nazim]]'' (or, ''[[Subahdar]]'') means the provincial governor - but formerly the states were all a part of Bengal, so the Nawabs may be mentioned only as the "Nawab of Bengal". The majority of Bengal is inhabited by [[Bengali people]] who speak the [[Bengali language]].

==History before the Nawabs' rule==
;Ilyas Shahi dynasty
The early [[Sultan]]s of [[Bengal]] ruled until 1282 which was followed by the rule of several successive dynasties. [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah|Ilyas Shah]] founder of the [[Ilyas Shahi dynasty]], took complete charge of the then [[Bengal]]<ref>Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). ''The Delhi Sultanate'', Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p.197</ref> and the capital was shifted to [[Sonargaon]] (near present day, [[Dhaka]] in Bangladesh).<ref>Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). ''The Delhi Sultanate'', Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p.212</ref>
He was one of the independent rulers of [[Bengal]]. His son, [[Sikandar Shah]], who succeeded him, built the [[Adina Mosque]] at [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]], near [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gour]], Adina Mosque in the medieval times, was considered to be the largest in [[Bengal|undivided Bengal]], as well as the entire [[Indian subcontinent]]<ref>[http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0040.htm Adina Mosque], from [[Banglapedia]].</ref>

;Mughal Empire and others
[[File:Babur idealisiert.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The first [[Mughal emperor]], [[Babur]]]]


The [[Mughal Empire]] emerged as a powerful Empire in northern India. [[Babur]], who was related to two legendary warriors - [[Timur]] and [[Genghis Khan]], invaded north India and defeated [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]].<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', "[http://www.economist.com/node/17723207 Babu, the First Moghul Emperor:  Wine and Tulips in Kabul]", 16 December 2010, pp. 80<U+2013>82.</ref> Babur thus became the first Mughal emperor. He was succeeded by his son, [[Humayun]]. At the same time, [[Sher Shah Suri]] (alias Farid Khan) of the [[Suri dynasty]] rose to prominence and established himself as the ruler of the present day [[Bihar]] by defeating Ghiyashuddin Shah. But he lost to capture the kingdom because of sudden expedition of Humayun. In 1539, Sher Khan faced Humayun in the battle of Chausa. He forced Humayun out of India. Assuming the title ''Sher Shah'', he ascended the throne of Delhi. He also captured Agra  and established control from Bengal in the east until the [[Indus River|Indus river]] in the west.<ref name="Columbia">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0844870.html |title=Sher Khan|work=|publisher=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref> After his death he was succeeded by his son, [[Islam Shah Suri]]. But in 1544 the Suris were torn apart by internal conflicts. Humayun took this advantage and captured Lahore and Delhi, but he died in 1556 AD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Islam Shah the Successor of Sher Shah|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/2012031025991/biography-of-islam-shah-the-successor-of-sher-shah.html}}</ref>  He was succeeded by [[Akbar]], who defeated [[Daud Khan Karrani]] of Bengal's [[History_of_Bangladesh#Karrani_dynasty|Karrani Dynasty]] (or, Karnani Dynasty). After this, the administration of the entire region of Bengal passed into the hands of governors appointed by the Mughal emperors, who ruled Bengal till 1716 AD.

There were several posts under the Mughal administrative system during Akbar's reign. ''[[Diwan_(title)#Title|Diwani]]'' was a system of provincial revenue administration under the Mughals. ''Nizamat'' (civil administration) and Diwani (revenue administration) were the two main branches of the provincial administration under the Mughals. A ''[[Subahdar]]'' (provincial viceroy or governor), also called a ''Nazim'' was in-charge of the ''Nizamat''. There was a chain of subordinate officials under the Nazims on the executive side and under ''Diwans'' on the revenue and judicial side.

;Emergence of the Nawab of Bengal
[[File:Murshidabad.gif|right|200px|thumb|Early nineteenth century view of [[Murshidabad]], with the [[Katra Mosque]] in the backdrops.]]
[[Murshid Quli Khan]] arrived as the governor of Bengal in 1717 AD. Before his arrival there were four ''Diwans''. And, after his arrival, [[Azim-ush-Shan]] held the ''Nazim's'' office. Azim got into conflict with Murshid Quli Khan over imperial financial control. Considering the complaint of Khan, emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered Azim to move to [[Bihar]].<ref>Anjali Chatterjee, [http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/A_0386.HTM Azim-us-Shan], [[Banglapedia]]: The National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh, [[Asiatic Society]] of Bangladesh, [[Dhaka]], ''Retrieved: 2012-07-28''</ref>Upon his departure the two posts united in one and Murshid Quli Khan became the first ''Nazim'' cum ''Diwan'' of Bengal. Murshid Khan was appointed the "''Nawab Nazim'' of Bengal" and he emerged as the ruler of Bengal under the Mughals. [[Murshidabad]] remained the capital of the Nawabs of Bengal until their rule.

==History after and during the Nawabs' rule==
;Dynasties
[[File:Aurangzeb reading the Quran.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]]]]
From 1717 until 1880, three successive Islamic dynasties <U+2013> Nasiri, Afshar and Najafi <U+2013> ruled what was then known as Bengal.

The first dynasty, the Nasiri, ruled from 1717 until 1740. The founder of the Nasiri, [[Murshid Quli Khan]], was born a poor [[Deccan]]i [[Oriya people|Oriya]] [[Brahmin]] before being sold into slavery and bought by one Haji Shafi Isfahani, a [[Persian people|Persian]] merchant from [[Isfahan]] who converted him to Islam. He entered the service of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Emperor Aurangzeb|Aurangzeb]] and rose through the ranks before becoming the [[Nawab]] [[Nazim]] of Bengal in 1717, a post he held until his death in 1727. He in turn was succeeded by his son-in law, [[Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Murshid Quli Khan|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-murshid-quli-khan.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>  After Shuja-ud-Din's death in 1739 he was succeeded by his son, [[Sarfaraz Khan]], who hold the rank, until he was killed in the [[Battle of Giria]] in 1741, and was succeeded by [[Alivardi Khan]], former ruler of [[Patna]], of the Afshar Dynasty in 1740.<ref>{{cite web|title=Defeat of Sarfaraz Khan in the Battle of Giria|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-sarfaraz-khan.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> 

The second dynasty, the Afshar, ruled from 1740 to 1757. [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] ([[Alivardi Khan]]'s grandson), the last Afshar Nawab was killed in the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.<ref name = battleofplassey/> They were succeeded by the third and final dynasty to rule the whole Bengal, the Najafi.<ref name = i>{{cite web|title=Dynasties of The Nawabs|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-nawab.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> 

;Under the Mughals
Bengal (Bengal ''subah'') was one of the wealthiest parts of the Mughal empire. As the Mughal empire began to decline, the [[Nawabs]] grew in power, although nominally sub-ordinate to the Mughal emperor. They wielded great power in their own right and ruled the ''subah'' as independent rulers for all practical purposes by the early 1700s.

;Maratha expeditions
[[File:Ragonath Row Ballajee.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]]]]
Marathas undertook [[Expeditions in Bengal|six expeditions in Bengal]] from 1741<U+2013>1748. Maratha general, [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] was able to annex Orissa to his kingdom permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa after the death of [[Murshid Quli Khan]] in 1727.<ref>SNHM. Vol. II, pp.&nbsp;209, 224.</ref>  Constantly harassed by the Bhonsles, Orissa, Bengal and parts of Bihar were economically ruined. Alivardi Khan made peace with Raghunathrao in 1751 ceding in perpetuity Orrisa up to the river Suvarnarekha, and agreeing to pay {{Indian Rupees}}12 lacs annually in lieu of the [[Chauth]] of Bengal and Bihar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1BY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA555&dq=MARATHA+INVASION+ON+BENGAL&hl=en&ei=nsRITuGPHMvjrAeRvulY&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=MARATHA%20INVASION%20ON%20BENGAL&f=false|title=Maratha invasion of Bengal}}</ref>

The treaty included {{Indian Rupees}}20 lacs as Chauth for Bengal (includes both west Bengal and Bangladesh) and {{Indian Rupees}}12 lacs for Bihar(including Jharkhand). After this Maratha promised never to cross the boundary of the Nawab of Bengal's territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gKOqA9lgtbwC&pg=PA64&dq=MARATHA+chauth+from+bihar&hl=en&ei=qMdITqPwJcP4rQePn5HYCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=MARATHA%20chauth%20from%20bihar&f=false|title=Maratha Chauth from Bihar}}</ref> 
Baji Rao thus is hailed as the greatest Maratha chief after [[Shivaji]] because of his success in subjecting Muslim rulers of east India in states such as Bengal, Bihar and Orissa to the Maratha rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aHcfv6zkJgQC&pg=PA21&dq=MARATHA+raids+in+bihar&hl=en&ei=FcpITubrJ4XtrQedwrTXAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=MARATHA%20raids%20in%20bihar&f=false|title=Maratha raids in Bihar}}</ref>

;Under British Rule
[[File:Clive.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Mir Jafar]] meeting with Sir [[Robert Clive]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]]]]
After the Nawab [[Siraj Ud Daulah]] (the last independent ruler of Bengal) was defeated by the British forces of Sir [[Robert Clive]] in the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, the Nawabs became puppet rulers, being dependent on the British.<ref name = battleofplassey>{{cite web|url=http://www.facts-about-india.com/bengal-nawabs.php|accessdate=July 28, 2012|title=Defeat of Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey}}</ref> Siraj-ud-daula was replaced by [[Mir Jafar]]. He was personally led to the throne by Robert Clive, after triumph of the British in the battle.<ref name = battleofplassey/> He briefly tried to re-assert his power by allying with the Dutch, but this plan was ended by the [[Battle of Chinsurah]]. After the grant of the ''Diwani'' of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], to the British East India Company in 1765 and the appointment of Warren Hastings by the East India Company as their first Governor General of Bengal in 1771, the Nawabs were deprived of any real power, and finally in 1793, when the ''Nizamat'' (governorship) was also taken away from them, they remained as the mere pensioners of the British East India Company. 

During Nawab [[Mubarak ud-Daulah]]'s administration all powers passed into the the hands of the East India company. All the ''Diwan'' offices except the ''Diwan Ton'' were abolished. So, ''Diwan Ton'' managed the household and state affairs of the Nawab Nazim, under the denomination of ''Diwan Nizamat'', and the chief officer in charge of the ''Nawab Nazim's'' affairs has since been known as the ''Diwan'', or sometimes the ''"Madarul Makam"''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incidents during Mubarak ud-Daulah's reign|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-mubarak-ud-daulla.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> 

;Decline of the Nawab of Bengal
[[Mansur Ali Khan]] (alias: Feradun Jah) was the last Nawab of Bengal. In his absence the Nizamat at Murshidabad became involved in debts and people started making several claims against him and as a result, attachments were issued against his property. The Government of India there upon moved into an action of freezing the Nawab and his property from suits and attachments. The government also moved upon of discharging portions of the claims. The title of "Nawab of Bengal" was abolished in 1880.<ref name=j>{{cite web|title=Decline of the Nawabs of Bengal|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-feradun-jah.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> 

Feradun Jah left Murshidabad in February 1869 and started living in England. He returned at Bombay in October 1881 but his journey not that of pleasure, as most of his time was spent in pleading his case against orders of the Government of India. After it was not resolved the Nawab renounced his styles and titles of Nawab Nazim of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and abdicated in favour of his eldest son at St. Ives, Maidenhead, on November 1 1880.<ref name = j/>

His son, [[Hassan Ali Mirza]], who succeeded him, was given the lesser title of [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] by the British. Hassan's descendants continued the title until 1969 when the last Nawab of the dynasty died and since then the title has been in dispute.<ref name = i/><ref name = j/>

;Emergence of the Nawab of Murshidabad
After Mansur Ali Khan's abdication, his son, [[Hassan Ali Mirza]] succeeded as the first Nawab of Murshidabad with the lesser title of Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad after the title of Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1881.<ref name = i/><ref name = j/> Nawabs of Murshidabad were the representatives of the former Nawabs of Bengal. After Lord Clive secured the Diwani of Bengal  from Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1765 for the East India Company they did not have any effective authority. So they lavishly enjoyed their title, privileges alongside with the honours they received. They had little or no say in the expenditure from the share of the revenues collected from Bengal and ceased to control any significant administrative, legal or military forces. The last Nawab of Murshidabad was [[Waris Ali Mirza]]. He left three sons and three daughters. Normally, the eldest son of oneself succeeds his father (the preceding Nawab) as the successive Nawab but Waris Ali's eldest son, Wakif Ali Mirza Bahadur, was excluded from the succession by his father for contracting a non-Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion (validity in law doubted by the Calcutta High Court on November 6, 1990). He took no steps during his lifetime to establish his succession but, being a foreign national, they were unlikely to be recognised by the Government of India. And, before declaring a successor Waris Ali passed away. So, since Waris Ali's death there has been no clear successor to the title of Nawab of Murshidabad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decline of the Nawabs of Murshidabad|url=http://murshidabad.net/history/history-topic-waresh-ali.htm|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>
