'''Hurricane Vince''' was an unusual [[hurricane]] which developed in the northeastern [[Atlantic basin]]. Forming in October during the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], the waters over which it developed were considered too cold for tropical development. Vince was the 20th [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|named tropical cyclone]] and 12th [[Tropical cyclone#Hurricane|hurricane]] of the extremely active season.

Vince developed from a non-tropical system on October&nbsp;8, becoming a [[subtropical storm]] southeast of the [[Azores]]. The [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and, on October&nbsp;11, made landfall on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as a tropical depression. Vince was the first tropical system to do so since 1842. It dissipated over [[Spain]], bringing much needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Vince 2005 track.png}}
On October&nbsp;5, an operationally [[2005 Azores subtropical storm|unnamed subtropical storm]] which had gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a non-tropical frontal [[Low pressure area|low]], which was moving to the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its [[Weather front|frontal structure]] after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on October&nbsp;8, 580&nbsp;[[statute mile|miles]] (930&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) southeast of [[Lajes]] in the Azores.<ref name="VinceTCR">{{cite web|author=James L. Franklin|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Vince|publisher=NOAA|date=2006-02-22|accessdate=2006-05-04|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL242005_Vince.pdf}}</ref> However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the [[Sea surface temperature|water temperature]] was too low for a [[tropical cyclone]] to normally develop. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (75&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]), much colder than the 26.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (80&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) usually required for tropical development.<ref name="VinceTCR"/>

Soon after it became a tropical storm on October&nbsp;9 near [[Madeira]], with a ragged [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] already present,<ref name="Malaga_Channel_Oct13">{{cite web|author=Staff|publisher=Malaga Weather Channel|date=2005-10-13|accessdate=2008-07-30|title=13 Oct 2005 ...'Hurricane Vince' visits southern Spain|url=http://www.malaga-weather.com/article.75.html}}</ref> the NHC officially named it Tropical Storm Vince and began to issue advisories.<ref name="NHC-disc1">{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Tropical Storm Vince Discussion Number 1|publisher=NOAA|date=2005-10-09|accessdate=2006-05-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al232005.discus.001.shtml}}</ref> At the time there was some uncertainty as to whether Vince was tropical or subtropical but, in his post-season analysis, forecaster James L.

The NHC forecaster decided that "if it looks like a hurricane, it probably is, despite its environment and unusual location".<ref name="Vince_disc_02"/>

==Preparations and impact==
The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre-emergency for the province of [[Castell<U+00F3>n (province)|Castell<U+00F3>n]] in the anticipation that Hurricane Vince would bring rains capable of flooding. The Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog<U+00ED>a (INM) issued a bulletin that warned of a 40% chance of flooding. Four [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous regions]] ([[Asturias]], [[Catalonia|Catalu<U+00F1>a]], [[Castile and Le<U+00F3>n]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) issued flood warnings, and [[Canary Islands|Canarias]] issued a wind warning.<ref name="el_confidencial">{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=El Confidencial|date=2005-10-12|accessdate=2008-07-28|title=Protecci<U+00F3>n Civil alerta a cinco comunidades por la lluvia y el viento|language=Spanish|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/noticias/noticia.asp?id=6804&edicion=12/10/2005&pass=}}</ref> Spanish fishing fleets off the [[Andalusia]]n coast returned to port and weathered the storm on their moorings rather than in the open ocean.<ref name="20minutos_oct13_01"/>

Hurricane Vince developed into a ''hurricane'' further east than any known storm, at 18.9<U+00B0>&nbsp;W.

When Subtropical Storm Vince formed on October&nbsp;8, it was the earliest in the season that the twenty-first tropical or subtropical storm had ever developed, 38&nbsp;days ahead of the previous record held by Tropical Storm&nbsp;21 of the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. Hurricane Vince was also the first named "V" storm in the Atlantic since naming began in 1950. Because the storm did not cause significant damage, the name ''Vince'' was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref>{{cite web|author=NHC|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|title=Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma "Retired" from List of Storm Names|accessdate=2008-07-30|date=2006-04-06|publisher=NOAA}}</ref> and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season.<ref name="2011_lists">{{cite web|author=NHC|publisher=NOAA|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2008-07-30|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref>
