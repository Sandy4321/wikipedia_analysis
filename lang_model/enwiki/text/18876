'''Josephine Veasey''' (born July 10, 1930) is a British [[mezzo-soprano]], particularly associated with [[Wagner]] and [[Berlioz]]
roles.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Peckham]], she studied with Audrey Langford, and became a member of the [[Royal Opera House]] chorus in 1949. She made her debut as a soloist on 5 July 1955 as the Page in ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', followed by Cherubino in ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', and later roles included Dorabella in ''[[Cos<U+00EC> fan tutte]]'',  Marina in ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', Preziosilla in ''[[La forza del destino]]'', Eboli in ''[[Don Carlos]]'', Amneris in ''[[Aida]]'', and sang the title role in ''[[Carmen]]'', amongst others. Beginning in 1957, she became a regular guest at the [[Glyndebourne Festival]], notably as Charlotte in ''[[Werther]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Noticed and encouraged by [[Georg Solti]], she began adding Wagner roles to her repertoire, notably Waltraute and Fricka in ''[[Die Walk<U+00FC>re]]'', the second of which she recorded for DG under [[Herbert von Karajan]]). Other included major roles in ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', Venus in ''[[Tannh<U+00E4>user (opera)]]'', and Kundry in ''[[Parsifal]]''. Under [[Colin Davis]]' guidance, she also became an illustrious interpreter of Berlioz's works, singing both Didon and Cassandre in ''[[Les Troyens]]'', and Marguerite in ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', which she also recorded for him.

On the international scene, she appeared at the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op<U+00E9>ra]], the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]], at [[La Scala]] in Milan, the [[Vienna State Opera]], the [[Salzburg Festival]], the [[Metropolitan Opera]], and the [[San Francisco Opera]]. In 1962, she created the role of Andromache in [[Michael Tippett]]'s ''[[King Priam]]'', and in 1976 created The Emperor in [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[We Come to the River]]''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Although not associated with the [[bel canto]] repertoire, she recorded in 1966, the role of Agnese in ''[[Beatrice di Tenda]]'', opposite [[Joan Sutherland]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], under [[Richard Bonynge]], and appeared as Adalgisa in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', opposite [[Montserrat Caball<U+00E9>]] and [[Jon Vickers]], in the famous production, recorded on DVD, at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Antique d'Orange]] in 1974.

One of her many distinguished roles was as Charlotte in [[Massenet]]'s ''[[Werther]]''. By chance, the BBC Radio 3 broadcast of that opera on 8 July 1979 captured for posterity her portrayal because she had stood in at the last minute for the indisposed [[Teresa Berganza]] and partnered [[Alfredo Kraus]] in one of his signature roles.

She also won considerable acclaim as Dido{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} in [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', which she also recorded with Colin Davis. She retired from the stage in 1982; her last performance was as Herodias at Covent Garden, the same opera in which she began her solo career, ''[[Salome]]'' by Richard Strauss. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
