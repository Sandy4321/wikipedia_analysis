'''Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard''' (10 April 1877 - 29 May 1971) was [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]] from 1946 to 1958 and known for his strict sentencing and conservative views. He was nicknamed the 'Tiger' and "Justice-in-a-jiffy" for his no-nonsense manner. He once dismissed six appeals in one hour in 1957.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,863716,00.html "The Last of the Tiger"], ''Time'', New York, 1 September 1958.</ref>

==Early Life==

Rayner Goddard was born on 10 April 1877 at Bassett Road, [[Notting Hill]], [[London]], the second of three sons and the third of five children.

Goddard attended [[Marlborough College]], where he decided on a career in law. In later life he vigorously denied the frequent claims of [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Lord Jowitt]] that he had amused his school contemporaries by reciting, word for word, the form of the death sentence upon those whom he disliked. He later attended [[Trinity College, Oxford]] and graduated with a upper second-class degree in [[jurisprudence]] in [[1898]], and gained a [[University Sporting Blue|full blue]] in athletics. He was called to the [[Bar (law)|Bar]] by both the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Gray's Inn]] in 1899. 

==Marriage==

On 31 May 1906 Goddard married Marie Schuster, the daughter of the banker Sir Felix Otto Schuster, with whom he was to have three daughters. She died on 16 May 1928 during an operation at the age of 44. Goddard never remarried.

==A career in the law==

He built a strong reputation in commercial cases on the [[Circuit court#Western Circuit|Western Circuit]] and was appointed as Recorder of [[Poole]] (a part-time Judgeship) in 1917. Goddard was appointed a [[King's Counsel]] in 1923, transferred to be Recorder of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1925, and eventually Recorder of [[Plymouth]] in 1928. He was elected a [[Bencher]] of his inns in 1929 and undertook work for the Barristers' Benevolent Association. In the general election of [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929]], Goddard agreed, against his better judgement, to contest the [[Kensington South (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington South]] constituency as an unofficial [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate. The sitting Conservative MP, [[William Davison, 1st Baron Broughshane|Sir William Davison]], had been a defendant in a divorce case, and a local committee thought the newly-enfranchised young women voters would refuse to support him. In the end, Goddard, running under the slogan "Purity Goddard", came last in the poll, winning only 15% of the vote, and the sitting member was returned.

==Judicial appointment==
On 5 April 1932 Goddard was appointed a full-time Judge of the [[Queen's Bench|King's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of England and Wales]], receiving a knighthood later that year. After only six years he was promoted again to be a [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Lord Justice of Appeal]]. Goddard was known for turning out well-argued and legally convincing judgments but he tended to give stiff sentences, especially when he was personally offended by the crime. After another six-year stint, he was appointed as a [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]] upon the death of [[Lord Atkin]] in 1944 and received as a [[Law lord]] a [[life peerage]]. He chose the title '''Baron Goddard''' of [[Aldbourne]] in the County of [[Wiltshire]].

==Lord Chief Justice== 
[[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Viscount Caldecote]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], suffered a [[stroke]] in 1945 and suddenly resigned, creating a vacancy at an inopportune moment. The tradition was for the appointment to be a political one, with the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] stepping up to take it. However, [[Hartley Shawcross]] was unwilling and considered too young. The appointment of a stop-gap candidate was expected. As Goddard explained in an August 1970 interview with [[David Yallop]]: "They had to give the job to somebody. There wasn't anybody else available, so [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] appointed me." The appointment, in January 1946, came at a time when the crime rate, and public concern over crime, were both increasing. Through his judgments, Goddard made it clear that he felt that stronger sentences were the way to tackle both. However, though a severe judge, Goddard was known to give young offenders probation rather than custodial sentences, if he believed that they would respond. Goddard was the first Lord Chief Justice to hold a law degree.

Despite his appointment as a [[stop-gap]], Goddard served twelve and a half years as Lord Chief Justice before stepping down in August 1958. 

==ID Cards==

In June 1951, Goddard ruled in ''Willcock v Muckle'' that giving police the power to demand an ID card "from all and sundry, for instance, from a lady who may leave her car outside a shop longer than she should", made people resentful of the police and "inclines them to obstruct the police instead of to assist them." Therefore, for the police to demand that individuals show their ID cards was unlawful because it was not relevant to the purposes for which the card was adopted. [[ID Cards]], in force since the start of [[World War II]], were abolished in February 1952.

==Craig and Bentley==
In December 1952 Goddard presided over the trial of Christopher Craig and [[Derek Bentley]], accused of the murder of PC Sidney Miles at a [[Croydon]] warehouse on 2 November 1952. 16-year-old Craig had apparently shot and killed PC Miles whilst resisting arrest on the roof of a factory he intended to break into. Bentley, who was 19 but of limited intelligence, had gone with him and was accused of urging Craig to shoot, having called out to him, "let him have it, Chris", when a policeman, [[Sergeant]] Frederick Fairfax, asked Craig for the gun. Fairfax was wounded by Craig. 

Lord Goddard directed the jury at the trial that, in law, Bentley was as guilty of firing the shot as Craig, even though there was contradictory evidence as to whether Bentley was aware that Craig was carrying a gun, and ballistics evidence doubting whether Craig could have hit PC Miles. During the trial, Goddard made no reference to Bentley's mental state, apart from when [[Christmas Humphreys]] asked Bentley to read a statement he had allegedly made to Police Officers after his arrest. Goddard told Humphreys that Bentley couldn't read. 

After 75 minutes of deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict in respect of both defendants. Craig was too young for a death sentence, but Bentley was not. Nevertheless, the jury had exceptionally returned a plea of [[mercy]] in favour of Bentley along with the guilty verdict. The decision passed to the [[Home Secretary]], [[David Maxwell Fyfe]], to decide whether clemency should be granted. After reading Home Office psychiatric reports and a petition signed by 200 MPs, he rejected the request and Bentley was hanged by [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on 28 January 1953. Craig was sent to prison and released in 1963 after serving ten-and-a-half years.

==Political context==

Goddard chose to continue his involvement with trials on the frontline, and opted to judge ordinary High Court cases as he was entitled to do. He presided over the 1946 [[libel]] trial at which [[Harold Laski]], Chairman of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], attempted unsuccessfully to sue the [[Daily Express]] for damages when it quoted him as saying that the party must take power "even if it means violence". 

On 13 June 1965, Goddard told Harold Laski's brother, [[Neville Laski]], that he was opposed to the jury's findings at his brother's libel action case, but that Harold Laski did not make a good witness in court. Goddard also said that he regretted the way in which he had conducted the trial.<ref>''The Times'', London, 11 June 1971.</ref>

In 1948 backbench pressure in the House of Commons forced through an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill to the effect that [[capital punishment]] should be suspended for five years and all death sentences automatically commuted to life imprisonment. The Bill also sought to abolish [[judicial corporal punishment]] in both its then forms, the [[cat-o'-nine-tails]] and the [[birching|birch]]. Goddard attacked the Bill in the House of Lords, making his [[maiden speech]], saying he was against the use of, and agreed with the abolition of, the "cat", but not birching, which he regarded as an effective punishment for young offenders. He also disagreed with the automatic commutation of death sentences, believing that it was contrary to the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]].

In a debate, he once referred to a case he had tried of an agricultural labourer who had assaulted a jeweller; Goddard gave him a short two months' imprisonment and twelve strokes of the birch because "I was not then depriving the country of the services of a good agricultural labourer over the harvest". The suspension of capital punishment was reversed by 181 to 28, and a further amendment to retain the birch was also passed (though the Lords were later forced to give way on this issue). As the crime rate continued to rise, Goddard became convinced that the Criminal Justice Act 1948 was responsible as it was a 'Gangster's Charter'. He held a strong belief that punishment had to be punitive in order to be effective, a view also shared at 
the time by [[Lord Denning]].

==Bodkin Adams case==
During the committal hearing for the suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] in January 1957, Goddard was seen dining with the defendant's probable gay lover, Sir [[Roland Gwynne]] (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929 to 1931), and ex-[[Attorney-General]] [[Hartley Shawcross]] at an hotel in [[Lewes]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen, Pamela V., ''A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams'', London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006. ISBN 1-904027-19-9</ref> Goddard had already appointed [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] to try Adams's case. Three months later, on 15 April, while the jury was out discussing the verdict on Adams's first charge of murder, Goddard telephoned to Devlin to urge him, if Adams were found not guilty, to grant Adams [[bail]] before he was tried on a second count of murder. Devlin was surprised since a person accused of murder had never been given bail before in British legal history.<ref>Devlin, Patrick, ''Easing the Passing'', 1985.</ref>

Adams was acquitted on the first count of murder, and the second charge was controversially dropped via a [[nolle prosequi]] - an act by the prosecution that was later called by Devlin an "abuse of process".<ref>Devlin.</ref> Adams was thought by pathologist [[Francis Camps]] to have murdered up to 163 patients.<ref name=Cullen/> Historian [[Pamela Cullen]] has suspected political interference.<ref name=Cullen/>

A month after Adams' trial, on 10 May 1957, Goddard heard a [[contempt of court]] case against Rolls House Publishing, publishers of [[Newsweek]], and chain of newsagents [[W.H. Smith]], who on 1 April during Adams's trial had respectively published and distributed an issue of the magazine containing two paragraphs of material "highly prejudicial to the accused", saying that Adams's victim count could be "as high as 400". Each company was fined <U+00A3>50. Goddard made no mention of his friendship with Roland Gwynne and the potential [[conflict of interest]].<ref name=Cullen/>

==Death penalty reaction==
It has been claimed that Goddard had a particular personal reaction to sentencing people to death. According to his valet, Goddard would have an [[orgasm]] during sentencing and his trousers had to be sent off to be cleaned as a result.<ref>Spencer, Colin (1995) ''Homosexuality - a history'' p.364 Fourth Estate. ISBN 1-85702-143-6</ref><ref>Bob Turney (2005), ''Wanted!'', p.95.</ref>
<ref>www.linkagenet.com/themes/deathpenalty.htm </ref>Another version suggests Goddard reacted in this way when sentencing young men to be birched.

==Retirement== 

In January [[1959]], five months after retiring as Lord Chief Justice, Goddard resumed regular judicial sittings in the House of Lords, continuing until [[1963]]. During this period he was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords in several controversial appeal cases, including ''Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith'' (1961), ''Sykes v Director of Public Prosecutions'' (1962), and ''Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher'' (1963). In April 1959 Goddard took the unprecedented step of returning to sit in the [[Court of Appeal]] for almost a year to help clear a backlog of appeal cases. In 1963 he fully retired from the law.
 
After retiring as Lord Chief Justice, Goddard continued to intervene occasionally in Lords debates and public speeches to put forward his views in favour of [[judicial corporal punishment]]. On 12 December 1960 he said in the House of Lords that the law was too much biased in favour of the criminal, as he was to assert to David Yallop nearly ten years later. Goddard also expressed his opposition to the legalisation of [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]] on 24 May 1965.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1965/may/24/sexual-offences-bill-hl-1#S5LV0266P0_19650524_HOL_69 House of Lords Hansard, 24 May 1965.]</ref> His last-ever speech in the House of Lords was in April 1968 at the age of 91, praising the City of London's law courts.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1968/apr/29/justices-of-the-peace-bill-1#S5LV0291P0_19680429_HOL_70 House of Lords Hansard, 29 April 1968.</ref>

==August 1970 Interview==

In the final interview he ever gave, in August [[1970]], Goddard told David Yallop that being Lord Chief Justice was not an easy job. When Yallop, who believed that Craig should have been imprisoned for [[manslaughter]] and Bentley thus cleared, asked Goddard about Derek Bentley's execution, he received the reply, "Yes, I thought that Bentley was going to be reprieved. He certainly should have been. There's no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Bentley should have been reprieved".<ref>''The The Times'', London, 10 June 1971.</ref> 

Goddard remarked that what troubled him was not Bentley being hanged when he was close to the minimum age, but the hard facts of the case, such as Bentley being innocent of the murder of PC Miles.<ref>''The Times'', London, 5 June 1971.</ref>

Goddard went on to slam David Maxwell Fyfe in the two hour interview, saying that "Bentley's execution was an act of supreme illogicality. I was never consulted over it (the decision and execution). In fact he (Maxwell Fyfe) never consulted anyone. The blame for Bentley's execution rests solely with Fyfe".<ref>David Yallop, ''To Encourage the Others''.</ref>. It was true that Maxwell Fyfe, who died in January [[1967]], was as much a supporter of the death penalty as Goddard. However, despite saying that Bentley should not have been executed, Goddard still expressed his strong support for the death penalty during the interview and asserted that the law was biased in favour of the criminal, not the victim. 

Whether Goddard felt this at the time of Bentley's execution, or if he was saying it in hindsight is a moot point. Goddard's claims in the 1970 interview were disputed by John Parris in his book "Scapegoat" (Duckworth), published in 1991. Parris, who died in 1996, was Craig's barrister at the 1952 trial, and wrote that Goddard told Maxwell Fyfe to ignore the jury's recommendation for mercy, and that Bentley must be hanged.

==Criticism==

On 30 July 1998, the Court of Appeal granted a posthumous acquittal to Derek Bentley on the basis of Goddard's misdirection to the jury which, according to [[Lord Bingham]], "must [...] have driven the jury to conclude that they had little choice but to convict." He added that the summing-up of the case was "such as to deny the appellant [Bentley] the fair trial which is the birthright of every British citizen".<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Bentley judge attacked | date=30 July 1998 | publisher=BBC News Online, London | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/142313.stm |}}</ref> 

Lord Bingham also, however, acknowledged that Goddard was "one of the outstanding criminal judges of the century", and underlined the change in social standards between 1953 and 1998.

After Goddard's death, he was attacked in the columns of ''[[The Times]]'' by [[Bernard Levin]], who described him as "a calamity" and accused him of vindictiveness and of being a malign influence on penal reform. Levin had also attacked Goddard when he retired as Lord Chief Justice thirteen years earlier in a [[Spectator]] article, saying he walked hand in hand with ignorance on one side of him and barbarism on the other. In ''The Times'' on 8 June 1971, Levin wrote (referring to Goddard's assertion in the August 1970 interview that he had been "very unhappy" about the result of the case) that "if Goddard did indeed claim this, it was a breathtaking piece of hypocrisy, in view of his conduct of the case".<ref>''The Times'', 8 June 1971.</ref> Afterwards Levin was blackballed by the [[Garrick Club]], a favourite resort of both lawyers and journalists, when his application for membership came up. 

To balance this criticism there is the appeal case of ''Daly v Cannon'', presided over by Lord Goddard in 1954. A [[rag and bone man]] in Ilford gave gifts to children to bring out recyclable material.  For fear of spreading disease it was made unlawful for rag and bone men to give 'articles' to children.  Mr Cannon circumvented this by giving the children goldfish by placing them in water filled jars that the children had to provide (and by doing so avoided the public health risk of handing them articles). Mr Daly, the Chief Sanitary Inspector for the local council, tried to prosecute him but the magistrates threw out the case on the grounds that a goldfish was not an article. Mr Daly appealed. Mr Cannon did not seem to be able to afford counsel for the appeal, so he sent a letter of apology to the Appeal Court in case he was found to have done something wrong. Lord Goddard agreed with the magistrates that a goldfish was not an article and dismissed the appeal. If he was vindictive, he did not show it in this case. This case was relatively trivial and did not involve capital punishment, however.

==Death==

Goddard died at his home in The Temple, London on 29 May 1971. He was cremated four days later, and when alive, he said he did not want any kind of memorial service, as they were "exercises in hypocrisy". He left over <U+00A3>100,000 in his will, published in July 1971.
