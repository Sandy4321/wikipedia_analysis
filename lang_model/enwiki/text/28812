The history of the emergence of Israelite [[monotheism]] and Yahweh worship has been the subject of scholarly study since at least the 19th century and [[Julius Wellhausen]]<U+2019>s ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels|Prolegomena to the History of Israel]]''; in the 20th century a formative work was [[William F.

== Name==
{{main|Tetragrammaton}}

The archaeological evidence suggests that the greater part of the population of Israel was of Canaanite origin; given this, one would expect the Israelites to worship a Canaanite god, but in the West Semitic world Yahweh was not worshiped outside Israel.<ref>Van der Toorn (1996), p.281</ref> ([[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] is the family of languages to which [[Hebrew]] belongs, along with Phoenician, Edomite, Moabite and a few others; they were similar enough to be mutually intelligible).<ref>Rendsberg (2003), pp.71-71</ref>

===Vocalisation===
[[Biblical Hebrew]] was written with consonants only, meaning that the name of God is written [[YHWH]]. The original pronunciation of this word was lost many centuries ago, but in the 19th century the eminent Hebrew scholar [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] (1786<U+2013>1842) suggested "Yahweh" as the most probable vocalization, based on his study of early Greek transcriptions, [[theophoric name]]s, and the reported pronunciation of the name in the Samaritan tradition.<ref name="Bartleby.com: Wilhelm Gesenius">[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ge/Gesenius.html Bartleby.com: Wilhelm Gesenius]</ref> This has become the conventional usage in Biblical scholarship.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

===Etymology===
Most scholars accept that YHWH is made up of Y, meaning "he", plus a form of HWY, the root of a group of words connected with "being" and "becoming".<ref>'It is generally accepted that this name is a ''yaqtil''-form of the Semitic stem ''HWY'' ('to be').'Stefan Paas, ''Creation and judgement: creation texts in some eighth century prophets,''BRILL, 2003 p.137</ref> [[Frank Moore Cross]] has advanced the hypothesis that the name Yahweh is an [[Hypocoristicon|abbreviation]], in which the [[theophoric]] element ''el'' has been dropped, thus giving ''yhwh-'l'' or "El-Yahweh",<ref>However, nowhere in the Old Testament has any trace been left behind on the complete name ''yhwh-'l''.' Stefan Paas, ibid. p.138.</ref> which would parallel "[[El-Shaddai]]" and "[[El-Elyon]]". [[El (god)|El]] was the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon, and El-YHWH is still attested as an [[epithet]], 'El, who shows himself' in a few places in the Old Testament (in Psalm 50:1, for example). It would have originated as a description of El's appearance and blessing: "El who shows himself".<ref>Paas (2003), pp.137<U+2013>139</ref> The author of {{Bibleref2|Exodus|3:13<U+2013>15}} gives a similar explanation: God, asked by Moses for his name, provides three names: "I Am That I Am", followed by "I Am", and finally "YHWH":
: {{lang|he|... <U+05D0><U+05D4><U+05D9><U+05D4> <U+05D0><U+05E9><U+05E8> <U+05D0><U+05D4><U+05D9><U+05D4> ... <U+05DB><U+05D4> <U+05EA><U+05D0><U+05DE><U+05E8> <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05DC> <U+05D0><U+05D4><U+05D9><U+05D4> <U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05D0><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DB><U+05DD>: ... <U+05D9><U+05D4><U+05D5><U+05D4> <U+05D0><U+05DC><U+05D4><U+05D9> <U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05EA><U+05D9><U+05DB><U+05DD> ... <U+05D6><U+05D4><U+05BE><U+05E9><U+05DE><U+05D9> <U+05DC><U+05E2><U+05DC><U+05DD> ... }}
: "[[I am that I am|I AM THAT I AM]] [...] Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. [...] YHWH, [[names of God in Judaism|God]] of your fathers, [...] this is My name for ever"{{Bibleref2c|Exod.|3:14<U+2013>15}}

As the origins of Yahweh seem to lie to the southeast of Israel, in Edom and Midian or even further south, an alternative explanation looks for its etymology in [[South Semitic]] languages like [[Arabic]] rather than in Hebrew, which is [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]]. One of the meanings of HWY in Arabic is connected with falling or causing to fall, leading to an interpretation of Yahweh as a storm god whose name means "He who causes to fall" (meaning rain, lightning, and his enemies) or "He storms". This also helps explain Yahweh's attributes as a storm god (he comes to rescue Israel surrounded by darkness and thick clouds, and the earth trembles, the clouds drop water, and the mountains quake at his appearance), and the way he appropriates attributes from the rival storm god Baal.<ref>Van der Toorn et. al. (1999), p.915-916</ref><ref>The storm-god in the ancient Near East - Page 275 Alberto Ravinell Whitney Green - 2003 "The Storm-God Yahweh within the Canaanite Milieu - In the absence of any significant river as a continuous water source, rainfall is the imperative agricultural necessity for coastal Syria and southern Canaan in particular, ."</ref>

Divine names, however, are often much older than the religions using them, and ideas about gods change over time; despite Exodus 14 it is fairly improbable that the authors of the Bible were aware of the meaning of the name Yahweh, and even an accurate knowledge of the origins of the name will not help understand the significance Yahweh held for them.<ref>Albertz (1994a), pp.50-51</ref>

== Yahweh in the Hebrew Bible ==
The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of the god Yahweh comes from the [[Hebrew Bible]] (more or less identical with the Christian [[Old Testament]]). This consists of 24 books ranging in subject matter from history to poetry to philosophical meditation, and in time from perhaps the 10th century to the 2nd century BCE. Almost every book of the Bible mentions Yahweh. Other names for God are also used, notably [[Elohim]], but in every case these are simply alternatives for Yahweh.

== History of Yahweh-worship ==
{{See also|Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|}}
===Origin of Yahweh and the Kenite hypothesis===
"Israel" is a term with many meanings, but in this section it means the ethnic group who emerged in the Canaanite hill country in the Iron Age I period (1200-1000&nbsp;BCE). The Bible tells a story in which Israel escaped from Egypt, met Yahweh on a mountain-top in the wilderness, agreed to become his chosen people, and conquered [[Canaan]] with his help. The view of modern scholarship is quite different: the archaeological evidence points to an Israelite community arising peacefully and internally in the highlands of Canaan.<ref>Gnuse, p.31</ref>

If Yahweh was not a Canaanite god, this raises the question of where he originated and how he became the national god of Israel and Judah in Iron Age II (1000-586). The first probable record of his name is in two Egyptian inscriptions from the 14th and 13th centuries, as a place-name in the region of Edom associated with [[Shashu]]-Bedouins". According to a widely accepted theory (the "Kenite hypothesis"), this god could have been brought north to the Canaanite hill country and the early Israelites by migratory Edomite desert tribes, of whom the [[Kenites]] were one.<ref>Van der Toorn et. al. (1999), pp.911-915</ref>

===Yahweh as national God of Israel===
In Iron Age I the religious life of ordinary Israelites, like that of other peoples throughout the Ancient Near East, was organised around the family-based cult of the ancestors and devotion to a local god, the "god of the fathers".<ref>Van der Toorn (1996), p.4</ref> According to the Bible the first king, Saul, was a [[Gibeonite]], a tribe with its roots in Edom, and in order to unify the new kingdom and cement his own authority Saul promoted his own god, Yahweh, as god of the kingdom;<ref>Van der Toorn (1996), pp.266-267</ref> previously, each extended family or clan was the "people" of a particular god, but now the entire Israelite community became the "people of Yahweh".<ref>Van der Toorn (1996), p.275</ref> 

Yahweh was the God of the northern kingdom of Israel by at least the early 9th century, and this is confirmed by an inscription from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] which refers to Yahweh of Samaria, probably meaning the kingdom rather than the city.<ref>Van der Toorn (1996), p.278</ref> 

More than forty inscriptions mentioning Yahweh, Yahu or Yah have been discovered, all tending to reinforce the centrality of Yahweh to Israelite religion. The inscriptions include blessings, oaths, salutations, votive offerings, seals and prayers. No other gods or goddesses are unambiguously recorded except for contentious references to [[Asherah]], who might be a goddess and Yahweh's consort, or possibly some kind of cult object. A fragment from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] (9th/8th centuries) mentions [[Baal]] in association with Yahweh, but in this case the word might simply mean "Lord" (the literal meaning of "baal").<ref>Miller (2000), pp.40-41</ref>

A 10th century cult stand from [[Taanach]] (a town in Northern Israel, near [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]) shows, among other images, two winged sphinxes with an empty space between them, possibly meant to represent Yahweh between the [[cherubim]]. A horse or bull figure on the same stand, topped by a solar disk, may represent either Yahweh or Baal, and a stylised tree and female figures are testimony to the presence of goddesses (possibly [[Asherah]]) in the pantheon.<ref>Miller (2000), pp.41-44</ref>

===History of Yahwism===
Archaeologists and historical scholars use a variety of ways to organize and interpret the available iconographic and textual information. William G. Dever contrasts "official religion/state religion/book religion" of the elite with <U+201C>folk religion<U+201D> of the masses.<ref>William G. Dever, Did God Have A Wife?: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel, Eerdmans Publishing (2005) p. 5</ref> Rainer Albertz contrasts "official religion" with "family religion", "personal piety", and "internal religious pluralism".<ref>Rainer Albertz, History of Israelite Religion Vol. 1, Westminster Jonk Knox Press (1994) p. 19</ref> Jacques Berlinerblau analyzes the evidence in terms of "official religion" and "popular religion" in ancient Israel.<ref>Jacques Berlinerblau, Official Religion and Popular Religion in Pre-Exilic Ancient Israel.</ref>

===Tension between monotheism and polytheism among the Israelites===
Tension between monotheism and polytheism among the Israelites is documented as early as the account of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. [[Aaron]]'s statement "These are your gods", in the plural, when only one [[golden calf]] was molded, looks forward to the two [[golden calves]] of [[Jereboam]].<ref>Barry L. Bandstra ''Reading the Old Testament: an introduction to the Hebrew Bible p142 2008 "The negative way in which the golden calf is viewed in Exodus is a veiled prophetic condemnation of Jeroboam's golden calf worship centers. The statement, "These are your gods," in the plural, when only one calf was molded, ..."</ref>

Both the archaeological evidence and the Biblical texts document tensions between groups comfortable with the worship of Yahweh alongside local deities such as Asherah and Baal and those insistent on worship of Yahweh alone during the monarchal period ([[1 Kings]] 18, [[Jeremiah]] 2)<ref name="Othmar Keel 1998">Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S. Smith, The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel<U+2019>s Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts, Oxford University Press (2001)</ref> The [[Deuteronomy|Deuteronomistic]] source gives evidence of a strong monotheistic party during the reign of king Josiah during the late 7th century BCE, but the strength and prevalence of earlier monotheistic worship of Yahweh is widely debated based on interpretations of how much of the Deuteronomistic history is accurately based on earlier sources, and how much has been re-worked by Deuteronomistic redactors to bolster their theological views.<ref>Steven L. McKenzie, Deuteronomistic History, The Anchor Bible Dictionary Vol. 2, Doubleday (1992), pp. 160<U+2013>168; Mark S.

==Patrick D. Miller's schema: orthodox, heterodox and syncretistic Yahwism==
Patrick D. Miller has distinguished three broad categories of Yahwism, orthodox, heterodox, and syncretistic.<ref>Miller (2000), pp.46<U+2013>62</ref> Orthodox Yahwism demanded the exclusive worship of Yahweh (although without denying the existence of other gods). The powers of blessing (health, wealth, continuity, fertility) and salvation (forgiveness, victory, deliverance from oppression and threat) resided fully in Yahweh, and his will was communicated via oracle and prophetic vision or audition. [[Divination]], soothsaying, and [[necromancy]] were prohibited. The individual or community could cry out to Yahweh and would receive a divine response, mediated by priestly or prophetic figures.<ref>Patrick D Miller, The Religion of Ancient Israel, Westminster John Knox Press (2000) p. 48</ref>

Sanctuaries were erected in various places and were used to express devotion to Yahweh by means of sacrifice, festival meals and celebrations, prayer, and praise. Toward the end of the seventh century (BCE) in Judah, worship of Yahweh was restricted to the temple in Jerusalem, while the major sanctuaries in the northern kingdom were at Bethel (near the southern border) and Dan (in the north). Certain times were set for the gathering of the people to celebrate the gifts of Yahweh and the deity<U+2019>s acts of deliverance and redemption.<ref>Miller (2000), pp.48<U+2013>50</ref>

Everything in the moral realm was understood as a part of relation to Yahweh as a manifestation of holiness. Family relationships and the welfare of the weaker members of society were protected by divine law, and purity of conduct, dress, food, etc. were regulated. Religious leadership resided in priests who were associated with sanctuaries, and also in prophets, who were bearers of divine oracles. In the political sphere the king was understood as the appointee and agent of Yahweh.<ref>Patrick D Miller, The Religion of Ancient Israel, Westminster John Knox Press (2000) pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref>

Heterodox Yahwism is described by Miller as a mixture of elements of orthodox Yahwism with particular practices that conflicted with orthodox Yahwism or were not customarily a part of it. For example, heterodox Yahwism included the presence of cult objects rejected in by orthodox expressions, such as the [[Asherah]], figurines of various sorts (females, horses and riders, animals and birds, and the calves or bulls of the Northern Kingdom. The "high places" as centers of worship seems to have moved from an acceptable place within Yahwism to an increasingly condemned status in official and orthodox circles. Efforts to know the future or the will of the deity could also be understood as heterodox if they went outside the boundaries of orthodox Yahwism, and even commonly accepted revelatory mechanism such as dreams could be condemned if the resulting message was perceived as false. Consulting mediums, wizards, and diviners was often employed by heterodox Yahwists.<ref>Miller (2000), pp.52<U+2013>56</ref>

Syncretism covers the worship of Baal, the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars), the "Queen of Heaven" and other deities as well as practices such as child sacrifice: "Other gods were invoked and serviced in time of need or blessing and provision for life when the worship of Yahweh seemed inadequate for those purposes."<ref>Miller (2000), pp.58<U+2013>59</ref>

== Ancient Israel and Judah ==

It has traditionally been believed that [[monotheism]] was part of Israel's original covenant with Yahweh on [[Mount Sinai]], and the idolatry criticized by the prophets was due to Israel's backsliding.<ref>Yehezkel Kaufmann, "The Religion of Israel, From its Beginnings to the Babylonian Exile", translated and abridged by Moshe Greenberg (University of Chicago Press, 1960)</ref> But during the 20th century it became increasingly recognised that the Bible's presentation raises a number of questions: Why do the Ten Commandments declare that there should be no other gods "before Me" (Yahweh), if there are no other gods at all? Why do the Israelites sing at the crossing of the Red Sea that "there is no god like you, O Yahweh",{{Bibleref2c|Ex|15:11}} implying that other gods exist? These observations eventually overthrew the belief that Israel had always worshipped no other god but Yahweh.<ref>Friedman, Richard E. ''Who Wrote the Bible?'' (Harper & Row, 1987)</ref>

Evidence of Israelite worship of Canaanite gods appears both in the Bible and the archaeological record. Respectful references to the goddess [[Asherah]] or her symbol, for example, as part of the worship of Yahweh, are found in the eighth century inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom, and references to the Canaanite gods [[Resheph]] and [[Deber]] appear without criticism in the original Jewish text of {{Bibleref2|Habakkuk|3:5}}. While traditionally these words have been understood to be either Jewish words whose meaning has been derived from characteristics of these Canaanite deities<ref>G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, and Heinz-Josef Fabry, eds., ''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament''. Vol. 14. s.v. "Resep."</ref> or references to demons,<ref>Berakhot 5a</ref> some interpret these as evidence of Israelite recognition of these gods as part of the military retinue of Yahweh.<ref>Mark S. Smith, ''The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polythesistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts'' (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 67-68.</ref> The "host of heaven" is also mentioned without criticism in {{Bibleref2|1_Kings|22:19}} and {{Bibleref2|Zephaniah|1:5}}. Though the "host of heaven" has traditionally been interpreted as either the stars/heavenly bodies or the host of angels/heavenly spirits depending on the context,<ref>Gustav Friedrich Oehler, Theology of the Old Testament, 2nd ed. trans. George E. Day (New York: Funk & Wagnalls Publishers, 1884), 437-443.</ref> some again have interpreted this term to refer to a pantheon of Israelite gods.<ref>Mark S. Smith, ''The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polythesistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts'' (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 47-155.</ref> The god El is also continually identified with Yahweh.<ref>Smith, Mark S. "Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century" (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)</ref>

Israel inherited polytheism from late first-millennium Canaan, and Canaanite religion in turn had its roots in the religion of second-millennium [[Ugarit]].<ref name="Toorn 1999">Karel van der Toorn, editor, "Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible" (second edition, Eerdmans, 1999)</ref> In the 2nd millennium, polytheism was expressed through the concepts of the divine council and the divine family, a single entity with four levels: the chief god and his wife (El and Asherah); the seventy divine children or "stars of El" (including Baal, Astarte, Anat, probably Resheph, as well as the sun-goddess Shapshu and the moon-god Yerak); the head helper of the divine household, Kothar wa-Hasis; and the servants of the divine household, including the messenger-gods who would later appear as the "angels" of the Hebrew Bible.<ref>Robert Karl Gnuse, "No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel" (Sheffield Academic Press, 1997)</ref>

In the earliest stage Yahweh was one of the seventy children of El, each of whom was the patron deity of one of the seventy nations. This is illustrated by the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint texts of Deuteronomy 32:8<U+2013>9, in which El, as the head of the divine assembly, gives each member of the divine family a nation of his own, "according to the number of the divine sons": Israel is the portion of Yahweh.<ref>Meindert Djikstra, "El the God of Israel, Israel the People of YHWH: On the Origins of Ancient Israelite Yahwism" (in "Only One God? Monotheism in Ancient Israel and the Veneration of the Goddess Asherah", ed.

Between the eighth to the sixth centuries El became identified with Yahweh, Yahweh-El became the husband of the goddess Asherah, and the other gods and the divine messengers gradually became mere expressions of Yahweh's power.<ref>Karel van der Toorn, "Goddesses in Early Israelite Religion in Ancient Goddesses: the Myths and the Evidence" (editors Lucy Goodison and Christine Morris, University of Wisconsin Press, 1998)</ref> Yahweh is cast in the role of the Divine King ruling over all the other deities, as in Psalm 29:2, where the "sons of God" are called upon to worship Yahweh; and as Ezekiel 8-10 suggests, the Temple itself became Yahweh's palace, populated by those in his retinue.<ref name="Toorn 1999" />

It is in this period that the earliest clear monotheistic statements appear in the Bible, for example in the apparently seventh-century Deuteronomy 4:35, 39, 1 Samuel 2:2, 2 Samuel 7:22, 2 Kings 19:15, 19 (= Isaiah 37:16, 20), and Jeremiah 16:19, 20 and the sixth-century portion of Isaiah 43:10<U+2013>11, 44:6, 8, 45:5<U+2013>7, 14, 18, 21, and 46:9.<ref>Ziony Zevit, "The Religions of Ancient Israel: A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches (Continuum, 2001)</ref> Because many of the passages involved appear in works associated with either Deuteronomy, the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua through Kings) or in Jeremiah, most recent scholarly treatments have suggested that a Deuteronomistic movement of this period developed the idea of monotheism as a response to the religious issues of the time.<ref name="Mark S 2001">Mark S.Smith, "Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century" (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)</ref>

The first factor behind this development involves changes in Israel's social structure. At Ugarit, social identity was strongest at the level of the family: legal documents, for example, were often made between the sons of one family and the sons of another. Ugarit's religion, with its divine family headed by El and Asherah, mirrored this human reality.<ref>Mark S. Smith and Patrick D Miller, "The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel" (Harper & Row, 1990)</ref> The same was true in ancient Israel through most of the monarchy <U+2013> for example, the story of Achan in Joshua 8 suggests an extended family as the major social unit. However, the family lineages went through traumatic changes beginning in the eighth century due to major social stratification, followed by Assyrian incursions. In the seventh and sixth centuries, we begin to see expressions of individual identity (Deuteronomy 26:16; Jeremiah 31:29<U+2013>30; Ezekiel 18). A culture with a diminished lineage system, deteriorating over a long period from the ninth or eighth century onward, less embedded in traditional family patrimonies, might be more predisposed both to hold the individual accountable for his behavior, and to see an individual deity accountable for the cosmos. In short, the rise of the individual as the basic social unit led to the rise of a single god replacing a divine family.<ref>Mark S. Smith, "Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century" (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)</ref>

The second major factor was the rise of the neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian empires. As long as Israel was, from its own perspective, part of a community of similar small nations, it made sense to see the Israelite pantheon on par with the other nations, each one with its own patron god <U+2013> the picture described with Deuteronomy 32:8<U+2013>9. The assumption behind this worldview was that each nation was as powerful as its patron god.<ref>William G. Dever, "Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient ISrael" (Eerdman's, 2005)</ref> However, the neo-Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in ca. 722 challenged this, for if the neo-Assyrian empire were so powerful, so must be its god; and conversely, if Israel could be conquered (and later Judah, c. 586), it implied that Yahweh in turn was a minor divinity. The crisis was met by separating the heavenly power and earthly kingdoms. Even though Assyria and Babylon were so powerful, the new monotheistic thinking in Israel reasoned, this did not mean that the god of Israel and Judah was weak. Assyria had not succeeded because of the power of its god [[Marduk]]; it was Yahweh who was using Assyria to punish and purify the one nation which Yahweh had chosen.<ref name="Mark S 2001" />

By the post-Exilic period, full monotheism had emerged: Yahweh was the sole God, not just of Israel, but of the whole world. If the nations were tools of Yahweh, then the new king who would come to redeem Israel might not be a Judean as taught in older literature (e.g. Psalm 2). Now, even a foreigner such as Cyrus the Persian could serve as the Lord's anointed (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1). One god stood behind all the world's history.<ref name="Mark S 2001" />

== Use of "Yahweh" in contemporary religion ==
===Modern Judaism===
In  modern Judaism, the Tetragrammaton is conventionally substituted by [[Adonai]] ("my Lord") when reading the text of the Bible. Jews ceased to pronounce the name in the [[intertestamental period]], replacing it with the common noun [[Elohim]], <U+201C>the God<U+201D>, to demonstrate the universal sovereignty of Israel's deity over all others. At the same time, the divine name was increasingly regarded as too sacred to be uttered, and was replaced in spoken ritual by the word [[Adonai]] (<U+201C>My Lord<U+201D>), or with [[haShem]] (<U+201C>the Name<U+201D>) in everyday speech,<ref>"Yahweh." ''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions.'' Web: 7 Oct 2010. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&pg=PA1152&lpg=PA1152&dq=universal+sovereignty+of+Israel's+God+over+all+others&source=bl&ots=CFVaLfvTDc&sig=qhql2pA8F0dWS-iBmrQwREpWQ4Y&hl=en&ei=sWGuTLOOJsedOoGFwYsG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&sqi=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=universal%20sovereignty%20of%20Israel's%20God%20over%20all%20others&f=false]</ref> see [[Names of God in Judaism]] for details.

===Roman Catholic church===
Traditionally in both Latin and vernacular worship "Lord" was used, following the Greek New Testament and Septuagint. Although the rendering of the Tetragrammaton as "Yahweh" is found in the Old Testament of versions such as the Roman Catholic [[Jerusalem Bible]], and [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the liturgical use of ''Yahweh'' in vernarcular worship was reprobated by the Vatican in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| title = CNS STORY: No 'Yahweh' in songs, prayers at Catholic Masses, Vatican rules | accessdate = 2009<U+2013>07<U+2013>29 | url = http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804119.htm }}</ref> The [[Holy See|Vatican]] [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] direction that the word "Lord" be used instead of Yahweh in English-language worship, and that the local equivalent to the Latin ''[[dominus]]'' (Lord, Master) be used in all vernacular worship,<ref>''[[Liturgiam authenticam]]''</ref> was based on the understanding that Jews at the time of Christ (compare the [[Septuagint]] use of ''[[kyrios|kurios]]'', Greek for "Lord") and also early Christians substituted other words rather than pronounce the name.<ref>William C. Graham ''A Catholic Handbook: Essentials for the 21st Century'' 2010 p51</ref>

===Protestantism===
Bible scholar and author [[Charles Caldwell Ryrie|Charles Ryrie]], author of the ''Ryrie Study Bible,''<ref>''Ryrie Study Bible NAS''. Moody Publishers; Expanded edition (February 9, 1995). ISBN 978-0802438669</ref>  says the name <U+201C>Yahweh<U+201D> appears 6,823 times in the Old Testament, and also many times in the New Testament when it directly quotes or paraphrases passages from the Old Testament containing God<U+2019>s name. He writes that the name "Yahweh" is particularly associated with God's holiness,{{Bibleref2c|Lev|11:44,45}} his hatred of sin {{Bibleref2c|Gen|6:3<U+2013>7}} and his provision of redemption.{{Bibleref2c|Isa|53:1,5,6,10}} It may be that the contemporary translations of the Bible do not use "Yahweh" out of respect for the traditional Jewish reverence for this name.<ref>Gilligan, Michael.  "Use of Yahweh in Church Songs." American Catholic Press. Web: 7 Oct 2010 <http://www.americancatholicpress.org/Father_Gilligan_Yahweh.html></ref>

Almost all Bibles ([[KJV]], [[Douay-Rheims Bible|DRC]], [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]], [[English Standard Version|ESV]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[New International Version|NIV]], [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|NJPS]], [[NRSV]], [[New American Bible|NAB]], [[NABRE]], [[Confraternity Bible|CCD]], [[New English Bible|NEB]], [[Revised English Bible|REB]], [[NKJV]], etc.), except for the [[Jerusalem Bible]] and [[New Jerusalem Bible]], and a few uncommon translations such as the [[Emphasized Bible|Rotherham Emphasized Bible]], substitute the titles "Lord" and "God" in [[small caps]] ({{smallcaps|Lord, God}}) where the [[tetragrammaton]] appears in the [[Masoretic text|Hebrew]]. The [[American Standard Version]] of 1901, a revision of the [[English Revised Version]] of 1881, derived from the King James Version, consistently used the rendering [[Jehovah]]. The name "Yahweh" does not appear in the text of most popular English Bible translations on the market today. Jewish Bible scholars introduced this tradition in the mid-2nd century BC Septuagint translation, and it has continued since that time. In 1611, the inaugural edition of the King James Bible editors did not include the name <U+201D>Yahweh,<U+201D> not being aware of the rendering, though ''Jehovah'' does appear several times.

There are some contemporary instances where the spelling ''Yahweh'' has come into religious use. The [[Sacred Name Movement]] is a small Christian movement, active since the 1930s, which propagates the use of the name ''Yahweh'' in Bible translations and in liturgy. "[[Sacred Name Bibles]]" are Bibles which render the Tetragrammaton by transliteration (or iconographically by inserting Hebrew script in the translation). An early such Bible was [[Rotherham's Emphasized Bible]] of 1902. The Jehovah's Witness [[New World Translation]] consistently uses "Jehovah", and even incorrectly inserts it in to the New Testament in place of the Greek "kurios" in many places.<ref>''The Jehovah's Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal.''
