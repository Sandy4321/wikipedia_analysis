'''''Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous''''' is the [[debut album]] of American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Big L]], released March 28, 1995 on [[Columbia Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at Powerplay Studios in Queens, New York during 1994 to 1995. The title originates from the television series, ''[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]''. [[Buckwild]], Craig Boogie, [[Kid Capri]], [[Lord Finesse]], as well as [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz]] produced the album. The album produced four singles, but only two charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' charts. ''Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous'' had slight success upon release, peaking at 149 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The album initially received moderate reviews from critics. The album was the only studio album to be released during Big L's lifetime.

==Background==
Born in [[Harlem, New York]], Big L grew up with [[Cam'ron]]. With [[Lord Finesse]] he recorded a number of tracks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Big-L-Biography/6AC83DFD0618696E4825698C002EA5CD | title=Big L Biography | publisher=Sing 365 | accessdate=June 25, 2011}}</ref> Big L began rhyming in 1990 and his first professional appearance came on the B-side of "Party Over Here" by Lord Finesse in 1992. Around this time, L joined Lord Finesse's [[Bronx]]-based hip hop collective [[Diggin' in the Crates Crew]] (D.I.T.C.).  The group consisted of [[Lord Finesse]], [[Diamond D]], [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Buckwild]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]] He founded Harlem rap group [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]] with fellow aspiring MC's [[Cam'ron|Killa Cam]], [[Ma$e|Murda Mase]], and Killa Cam's cousin Bloodshed; when the latter died in a car accident in 1997, the group folded.

In 1993, Big L submitted a four track [[cassette tape]] to [[Columbia Records]], which signed him later on. The album title is a play on the 1984-95 Television series, ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous''.

==Recording, production==
Recording for ''Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous'' took place mainly at Powerplay Studios ([[Queens, New York]]);<ref name=lpdiscogs>{{cite web|title=Big L - Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Big-L-Lifestylez-Ov-Da-Poor-Dangerous/release/1145483|work=''[[Discogs]]''|publisher=Zinc Media|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref> the songs "[[Put It On]]" and "Danger Zone" were recorded at Unique Studios ([[New York City, New York]])<ref name=lpdiscogs /> and the songs "[[M.V.P. (song)|M.V.P.]]" and "Street Struck" were recorded at Chung King Studios (New York City, New York).<ref name=lpdiscogs /> James Niedermeyer worked with [[Big L]] on the album, heavily influencing lyrics on songs such as "Danger Zone" and "All Black". 

''Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous'' was produced by mainly members of Big L's group, [[Diggin' in the Crates Crew]]: [[Buckwild]], [[Lord Finesse]] (who produced most of the album), and Showbiz. Craig Boogie as well as [[Kid Capri]] (who was often referred to as an honorary member of D.I.T.C.<ref name=dxinter />) also helped with the production of the album.

==Release, promotion, marketing==
''Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous'' was released on March 18, 1995. Prior to the release, [[Big L]], under [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], released a promotional cassette tape in 1994 consisting of four tracks. These tracks did not make the final album though.

==Musical style, writing, composition==

In a 2010 interview with HipHop DX, to commemorate the album's 15th year anniversary and its re-issue by Traffic Entertainment, [[Lord Finesse]] discussed the making of the album.<ref name=dxinter>{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Paul|title=Lord Finesse Breaks Down Big L's "Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous"|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/editorials/id.1577/title.lord-finesse-breaks-down-big-ls-lifestylez-ov-da-poor-dangerous|publisher=Hip Hop DX|accessdate=April 25 2011|date=July 30, 2010}}</ref> 

Concerning "[[Put It On]]", he stated: 
<blockquote>
[Columbia Records] wanted something with a hook that would be kinda catchy, and something they could get radio play with. Like, everything [L] did was dark, and it was gangsta, and it was . . . what was the [popular style at the time]? Horror-core. So they needed something bright, something friendly. And "Put It On" just matched everything perfect."
</blockquote>

Concerning "[[M.V.P. (song)|M.V.P.]]", he stated:
<blockquote>
That song came about because L wanted a commercial, R&B loop that everybody could recognize. And me remembering that [DeBarge] record, and also remembering how Kid Capri used it way back when he did <U+2013> I forgot which record he did, but he had that [song], and I<U+2019>m like, "Damn, well maybe we could reinvent that right there." And L heard the loop and was like, "Yeah, that<U+2019>s it!" But, [with] Diggin<U+2019>, we had to have the right drums, the right everything [to go with a sample], and we dressed it up in a way where we tried to keep it Hip Hop.
</blockquote>

Concerning "8 Iz Enuff", he said:
<blockquote>
With that [song] L just thought he had to do a track with the rappers from his hood. And he definitely wanted to put on [those particular emcees]<U+2026> We looking like, "How you gonna put eight niggas on one track?" [And he was like], "Don<U+2019>t worry, I got this."</blockquote>

Speaking about "Danger Zone", he said:
<blockquote>
At the time it was somebody by the name of David Kahne [working as L<U+2019>s A&R at Columbia]. He was like the person who was responsible for getting L signed, and he loved all that devil<U+2019>s son shit. [Says in nasally white-guy voice] "Oh wow, this is great!" It<U+2019>s like, "Are you serious?" Because we had to make [L] change a line in "Devil<U+2019>s Son" because it was [like], "You<U+2019>re too out-of-order." What was the line . . . "I<U+2019>m killin<U+2019> chumps for the cheapest price / I<U+2019>m rollin<U+2019> with Satan," [and instead of then saying "not Jesus Christ"] it was "F Jesus Christ." But we made him change it to "Not Jesus Christ." [We were] like, "Yo, what the fuck are you doing?!"
</blockquote>

Commenting on "Street Struck", he said:
<blockquote>
That was Sony [that wanted him to make something more positive]. [They were like], "You so dark on this album, we need something positive we can push. This album is too dark: you got "All Black", you got "Danger Zone", you done came out with "Devil<U+2019>s Son". We really don<U+2019>t wanna push that as your image. You have to do something that<U+2019>s gonna balance it." And that<U+2019>s [when] we started doing more conceptual, conscious songs like "Fed Up Wit The Bullshit", "Street Struck", and "M.V.P." and "Put It On."
</blockquote>
