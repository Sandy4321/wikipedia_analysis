'''Betty Hutton''', (born '''Elizabeth June Thornburg''' on [[February 26]], [[1921]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]) is a former [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[singer]]. 

Raised by a single mother, Hutton (along with her sister, [[Marion Hutton]]) started singing in the family's [[speakeasy]] at age 3. Related troubles with the police kept the family on the move, and eventually they moved to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. When interviewed  as an established star appearing at the premiere of ''[[Let's Dance]]'' ([[1950 in film|1950]]), her mother (arriving with her, and following a police escort) commented "This time the police were in front of us." Hutton sang in several local bands as a teenager, and at one point visited [[New York City]] hoping to perform on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where she was rejected.

A few years later, she was scouted by orchestra leader [[Vincent Lopez]], who gave Hutton her entry into entertainment. In 1939 she appeared in several musical shorts for [[Warner Bros.]], and appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Panama Hattie]]'' and ''Two for the Show'', both produced by [[Buddy DeSylva]]. 

When DeSylva became a producer at [[Paramount Pictures]], Hutton was signed to starring role in ''[[The Fleet's In]]'' in 1942. She made 14 films in 11 years during the 1940s and early [[1950s]], including ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)#1950 MGM film version|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' for [[MGM]], which hired Hutton to replace an exhausted [[Judy Garland]] in the role of [[Annie Oakley]]. The film and the leading role, retooled for Hutton, was a smash hit, with the biggest critical praise going to Betty, but Hutton, like her closest movie musical rival -- Garland -- was earning a reputation for being extremely difficult.

In 1942, she signed with [[Capitol Records]], one of the first artists to do so, but was unhappy with their management, and then signed with [[RCA Victor]]. Her time as a [[Hollywood]] star came to an end due to contract disagreements with Paramount following ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' ([[1952 in film|1952]]) and ''[[Somebody Loves Me]]'' (1952), a biopic of singer Blossom Seeley.

Hutton worked in radio, appeared in [[Las Vegas]] and in nightclubs, then tried her luck on the new medium of [[television]]. An original musical TV "spectacular" written especially for Hutton,  ''Satin 'n Spurs'' (1954), was an enormous flop with the public and critics. [[Desilu]] took a chance on Betty and in 1959 gave her a sitcom ''The Betty Hutton Show'', which quickly faded. Her last TV outing was a brief guest appearance in 1975 on ''[[Baretta]]''.  

In 1967, she was signed to star in two low-budget [[western films|Westerns]] for Paramount, but was fired shortly after the projects began. Afterwards, Hutton had trouble with alcohol and substance abuse, eventually attempting suicide after losing her singing voice in 1970, and having a [[nervous breakdown]]. She divorced her husband jazz trumpeter [[Pete Candoli]] and declared herself bankrupt. However, after regaining control of her life through a church, she converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and went on to teach acting and to cook at a rectory in Rhode Island.

She replaced [[Dorothy Loudon]] as the evil Miss Hannigan in ''[[Annie]]'' on Broadway for a limited run in 1980. Her last known performance in any medium was on ''Jukebox Saturday Night,'' which aired on PBS in 1983. She was interviewed by [[Robert Osborne]] for [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]'s "Private Screenings" in [[April 2000]]. Married four times with three daughters, as of 2006, Hutton resides near [[Palm Springs, California]].
