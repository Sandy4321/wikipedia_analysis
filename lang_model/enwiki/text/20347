==General background==

The central [[protagonist]], [[Munna Bhai]], meets the ghost of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and learns the principles of [[Gandhian]] philosophy in this second film of the ''Munna Bhai'' series (the first was ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]''). Each installment of the series features the central characters ([[Munna Bhai]] portrayed by [[Sanjay Dutt]] and [[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]] portrayed by [[Arshad Warsi]]) in a story which is comprehensive unto itself and is not continued or referred to in another film in the series. 

The series has been likened to [[Laurel and Hardy]] films by some.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006090103120100.htm&date=2006/09/01/&prd=fr&| title=  Our answer to Laurel and Hardy?| publisher=hinduonnet.com| date=| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> Others have negated this comparison, stating that the series is more akin to the ''[[Road to...]]'' "buddy films" of [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Piroj| last=Wadia| url=http://www.screenindia.com/fullstory.php?content_id=13698| title=Carry on with Munnabhai| publisher=screenindia.com| date=| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> The series also stars [[Boman Irani]] as the [[antagonist]] of each film and [[Jimmy Shergill]] as a secondary character who is rescued by Munna Bhai. In addition, several actors from ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' have minor roles in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'', such as Kurush Deboo who portrayed Dr. Rustam Pavri in the first film. 

[[Chiranjeevi]], who was the lead in ''[[Shankar Dada MBBS]]'' (the remake of ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]''), has confirmed that he will star in the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] remake of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' entitled ''[[Shankar Dada Zindabad]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14333821| title=Prabhu Deva to direct Chiranjeevi| publisher=sify.com| date=2006-11-20| accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoilers}}
''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' revolves around the comic adventures of [[Munna Bhai]], a ''[[Tapori (word)|Tapori]]'' in the [[Mumbai underworld]]  (the word ''bhai'' can mean either "gangster" or "brother" in [[Bambaiya Hindi]], a colloquial version of [[Hindi]] spoken in [[Mumbai]]) portrayed by [[Bollywood]] superstar [[Sanjay Dutt]], and his [[sidekick]]  [[Circuit (film character)|Circuit]] ([[Arshad Warsi]]). Munna is in love with the voice of Jhanvi ([[Vidya Balan]]), a [[radio jockey]] and devises a plan to meet her when she announces a contest on the life and beliefs of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] set for [[October 2]]. Munna Bhai (who does not know the significance of this date) is informed by Circuit that October 2 is  "[[Prohibition#South Asia|Dry day]]" (since alcoholic drinks are not sold on this day). Upon further investigation, Circuit discovers that "Dry Day" is observed because of [[Gandhi Jayanti]], a national holiday which celebrates the birthday of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (or "Bapu," as he is referred to in the film). 

Circuit helps Munna win the contest by [[kidnap]]ping and then [[bribery|bribing]] a group of professors. As the winner, Munna is granted an interview with Jhanvi. He lies to her, presenting himself as a professor of [[History of India|history]] and a Gandhi specialist. Jhanvi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of [[senior citizen]]s who live in her home, called the ''Second Innings House''. In order to prepare for this event, Munna engages in a period of intense study of the life and works of Gandhi. It is during this period that the image of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] appears offering help and advice to Munna. Indeed, Gandhi continues to appear each time Munna sings ''[[Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram]]'' (a song often sung in Gandhi's memory).

Lucky Singh ([[Boman Irani]]), an unscrupulous [[businessman]] who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct "[[underworld]]" activities, is negotiating his daughter Simran's ([[Dia Mirza]]) marriage to the son of a very wealthy man named Kkhurana ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]). Lucky wishes to present the ''Second Innings House'' as a wedding present to Kkhurana. Thus, he sends Munna, Jhanvi, and the elder residents of the house on a holiday in [[Goa]] and orders Circuit to seize the house. When Munna threatens to take the house back through violent means, Lucky threatens to reveal the fact that Munna is a gangster to Jhanvi. Turning to Gandhi for help, Munna learns about [[satyagraha]] (the path of truth). In turn, Munna encourages the residents of ''Second Innings'' to use ''Gandhigiri'' in an attempt to regain their home. However, when Munna divulges the fact that he can see Gandhi to Lucky Singh, Lucky uses this information in a press conference to show that Munna is mentally disturbed.

As Gandhi guides Munna Bhai in the cultivation of a new life based upon [[Gandhism]], particularly [[Mahatma_Gandhi#Gandhi.27s_principles|non-violence and truth]] (which Munna Bhai calls [[Gandhigiri]]), anyone who comes into contact with Munna is transformed. In an important [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] moment in the film, Victor D'Souza ([[Jimmy Shergill]]), uses Gandhigiri to confess to his father ([[Parikshat Sahni]]) that he lost the family savings in the [[stock market]]. In another important scene Simran ([[Dia Mirza]]), who is influenced by Gandhigiri, decides to tell the truth to her superstitious future father-in-law Kkhurana ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]): she is a ''[[Mangal Dosha|manglik]]'' (a term which signifies astrological settings at the moment of birth that are considered unlucky by some in [[India]]), a fact concealed by her father Lucky Singh ([[Boman Irani]]) prior to the wedding. As a result Kkhurana, whose interest in [[numerology]] and [[astrology]] has allowed his [[astrologer]] Batuk Maharaj ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) to control all aspects of his life, attempts to cancel the impending marriage ceremonies. However, with the help of Munna and and Kkhurana's son, Sunny ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), the marriage proceeds. In gratitude, Lucky Singh returns ''Second Innings'' to its residents. In this manner, the application of Gandhi's concept of [[satyagraha]] (non-violence) to day-to-day modern life (and thus the revivial of Gandhi's "spirit") becomes the central thematic issue of the film.

While actors generally conduct research before the beginning of the film's production, [[Sanjay Dutt]] did not prepare for the role of Munna Bhai by reading Gandhi's ''My Experiments with Truth.'' He states instead in an interview with ''[[The Times of India]]'' that both his father, [[Sunil Dutt]] (who portrays [[Munna Bhai]]'s father in the first film, ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'') and his mother (the late actress [[Nargis]]) were his role models as they "were basically Gandhians.

Cinematic works by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] (such as ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'') often contain [[allusion]]s to other important films and works of music or literature. In ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai,'' Jhanvi's  opening line for her radio show, "Gooooooood Moooooooorninnnng Mumbai!", is an ''[[homage]]'' to [[Robin Williams]]' opening for his radio show ("Gooooooooood morning, Vietnaaaaaaaaammm!") in the 1987 film, ''[[Good_Morning%2C_Vietnam#Quotes|Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sunreport.asp?Newsid=1050758| title= Lage Raho Munnabhai| publisher=dnaindia.com| date=2006-09-02| accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/lage-raho-munna-bhai| title= Lage Raho Munnabhai| publisher=ultrabrown.com| date=| accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> In addition, parts of the [[melody]] of the song "Pal Pal...Har Pal" are reminiscent of the [[Cliff Richard]] song "Theme for a Dream." <ref name="Smashits music">{{cite news | first= | last=| url=http://ww.smashits.com/news/bollywood/music-review/5677/lage-raho-munna-bhai.html| title=Smashits - Lage Raho Munna Bhai Music Review  | publisher=smashits.com| date=| accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

This is where [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] has put his trademark. There is an underlying moral in the movie and the director drives home that message loud and clear."<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | url=http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=123403&catID=&category=Entertainment&rtFlg=rtFlg | title=Review:Lage Raho Munna Bhai| publisher=merinews.com| date= | accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>

Others disagree. In the article "Nothing Gandhian about it", in ''[[The Hindu]]'', Ajit Duara states: "It is a commentary on our times that, 58 years after his assassination, the accomplished cultural sophistication and political genius of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has to be dumbed down to the astoundingly moronic levels of 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' [...] If you had never heard of M.K. Gandhi till you saw the film you would come out of the theatre believing that he was this [[pacifism|passive fellow]] who always turned the other cheek, solved problems by saying sorry to people and shaming them into better behaviour, got rid of the [[British Raj|British]] by wearing a [[dhoti]] and horn-rimmed [[glasses]], told the truth to scoundrels until they stopped telling lies. On the contrary, M.K. Gandhi's greatest legacy to India and the world was a form of political agitation called [[civil disobedience]]"<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/10/01/stories/2006100100110500.htm| title= Nothing Gandhian about it| publisher=hindu.com| date=| accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref> In addition, according to filmmaker [[Jahnu Barua]], "Gandhian philosophy is serious business and ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' is not the right way to show it".<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061010/asp/calcutta/story_6850882.asp| title= <U+2018>Gandhism is serious business<U+2019>| publisher=telegraphindia.com| date=| accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>

===High profile screenings===
[[Image:VidyaBalan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vidya Balan]] as Jhanvi]]
There have been a number of important screenings of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai.'' One of the first took place in [[Los Angeles]] on [[27 October]] [[2006]] during the film festival ''Melodramas Of Change: USC's First Indian Film Festival'', ([[USC School of Cinematic Arts|University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts]]).  The screening was followed by a question and answer session with [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]], [[Rajkumar Hirani]], and [[Abhijat Joshi]]. Filmmaker [[Gurinder Chadha]] also attended and spoke at the conclusion of the question and answer session.<ref>{{cite news | first=Taran| last=Adarsh| url=http://www.indiafm.com/news/2006/11/01/8122| title=Munna's tryst with Oscars begins| publisher=indiafm.com| date=[[2006-11-01]]|accessdate=2006-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.usc.edu/webapps/events_calendar/custom/32/index.php?category=Item&item=0.861809| title=Melodramas of Change - Visions and Voices: The USC Arts & Humanities Initiative| publisher=usc.edu| date=|accessdate=2006-10-31}}</ref>

A similar screening occurred on [[10 November]] [[2006]] in the [[United Nations]] auditorium (''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' is the first [[Hindi]] film to be shown at the United Nations). The film was introduced by [[Shashi Tharoor]], ''[[United Nations]] [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary General]] for Communications and Public Information.''  [[Rajkumar Hirani]], [[Abhijat Joshi]] and actor [[Boman Irani]] (Lucky Singh) entertained questions afterwards. ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' was well received by the audience of diplomats and journalists as it was "an evening that had started with massive security arrangements in the sombre UN setting, [and] concluded in a festive atmosphere in the lounge of the UN with diplomats from other tables joining in raising a toast for the film."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/06/nov/14_lage_raho_munna_bhai_rajkumar_hirani.asp| title=UN members laughed and applauded at 'Lage Raho...| publisher=glamsham.com| date=[[2006-11-14]]|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> 

The [[Prime Minister]] of [[India]], [[Manmohan Singh]] was also given a private screening of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai.'' After viewing the film, he stated that the movie "captures Bapu's message about the power of truth and humanism."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006102615091100.htm&date=2006/10/26/&prd=th&| title=Manmohan watches Munnabhai| publisher=hinduonnet.com| date=2006-10-26| accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>  Furthermore, during his visit to [[South Africa]], Singh was quoted as saying "I was heartened to see recently that back home in India the most popular movie this festival season is a film about a young man's discovery of the universal and timeless relevance of the Mahatma's message."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2006/november/17/india_news/pm_calls_for_end_to_corruption_cites_lage_raho_munna_bhai.html| title=PM calls for end to corruption, cites "Lage Raho Munna Bhai"| publisher=indianmuslims.info| date=2006-11-17| accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref>

In addition, ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' was screened at a global judiciary summit ("7th annual conference of top judicial functionaries of about 75 countries") in [[Lucknow]] in [[December]] [[2006]]. After viewing the film Justice Kenneth Mithyane of the ''[[South Africa]]n Supreme Court'' of Appeals commented "The movie has re-enlivened the non-violence philosophy practiced by Mahatma Gandhi who continues to remain close to the hearts of the South Africans." In addition, Fatima Chouhan, a young member of the [[South African]] parliament also noted that, "'Munnabhai' will be widely appreciated in [[South Africa]]. I'm carrying a couple of video discs for my family and friends."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1069061| title='Munnabhai' charms South Africans| publisher=dnaindia.com| date=[[2006-12-13]]|accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref> 

Finally, after a screening of the film, Gandhi's grandson, [[Rajmohan Gandhi]], stated in a [[12 January]] [[2007]] article that Gandhi would have enjoyed ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'': 

<blockquote>'He would not have objected,' says Rajmohan, who adds that he recently watched ''Lage Raho Munnabhai'' and enjoyed it thoroughly. 'He was a man of the masses and had an ear to the ground. He would have actually encouraged its use and would have been pleased how simply his difficult concepts has been made accessible to the common man through the film.'<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=217197| title=Bapu would have loved Gandhigiri, says grandson Rajmohan| publisher=expressindia.com| date=2007-01-12| accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref></blockquote>

The decision to include [[Mahatma Gandhi]]  as a central character in the film (through his interactions with [[Munna Bhai]]) introduces important thematic concepts and ideas which draw upon the period of [[Colonial India]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Gandhi was a leader in this movement, challenging the occupation of [[India]] by the [[British Empire]] through the use of  ''[[Satyagraha]]'' (non-violence). In this context Jhanvi and Munna Bhai's non-violent protest against Lucky Singh serves as a metaphor for the Indian Independence movement and the battle against the [[British Raj]].

Indeed, the thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has both revived an interest in ''[[Gandhism]]'' under the new term, ''[[Gandhigiri]]'' in [[India]] <ref>{{cite news | first=MRIDULA| last=CHUNDURI| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2038291.cms| title= Gandhigiri, a cool way to live| publisher=timesofindia.com| date=[[2006-09-29]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> and has likewise "made Gandhi suddenly hip.

This "Gandhi revival" has had a number of political as well as social repercussions. The [[Prime Minister]] of [[India]], [[Manmohan Singh]], announced the creation of a new Public Services Bill to combat corruption in a press release dated [[17 November]] [[2006]] and cites ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' as one of its influences.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=22094| title=PM<U+2019>s key note address to conference of CBI & state anti-corruption bureaus: Government to bring forward public services bill :PM| publisher=pib.nic.in| date=2006-11-17| accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has also inspired a new interest in books about Gandhi, <ref>{{cite news | first=Zeeshan| last=Jawed| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060922/asp/calcutta/story_6766052.asp| title= Groove to Gandhi, get it? - Books on Bapu fly off shelves, schools block bulk tickets| publisher=telegraphindia.com| date=[[2006-09-22]]| accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref> with requests for copies of Gandhi's autobiography, ''[[My Experiments with Truth]]'' from prison inmates.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200610082129.htm| title=Gandhigiri in prison, inmate pleads for Mahatma's autobiography| publisher=hindu.com| date=[[2006-10-08]]| accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> Due to its influence, the film awas made tax-free in [[Delhi]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/lage-raho-munnabhai-taxfree-in-delhi/21309-8.html| title=Munnabhai goes tax-free in Delhi| publisher=ibnlive.com| date=2006-09-12| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200609270310.htm| title=Lage Raho Munnabhai' made tax-free in Chhattisgarh| publisher=hindu.com| date=[[2006-09-27]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/?file=story&id=1228| title=Lage Raho Munnabhai tax free in Mumbai| publisher=businessofcinema.com| date=[[2006-09-29]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/68565.php/Uttar_Pradesh_exempts_Lage_Raho_Munna_bhai_from_tax| title=Uttar Pradesh exempts 'Lage Raho Munna bhai' from tax| publisher=dailyindia.com| date=[[2006-10-11]]|accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref>

A number of examples of "Gandhigiri" protests and a new interest in [[satyagraha]] have also been reported. ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' is a partial influence in the development of a two day conference (with participants from 54 countries) set for [[29 January]], [[2007]] to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[satyagraha]] in [[South Africa]]."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/India/Cong_plans_mega_satyagraha_meet/articleshow/815076.cms| title=Cong plans mega satyagraha meet| publisher=timesofindia.com| date=[[2006-12-15]]|accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref> In addition, farmers staged a protest with [[flowers]] in the Vidarbha region, <ref>{{cite news | first=Zubair| last=Ahmed| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6044476.stm| title=Gandhi-style protest by farmers| publisher=bbc.com| date=[[2006-10-12]]|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref> and people who organized a protest in [[Lucknow]] claimed to have been inspired by ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' to use [[rose]]s to convey their message.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/61944.php/Lucknow_residents_play_Munnabhais| title=Lucknow residents play Munnabhais| publisher=dailyindia.com| date=[[2006-09-20]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> In [[Lucknow]] students claimed to have been inspired by ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' to do volunteer work, planting trees "to conserve nature which is bound to benefit public health."<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://news.sawf.org/Bollywood/22195.aspx/Lucknow_residents_play_Munnabhais| title=Bollywood's Lage Raho Munna Bhai inspires Lucknow's medical students  | publisher=sawf.org| date=[[2006-09-27]]| accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>.

Theories for this sudden revival vary. According to  ''[[The Washington Post]]'', some have suggested that this phenomenon could be attributed to the film simplifying Gandhi's "lofty ideals" and conveying them "in contemporary, colloquial language.<ref name=washpost>{{cite news | first=Y.P.| last=Rajesh| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/02/AR2006100200254.html| title= Bollywood gangster comedy makes Gandhi new pop icon| publisher=washingtonpost.com| date=[[2006-10-02]]| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> Others, according to ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', have  noted that the appeal of the film lies in the fact that "Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems."<ref>{{cite news | first=Mark| last=Sappenfield| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1003/p01s04-wosc.html| title=It took a comedy to revive Gandhi's ideals in India| publisher=csmonitor.com| date=[[2006-10-03]] edition| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> Whatever the reason, a [[13 October]] [[2006]] article in ''The [[Boston Globe]]'', suggests that the revival has had a positive impact in India and states, "What America needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, [[Martin Luther King|Kinggiri]], or [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedygiri]]. If it worked for [[Bollywood]], it could work for [[Hollywood]]."<ref>{{cite news | first=Swati Gauri| last=Sharma| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/13/how_gandhi_got_his_mojo_back/| title=How Gandhi got his mojo back| publisher=boston.com| date=[[2006-10-13]]|accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref>

The soundtrack features five compositions, ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'', ''Samjho Ho Hi Gaya'', ''Aane Char Aane'', ''Bande Mein The Dum...[[Vande Mataram]]'' and ''Pal Pal...Har Pal'' as well as [[remix]]es of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' and ''Aane Char Aane'' and an [[instrument|instrumental]] version of ''Bande Mein Tha Dum''.

==DVD==
The DVD of ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' (distributed by ''Eros Entertainment'') was released on [[November 13]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last=| url=http://www.erosentertainment.com/eros_us/Product/ProdListIn.asp?6747| title=Lage Raho Munna Bhai DVD  | publisher=erosentertainment.com| date=| accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last=| url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raho-Munna-Bhai-Sanjay-Dutt/dp/B000I5X1NU| title=Lage Raho Munna Bhai DVD at Amazon | publisher=[[Amazon]]| date=| accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> The package contains a bonus [[DVD]] with a [[promo|promotional video]] based on short clips from ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' and ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' In addition, the bonus DVD features a 98-minute 5-part [[documentary film|documentary]] on the making of the film, interviews with members of the cast and crew, and information on the creation of the musical portions of the film.<ref name="DVD News">{{cite news | first= | last=| url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=63438| title=Lage Raho Munna Bhai DVD  | publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk| date=| accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> Finally, the bonus DVD includes critiques of ''Lage Raho ...'' as well as its predecessor ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'', a comparison between the two and a special feature entitled, ''Munna meets Bapu''.<ref name="DVD News"/>

According to the ''DVD Times'', some have criticized ''Eros Entertainment'' for providing substandard sound and visual quality: "This disc is in [[NTSC]] format, but has been copied from a [[PAL]] video source, which in turn has been improperly converted from a 24fps master. So not only are we getting the usual ghosting that goes with bog-standard interlacing, but duplicated frames as well giving a horribly blurred and jerky picture".<ref name="DVD News"/> The ''DVD Times'' also argues that while the [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 is relatively clear, the transition to DVD created problems with sound in some parts of the film.<ref name="DVD News"/>
