'''Pye Dubois''' (born '''Paul Phillip Woods'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cshf.ca/song/tom-sawyer/|title=TOM SAWYER|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/M/Max_Webster.html|title=CANOE -- JAM! Music - Pop Encyclopedia - Max Webster|work=canoe.ca|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[lyricist]] and [[poet]].  He has worked with a number of bands, including [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Max Webster]], with whom he was considered an unofficial fifth non-performing member.<ref name="book2">{{cite book | author=[[Martin Popoff|Popoff, Martin]]| title= Riff Kills Man! 25 Years of Recorded Hard Rock & Heavy Metal | publisher=Power Chord Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-9697707-0-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0002398|title=Drayton Valley|author=D.G. WETHERELL|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>  Dubois would accompany the band in the studio and wrote lyrics for each of their albums.  Dubois was given lyric writing credits on several Rush songs including "[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]", along with "Force Ten". Pye Dubois also wrote the poem "Between the Sun and Moon", which inspired lyricist and drummer [[Neil Peart]] to write many of the lyrics for the album ''[[Counterparts (Rush album)|Counterparts]]''. He is also credited as a contributing composer on the song "[[Test for Echo (song)|Test for Echo]]."

After Max Webster dissolved, Dubois continued his writing relationship with singer and guitarist [[Kim Mitchell]] on his solo songs.  This would include all but one of the songs on Kim's platinum ''[[Akimbo Alogo]]'', every song on the triple platinum ''[[Shakin' Like a Human Being]]'', and double platinum ''[[Rockland (album)|Rockland]]''.  Dubois had a falling-out with Mitchell during the sessions for ''Rockland'', caused by Mitchell's decision to record the album in the US without Dubois present in the studio as he had been in the past.  Dubois did not write on Mitchell's follow-up album, ''[[Aural Fixations]]'' (lyrics on that album were handled largely by Jim Chevalier and [[Andy Curran]]), but did return for 1994's ''[[Itch (Kim Mitchell album)|Itch]]''.  Dubois took part in several [[Max Webster]] reunion concerts, but not their most recent one in Toronto on May 24, 2007, and has not written lyrics with Mitchell since 1994.

On July 20, 2007, Dubois went temporarily missing, causing concern with his neighbor, author [[Martin Popoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/70468|title=RUSH - Writer Of 'Tom Sawyer' Lyric, Pye Dubois, MISSING!|work=bravewords.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalpioneer.com/Living/Technologies/2009-10-31/article-1385672/Former-D.O.A.-drummer-Chuck-Biscuits-alive-and-well-despite-Internet-reports/1|title=Former D.O.A. drummer Chuck Biscuits alive and well despite Internet reports|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>
