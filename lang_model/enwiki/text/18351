The '''''Provence''''' was a  64-gun [[List of ships of the line of France|ship of the line]] of the [[French Navy]]. She was funded by a [[don des vaisseaux]] donation from the Estates of [[Provence]].

Ordered as ''Union'' in February 1762, the ship was renamed ''Provence'' on 17 March, and begun in May on plans by engineer Gauthier.

After an uneventful career, she was decommissioned in February 1769, but reactivated in April of the next year and commissioned under Captain Mori<U+00E8>s-Castellet. She was appointed to a three-ship squadron under Captain de Broves and departed Toulon on 16 May, bound for Tunisia, where she blockaded the harbours of [[Sousse]] and [[Bizerte]], and took part in the [[French bombarment of Tunisia in 1770|bombarment of the cities]] in late June<ref>[http://www.famillecst.fr/j_-_le_bombardement_de_porto_farina_et_de__bizerte.html LE BOMBARDEMENT DE PORTO FARINA ET DE BIZERTE]</ref>.

In 1778, she took part in the [[Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War]] under Captain Desmichel-Champorcin. She took part in the [[Battle of Grenada]], where Desmichel-Champorcin was killed.  In December 1779, she had returned to brest, where she was decommissioned.

Between 1783 and 1785, she sailed as a merchantman for the [[Compagnie de Chine]], before being struck in Rochefort and brocken up in 1786.
