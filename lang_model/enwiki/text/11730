'''Blount Island''' is an island of approximately 2,000&nbsp;acres on the [[St. Johns River]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], nine nautical miles (16.7&nbsp;km) west of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. One of three public cargo facilities at the [[Port of Jacksonville]] is located there, and it is also the site of the [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Blount Island Command]].<ref>[http://www.jaxport.com/sea/blount.cfm "Blount Island"] Jacksonville Port Authority, Seaports</ref>

==History==
The [[St. Johns River]] between Jacksonville and the Atlantic Ocean twists and turns. That was not a problem until shipping companies began using bigger and bigger freighters after [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] created the ''Dames Point Cut'', a straight channel that provided an alternative to the river's natural course, which contained several of the sharpest turns in the river.  Four marsh islands received the [[dredging]] [[spoil]] and became Blount Island. The property was turned over to the Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) for development. <ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/blount-island.htm "Blount Island Command (BICmd)"] Global Security, Military</ref> 
The west side of the island was developed and used for freight operations after the [[Jacksonville Port Authority]] (JAXPORT) was established in 1963. Railroad access to the site was added in the late 1960s.<ref name=RAIL />

===Floating Power===
{{main|Offshore Power Systems}}
''Offshore Power Systems'' (OPS) was a 1970 joint venture between nuclear power company [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse Electric]] and ship builder [[Tenneco]]. The company intended to manufacture and assemble floating nuclear power plants. The east half of the island was unused and mostly marsh until OPS obtained 850&nbsp;acres of land from JAXPORT, destroyed the marsh and replaced it with sterile fill. Utilities, roads and other infrastructure was established and the world's largest crane, 38-stories tall and capable of lifting 990 metric tons, was purchased and installed for $15 million.<ref name=CRANE>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/blount-island "Across the State"] Orlando Sentinel, November 3, 1990</ref> A total of $125 million was invested in development of the site and improvements, but no power plants were ever built and the company closed in 1984.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-3140683.html "Westinghouse Electric Corp. to close Offshore Power Systems operation."] PR Newswire, February 17, 1984</ref>

Westinghouse sold their Blount Island property to [[Gate Petroleum]] for $17 million in 1985.<ref> ''Newboy: the Autobiography of Herbert Hill Peyton'', page 158, Herbert Hill Peyton, ISBN 0965827704</ref>

===Gate Petroleum===
The following year, Gate Petroleum leased a portion of their Blount Island property to the [[United States Marine Corps]]. In 1989, the U.S. Navy signed a $5 million per year contract with Gate to dock two ships at Blount Island on new piers built for that purpose. The construction, which would require dredging the channel, was opposed by a group of fishermen, environmentalists and nearby residents who owned riverfront property.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/blount-island "Jacksonville contract cancelled"] Orlando Sentinel, December 20, 1989</ref>
Gate's project was consistent with the city's master plan for the industrial area, but Gate chose to abandon the development and requested that the Navy cancel the contract for public relations reasons.<ref>Schoolcraft, Lisa R.: [http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2001/07/02/daily26.html "Gate Maritime sinks dock plans on Blount Island"] Jacksonville Business Journal, July 6, 2001</ref>

In November 1990, Gate sold the 20-year old Offshore Power Systems crane for $3 million to the [[China State Shipbuilding Corporation]] and their workers dismantled it for shipment overseas.<ref name=CRANE />

===Marines===
{{main|Blount Island Command}}
Blount Island Command supports three [[Maritime Prepositioning ship]] squadrons (each with multiple ships) strategically located in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the Western [[Pacific Ocean]]. The squadron's ships contain enough food, equipment, supplies, and ammunition to support a [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] for one month.

In 1986, the U.S. Marine Corps established the ''Biennial Maintenance Command'' (BMC) on the east side of Blount Island using {{convert|262|acre|km2}} leased from [[Gate Petroleum|Gate Maritime Properties]] for $11 million per year. The lease between Gate and the Marine Corps was due to end in 2004, and in 2000, the Corp stated their intentions to purchase the property when the lease expired. The Marine Corps budget included $115.7 million for the acquisition, but extended negotiations did not result in an agreement. Gate contended that the land was worth between $160 million and $200 million, so in August 2004, the Marine Corps seized {{convert|1100|acre|km2}} on Blount Island (Gate's entire Blount Island holdings) by [[eminent domain]] and paid $101 million (later increased to $106 million). When land is seized by eminent domain for uses that benefit the public, the government is required to pay landowners "just compensation", so Gate asked for a jury to decide the land's value. On November 14, 2005, a jury determined that the government should pay $162 million for the parcel.<ref>Gibbons, Timothy J.:[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/111605/bus_20309669.shtml Florida Times-Union: November 16, 2005-Marines to pay $160M for Blount property]</ref><ref name=JBJ>Quesada, Tony: [http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2005/11/14/daily17.html "Jury: Feds must pay $162M for Blount Island property"] Jacksonville Business Journal, November 16, 2005</ref>

==Public facility==
[[Image:BlountIslandMarineTerminalJax.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Blount Island Marine Terminal]]

The 754-acre ''Blount Island Marine Terminal'' is JAXPORT's largest container facility, handling 80% of all container cargo at the port,<ref name=RAIL>[http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2009/10/05/daily24.html "Port gets $6M for Blount railroad system"] Jacksonville Business Journal, October 6, 2009</ref> but also processes [[Roll-on/roll-off|Ro/Ro]], heavy lift, breakbulk and liquid bulk cargoes. The terminal has 6,600 linear feet (2,012&nbsp;m) of deep water berths.

Blount Island has one 112-ton whirly crane and six container cranes (three 50-ton cranes, one 45-ton crane and two 40-ton cranes), with two additional cranes planned for purchase in 2010. The terminal also offers 240,000-square feet of transit shed space and a 90,000-square-foot Container Freight Station for cross-dock efficiency.

In addition to import operations, several companies provide freight service to the [[Caribbean]], including [[Trailer Bridge]] and [[Crowley Maritime]].<ref>Luxner, Larry: [http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=1033 "Crowley, Trailer Bridge hope to dominate containerized cargo trade"] Luxner News, October 2002</ref>

===Rail===
Over 30% of the terminal's shipments utilize on-dock rail service provided by [[CSX Corporation]] directly. JAXPORT owns the 14&nbsp;miles of track, which was laid down in the late 1960s. In the Fall of 2009, the Port Authority received a grant of almost $6 million to improve the Blount Island rail system, which was also utilized by the U.S. Marine Corps' terminal. The [[United States Department of Transportation]] required matching funds of $1.7 million from JAXPORT. The project laid 3<U+00BD> miles of new track and replaced 12,000 aging crossties.<ref name=RAIL />

===Truck===
The island has highway access nearby. [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|Interstate 295]] (State Road 9-A) is located one mile west; [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] is five minutes away with [[Interstate 10]] on the west side of the I-295 beltway. [[Interstate 75]] is a one hour drive west.
