'''Judeo-Christian''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|in British English]], '''Jud<U+00E6>o-Christian''') is used in the United States since the 1940s to refer to standards of ethics held in common by [[Judaism and Christianity]].  The term is also used in a historical sense to refer to the close early connections between Christianity and Judaism.
==History of Christianity==
The earliest use of the term "Judeo-Christian" in the historical sense dates to 1829 in the journal of [[Joseph Wolff]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Missionary Journal of the Rev. Joseph Wolff, Missionary to the Jews |last=Wolff |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Wolff |year=1829 |volume=III |publisher=James Duncan |location=London |page=314 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Cd8_AAAAcAAJ}}</ref> and before that as "Jud<U+00E6>o Christian" in a letter from Alexander M'Caul dated October 17, 1821.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=M'Caul |first1=Alexander |year=1820<U+2013>1821 |title=Extract of a Letter From Mr. M'Caul |journal=The Jewish Expositor, and Friend of Israel |publisher= |volume=V |pages=478 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dSYbAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> The former appears in discussions of theories of the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|emergence of Christianity]], and both are used with a different sense than the one common today.

Accessed online 2008-07-21</ref> The term "[[Jewish-Christian]]" had been used in this sense as early as 1785 in [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Richard Watson]]'s essay "The Teaching and Witness of the Holy Spirit",<ref>{{cite book |title=A Collection of Theological Tracts, in Six Volumes |last=Watson |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Watson (bishop) |volume=IV |chapter=Essay on the Teaching and Witness of the Holy Spirit |year=1785 |publisher=T.

Early German use of the term ''judenchristlich'' ("Jewish-Christian"), in a decidedly negative sense, can be found in the late writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who emphasized what he saw as neglected aspects of continuity between the Jewish world view and that of Christianity. The expression appears in ''[[The_Antichrist_(book)|The Antichrist]]'', published in 1895 and written several years earlier; a fuller development of Nietzsche's argument can be found in a prior work, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''.
==Ethical value system==
The present meaning of "Judeo-Christian" tregarding ethics first appeared in print on July 27, 1939, with the phrase "the Judaeo-Christian scheme of morals" in the ''New English Weekly''.<ref>[http://books.google.cz/books?id=7zpSvtOak7AC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 See Peter Novick: ''Holocaust in American Life'']</ref> The term gained much currency in  the 1940s, promoted by groups which evolved into the National Conference of Christians and Jews, to fight [[antisemitism]] by expressing a more inclusive idea of American values rather than just Christian or Protestant .<ref name="Silk">Mark Silk (1984), Notes on the Judeo-Christian Tradition in America, ''American Quarterly'' '''36(1)''', 65-85</ref><ref>Sarna, 2004, p.266</ref> By 1952 [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was speaking of the "Judeo-Christian concept" being the "deeply religious faith" on which "our sense of government<U+2026>is founded."<ref>Dwight D. Eisenhower, speech to the Freedoms Foundation in New York. "Our sense of government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply religious faith, and I don't care what it is. With us of course it is the Judeo-Christian concept, but it must be a religion that all men are created equal." Quoted by Silk (1984).</ref>
==Culture wars==
The term became especially popular among the Conservative Right in American politics, promoting a "Judeo-Christian values" agenda in the so-called [[culture wars]], a usage which surged in the 1990s.<ref name="Hartmann">Douglas Hartmann, Xuefeng Zhang, William Wischstadt (2005).

[[James Dobson]], a prominent conservative spokesman, said the Judeo-Christian tradition includes the right to display the following documents in Kentucky schools, after they were banned by a federal judge in May 2000 as "conveying a very specific governmental endorsement of religion":
*an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence, which reads, "All men<U+2026>are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness"
*the preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky, which states, "We, the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, grateful to Almighty God for the civil, political and religious liberties we enjoy, and invoking the continuance of these blessings, do ordain and establish this Constitution"
*the national motto, "[[In God we trust]]"
*a page from the congressional record of Wednesday, February 2, 1983, Vol. 129, No. 8, which declares 1983 as the "Year of the Bible" and lists the Ten Commandments
*a proclamation by President [[Ronald Reagan]] marking 1983 the "Year of the Bible"
*a proclamation by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] designating April 30, 1863, a "National Day of Prayer and Humiliation"
*an excerpt from President Lincoln's "Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon Presentation of a Bible," which reads, "The Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man"
*The [[Mayflower Compact]]  of 1620, in which the Plymouth colony's founders invoke "the name of God" and explain that their journey was taken, among other reasons, "for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith"<ref>Dobson Phd., James C.. ''One Nation Under God'' http://www2.focusonthefamily.com/docstudy/newsletters/A000000365.cfm
September 2000</ref>
 
Prominent champions of the term also identify it with the historic American religious traditions. The Jewish Conservative columnist [[Dennis Prager]], for example, writes:
<blockquote>The concept of Judeo-Christian values does not rest on a claim that the two religions are identical. It promotes the concept there is a shared intersection of values based on the Hebrew Bible ("[[Torah]]"), brought into our culture by the founding generations of Biblically oriented Protestants, that is fundamental to American history, cultural identity, and institutions.<ref>Prager, Dennis. "[http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42864 The Case for Judeo-Christian Values, part 5]". Worldnetdaily.com, February 15, 2005. Accessed: 2008-07-12.</ref> </blockquote>

Some secularists reject the use of "Judeo-Christian" as a code-word for a particular kind of Christian America,<ref name="Marty">Martin E. Marty (1986), [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=188 A Judeo-Christian Looks at the Judeo-Christian Tradition], in ''[[The Christian Century]]'', October 5, 1986</ref> with scant regard to modern Jewish, Catholic or more [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian traditions]].
===Since 9/11===  
Usage has shifted again, according to Hartmann ''et al.'', since 2001 and the [[September 11 attacks]], with the mainstream media using the term less, in order to characterize America as multicultural.  The study finds the term now most likely to be used by Liberals in connection with discussions of [[Islam in the United States|Muslim and Islamic inclusion in America]], and renewed debate about the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name="Hartmann" /> 

It is used more than ever by some Conservative thinkers and journalists, who use it to discuss the Islamic threat to America, the dangers of [[multiculturalism]], and moral decay in a materialist, secular age. Dennis Prager, author of popular books on Judaism and antisemitism, ''Nine Questions People ask about Judaism'' (with Joseph Telushkin)<ref>''Nine Questions People ask about Judaism'',with Joseph Telushkin, 1986, ISBN 0-6716-2261-7</ref> and ''Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism'',<ref>Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism (with Joseph Telushkin) (2003) ISBN 0-7432-4620-9</ref> and radio commentator, has published an on-going 19-part series explaining and promoting the concept of Judeo-Christian culture, running for three years from 2005 to 2008, reflecting the interest of this concept to his listeners.  He believes the Judeo-Chrisitan perspective is under assault by an amoral and materialistic culture that desperately needs its teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dennis Prager Publishes Series On Judeo-Christian Values|url=http://www.traditionalvalues.org/modules.php?sid=2368|work=[[Traditional Values Coalition]]}}</ref><ref>Dobson, James. 2000</ref>

<blockquote>
<U+2026>only America has called itself Judeo-Christian. America is also unique in that it has always combined secular government with a society based on religious values. 
Along with the belief in [[liberty]]<U+2014>as opposed to, for example, the European belief in [[Social equality|equality]], the Muslim belief in [[theocracy]], and the Eastern belief in social [[conformity]]<U+2014>Judeo-Christian values are what distinguish America from all other countries.
</blockquote>

==Basis of a common concept of the two religions==
{{seealso|Biblical law in Christianity|Noahide Law}}

Supporters of the Judeo-Christian concept point to the Christian claim that [[Christianity]] is the heir to [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Judaism]], and that the whole logic of Christianity as a [[religion]] is that it exists (only) as a religion built upon Judaism. Two major views of the relationship exist, namely [[New Covenant theology]] and [[Dual-covenant theology]]. In addition, although the order of the books in the Protestant [[Old Testament]] (excluding the [[Biblical apocrypha]]) and the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) differ, the books are the same. The majority of the Christian Bible is, in fact, Jewish scripture, and it is used as moral and spiritual teaching material throughout the Christian world. The prophets, patriarchs, and heroes of the Jewish scripture are also known in Christianity, which uses the Jewish text as the basis for its understanding of historic Judeo-Christian figures such as [[Abraham]], [[Elijah]], and [[Moses]]. As a result, a vast chunk of Jewish and Christian teachings are based on a common sacred text.


===Political conservatives===
By the 1950s [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] were emphasizing the Judeo-Christian roots of their values.<ref> Rossiter, ''Conservatism in America'' (1968) p. 268</ref> As economist Elgin Groseclose explained in 1958, it was ideas "drawn from Judeo-Christian Scriptures that have made possible the economic strength and industrial power of this country."<ref> A. G. Heinsohn G. Jr., ed. ''Anthology of Conservative Writing in the United States, 1932-1960'' (Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1962) p. 256. </ref> Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] noted that Conservatives "believed the communist projection of man as a producing, consuming animal to be used and discarded was antithetical to all the Judeo-Christian  understandings which are the foundations upon which the Republic stands."<ref>Barry Morris Goldwater. ''With no apologies'' (1979) </ref> [[Ronald Reagan]] frequently emphasized Judeo-Christian values as necessary ingredients in the fight against Communism. He argued that the Bible contains "all the answers to the problems that face us."<ref>John Kenneth White,  ''Still seeing red: how the Cold War shapes the new American politics'' (1998) p 138</ref> Belief in the superiority of Western Judeo-Christian traditions led Conservatives to downplay the aspirations of the non-[[Capitalism|Capitalist]] [[Third World]] and to repudiate the value of [[aid|foreign aid]].<ref>Lisa McGirr, ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right'' (2002) p. 173</ref><ref>By the 1990s "Judeo-Christian" terminology was now mostly found among Conservatives. Douglas Hartmann, et al., "One (Multicultural) Nation Under God? Changing Uses and Meanings of the Term "Judeo-Christian" in the American Media," ''Journal of Media & Religion,'' 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 4, pp. 207-234 </ref>

The emergence of the "[[Christian right]]" as a political force and part of the Conservative coalition dates from the 1970s. As Wilcox and Robinson conclude:

<blockquote>The Christian Right is an attempt to restore Judeo-Christian values to a country that is in deep moral decline. <U+2026>[They] believe that society suffers from the lack of a firm basis of Judeo-Christian values and they seek to write laws that embody those values.<ref>Clyde Wilcox and Carin Robinson, ''Onward Christian Soldiers?: The Religious Right in American Politics'' (2010) p. 13 </ref></blockquote>

==Judeo-Christian concept in interfaith relations==
Promoting the concept of [[United States|America]] as a Judeo-Christian nation became a political program in the 1920s, in response to the growth of anti-Semitism in America. The rise of [[Hitler]] in the 1930s led concerned [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Roman Catholic church|Catholics]], and [[Jewish people|Jews]] to take active steps to increase understanding and tolerance.<ref>Sarna, Jonathan. American Judaism, A History. Yale University Press, 2004. p. 266</ref>

In this effort, precursors of the [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]] created teams consisting of a priest, a rabbi, and a minister, to run programs across the country, and fashion a more pluralistic America, no longer defined as a Christian land, but "one nurtured by three ennobling traditions: Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism."<ref name=autogenerated2>Sarna, p. 267</ref>  "The phrase 'Judeo-Christian' entered the contemporary lexicon as the standard liberal term for the idea that Western values rest on a religious consensus that included Jews."<ref name=autogenerated3>Sarna, p. 267</ref>  

Through soul-searching in the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], "there was a revolution in Christian theology in America. [<U+2026>] The greatest shift in Christian attitudes toward the Jewish people since [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine converted the Roman Empire]]."<ref>Brog, David. Standing With Israel. 2006.p.13</ref> The rise of [[Christian Zionism]]<U+2014>that is, religiously motivated Christian interest and support for the state of Israel<U+2014>along with a growth of [[philo-Semitism]] (love of the Jewish people) has increased interest among American Evangelicals in Judaism, especially areas of commonality with their own beliefs, see also [[Jerusalem in Christianity]]. Interest in and a positive attitude towards America's Judeo-Christian tradition has become mainstream among [[Evangelicals]].<ref>Brog, David. Standing with Israel. Frontline, 2006. ISBN 1591859069; Merkley, Paul Charles. Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion: Series Two. McGill-Queen's University Press (March 1, 2007) ISBN 0773532552</ref> 

The scriptural basis for this new positive attitude towards Jews among Evangelicals is [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:3, in which God promises that He will bless those who bless [[Abraham]] and his descendants, and curse those who curse them (see also "[[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|Abrahamic Covenant]]"). Other factors in the new philo-Semitism include gratitude to the Jews for contributing to the theological foundations of Christianity and for being the source of the prophets and [[Jesus]]; remorse for the Church's history of anti-Semitism; and fear that God will judge the nations at the end of time on the basis of how they treated the Jewish people. Moreover, for many Evangelicals Israel is seen as the instrument through which prophecies of the end times are fulfilled.<ref>Evangelicals and Israel: The Story of Christian Zionism by Stephen Spector, 2008</ref> Great numbers of Christian pilgrims visit Israel, especially in times of trouble for the Jewish state, to offer moral support, and return with an even greater sense of a shared Judeo-Christian heritage.

Public awareness of a shared Judeo-Chrisitan belief system has increased since the 1990s due to a great deal of interest in the life of the [[historical Jesus]], stressing his Jewishness (see also "[[Jewish Christians]]"). The literature explores differences and commonalities between [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus's teachings]], Christianity and Judaism.<ref>''Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels'' by Geza Vermes</ref><ref>''Jesus and Judaism'' by E. P. Sanders</ref><ref>''From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Christ'' by Paula Fredriksen</ref><ref>''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'' by John Dominic Crossan</ref><ref>''Jesus As a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'', by Mark Allan Powell</ref><ref>''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus: The Roots of the Problem and the Person'' by John P. Meier</ref>

On the other hand, the response of Jews towards the "Judeo-Christian" concept has been mixed. In the 1930s, "In the face of worldwide antisemitic efforts to stigmatize and destroy Judaism, influential Christians and Jews in America labored to uphold it, pushing Judaism from the margins of American religious life towards its very center."<ref>(Sarna,p.267)</ref> During World War II, Jewish chaplains worked with Catholic priests and Protestant ministers to promote goodwill, addressing servicemen who, "in many cases had never seen, much less heard a Rabbi speak before." At funerals for the unknown soldier, rabbis stood alongside the other chaplains and recited prayers in Hebrew. In a much publicized wartime tragedy, the sinking of the [[USAT ''Dorchester'']], the ship's multi-faith chaplains gave up their lifebelts to evacuating seamen and stood together "arm in arm in prayer" as the ship went down. A 1948 postage stamp commemorated their heroism with the words: 'interfaith in action."<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In the 1950s, "a spiritual and cultural revival washed over American Jewry" in response to the trauma of the Holocaust.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  American Jews became more confident to be identified as different.  

Two notable books addressed the relations between contemporary Judaism and Christianity, [[Abba Hillel Silver]]'s ''Where Judaism Differs'' and [[Leo Baeck]]'s ''Judaism and Christianity'', both motivated by an impulse to clarify Judaism's distinctiveness "in a world where the term Judeo-Christian had obscured critical differences between the two faiths."<ref>Sarna, p281</ref> Reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions, Rabbi [[Eliezer Berkovits]] wrote that "Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism."<ref>Disputation and Dialogue: Readings in the Jewish Christian Encounter, Ed. F. E. Talmage, Ktav, 1975, p. 291.</ref> Novelist and theologian [[Arthur A. Cohen]], in ''The Myth of the Judeo-Christian Tradition'', questioned the theological validity of the Judeo-Christian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], while [[Jacob Neusner]], in ''Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition'', writes, "The two faiths stand for different people talking about different things to different people."<ref>Jacob Neusner (1990), ''Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition''. New York and London: Trinity Press International and SCM Press.  p. 28</ref>

Law professor Stephen M. Feldman identifies talk of Judeo-Christian tradition as [[supersessionism]]:

<blockquote>Once one recognizes that Christianity has historically engendered antisemitism, then this so-called tradition appears as dangerous Christian dogma (at least from a Jewish perspective).  For Christians, the concept of a Judeo-Christian tradition comfortably suggests that Judaism progresses into Christianity<U+2014>that Judaism is somehow completed in Christianity. The concept of a Judeo-Christian tradition flows from the Christian theology of supersession, whereby the [[New Covenant|Christian covenant]] (or Testament) with God supersedes the Jewish one. Christianity, according to this myth, reforms and replaces Judaism. The myth therefore implies, first, that Judaism needs reformation and replacement, and second, that modern Judaism remains merely as a "relic".

Most importantly the myth of the Judeo-Christian tradition insidiously obscures the real and significant differences between Judaism and Christianity.<ref>Stephen M. Feldman (1998), ''Please Don't Wish Me a Merry Christmas: A Critical History of the Separation of Church and State''</ref></blockquote>

==Judeo-Christian concept in American history==
Nineteenth century historians wrote extensively on the United States of America having a distinctively Protestant character in its outlook and founding political philosophy. It is only since the 1950s that the term "Judeo-Christian" has been applied to it, reflecting the growing use of that term in American political life. By some the term is used casually, simply as a commonplace term, or as an inclusive synonym for the religious. Others, including for example Prager, argue the term is appropriate in its own right, capturing a distinctively Old Testament dimension (though not necessarily that of Judaism) in the Puritan character of early American Protestantism.

The notion of a distinctive religious basis for American [[democracy]] and culture was first described and popularized by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in the 1840's, in his influential book, ''Democracy in America''.  In the second chapter, de Tocqueville describes America's unique religious heritage from the [[Puritans]].  His analysis showed the Puritans as providing the foundational values of America,  based on their strong [[Hebrew Bible]] view of the world, which included fighting for earthly political justice, an emphasis on laws and education, and the "[[chosen people|chosenness]]" which the Puritans identified with, giving them a sense of moral mission in founding America.  As de Tocqueville observed, the Puritan's biblical outlook gave America a moral dimension which the Old World lacked. De Tocqueville believed these biblical values led to America's unique institutions of religious tolerance, public education, egalitarianism, and democracy. 
 <blockquote>
The principles of New England<U+2026>now extend their influence beyond its limits, over the whole American world. The civilization of New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill. [<U+2026>] Puritanism was not merely a religious doctrine, but corresponded in many points with the most absolute democratic and republican theories. [<U+2026>] [[Nathaniel Morton]], the historian of the first years of the settlement, thus opens his subject: "we may not hide from our children, showing to the generations to come the praises of the Lord; that especially the seed of [[Abraham]] his servant, and the children of [[Jacob]] his chosen ([[Psalm 105|Psalm cv.]] 5, 6), may remember his marvellous works in the beginning<U+2026>" [<U+2026>] The general principles which are the groundwork of modern constitutions, principles<U+2026>were all recognized and established by the laws of New England: the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of taxes, the responsibility of the agents of power, personal liberty, and trial by jury were all positively established without discussion. [<U+2026>] In the bosom of this obscure democracy<U+2026>the following fine definition of liberty: "There is a twofold liberty, natural<U+2026>and civil or federal. The first is common to man with beasts and other creatures. By this, man, as he stands in relation to man simply, hath liberty to do what he lists; it is a liberty to evil as well as to good. [<U+2026>] The exercise and maintaining of this liberty makes men grow more evil, and in time to be worse than brute beasts: [<U+2026>] The other kind of liberty I call civil or federal; it may also be termed moral, in reference to the covenant between God and man, in the moral law, and the politic covenants and constitutions, among men themselves. [<U+2026>] This liberty you are to stand for, with the hazard not only of your goods, but of your lives, if need be." I have said enough to put the character of Anglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the result (and this should be constantly kept in mind) of two distinct elements, which in other places have been in frequent disagreement, but which the Americans have succeeded in incorporating to some extent one with the other and combining admirably. I allude to the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty.<ref>de Tocqueville, Alexis. Democracy in America, Chapter II ORIGIN OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANS, AND IMPORTANCE OF THIS ORIGIN IN RELATION TO THEIR FUTURE CONDITION</ref></blockquote>

This concept of America's unique Bible-driven historical and cultural identity was developed by historians as they studied the first centuries of America's history, from the Pilgrims through Abraham Lincoln. The statements and institutions of the founding generation that have been preserved are numerous, and they explicitly describe many of their biblical motivations and goals, their interest in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]<ref>Most of the ten universities founded before the Revolution taught Hebrew.  To graduate from Harvard, students had to be able to translate the Old and New Testament from Latin to Hebrew.  Orations at graduation were in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.  Ezra Stiles, president of Yale, and a personal friend of the leading Jews of Newport, told the story in 1771 about an American Jew who brought a letter in Hebrew he received from Hebron in Judea to Stiles to be translated.

Perry Miller of Harvard University wrote in 1956:

<blockquote>Puritanism may be described empirically as that point of view, that code of values, carried to New England by the first settlers.  [<U+2026>] The New Englanders established Puritanism<U+2014>for better or worse<U+2014>as one of the continuous factors in American life and thought. It has played so dominant a role<U+2026>all across the continent<U+2026>these qualities have persisted even though the original creed is lost.

Chambers]], 463 U.S. 783 (1983), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a state legislature could constitutionally have a paid chaplain to conduct legislative prayers "in the Judeo-Christian tradition." In Simpson v. Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors,<ref>{{cite web|title=Simpson v. Chesterfield County, No. 04-1045|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/4th/041045p.pdf|work=UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT|date=2005|accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref> the [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] held that the Supreme Court's holding in the ''Marsh'' case permitting legislative bodies to conduct prayer in the "Chesterfield County could constitutionally exclude Cynthia Simpson, a [[Wicca]]n priestess, from leading its legislative prayers, because her faith was not 'in the Judeo-Christian tradition.'" Chesterfield County's board included Jewish, Christian, and Muslim clergy in its invited list.
