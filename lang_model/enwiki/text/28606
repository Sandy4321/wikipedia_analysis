{{Segregation}}
'''Racism and ethnic discrimination in the United States''' has been a major issue since the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] and the [[Slavery in the United States|slave era]]. Legally sanctioned racism imposed a heavy burden on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[African American]]s, [[Asian American]]s, and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin Americans]]. [[European American]]s (particularly [[Anglo-America|Anglo Americans]]) were privileged by law in matters of [[literacy]], [[immigration]], [[voting rights]], [[citizenship]], land acquisition, and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s. Many non-[[Protestant]] European immigrant groups, particularly [[Jews]], [[Irish people]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]], suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of discrimination in American society.

Major racially and ethnically-structured institutions included [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]], [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[Native American boarding schools|residential schools]] for Native Americans, and [[List of internment camps#United States|internment camps]].<ref>Internment camps are particularly associated with World War II, but also occurred during World War I. Most significant was the [[Japanese American internment]] of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. There was also internment of almost 11,000 German Americans in [[German American internment]] during World War II, and some [[Italian American internment]].</ref> Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well, yet racial politics remain a major phenomenon. Historical racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality,<ref>In his 2009 visit to the US, the [UN] Special Rapporteur on Racism noted that "Socio-economic indicators show that poverty and race and ethnicity continue to overlap in the United States. This reality is a direct legacy of the past, in particular slavery, segregation, the forcible resettlement of Native Americans, which was confronted by the United States during the civil rights movement. However, whereas the country managed to establish equal treatment and non-discrimination in its laws, it has yet to redress the socioeconomic consequences of the historical legacy of racism."{{Cite book | last = CERD Task Force of the US Human Rights Network | title = Universal Periodic Review Joint Reports: United States of America | chapter = From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Implementing US Obligations Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) | date = 2010-08 | page = 44}}</ref> and has taken on more modern, indirect forms of expression, most prevalently [[symbolic racism]].<ref>Henry, P.

At the same time, white respondents endorse many stereotypical beliefs, doubt the existence of significant racial discrimination, and show low levels of support for efforts to achieve racial equality through government intervention." {{Cite journal

===Racism against Native Americans===
[[File:Creeks in Oklahoma.png|thumb|left|Members of the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] in Oklahoma around 1877. Notice the members with European and African ancestry. The Creek were originally from the Alabama region.]] 

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years,<ref>Mann, Charles C., ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus'', Vintage Books, 2006, c.2005, p. 18</ref> had an enormously complex impact on American history and racial relations. During the colonial and independent periods, a long series of conflicts were waged, with the primary objective of obtaining resources of Native Americans. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as in the [[Trail of Tears]]), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken and numerous hardships imposed. In 1540, the first racial strife was with Spaniard [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition who enslaved and murdered in many [[New World]] communities. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.<ref name=brescia_era>

The Choctaws in [[Mississippi]] described their situation in 1849, "we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died."<ref name=peterson>

Ideological expansionist justification ([[Manifest Destiny]]) included stereotyped perceptions of all Native Americans as "merciless Indian savages" (as described in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]) despite successful American efforts at civilization as proven with the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Creek (people)|Creek]], and [[Choctaw]]. An egregious attempt occurred with the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. Under [[Alta California|Mexican rule in California]], Indians were subjected to ''de facto'' enslavement under a system of [[peon]]age by the white elite. While in 1850, California formally entered the [[United States|Union]] as a [[Free state (United States)|free state]], with respect to the issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the practice of Indian [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] was not outlawed by the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]] until 1863.<ref>[[Edward D. Castillo|Castillo, Edward D.]] (1998). ''[http://www.ceres.ca.gov/nahc/califindian.html Short Overview of California Indian History]", California Native American Heritage Commission.</ref>

Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.

====Discrimination, marginalization====
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.<ref>{{cite web

{{see also|Native American reservations}}
Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations&mdash;constituting just 4% of U.S. territory&mdash;and the treaties signed with them violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding school|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy, to "kill the Indian, save the man."<ref>Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006. The basis for this theory was that inside every native person, there was a repressed white person screaming to come to the surface. Abuse both physical and psychological was common in these schools, and often their objective of 'compulsory whiteness' was not even ultimately achieved, with many of the Indians who later returned to the reservations afterwards not at all 'becoming white', but instead simply becoming heavy [[alcoholic]]s and displaying signs of permanent psychological distress, and even [[mental illness]]. Further, these individuals were often either totally unemployable or only marginally employed, as it was sensed by those around them that on the one hand, they had not successfully assimilated into 'white society', nor were they any longer acceptable to the Indian societies from which they had originated.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_news_america/9097996.stm | work=BBC News | first1=Franz | last1=Strasser | first2=Sharon | last2=Carpenter | title=Native Americans battle teenage suicide | date=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

Further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present, although these current dispossessions, especially in terms of land, rarely make major news headlines in the country (e.g., the [[Lenape]] people's recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the [[State of New Jersey]]), and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur. Through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land from the [[Allotment Act]] forward, these concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10<U+2013>40 billion.<ref>United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&Other_id=12&Month=3&Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v. Kempthorne]. See also, [[Cobell v. Norton]].</ref>

===Racism against African Americans===
{{Main|African American history}}

Perhaps the most prominent and notable form of American racism (other than imperialism against Native Americans) began with the [[slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]], during which [[African]]s were enslaved and treated as [[property]].   Prior to the institution of slavery, early African and non-white immigrants to the Colonies had been regarded with equal status, serving as [[sharecroppers]] alongside whites. After the institution of slavery the status of Africans was stigmatized, and this stigma was the basis for the more virulent anti-African racism that persisted until the present.<ref>
[[Dinesh D'Souza]] ''[[The End of Racism]]'' pp. 79 "As the example of the Black slaveowner suggests, American slavery was not established because of racism but for the purpose of profit." D'Souza quoting [[Eugene Genovese]]: "Race relations did not determine the pattern of slavery in the New World; the patterns of slavery... determined race relations."</ref> African Americans were treated like second-class citizens. They were denied defense-industry jobs, and when the US entered [[World War II]], they could only serve in segregated units.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1940s: African Americans|url=http://ars.sirs.com/decades.html|work=SIRS Decades|accessdate=29.

==== Slavery and emancipation ====
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}

In colonial America, before [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] became completely based on racial lines, thousands of African slaves served European colonists, alongside other Europeans serving a term of [[indentured servitude]].<ref>{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml |title=The curse of Cromwell |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> In a precursor to the American Revolution, [[Nathaniel Bacon (colonist)|Nathaniel Bacon]] led a [[Bacon's Rebellion|revolt]] in 1676 against the Governor of [[Virginia]] and the system of exploitation he represented: exploitation of poorer colonists by the increasingly wealthy landowners where poorer people, regardless of skin color, fought side by side. However, Bacon died, probably of [[dysentery]]; hundreds of participants in the revolt were lured to disarm by a promised [[amnesty]]; and the revolt lost steam.<ref name="worldbook-nb">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1992 | title = Bacon, Nathaniel | encyclopedia = The World Book Encyclopedia | publisher = World Book |pages = 18 | isbn = 0-7166-0092-7}}</ref>

In the mid-18th century, American colonies with slavery, as South Carolina under Governor [[James Glen]], began to promote an official policy that aimed to create in Native Americans an "aversion" to African Americans in an attempt to thwart possible alliances between them.<ref name="PatrickMinges">{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X9W31OHDxQYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Slavery in the Cherokee Nation: the Keetoowah Society and the defining of a people, 1855-1867|page=27|author=[[Patrick Minges]]|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-94586-8}}</ref><ref name="KimberleyTolley">{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eoQ-aRXS4WwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Transformations in Schooling: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|page=228|author=Kimberley Tolley|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4039-7404-4}}</ref>

Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war. According to the 1860 U.S. census, there were about 385,000 slaveowners out of approximately 1.5 million white families.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, George Clack, and Mildred Sola Neely. [http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/historybrf/index.htm Outline of US History.] A publication of the US Department of State.</ref>

In the early part of the 19th century, a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed [[colony|colonization]], while others advocated [[emigration]]. During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&issue_id=75|title=Background on conflict in Liberia}}</ref> and in 1821 the A.C.S. established the colony of [[Liberia]], assisting thousands of former African-American slaves and free black people (with legislated limits) to move there from the United States. The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder [[Henry Clay]] stating; "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".<ref name=ATH>Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997). ''The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity.'' p.264. Duke University Press, 1997. ISBN 0-8223-1992-6</ref>

Although the Constitution had banned the importation of new African slaves in 1808, and in 1820 slave trade was equated with piracy, punishable by death,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/SlaverBackground.htm |title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels |publisher=Pdavis.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> the practice of chattel slavery still existed for the next half century. All slaves in only the areas of the [[Confederate States of America]] that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was issued on January 1, 1863 by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=34 |title=Emancipation Proclamation (1863) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> It should be noted that the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union, thus the document only freed slaves where the Union still had not regained the legitimacy to do so. Slavery was not actually abolished in the United States until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII - Slavery Abolished] The Avalon Project</ref>

About 4 million [[African American|black]] [[slavery|slaves]] were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.<ref>James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15</ref> Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[white American|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |title=The Deadliest War |publisher=Harvardmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

====Nadir of American race relations====
{{Main|Nadir of American race relations |Mass racial violence in the United States}}
[[File:Lynching-of-will-james.jpg|right|thumb|The mob-style [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] of Will James, Cairo, Illinois, 1909.]]

The new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Although technically able to vote, [[poll tax]]es, acts of terror (often perpetuated by groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clause]]s kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but also nationwide following the [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]] election at the end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era in 1877. In response to [[de jure]] racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.

This time period is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since. [[Racial segregation|Segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[lynchings]] and [[race riot]]s.

In addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City|New York]] ([[Harlem]]). In northern cities, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]]<U+2014>mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated<U+2014>increased dramatically in the 1920s. As a member of the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] chapter of the NAACP, [[Albert Einstein]] corresponded with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's "worst disease".<ref>Fred Jerome, Rodger Taylor (2006) [http://books.google.com/books?id=4d79VQdOfFUC&pg=PR10&dq=Einstein+on+Race+and+Racism+america's+worst+disease&hl=en&ei=rGkNTP-OB9DY4gaN6f1-&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Einstein on Race and Racism] Rutgers University Press, 2006</ref><ref>Warren Washington (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=dLhVn-McDDgC&pg=PA226&dq=racism+americas+worst+disease+1946&hl=en&ei=cWINTOqjGpKX4gavnK22AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Odyssey in Climate Modeling, Global Warming, and Advising Five Presidents]</ref>

From 1981 to 1997, the United States Department of Agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of African American farmers, denying loans provided to white farmers in similar circumstances. The discrimination was the subject of the [[Pigford v.

====Taking a nonviolent stand====
In February 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit-ins took place to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dream of Equality, 1954-1974|work=American History|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref>{{Broken citation|date=August 2012}}

===Discrimination against Latin Americans===
Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]") come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority.

After the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846<U+2013>1848), the U.S. annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico. Mexicans residing in that territory found themselves subject to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to lack of records in many reported lynchings). Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period, which suffered an average of 37.1 per 100,000 population.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-111897839.html The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> Between 1848 to 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_9 |title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 &#124; Journal of Social History &#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

During [[The Great Depression]], the U.S. government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens.<ref>http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=lawrev</ref>

The [[Zoot Suit Riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g. [[Mexican-Americans]]) in [[Los Angeles]] in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group.<ref>Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2.

(Aug., 1994), pp. 306-7.</ref></small>

Many public institutions, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. School children of Mexican American descent were subject to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved a Mexican American defendant. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/osi04.soc.ush.civil.mendez/ |title=Teachers' Domain: Mendez v.

People of Middle East and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle East, and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were "white" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a "common-knowledge" standard, concluding that "scientific evidence", including the notion of a "[[Caucasian race]]" including Arabs and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a "performance-based" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.<ref>John Tehranian, "Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America," ''[[The Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 109, No. 4.

Iranian people (who constitute a different ethnicity than Arabs), as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as "Arabs". The case of [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a [[white supremacist]] for "looking like an Arab terrorist" (because of the turban that is a requirement of [[Sikhism]]), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for "being Muslims" have achieved prominence and criticism following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|author=February 11, 2009, 8:55 PM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml |title=Hindu Beaten Because He's Muslim, Mistaken Anti-Islam Thugs Pummel, Hogtie And Stab Deliveryman |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp |title = ADL Condemns Hate Crime Against Hindu  |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) |accessdate = 2008-07-18}}</ref>

The November 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the [[Iranian Revolution|new Islamic regime]] and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mehdi|last=Bozorgmehr|title=No solidarity: Iranians in the U.S.|url=http://www.Iranian.com/Opinion/2001/May/Iranians/index.html#3a|work=The Iranian|date=2001-05-02|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>

====Antisemitism====
{{Main|Antisemitism in the United States}}
[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in America. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jews]] were escaping the [[pogroms]] in [[Europe]]. They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern [[Germany]], and largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York]].<ref name=Takaki-JewishMigr>Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 1993), 277-283.</ref>

It is thought by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book, '[[The Joys of Yiddish]]', that as soon as they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term '[[kike]]' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles - or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).<ref>Rosten, Leo (1968) "The Joys of Yiddish"</ref>

From the 1910s, the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used 'The Jewish Banker' in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Texas]]-born, [[New York]] Jew [[Leo Frank]] was lynched by the newly re-formed Klan, after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).<ref name="lynching openly organized">Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or ... see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."</ref>

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from America. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading America into the war.<ref name="Coughlin">[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891-1971)] By Richard Sanders, Editor, ''Press for Conversion!''</ref> He preached in weekly, overtly [[anti-Semitic]] sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].<ref name="Coughlin">Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E.

A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the [[Nation of Islam]] to be [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. Specifically, they claim that the [[Nation of Islam]] has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the [[Jews and the slave trade|role of Jews in the African slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html |title=H-ANTISEMITISM OCCASIONAL PAPERS, NO. 1M |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) alleges that NOI Health Minister, Abdul Alim Muhammad, has accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the [[AIDS]] virus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp |title=Nation of Islam |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> an allegation that Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad has denied.

===Anti-European immigrant ethnic discrimination===
{{main|Anti-Irish racism}}

Various [[European-American]] immigrant groups have been subject to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status (known as "[[Nativism (politics)|Nativism]]") or on the basis of their ethnicities (country of origin).

[[File:Philadelphia1844riot.jpg|thumb|[[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]].]]
[[File:NINA-nyt.JPG|thumb|''[[New York Times]],'' 1854 ad, reading "No Irish need apply."]]
In the 19th century, this was particularly true of anti-Irish prejudice, which was partly [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment, partly anti-Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholic and Protestant) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discimination and eventually blended into the American white population.

The 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and central Europe (notably [[Italian-American]]s and [[Polish American]]s), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as against Irish-Americans), and partly from [[Nordicism]], which considered non-Scandinavian or British immigrants as inferior <U+2013> see [[Nordic race#Nordicism in the USA|Nordicism in the USA]].

{{rquote|right|Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully.

Nordicism led to the reduction in Southern European and Russian immigrants in the [[National Origins Formula]] of the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration in proportion to existing populations. This reduced the inflow from the average prior to 1921 of 176,983 from northern, central and western Europe, and 685,531 for other countries, principally Southern and Russia, to a 1924 level of 140,999 for northern, central and western Europe, and 21,847 for other countries, principally Southern and Russia (from a 1:3.9 ratio to a 6.4:1 ratio).

There was also discrimination against German-Americans and Italian-Americans due to these being enemy countries in [[World War I]] (Germany) and [[World War II]] (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German-American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of [[German in the United States]] following WWI, which had hitherto been significant, and to [[German American internment]] and [[Italian American internment]] during WWII; see also [[German American#World War I anti-German sentiment|World War I anti-German sentiment]].

Specific European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of Black/White, as described and predicted by [[Lothrop Stoddard]], due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-White immigrant racism with anti-Black racism; and the [[Great Depression]] brought economic concerns to the fore.

Anti-Catholic sentiment remained evident in the presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]], who nevertheless went on to become the US's first Catholic (and indeed non-Protestant) president.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many immigrants came to the United States from Russia. A new type of racism which is based on the former Cold War stereotypes began to target white people from the former Soviet states. There are many jokes refer to a communist past, corruption, alcohol consumption, prostitution, and unemployment. Some people began to use words like ''Eurotrash, mafia, cracker, commie, [[Borat]]'', and ''Russki'' when refer to Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, or Balcan peoples: [[Serbs]], [[Albanians]] and others. During the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver NBC's commenter Mike Milbury used the term ''Eurotrash'' to describe the Russian hockey team. A "mock Irish" ska band from Boston called [[Dropkick Murphys]] wrote a song called "Eurotrash" which promotes violence against Europeans and European culture. Jokes about Russian mail brides, European prostitutes and fashion models, the revival of white ethnic (esp. anti-Polish and anti-Italian) stereotypes in movies and television shows (''[[Jersey Shore]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'', ''[[The Real Housewives of New Jersey]]'' and ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'') and offensive images became popular among young people in the United States.

===Racism and discrimination against European Americans===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
{{Contradict|date=May 2011}}
In addition to racism against European immigrants on the basis of their immigrant status or country of origin, there has also been discrimination against [[European American]]s on the basis of their ethnicity, regardless of country of origin. A general anti-white [[Term of disparagement|slur]] is "[[Cracker (pejorative)|cracker]]".

Some policies adopted as [[affirmative action]], such as [[racial quotas]] or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of "[[reverse discrimination]]".<ref>

In [[Hawaii]], there is an alleged tradition  dating at least to the 1950s, of the last day of school called "[[Kill Haole Day]]", "[[Haole]]" originally referring to foreigners, and more generally to white people. There is a custom, reported in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in 2003, of [[May Day]] (May 1) being "[[Beat Up a White Kid Day]]".

====White subgroups====
Certain subgroups of White Americans, while not identifying as separate races (often identifying as having "[[American ethnicity]]"), have distinct heritages and experience discrimination and low socioeconomic status as an ethnicity.

The status of poor rural whites has often been compared to that of blacks, being also seen as suffering from slavery (because they were unable to compete with the free labor of slaves). Such descriptions date to the 19th century, as in ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', and poor rural whites continue to lag on numerous socioeconomic indicators (health, income, and the like) <U+2013> see [[social and economic stratification in Appalachia]].

Other white subgroups who are sometimes subject of offensive humor, jokes, and stereotypes are [[Mennonites]] and [[Mormons]] (due to [[Mormonism|their religion]]), and [[French-Canadians]] (because their mother language is [[French language|French]]) as well people from the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and/or [[Southeastern United States]].

There are "blonde jokes" directed against women based on blonde hair color, a common trait among white Americans.

====Anti-White crimes====
{{Main|Hate crimes against white people}}
One series of unprovoked crimes that specifically targeted [[White Americans]] is the [[Zebra murders]] that occurred in San Francisco between 1973 and 1974. The Zebra murders were carried out by a group known as Death Angels (a radical splinter group of the [[Nation of Islam]]) that intended to kill whites to spread terror and earn favor and status within their sect.

Another series of crimes that specifically targeted whites is the 2002 [[Beltway sniper attacks]] which planned to kill six whites a day for 30 days,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mount |first=Harry |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1519411/The-snipers-plan-kill-six-whites-a-day-for-30-days.html |title=The sniper's plan: kill six whites a day for 30 days |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2006-05-25 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> and resulted in 10 deaths and 3 critical injuries. One of the snipers [[Lee Boyd Malvo]] testified that [[John Allen Muhammad]] was driven by hatred of America because of its "slavery, hypocrisy and foreign policy" and his belief that "the white man is the devil."

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, national anti-white hate groups that are currently active include [[Nation of Islam]] and [[New Black Panther Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Separatist|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/black-separatist|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> 

According to [[FBI]] statistics from 1995 to 2002, whites are the second most targeted group for racially motivated hate crime in New York City.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== History by region ==
In the popular imagination, racism is particularly associated with the American South, with its legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. However, all regions of the United States have exhibited racism in various forms and at various times. For example, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans (1910<U+2013>1930) from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, led to increased Black/White contact, racism, and segregation in the destinations.

=== West Coast racism ===
The Pacific and [[Western United States|Western]] states were often portrayed to those on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as more tolerant in terms of race relations in the 1960s and 1970s, but California legally allowed racial segregation of public facilities until the 1950s and other forms of racism were felt there as well.

Over the winter spanning 1929 and 1930, anti-[[Filipino people|Filipino]] racism exploded in the [[Central Coast of California|Central Coast]] area surrounding [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]] over labor tensions and general xenophobia. [[Filipino American|Filipino]] farm workers were terrorized for "taking jobs from whites", and for mixing with white women; in California, and many states, Filipinos were barred from marrying [[White Americans]] (a group which included [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]]s). Violence was directed towards Filipinos, some resulting in deaths, and a Filipino establishment was dynamited. A race war broke out in the Bay Area, with roving gangs of whites pulling Filipinos from their homes and dwellings, until the violence subsided. As a result of the riots, California's attitude changed towards importing cheaper Asian labor, moving towards utilizing cheaper Mexican labor instead.<ref name=WatsonvilleRiots>[http://www.pinnaclenews.com/life/contentview.asp?c=198024 Racial hate once flared on the West Coast]</ref>

{{See also|History of Oregon Racial Discrimination}}
A variety of laws were enacted to prevent African American migration to the [[Pacific Northwest]], primarily to keep slave masters from following and introducing their property laws disruptive to [[Free Soil Party]] economic principles, and to avoid enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]. While slavery was criminalized in the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1844, a so-called "lash law" subjected blacks found guilty of violating the law to whippings<U+2014>no less than 20 and no more than 39 strokes of the lash<U+2014>every six months "until he or she shall quit the territory". An exclusion law, barring African Americans from entering the territory was passed in 1847, repealed in 1854, and added to the new Oregon state constitution in 1857. While African Americans have been present at some level since 1805, the demographic reverberations of these laws remain, since they have typically settled in large numbers along with the plantation system or urban employment opportunities.<ref name=BlackTimeline>[http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/blaktime.html Timeline of Black History in the Pacific Northwest]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

==Racism as a factor in U.S. foreign policy==
The earliest decades of expansionist [[United States foreign policy]] making was often accompanied by racialist ideological justifications. While pursuing a series of expansionist wars (see "[[#Racism against Native Americans|Racism against Native Americans]]" above), American leaders embraced an ideology of [[white supremacy|white racial supremacy]]. [[George Washington]] predicted at the end of the [[U.S. Revolutionary War]], "The gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire; both being beasts of prey, tho' they differ in shape."<ref>Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1993), 22.</ref> The successful slave revolution in [[Haiti]] alarmed the United States leadership, and the country refused diplomatic recognition for decades. The United States conquest of [[Florida]] and the [[Seminole Wars]] were fought in part to confront the danger of "mingled hordes of lawless Indians and negroes", in the words of President John Quincy Adams.<ref name=Year501p24>Quoted in Noam Chomsky, ''Year 501: The Conquest Continues'', (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1993), 24.</ref>

Early 20th-century President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declared, "The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages" and openly spoke of cementing the rule of "dominant world races".<ref name=Year501p24 /> In line with the concepts of the "[[Manifest Destiny]]" of white Anglo-Americans to conquer lands inhabited by "inferior" races of Native Americans and Mexicans, and the "White Man's Burden" of Europeans' obligation to introduce civilization to the "primitive" people of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, American foreign policy in the early 20th century had racial overtones of a "superior" race destined to rule the world.

Critics such as [[Gore Vidal]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have suggested that racism has played a significant role in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and its treatment of the Arabs. Various critics have suggested that racism along with strategic and financial interests motivated the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] to attack Iraq even though the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] did not possess weapons of mass destruction nor had any ties to [[Al Qaida]].<ref>{{cite web|author=By Author |url=http://www.merip.org/mero/interventions/lockman_interv.html |title=MERIP Interventions: Behind the Battles Over US Middle East Studies, by Zachary Lockman |publisher=Merip.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamonitors.net/kristenschurr1.html |title=Racism in Reporting, Jingoism as Foreign Policy (by Kristen Schurr) - Media Monitors Network |publisher=Mediamonitors.net |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref>http://www.query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E6DA153BF93BA35750C0A964948260</ref> On the other hand, some scholars believe that the United States has softened racial restrictions based on foreign policy concerns.

===War on Drugs and Racism===
{{main|Race and the War on Drugs}}
The "[[War on Drugs]]", a term coined by President [[Richard Nixon]], was a law enforcement effort by US presidents starting from Nixon to oppose the sale, distribution and usage of illegal drugs. This term as well as the effects of this war, has become controversial for the way it has hurt Black people, racial minorities and poor people in the US. A big part of this effort has involved in the arresting of Americans (over 13 million) mostly of color.

One of every nine black families has a close relative in prison over aggressive arrests done by [[Law enforcement in the United States|US law enforcement]].<ref>{{cite web|author=from Brown University Plus 1 year ago not yet rated |url=http://vimeo.com/32110912 |title=Janus Forum - Should the US Legalize Drugs? on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> Even though usage of illegal drugs are roughly the same along racial lines, the Drug Policy Alliance Network shows that blacks constitute 13 percent of drug users, but are 38 percent of people arrested for drug offenses, and 59 percent of those convicted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/communities/race/ |title=Race and the Drug War &#124; Racial Discrimination in Drug Law Enforcement &#124; Drug Policy Alliance |publisher=Drugpolicy.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> The Human Rights Watch supported this claim as well, stating that of blacks convicted of drug crimes 71% are incarcerated, compared with 63% of convicted whites.<ref>http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us0309web_1.pdf</ref> US laws have a much higher penalty for possession and distribution of crack cocaine, a frequently used drug among African Americans and this affects the Black community as well.

==Conflicts between racial and ethnic minorities==

===Argument against minority-minority racism===
Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others.<ref>For example, Catherine A. Hansman, Leon Spencer, Dale Grant, Mary Jackson, "Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education," ''Journal of Instructional Psychology'', March 1999</ref>

===New Immigrant Blacks and African Americans===
The rapid growth in [[Africans in the United States|African]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants has come into conflict with American blacks. Interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks are, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation is not ordinarily based on color of skin but more on shared common, cultural experiences, and beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06044/654613.stm |title=African immigrants face bias from blacks |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=1969-12-31 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=5237459&page=1 |title=Racism not always black and white |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

=== Strife, conflict and reconciliation ===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
{{Original research|section|date=November 2009}}
The U.S. has long had experienced conflict and reconciliation between ethnic minority groups.

Historians point out after a period of conflict, ethnic and racial groups can band together in solidarity. For example, the competing [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] groups once held animosity against each other in the early 20th century, would later merge and also with [[Polish-Americans]], [[German-Americans]] and [[French-Canadians]] in the U.S. because of the commonality as "ethnics" and [[Roman Catholics]] in a primarily Protestant Anglo America by the 1940s and '50s. The modern American consciousness on race will consider descendants of European ethnic groups assimilated to become part of the larger "[[White American]]" group.

In the 1960s & '70s, African-American and [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] political activism banded together to battle the common problems of racial discrimination, poverty and underpresentation in many urban areas across the US like in [[New York City]]. Also to note there was substantial intermarriage between the newly-arrived [[Indian American]], later came the Filipino and Hispanic communities in California under similar working conditions and shared cultural values in the 1920s (see [[Punjabi Mexican American]]).

The current-day social melange of "minorities" and "people of color" echoes the previous experience of European ethnic groups' sense of "otherness" about 2 or 3 generations ago.

==Stereotypes and prejudice==
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
[[File:1900sc Mammy Card Interracial.jpg|thumb|This racist [[postcard]] from the 1900s shows the casual denigration of black women.

===Stereotypical images in the entertainment media===
{{See also|Stereotypes of African Americans|Stereotypes of East Asians in the Western world|Stereotypes of Native Americans}}
Popular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]]. Directly related to this was the institution of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]]. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" and the irrational, hypersexual male "buck".

Other stereotypes include the portrayal of East Asians as very small people with huge front teeth; the portrayal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as dangerous savages; the portrayal of Australians as blonde rednecks who do nothing but ride kangaroos and cook food on the barbie; and the portrayal of Frenchmen who wear berets and striped shirts, smoke, love watching [[Jerry Lewis]] and give up too easily.

=== Contemporary images and protests ===
Increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that [[rap music]] videos utilize African-American performers commonly enacting [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of scantily clothed women and men as thugs or pimps. Church organized groups have protested outside the residence of Phillipe Dauman (Upper East Side (New York, NY)) (president and chief executive officer of [[Viacom]]) and the residence of Debra L. Lee (Northwest Washington DC) (chairman and chief executive of [[Black Entertainment Television]], a unit of Viacom). Rev.

==Segregation and integration==
{{Main|Racial segregation in the United States}}

===History===
The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the [[United States]] and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to [[white American]]s. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. (These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800-66 [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]], which had restricted the [[civil rights]] and civil liberties of African Americans.) State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]]; none were in effect at the end of the 1960s.

Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.<ref name="vigdor">''The Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto'' David M.

Although in the [[United States]] informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, the practice called "redlining" began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 ''Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival''] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. ISBN 0-8133-3952-9. 2002. p. 114.

Black-White segregation is declining fairly consistently for most metropolitan areas and cities. Despite these pervasive patterns, many changes for individual areas are small.<ref>''Inequality and Segregation'' R Sethi, R Somanathan - Journal of Political Economy, 2004</ref> Thirty years after the civil rights era, the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which Blacks and Whites inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.<ref>''SEGREGATION AND STRATIFICATION: A Biosocial Perspective'' Douglas S.

Some researchers suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality.<ref name="lavest">..</ref> Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female Whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434<U+2013>8 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9518976}}</ref>

Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615<U+2013>7 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10754978}}</ref> Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998).

==Institutional racism==
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups, although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism.<ref>[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM</ref> There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).<ref>Bullock III, C. S. & Rodgers Jr., H. R. (1976) "Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping". ''Phylon'' 37 (3), 212-223.</ref>

===Immigration===
Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which refused naturalization to "non-whites". Many in the modern United States forget the institutionalized prejudice against white followers of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from countries such as [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].<ref>[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center</ref> Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=47 |title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |date=1968-07-01 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref><ref>[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] HistoricalDocuments.com</ref> The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Russians]] who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.

===Wealth creation===
Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of twenty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0726/Wealth-gap-widens-Whites-net-worth-is-20-times-that-of-blacks |title=Wealth gap widens: Whites' net worth is 20 times that of blacks |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, <U+201C>The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it<U+2019>s also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States.<U+201D><ref>Quoted in AP, "[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ Census report: Broad racial disparities persist]," November 14, 2006.</ref> Differentials applied to the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after [[World War II]]. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.<ref>George Lipsitz, "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0678%28199509%2947%3A3%3C369%3ATPIIWR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies]," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3. (Sep., 1995), pp. 369-387.</ref>

===Slavery by non-whites===
{{see also|Slavery in the United States}}
Before removal and "under white influence", some Southern Native American tribes owned African American slaves. The Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw were known to have had slaves. However, unlike white slaveholders, they encouraged the young black slaves to attend the schools opened for the Indian children. The children they had with black women and men were raised in practical equality with their full blooded offspring." <ref>Meltzer, Milton, ''Slavery: A World History'', A Da Capo Press, New York, 1993, p. 73</ref> Unlike the United States before [[Emancipation]], African Americans (and European Americans) were allowed to become citizens of their respective Native American nations; however, it was rare for African Americans to become citizens of Native American nations. For example, a small number of "Free People of Color" lived in many Native American nations as Cherokee, Choctaw, or Creek citizens.<ref name="first">

===Impact on health===
{{See also|Race and health}}
In the US racial differences in health and quality of life often persist even at equivalent socioeconomics levels. Individual and institutional discrimination, along with the stigma of inferiority, can adversely affect health. Residence in poor neighborhoods, racial bias in medical care, the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health.<ref name="raceSES">{{cite journal |author=Williams DR |title=Race, socioeconomic status, and health.

===Health care inequality===
{{See also|Race and health}}
There are major racial differences in access to [[health care]] and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites." The key differences they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate [[health insurance|insurance]], poor service, and reluctance to seek care.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woolf SH, Johnson RE, Fryer GE, Rust G, Satcher D |title=The health impact of resolving racial disparities: an analysis of US mortality data |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=2078<U+2013>81 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15569956 |pmc=1448594 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2078|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15569956}}</ref> A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.<ref>"The History of Black 'Paranoia',<U+201D> ch. 3 of Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press'', London: Verso, 1998.</ref>

Inequalities in health care may also reflect a [[systemic bias]] in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of [[Scientific racism|racism in science]] and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhopal R |title=Spectre of racism in health and health care: lessons from history and the United States |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7149 |pages=1970<U+2013>3 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9641943 |pmc=1113412 |doi= |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9641943}}</ref> Nancy Krieger contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism.

== Political issues ==

===Affirmative action===
{{Main|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is a policy or program intended to promote access to education or employment for minority groups and women. Motivation for affirmative action policies is to redress the effects of past discrimination and to encourage public institutions such as universities, hospitals, and police forces to be more representative of the population.

Some opponents of affirmative action view the policy as a form of [[reverse discrimination]]. In their view, these policies demonstrate an overt preference for applicants from particular backgrounds over better-qualified (or equally-qualified) candidates from other backgrounds. Some opponents of affirmative action believe the only consideration in choosing between applicants should be merit. Some also criticize affirmative action because they believe it perpetuates racial division instead of minimizing the importance of race in American society.<ref>''Cultural whiplash: the unforeseen consequences of America's crusade against racial discrimination'' / Patrick Garry (2006) ISBN 1-58182-569-2</ref>

Supporters of affirmative action believe that the perceived injustice to the dominant group is not supported by facts. They point to statistics that suggest that affirmative action has not resulted in fewer opportunities for white people. For example, white enrollment in universities has increased along with minority enrollment. In 1973, 30% of white high school graduates attended universities; in 1993, after widespread implementation of affirmative action policies, that number had risen to 42%.<ref name=Myths>[http://www.iupui.edu/~aao/myths.html Myths and Fact about Affirmative Action]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

===Hate crimes===
{{Main|Hate crime}}
Most [[hate crimes]] in the United States target victims on the basis of race or ethnicity (for Federal purposes, crimes targeting Hispanics based on that identity are considered based on ethnicity). Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings are: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.<ref>[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].</ref> There are more hate crimes against whites than against Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, and multiracial groups - a statistically expected trend given that there far more whites than other ethnic groups put together. By contrast, the National Criminal Victimization Survey, finds that per capita rates of hate crime victimization varied little by race or ethnicity, and the differences are not statistically significant.<ref>[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims and Police], Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.</ref>

The [[New Century Foundation]], a [[white nationalist]] organization founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes, and that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as "white".<ref>[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.</ref> Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the criminological mainstream view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."<ref>Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].</ref> NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.<ref>Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.</ref><ref>Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].</ref>

The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the [[murder of Vincent Chin]], an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by a two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he "looked like a Jap", an ethnic slur used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and that they were angry enough to beat him to death.

== Current hate groups ==
{{Main|Hate groups}}
[[Supremacism|Supremacist]], separatist, racist, and hate groups still operate in the United States. The [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], [[National Socialist Movement (United States)]], [[New Black Panther Party]], [[Nation of Islam]], [[United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]], [[Aryan Nations]], [[League of the South]], [[Voz de Aztl<U+00E1>n]], [[Nation of Yahweh]], the [[Jewish Defense League]], and the [[White Order of Thule]] are among the institutions most commonly identified in this way.

==Anti-racism==
{{Main|Anti-racism}}
Organizations known for anti-racist and civil rights activism are the [[NAACP]] (National Association of the Advancement of Colored People), the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]] (Southern Poverty Law Center), the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League), the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund]], the [[National Council of La Raza]] representing Latinos, the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]], the [[National Italian American Foundation]], the [[Japan Society|Japan Society of America]], and the [[National Congress of American Indians]] among others. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. There are also many individual and grassroots websites and movements that are against racism, such as: Islamophobia-watch.com, AgainstRacism.Info and numerous others across the World Wide Web. They aim to expose the racism and discrimination in its many forms in order to combat them.
