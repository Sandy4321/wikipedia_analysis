'''Norman Ellard "Norm" Nixon''' (born October 11, 1955) is a retired American professional basketball player for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], who spent twelve seasons with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers]].

==Early life==
Born the third of three boys to Mary Jo and Elmer Nixon, in [[Macon, Georgia]], his mother contracted [[myasthenia gravis]] when Norm was a baby, and his parents divorced when he was two years old.  The three boys were also raised with the help of his mother's mom and aunt (the boys' grandmother and great aunt).  He and his two brothers, Ken and Ron, attended the [[Methodist]] church, and Norm became an [[church usher|usher]].<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08>Howard-Cooper, Scott. - "Nixon realistic about latest comeback - If it doesn't work out, he can always write his poem on life in the NBA". - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - (c/o - ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''). - January 8, 1989.</ref>

===High school===
He played basketball and [[American football|football]] in high school at [[Southwest Magnet High School|Southwest High School]] in Macon, Georgia, and was named to all-state in both sports. In football he played [[defensive back]] and [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]], and was later offered a [[free agent]] tryout by both the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]].<ref name=LivingstonB-PI-1983-05-24>Livingston, Bill. - Little Guy Nixon Doesn't Fear Contact, Especially in Playoffs". - ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. - May 24, 1983.</ref>  He was senior class president and named as the starting guard on the Georgia All-State team for 1973, after leading Southwest to the 1973 state high school basketball championship under coach [[Donald "Duck" Richardson]].  Nixon also played the [[trumpet]] and was on the [[yearbook]] staff.  He was on the track team, ran the [[400 m|440 yard dash]], and won a regional title in the [[high jump]] at 6-feet, 5-inches.<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08 />

==Career==
===College===
He played four full seasons at [[Duquesne University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. While there he averaged 17.2 points-per-game (PPG), 5.5 assists-per-game (APG), and 4.0 rebounds-per-game (RPG), scoring 1,805 points and adding 577 assist in 104 games for his career with the [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne Dukes]].<ref name=NN-BR>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nixonno01.html Norm Nixon]. - Basketball-Reference.com.</ref>  Nixon was named first-team All-Eastern Eight Conference, and left holding the record for career assists.<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08 /> 

On January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]] ([[Cincinnati]]), the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jerseys of five of its all-time greatest players, including Nixon's #10 (also retired: [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]], [[Sihugo Green]], [[Dick Ricketts]] and [[Willie Somerset]]).<ref name="jerseys">Duquesne University Men's Basketball History: [http://goduquesne.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111202aaa.html "Retired Jerseys"]. - Duquesne University Athletics. - Retrieved: 2007-09-17.</ref>

===NBA career===
Nixon was the 22nd overall pick in the [[1977 NBA Draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. He played for the Lakers for six successful seasons and helped them to win NBA championships in [[1980 NBA Finals|1980]] (4<U+2013>2) and [[1982 NBA Finals|1982]] (4<U+2013>2), both against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. The same two teams would meet in the [[1983 NBA Finals]], but Philadelphia won this series four games to none. In the 1978 ([[Seattle SuperSonics]]), 1979 (Seattle), and 1981 ([[Houston Rockets]]) playoffs, the Lakers were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion.

He led the team in scoring in the 1982 playoffs.<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08 />

In game one of the 1983 finals he had a violent collision with [[Andrew Toney]] of the 76ers early in the first quarter. As he came off the floor, coach [[Pat Riley]] asked Nixon "You need a blow?", to which Nixon replied: "No, a casket".<ref name=LivingstonB-PI-1983-05-24 />  He would continue to play in game one and game two despite a separated shoulder.<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08 />

Prior to the start of the [[1983<U+2013>84 NBA season|1983<U+2013>84 season]] he was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers|San Diego Clippers]] in exchange for the draft rights to guard [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]]. 

In his first year with the Clippers, Nixon led the league in assists and made the All-Star team for the second time in the 1984<U+2013>85 season.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nixonno01.html Norm Nixon player page]</ref>  After the 1985<U+2013>86 season, he spent much of his later career on the injured list, spending more than two full seasons on the injured list before retiring for good at the end of the [[1988<U+2013>89 NBA season|1988<U+2013>89 season]].  During his time with the Clippers he would never make it to the playoffs again.

For the 1978<U+2013>79 season he tied [[Eddie Jordan (basketball)|Eddie Jordan]] of the [[New Jersey Nets]] for the NBA lead in steals with 201,<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1979_leaders.html "1978-79 NBA Expanded Leaders"] - Basketball-Reference.com</ref> and total games (82 regular season + 23 playoffs = 105).  The next season (1979<U+2013>80) he led the league in minutes played (3,226), minutes per game (39.3), and was third in assists with 642.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980_leaders.html "1979-80 NBA Expanded Leaders"]. - Basketball-Reference.com.</ref>  Led the league in assists for the 1983-84 season with 914, and regular season games played (82).<ref name=NN-BR />

He missed the 1986<U+2013>87 season after stepping into a hole during a softball game in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] during the summer of 1986 (July 23, 1986) and suffered severe damage to the tendon just above his left knee. Nixon ruptured his right achilles tendon during a pre-season practice on November 4, 1987; the injury would cause him to miss the entire 1987<U+2013>88 season.<ref name=ZeiglerM-SDU-1988-03-23>Zeigler, Mark. - "After two career-threatening injuries, the Clippers' Norm Nixon still is planning to ... BOUNCE BACK". - ''[[San Diego Union]]''. - March 23, 1988.</ref>  Before being injured he had played in 715 of 725 games available in his first nine seasons.<ref name=Howard-CooperS-HC-1989-01-08 /> 

During his NBA career, Nixon scored 12,065 points (15.7 points per game) and had 6,386 assists (8.3) in 768 games played. Although he had impressive statistics, he may be remembered most for faking a [[free throw]] at the end of a Lakers-[[San Antonio Spurs]] game on November 30, 1982, which caused a double lane violation.<ref>Swansburg, John. - [http://www.slate.com/id/2185852/sidebar/2186022/ "The NBA dares to trifle with the sports-time continuum"]. - ''[[Slate Magazine]]''.</ref>  The referees erroneously ordered a jump ball, instead of requiring Nixon to re-shoot the free throw. The Lakers got the ball and Nixon made a field goal to tie the game, where they prevailed in overtime. The last three seconds of the game were later replayed in April 1983.

==Post NBA==
After retiring from the NBA in March 1989, Nixon played for [[Victoria Libertas Pesaro|Scavolini Pesaro]] of the Italian major-league [[Serie A (basketball)|Serie A]] in April and May.<ref>SPORTS: "Update". - ''[[USA Today]]''. - April 11, 1989.</ref>  In August 1989 Valerio Bianchini (who had coached Pesaro the previous season) head coach of [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Messaggero Roma]] tried to get Nixon to come play for the 1989<U+2013>90 season.<ref>Voisin, Ailene. - "Soviet Finds Summer League Hard, but He's Living NBA Dream - Volkov a Sign of Changing Times". - ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''. - August 4, 1989.</ref>

He became a [[sports agent]] (at Premier Management Group Inc. and then later Norm Nixon & Associates) representing such clients as [[Doug Edwards]],<ref>Voisin, Ailene. - "Hawks' No. 1 choice makes a good first pick". - ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''. - July 9, 1993.</ref> [[Samaki Walker]], [[Jalen Rose]], [[Maurice Taylor]], Teddy Dupay, [[Gary Grant]], [[Gerald Fitch]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Peter Warrick]], [[Larry Smith (defensive tackle)|Larry Smith]], and [[Al Wilson]]. And entertainers such as [[LL Cool J]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]].<ref name=WertheimLJ-SI-2005-07-11>Wertheim, L. Jon. - "Norm Nixon: An original Showtimer, he hasn't mellowed or slowed down". - ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. - July 11, 2005.</ref><ref>Broussard, Chris. - "PRO BASKETBALL - Nixon Is Still Giving Assists as an Agent". - ''[[New York Times]]''. - February 29, 2004.</ref>

Founded the Debbie Allen Dance Academy (DADA) in [[Culver City, California]] with his wife.<ref name=WertheimLJ-SI-2005-07-11 /> 

In his retirement years, Nixon concentrated on several business ventures, and served one season as [[radio commentator]] for the Clippers (2004<U+2013>05), as well as doing analyst work for [[KABC-TV]]'s NBA post-game shows during the mid-2000s.

Subsequently, he was hired by [[Fox Sports West]] to take over [[Jack Haley (basketball)|Jack Haley]]'s position as studio [[color analyst]] for all Lakers home games, working alongside studio host Bill McDonald during pregame, halftime, and post game coverage.

==Personal life==
Nixon has been married to actress/producer/director/dancer [[Debbie Allen]] since 1984 and they have three children, actor [[DeVaughn Nixon]] (Allen is his stepmother), dancer [[Vivian Nixon|Vivian Nichole Nixon]], and basketball player Norman Ellard Nixon Jr. ([[Wofford College]] & [[Southern University]]).<ref>PEOPLE: "AND BABY MAKES FOUR". - ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. - September 2, 1987.</ref><ref>Mackall, Dave. - "Nixon fondly remembers Duquesne". - ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''. - May 31, 2007.</ref><ref>Schiefelbein, Joseph. - "Spivery, Jaguars to begin practice". - [[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|''The Advocate'']]. - October 17, 2008.</ref>   Debbie Allen is also the sister of actress [[Phylicia Rashad]]. 

Before they were married, both Nixon and Allen appeared in the 1979 film ''[[The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh]]'' (a film that also featured NBA stars [[Julius Erving]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079154/fullcredits#cast Full cast and crew for: ''The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh'' (1979)]. - [[IMDb]].</ref>
