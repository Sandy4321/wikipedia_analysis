'''Mansoor Ijaz''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+0646><U+0635><U+0648><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0639><U+062C><U+0627><U+0632>}}) (born August 1961) is an [[United States|American]] venture financier and hedge-fund manager. He is founder and chairman of Crescent Investment Management Ltd, a New York and London-based investment firm that operates ''CARAT'', a proprietary trading system developed by Ijaz in the late 1980s. He was born in Florida to Pakistani immigrant parents and raised in Virginia's [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. He was educated at the University of Virginia and earned his graduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is married and has five children.

Ijaz has run Crescent as a quantitative asset manager for the past 25 years, integrating venture capital investments into the company's activities during the past decade. His venture investments include recent efforts to acquire a stake in [[Lotus F1]], a [[Formula One]] team. He was for some time a media analyst focusing on Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the role of [[Muslim-American]]s in U.S. political life. In the 1990s, Ijaz and his companies were significant contributors to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] institutions as well as the presidential candidacies of [[Bill Clinton]]. During that time, he acted as an unofficial channel for communications between the United States and foreign governments, notably of Sudan, India and Pakistan. 

During the first Clinton term, when the U.S. had severed official ties with Sudan, Ijaz opened informal communications links between Washington and Khartoum in an effort [[:File:Bashir letter to Hamilton.jpg|to gain access to Sudanese intelligence data]] on [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]], who were operating from Sudan at the time. Ijaz, who is of Pakistani descent, was involved in efforts to [[:File:2000.08.17 KASHMIR Sayed Salahuddin Letter to Clinton on Peace Offer.jpg|broker a ceasefire]] in Kashmir in 2000<U+2013>2001. He was also involved in the [[Memogate (Pakistan)|Memogate]] controversy, in which former Pakistani envoy [[Husain Haqqani]] allegedly used Ijaz to [[:File:Mullen Memorandum & Judicial Commission Report.jpg|deliver a memorandum]] to senior U.S. officials in order to thwart an attempted coup by the Pakistani military after bin Laden was killed.

==Professional life==

===Wall Street career===
[[File:M IJAZ Lotus F1 Grid MC.jpg|alt=Ijaz at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2013|thumb|right|220px|Ijaz at the [[Monaco Grand Prix]], 2013]]
Mansoor Ijaz began his career on [[Wall Street]] in 1986, joining [[Van Eck Global|Van Eck Associates Corporation]] as a technology analyst. In 1990, Ijaz left Van Eck to start Crescent Investment Management LLC, where he developed a trading system, ''"Computer-Aided Regression Analysis Techniques"'' ''(CARAT)'', to manage his first hedge fund. His mentor at Van Eck, Klaus Buescher, joined Crescent as president in 1991, and they together managed the company until Buescher's death in June 1997. Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment adviser and venture investing firm.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=38Q6p6VPqSkC|title=Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror|last=Miniter|first=Richard| publisher=[[Regnery Publishing|Regnery]]|isbn=9781621571117|year=2003|accessdate=2014-03-19|page=117}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, Crescent transitioned from a traditional hedge-fund management firm to a focus on venture investments, initially in homeland security technologies after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Ijaz formed and listed Crescent Technology Ventures PLC on London's [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM Stock Exchange]] to raise venture capital for his projects, but changes in AIM Rules for small-cap investment companies forced the start-up to de-list a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/companies-and-advisors/aim/advisers/aim-notices/aim-13-final-clean.pdf|title=AIM Notices|publisher=[[London Stock Exchange]]|date=2005-03-18|accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref> In the 2000s, Ijaz also launched an effort to finance and build what would have been the world's first underwater hotel, [[Hydropolis]].

Crescent's venture investments include a bid to acquire a stake in Lotus F1, a Formula One team, together with its Abu Dhabi affiliate, Al Manhal International Group LLC. Quantum Motorsports Limited, a partnership between Crescent and Al Manhal, announced its intention to acquire 35% of Lotus F1 in June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/10130010/Lotus-will-be-the-No-1-team-on-the-Formula-One-grid-within-a-year-claims-new-investor-Mansoor-Ijaz.html|title=Lotus will be the No. 1 team on the Formula One grid 'within a year', claims new investor Mansoor Ijaz|last=Cary|first=Tom| publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=2013-06-19|accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref> The deal's closing suffered numerous financing delays, remaining incomplete as negotiations with Lotus continued into 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/112169|title=Lotus Formula 1 team talks with Quantum continue|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|publisher=''[[Autosport]]''|date=2014-01-21|accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref>

Mansoor Ijaz was involved in unofficial negotiations<ref name="Miniter2013"/> between the U.S. and [[Sudanese government|Sudanese]] governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to [[CIA activities in Sudan|Sudan's intelligence files]] on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of [[Al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda's network]] there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996.

In April 1997, [[Omar al-Bashir]] [[:File:Bashir letter to Hamilton.jpg|sent a letter]] to Hamilton, hand-carried by Ijaz from Khartoum to Washington D.C., in which Sudan made an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and other U.S. intelligence agencies.<ref name="HR Testimony 1997"/> [[Madeleine Albright]], then newly appointed Secretary of State, decided to test the Sudanese government's moderating public stance, and on September 28, 1997 she announced that certain U.S. diplomats would return to Khartoum to pursue, among other objectives, obtaining Sudan's counterterrorism data.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/world/slowly-us-is-returning-some-envoys-to-the-sudan.html|title=Slowly, U.S. Is Returning Some Envoys To the Sudan|last=Krauss|first=Clifford|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1997-09-28|accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> According to former U.S. Ambassador to Sudan [[Timothy M.

Capturing bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton until his death in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html|title=Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing Bin Laden|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2006-09-24|accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref> Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of [[Hezbollah]], [[Hamas]], Egypt's [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and Iran's [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guard]], among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of [[Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa#Somalia|bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia]], some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters]] in Mogadishu in October 1993.<ref name="Ijaz"/> Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.

However, the [[9/11 Commission]] found that although ''"former Sudanese officials claim that Sudan offered to expel bin Laden to the United States", "...&nbsp;we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim."''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_5.pdf|title=9-11 Commission Report|date=2004-07-22|accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref> Amb.

===Ceasefire negotiations in Kashmir===
In 2000 and 2001, Ijaz was involved in efforts to broker a [[Kashmir conflict|ceasefire in Kashmir]], the cause of [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts#Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|multiple wars]] between India and Pakistan since independence. He held a series of meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held [[Kashmir]] from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas.<ref name="Gopal">{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/architects-and-wreckers-of-the-kashmir-plan-1.287347|title=Architects and Wreckers of the Kashmir Peace Plan|last=Gopal|first=Neena|publisher=''[[Gulf News]]''|date=2005-05-11|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of [[Research and Analysis Wing|India's intelligence directorate]], Dar declared a unilateral ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's [[Hizbul Mujahideen]], widely believed to have been supported by [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani intelligence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-2/narayanan.html|title=The Hizbul-Mujahideen Ceasefire<U+2013>Who Aborted It?|last=Menon|first=Jaideep|publisher=[[Bharat Rakshak|Bharat Rakshak Monitor]]|date=Sep<U+2013>Oct 2000| accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in Kashmir, Ijaz met [[Pervez Musharraf|Gen. Pervez Musharraf]] in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.<ref name="Gopal"/>

Ijaz carried Musharraf's message to senior Indian officials, including India's then-deputy intelligence chief, [[C. D. Sahay]]. Sahay and Ijaz worked together to develop a comprehensive blueprint<ref name="Gopal"/> for participation of a wider cross-section of Kashmiri resistance groups, particularly militant groups operating from [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistan-held Kashmir]]. In late summer 2000, Ijaz traveled to [[Muzaffarabad]] to negotiate with Hizbul Mujahideen commander [[Syed Salahuddin]]. That meeting resulted in Salahuddin [[:File:2000.08.17 KASHMIR Sayed Salahuddin Letter to Clinton on Peace Offer.jpg|issuing a letter]] to President Clinton,<ref name="Ijaz IHT">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/opinion/22iht-edijaz.t.html|title=A Workable Peace Plan for Kashmir|last=Ijaz|first=Mansoor| publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> hand-carried to the White House by Ijaz, in which the Kashmiri leader requested Clinton's support for Salahuddin's further steps in Kashmiri ceasefire negotiations.

The plan drafted by Sahay and Ijaz<ref name="Ijaz IHT"/> reportedly became the basis of a decision by India's prime minister, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to announce a unilateral ceasefire in [[Jammu and Kashmir|Indian-held Kashmir]] in November 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/printedition/int/pakistan20.htm|title=India Announces One-Month Cease-Fire in Kashmir; Unilateral Move Aimed at Opening Talks With Rebel Groups|last=Constable|first=Pamela|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=2000-11-20|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> To broaden support for the plan, Ijaz met with senior Indian government officials in New Delhi and leaders of Kashmiri resistance groups in [[Srinagar]]. He would later bring the two sides together for face-to-face negotiations. But Ijaz's efforts to build permanent peace ended in early 2001 when he shared his plans with Indian home minister [[L. K. Advani]] to bring Pakistan's [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|radical Islamic groups]] on board in support of wider Indo-Pakistani peace.<ref name="Gopal"/>  A resulting [[Agra summit|peace summit]] between India and Pakistan, held in Agra in June 2001, sought to forge an agreement on a permanent resolution to the Kashmir conflict, but Musharraf and Vajpayee ultimately failed to persuade their hardliners to allow signing of an accord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/indo-pakistani-military-standoff/|title=Indo-Pakistani Military Standoff: Why It Isn't Over Yet|last=Kampani|first=Gaurav|publisher=Senior Research Associate at Monterey Institute of International Studies|date=2002-06-01|accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>
