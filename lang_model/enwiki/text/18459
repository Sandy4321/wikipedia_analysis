==Background information==
The historical context of the Iglesia ni Cristo lies in a period of the early [[20th century]] characterised by a variety of rural anti-[[colonialism]] movements, often with religious undertones, in the [[Philippines]]. At this time, U.S. [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] work was exposing [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino culture]] to many alternatives to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] installed under earlier [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]].<ref name="Partridge">Partridge, Christopher (Ed.)

After Felix Manalo joined and left many religious organizations as a young adult,<ref name="GM25Y1993">'25 Years in the West, ''God's Message'' (Manila: 1993)</ref>
he declared that God gave him a mission to preach the [[gospel]] and to reestablish the first [[church]] founded by [[Jesus]].<ref name="Crisostomo">[http://www.iglesianicristo.us/fymbio.html Crisostomo, Isabelo T. 'Felix Y. Manalo and the Iglesia ni Cristo', ''Pasugo'' (May-June 1986)]</ref>

==Missionary activities==

INC members are instructed by their administration to invite people to Bible Studies and evangelical missions (known as ''Pamamahayag'' in Filipino), and to distribute magazines and pamphlets which are given to them by the administration.

In the [[Philippines]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programs are produced, and they are broadcast on 1062 [[Hertz|kHz]] DZEC-[[AM broadcasting|AM radio]], DZEM 954kHz, the [[Net 25]] [[television station]] operated by Eagle Broadcasting Corporation, the broadcast division of the Iglesia ni Cristo and GEM TV, the sister station to NET 25, also owned by the INC and broadcast on cable. 

In [[North America]], a [[television program]] called ''The Message'' is produced in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  It is currently aired in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and some parts of [[Europe]]. Each 30-minute program is hosted by one of a panel of INC ministers, who share the main beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo with a [[television]] [[audience]].<ref name="VisionTV">[http://www.visiontv.ca/Programs/mosaic_christian.html#message 'Mosaic Christian Programs', ''Vision TV'' (2005)].

More recently, [[DWDM-TV|GEM-TV]] began broadcasting on [[List of DirecTV channels|DirecTV]] channel 2068.

[[Image:felixManalo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Felix Manalo on the cover of the Pasugo]]
The official INC [[magazine]] available to INC congregations worldwide is entitled ''God's Message'' or ''Pasugo''. For many years the INC published the bilingual ''Pasugo'' for the Philippines and a separate all-English ''God's Message International Edition'' for usage abroad. In [[January 2004]], the administration of the INC began to publish only one magazine both in the Philippines and abroad bearing the name ''God's Message''. While predominantly English, the latest version contains a Filipino Section. The [[magazine]] consists of letters to the [[editing|editor]], [[news]] from locales worldwide, religious [[poetry]], articles relating to INC beliefs, a [[telephone directory|directory]] of locales outside the [[Philippines]] and would also feature a schedule of worship services until recently.

==Membership and doctrines==
<div class="boilerplate seealso">
:''For more details on {{{2|this topic}}}, see [[Fundamental Beliefs of Iglesia ni Cristo]].''</div>
Membership in the INC is conferred through [[baptism]]. People who wish to be baptized in the INC must first submit to a formal process taking at least six months. Once someone officially registers with their locale, the person is given the status of ''Bible Student'', as they are called within the Iglesia ni Cristo, and taught the twenty-six lessons concerning fundamental [[doctrine]]s of the INC. In the [[United States]], there are an additional three lessons taught for a total of twenty-nine, which mainly contain information about the Church and its beginnings in the Philippines. These lessons are contained in the doctrine manual written by [[Era<U+00F1>o G. Manalo]] entitled ''[[Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo|Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ)]]''. This book is given to ministers, evangelical workers, and ministerial students of the INC. Each lesson is usually thirty minutes to one hour in length.

After hearing all of the lessons, the students enter their probationary period during which they are obliged to attend fifteen once a week group prayer meetings, wherein they are taught to pray and are guided in their adjustment to the INC lifestyle.

When the sixth month comes, the students who have been active in attending the twice a week worship services and whose lifestyles are in accordance with INC doctrines are screened before being baptized. During the screening they are asked questions about the doctrines taught to them. Those who pass the screening are scheduled to be baptized.

Since understanding is necessary before being baptized in the INC, the minimum age for baptism is set at around eleven and at least the 6th grade. Newborn children of members are instead "offered" during the worship service. The child offering in the INC is done through a prayer led by an ordained minister of the INC.<ref name="FBINC-baptism">Manalo, Era<U+00F1>o G., 'Baptism', ''Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ)'', Leksyon #22 (In Filipino, the corresponding lesson is lesson #19, 'Ang Bautismo'  (Manila: Iglesia ni Cristo, 1989)</ref>

Members who are not living in accordance with the doctrines taught in the INC are admonished. Those who continue in violation of INC doctrines after being admonished are expelled from the INC. Certain violations, such as eating blood or marrying non-members may result in mandatory expulsion after the first proven offense, just like in [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref name="DLTYMS"><U+2018>Ang Pinakamabigat Na Parusa Na Maaaring Igawad Sa Isang Iglesia Ni Cristo<U+2019>, Leksyon #10, Doktrina 3b (Doctrinal lessons for third year ministerial students), 1998 Iglesia ni Cristo</ref><ref name="Shepherd" />

==Central office==
[[Image:Central temple.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Iglesia ni Cristo Central Temple in New Era, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]]]
The INC's Central Administration is the Iglesia ni Cristo Central Office; a large, secured complex located on [[Quezon City#Commonwealth and Balara|Commonwealth Avenue]], New Era, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. An editorial in the [[July 25]], [[2004]] issue of ''[[Philippine Panorama Magazine]]'' described the complex as including: the six-story Central Office Building; the 7,000-seat [[temple|Central Temple]]; the [[Tabernacle (disambiguation)|Tabernacle]], a multi-purpose hall; the 30,000 seating-capacity Central Pavilion; the College of Evangelical Ministry; the New Era General Hospital; and the [[New Era University]]. There is also a residence for the family of Executive Minister, [[Era<U+00F1>o G. Manalo]] on the premises as well as one for the family of [[Eduardo V. Manalo]], the Deputy Executive Minister.

==Politics==
Ever since former [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] created a lasting friendship after asking [[Felix Manalo]] for advice, the INC has been known for its strong [[politics|political]] [[influence]]. It was well-known for its support of President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] until his ousting during the [[EDSA Revolution]] of [[1986]].<ref name="Mangahas">Mangahas, Malou; "[http://www.pcij.org/stories/2002/inc.html Church at the Crossroads]", ''Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism'', [[April 29]], [[2002]]</ref>

This has given INC strong political influence on elected officials. Newspaper reports say that the Philippine Congress decision to uphold the decision on September 2005 to reject the Arroyo impeachment complaint was swayed by largely by INC influence. One newspaper reported that [[Erano Manalo]] personally called each and every lawmaker.<ref name="Cabacungan">[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=49385 Tubeza, Philip C.; Cabacungan, Gil Jr., 'INC tipped balance for GMA, says solon' ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' (Manila: September 7, 2005) p.

Others, however, argue that the INC vote is only significant in close-run elections, noting that INC-supported candidates, [[Senator]] Sergio Osme<U+00F1>a Jr. lost in [[1969]] to Marcos and businessman [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]] lost to [[Fidel Ramos]] in [[1992]].<ref name="Danao">Danao, Efren L.; Cruz, Maricel V., 'INC vote may be overrated factor' ''The Manila Times'' (Manila: May 04, 2004)</ref>

Not all candidates in Philippine politics embraced support from INC. Macapagal-Arroyo's father, [[Diosdado Macapagal]] has refused INC's preferred support during his runs for [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] in [[1957]], and re-election for [[President of the Philippines|President]] in [[1965]] &ndash; in which he incidentally lost to [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]]. According to Macapagal's official website, he declined support in order to "advance the maturization of Philippine democracy."<ref name="Macapagal">[http://www.macapagal.com/dm/profile.htm Macapagal, Diosdado 'Autobiography']</ref>. There is no evidence of public claims of such political influence outside the Philippines.

The INC also maintains a party-list, called [[Alagad]].

==Criticism==
The Iglesia ni Cristo has come under fierce criticism from [[apologetic]]s groups and other [[religion]]s mainly due to disagreements over their doctrines and beliefs regarding the interpretation of the [[Bible]]. They have also been criticized by non-religious groups for their political influence and supposed restraint of [[press freedom]].

===From religious groups===
Dr. [[Karl Keating]], the founder of [[Catholic Answers]] claims that Dr. Jose Ventilacion, an INC minister and one of their chief debaters, broke an agreement in 1990 for a one-on-one debate made by the two organizations in [[National City, California]]. Instead of a one-on-one debate, Keating states that Ventilacion had three helpers assisting him, and that they were shouting at him during the debate. He also claims that ''God's Message'' magazine is dedicated more to criticizing and attacking Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] beliefs and doctrines (by referring to them as "tools of [[Satan]]" for example), rather than explaining their own positions.<ref name="Keating">[http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1990/9002fea1.asp Keating, Karl 'Into the Maw of the Cult' ''This Rock'' (San Diego: Catholic Answers, February 1990)] - Retrieved [[May 17]], [[2006]]</ref> 

The Catholic Church refutes INC's claim that the beast of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] is the Pope, a common belief shared by other religious movements. INC claims that the pope's title, [[Vicarius Filii Dei]], Latin for Vicar of the Son of God, adds up to 666 which is the the "[[Number of the Beast]]", and the Iglesia ni Cristo also allegedly claimed that it is engraved on the Pope's [[tiara]], a charge that has been proven false<ref name="Keating" /> and a claim formerly shared by some in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], but now officially rejected.<ref name="QuickQuestions">[http://www.newadvent.org/library/almanac_thisrock92.htm 'Quick Questions' ''This Rock'' (San Diego: Catholic Answers, 1992)] as cited by NewAdvent.org's Catholic Library</ref> The Catholic Church also declared that [[Vicarius Filii Dei]] has never been an "official title" of the pope.<ref name="QuickQuestions" />

Catholic Answers also rejects the INC's doctrines of [[apostasy]] within the [[Catholic Church]] and does not consider the verses used to support the doctrine of the Iglesia ni Cristo being prophesied nor the apostasy of the Catholic church are used in the right context. It contends that other verses are difficult to reconcile with the views of the Iglesia ni Cristo.<ref name="catholic.com">[http://www.catholic.com/library/Iglesia_Ni_Cristo.asp 'Iglesia ni Cristo', ''Catholic Answers'' (San Diego: Catholic Answers, August 2004)]. Retrieved [[July 5]] [[2005]].</ref> 

Let Us Reason Ministries, an online apologetics research group, criticized the INC for holding the belief that it has the sole authority from [[God]] to interpret and preach the Bible, while other religions do not. They also claim that the INC intentionally misinterprets and misappropriates verses to agree with their doctrines and that they use fallacious arguments against other religions,<ref name="LetUsReason1">Oppenheimer, Mike "[http://www.letusreason.org/Iglesia8.htm How the Church teaches]", ''Let Us Reason ministries'' (2002).

Dr. [[Charles Caldwell Ryrie]] has criticized the INC for allegedly misquoting his Ryrie Study Bible regarding {{bibleverse||John|1:1|!all}} in the May/June [[1984]] issue of the ''Pasugo''. Ryrie has been quoted as saying, in a letter to Robert Elliff, the author of the book, ''Iglesia Ni Cristo: The Only True Church?'' "Anyone can look in my Study Bible and see how conveniently this author [the INC] omitted the last phrase in the note of John 1:1."<ref name="Elliff">[http://www.examineiglesianicristo.com/honesty3.html Elliff, Robert 'Iglesia Ni Cristo: The Only True Church?' (1989)] - Retrieved [[September 10]], [[2005]]</ref>

===Secular criticism===
The main accusation of restraint of press freedom arises from the church's seeking of [[prior restraint]] on [[Ross Tipon]]'s book, ''The Power and the Glory: The Cult of Manalo'') for alleged gross inaccuracies,<ref name="Echeminada">[http://jesus-messiah.com/philippines/inc/philstar.html Echeminada, Perseus.

Retrieved [[July 3]] [[2005]].</ref> Critics claim that the INC is stifling free speech by banning an unpublished book, and Tipon claims infringement on his free speech rights. An [[attorney]] representing the INC, Abraham Espejo states "The publication of the criminal manuscript will trigger social unrest, Millions of people may come out in the streets and this may lead to violence." The Iglesia ni Cristo alleges that the book has defamed its organization and [[Felix Manalo]].
