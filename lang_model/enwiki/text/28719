'''''When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships''''' is a 1999 book by [[Eric Ludy|Eric]] and [[Leslie Ludy]], an American married couple. After becoming a [[bestseller]] on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, [[courtship]], and marriage. The authors advise [[Single person|single people]] not to be [[Physical intimacy|physically]] or [[Emotional intimacy|emotionally intimate]] with others, but to wait for the [[life partner]] that [[Will of God|God has planned]] for them. The first edition was packaged with a [[CD single]] by the Ludys: "Faithfully", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.

The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's [[Personal_god#Christianity|relationship with God]]. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly [[Chastity|unchaste]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]] individuals.

Other American authors, such as [[Mark Matlock]] and [[Jason Evert]], gave positive criticism for ''When God Writes Your Love Story''. Leah Andrews of the ''Lewiston Morning Tribune'' compared ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to [[dating]], including [[Joshua Harris (pastor)|Joshua Harris]]'s ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship|Boy Meets Girl]]''. American college professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story," in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland of [[Crosswalk.com]] criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on [[anecdote]]s and not enough on the [[Bible]].

==Content==
The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, "Desiring a Love Story", addresses [[sexual desire]] and [[lovesickness]], suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of [[fidelity]] to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of [[sexual abstinence]] and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honour God.

[[File:Ulysses and the Sirens by H.J. Draper.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|alt=A painting of six men in a boat, four of whom are rowing and the fifth of whom is tying the sixth to the mast, and three sirens climbing the hull|Early in the book, [[Eric Ludy]] retells a portion of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', describing the episode in which [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] sails near the land of the [[Siren]]s.]]

Early in the book, Eric retells a portion of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', describing the episode in which [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] sails near the land of the [[Siren]]s: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with [[beeswax]] and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of [[Orpheus]]'s encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a "sweeter song" than that of the Sirens;<ref>Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 17.</ref> his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then [[Argument from analogy|argues from analogy]] that, normally, those who force themselves to resist [[premarital sex]]ual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for [[marriage]] much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the "sweeter song" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is "the beautiful side of love";<ref>Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 19.</ref> the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as [[breakup]]s, [[unrequited love]], and [[sexual frustration]].

The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's [[Personal_god#Christianity|relationship with God]]. They suggest that, "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry&nbsp;... is alive and wandering the earth" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased.<ref>Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 73.</ref> The Ludys contest the definition of "true love" as an emotion; instead, they define "true love" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied&nbsp;... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others&nbsp;... our deepest needs are met as well!"<ref>Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 205.</ref>

Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term [[psychological pain]] and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the [[Greek myths|Greek myth]] of the [[suitors of Penelope]], in which [[Penelope]], whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of [[marriage proposal]]s until Ulysses returns and slays the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that [[selfless service]] is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question "How will I know when a relationship is from God?" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a "team&nbsp;... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective."<ref>Ludy and Ludy (1999), p. 187.</ref> She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other [[Christian]]s of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly [[Chastity|unchaste]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]] individuals.

''When God Writes Your Love Story'' was received positively by some American Christian authors. In ''Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom'', [[Mark Matlock]], a [[Youth studies|youth expert]]<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Baptist Press]]|author=Shannon Baker|date=January 24, 2002|title=Youth ministers challenged to color outside the lines|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=12603|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref> and [[Ordination|ordained]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]],<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=The Baptist Standard|title=Many teens dabbling in psychics and the occult, youth study finds|author=John Hall|date=October 28, 2002|url=http://assets.baptiststandard.com/archived/2002/10_28/print/matlock_occult.html|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref> recommends ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to college students seeking wisdom. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid.<ref>Matlock (2005), p. 166.</ref> [[Jason Evert]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] author and chastity speaker,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130306/LIVING/303069995/1008|title=Noted chastity speaker will present programs here Thursday and Friday|date=March 6, 2013|work=[[The News-Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> wrote positively of ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in his book ''If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity''. Evert commends Leslie Ludy for writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to [[Voice of God|God's voice]] in seeking discernment about romantic relationships.<ref>Evert (2003), p. 45.</ref> Also in ''If You Really Loved Me'', Evert praises a passage from ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.<ref>Evert (2003), pp. 59<U+2013>60.</ref>

[[Christine Gardner]], a professor at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]],<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Religion & Politics|author=Amy Frykholm|title=Can Sex Sell Abstinence?|date=May 21, 2012|url=http://religionandpolitics.org/2012/05/21/can-sex-sell-abstinence/|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}</ref> was less enthusiastic about the Ludys' book. In ''[[Making Chastity Sexy|Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns]]'', Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and "desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks." Gardner argues that the result "was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending."<ref>Gardner (2011), p. 114.</ref>

Margaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who have taught together at [[North Park University]] and [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dwight N.

They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story." They write therein that, while they read ''When God Writes Your Love Story'', "it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage."<ref name=Peterson84/> In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment.<ref>Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 94.</ref> While referencing ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that "it is the entire genre that is problematic."<ref name=Peterson84>Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 84.</ref>

Commentators have also noted the song "Faithfully" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse.<ref>Peterson and Peterson (2009), pp. 91<U+2013>93.</ref> On the other hand, in ''Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity'', Brienne Murk, a [[Christian music]]ian and [[Public speaking|public speaker]], identifies "Faithfully" as one of her favourite songs.<ref>Murk (2011), p. 121.</ref>

Christine A. Col<U+00F3>n and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties,<ref>Col<U+00F3>n and Field (2009), p. 10.</ref> expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in ''Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church''.<ref name=Singled/> Col<U+00F3>n, an English professor at Wheaton College;<ref>{{Cite web|title=Christine Col<U+00F3>n, Ph.D.|publisher=[[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/C/Christine-Colon|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> and Field, a former English professor at [[Wayland Baptist University]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bonnie E. Field|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]|url=http://www.spckpublishing.co.uk/authors/bonnie-e-field/|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Col<U+00F3>n and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Cymbeline]]'', which states "the more delay'd, delighted."<ref name=Singled/> ''Singled Out'' suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.<ref name=Singled/>

Col<U+00F3>n and Field compare ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to [[Derek Prince]]'s ''God Is a Matchmaker'', and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their [[soulmate]]s quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Col<U+00F3>n and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so [[Test (assessment)|tests]] one's [[faith]] and that "God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose."<ref name=Singled>Col<U+00F3>n and Field (2009), p. 125.</ref>
