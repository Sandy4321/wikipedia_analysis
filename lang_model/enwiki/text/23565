The '''2007 Canadian Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] [[auto race|motor race]] held on [[10 June]], [[2007]], at [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] in [[Montr<U+00E9>al, Canada]].<ref name="race page">{{cite web| title =Race page on Formula1.com | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/races/in_detail/775/| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref> It was the sixth race of the [[2007 Formula One season]]. The race was won by rookie [[Lewis Hamilton]], who also started from [[pole position]] on the grid; it was his first [[Formula One]] victory and the first Formula One race ever won by a black driver. Second place was taken by [[Nick Heidfeld]] and [[Alexander Wurz]] was third, making this the first Grand Prix of the 2007 season that drivers from teams other than [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[McLaren]] have made the podium.

The race was filled with many incidents resulting in an unprecedented four [[safety car|safety car periods]],<ref name="4safety car">{{cite web| title =Wurz's anniversary podium 'a dream' | publisher =ITV| url =http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=39550&PO=39550| accessdate =2007-08-14}}</ref> including the violent impact of [[Robert Kubica]]'s [[BMW Sauber]] against a concrete retaining wall, that he escaped with a sprained ankle and concussion. During the race [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] were disqualified for failing to stop at the end of the pit lane when the exit was closed.

===Pre-race===
A test session was held on [[May 17]] and [[May 18]] at the Paul Ricard circuit, with the track set up to replicate the conditions of the Canadian Grand Prix for the final 2 days. Despite the fact that the [[McLaren]] team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] were better on the Canadian set up.<ref name="paul ricard testing 1">{{cite news| title =Paul Ricard day three - Raikkonen takes charge | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6112.html| date = 2007-05-18|accessdate =2007-06-09}}</ref><ref name="paul ricard testing 2">{{cite news| title =Paul Ricard day four - Raikkonen once more | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6116.html| date = 2007-05-18|accessdate =2007-06-09}}</ref>

[[Kimi Raikkonen]] had the fastest time on the first day, with a time of 1:28.833. Rain after lunch caused a  delay to the programmes. Raikkonen was forced to end his running early when he was hit by an electronic problem. [[Scott Speed]] was suprised with the second fastest time two tenths of a second behind Raikkonen. Seven tenths separated the first eight drivers. The [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] team focused on testing there suspension. [[Rubens Barrichello]] and [[Christian Klien]] shared testing for the [[Honda Racing F1|Honda team]] over the day, the engine failed on Klien's first lap. [[James Rossiter]] in the [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri]] completed the most laps with 115.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Raikkonen leads the way at Paul Ricard  |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/58885 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2007-08-11 }}</ref>

Raikkonen was also the fastest on the second day with a time of 1:28.624. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] finished in second less than two hundredths of a second behind Raikkonen, he also completed the second most laps with 111, behind [[James Rossiter]] with 131. [[Pedro de la Rosa]] was third fastest despite his engine failing. The testing was stopped twice, first when [[Adrian Sutil|Adrian Sutil's]] and then [[Jenson Button|Jenson Button's]] engines failed.

During the two weeks leading up to the Grand Prix, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen and [[Felipe Massa]] released statements to the press saying that they believed that everything will be different in Canada because of the very different conditions - as shown at Paul Ricard.<ref name="raikkonen pre-race">{{cite news| title =McLaren will not dominate Canada - R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen | publisher =GPUpdate.net| url =http://f1.gpupdate.net/en/news/2007/06/06/mclaren_will_not_dominate_canada_raikkonen/| date = 2007-06-06|accessdate =2007-06-09}}</ref> [[Fernando Alonso]] believed the team had momentum from the win in Monaco and [[Martin Whitmarsh]] said that they were realistic about dominating the race.<ref>{{cite news| title =2007 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX PREVIEW | publisher =mclaren.com| url =http://www.mclaren.com/f1season/2007/canada/preview.php| date = 2007-06-01|accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref>

[[BMW Sauber]] were pleased with 5th place then 7th place from [[Nick Heidfeld]] - despite him reporting that the car was "very difficult to drive", but [[Robert Kubica]]s car suffered a fuel leak resulting in him being unable to post a timed lap in the morning session and 12th place in the second session. Kubica also told the press after the fuel leak, "the car has been quite difficult to drive."<ref name="practice quotes">{{cite news| title =Friday practice - selected driver quotes | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/6/6241.html| date = 2007-06-08|accessdate =2007-06-09}}</ref> Both [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] drivers finshed in the top ten of the morning practice.<ref name="friday practice 1" /> [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] stayed behind its customer team [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri]] in the first practice, but got [[Rubens Barrichello|Barrichello]] above the Super Aguri car of [[Takuma Sato]] in the second practice.

Consistent with previous form, the Hondas of Barrichello and Button failed to make it into the top ten; they qualified thirteenth and fifteenth respectively. [[Takuma Sato]], once again out-qualifying the two Honda cars and just missed out on the top ten, in front of [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]].

===Race===
[[Image:Kubica crash.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kubica's violent crash.]]

[[Lewis Hamilton]] led from the start, preventing [[Fernando Alonso]] from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide and allowed [[Nick Heidfeld]] to overtake and move into second place. Alonso damaged his car in the process and subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race.<ref name="alonso weekend">{{cite news|url= http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/6/6258.html|title=Alonso, Ferrari struggle in Canada|publisher=Formula1.com|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref><ref name="alonso mistakes">{{cite news|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/6/6259.html|title=Hamilton triumphant in Montreal|Publisher=Formula1.com|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Every driver got off the grid except for [[Jenson Button]] who had a [[gearbox]] problem and was unable to select first gear.<ref name="race driver quotes">{{cite news|title=Canadian Grand Prix - selected driver quotes| url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/6/6260.html| publisher=Formula1.com|date = 2007-06-10| accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> The first accident of the race involved [[Scott Speed]] who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] and went into the hairpin with a broken [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]].

Possibly frustrated by dropping back to third, Alonso ran across the grass at turn one again on lap 15. As a result he lost another two seconds on Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn and he slid across the grass for the third time in the race. This cause him to drop back to fourth as it allowed Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lewis triumphs above Canada chaos| url=http://www.itv-f1.com/RaceReport_Story.aspx?PO=39583| publisher=itv-f1.com|date = 2007-06-10| accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

Hamilton had opened up a lead over Heidfeld of nineteen seconds by lap 21. Alonso meanwhile showed no sign of attempting to overtake Heidfeld. Alonso made mistakes on lap fourteen and eighteen. After falling to over five seconds behind Heidfeld, he overtaken by [[Felipe Massa]]. Massa moved into second when Heidfeld pitted on lap 20. Hamilton pitted on lap 22 and rejoined the race in third place.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6738963.stm|title=Canadian Grand Prix Commentary|Publisher=BBC|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

On lap 22, [[Adrian Sutil]] crashed at turn four, and the [[safety car]] had to be deployed, Hamilton had pitted just before this.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.autoracingdaily.com/article/adrian_sutil_obviously_i_am_very_disappointed_not_to_have_finished_the_race/|title=Adrian Sutil|publisher=autoracingdaily.com|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> At that point, the pit lane was closed but Alonso and [[Nico Rosberg]] were forced to pit in order to avoid running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop/go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened and the rest of the field pitted, Massa and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] left the pit lane when the red light was still on. Both were later black-flagged from the race on lap 51.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/10062007/23/massa-fisichella-don-t-red.html|publisher=eurosport|title=Massa, Fisichella don't see red|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

The race was restarted on lap 26, and on the approach to the hairpin on the first lap afterwards [[Robert Kubica]] hit the back of [[Jarno Trulli]]'s [[Toyota F1|Toyota]]. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass at the edge of the track, where a bump launched his car into the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing much of the nosecone and front suspension in the initial impact, the [[BMW Sauber|BMW]] flipped back across the track and came to rest against the armco in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, he escaped with a sprained ankle and [[concussion]].<ref name="Unscathed Kubica out of hospital">{{cite news| title =Unscathed Kubica out of hospital| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739431.stm| publisher =BBC| date =2007-06-10| accessdate =2007-07-02}}</ref> The safety car was deployed again after this crash.<ref name="Kubica escapes injury after crash">{{cite news| title =Kubica escapes injury after crash | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739431.stm| publisher =BBC| date =2007-06-10| accessdate =2007-06-10}}</ref> The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving [[Christijan Albers]] on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] crashing into a wall.

Dust was placed at the hairpin around Kubica's accident. Raikkonen ran wide after he misjudged the braking on the dust. The [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri]] of [[Takuma Sato]] went past him as a result and moved into 10th place.
On lap 37, Trulli and [[Nico Rosberg]] were battling for position. Both span off the track in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap [[Anthony Davidson]] made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a [[beaver]] had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it more likely to have been a [[groundhog]].<ref name="groundhog">{{cite news| title =<U+2018>Beaver<U+2019> gets all the blame | url =http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/canada/AB/story.html?id=061eb1f5-2438-46a7-8474-2903cb9764e2| publisher =canada.com| date =2007-06-12| accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref> One lap later [[David Coulthard]] is forced to retire due to a gearbox problem.<ref>{{cite news| title =F1 2007 Canada Race Report | url =http://www.bitsofnews.com/content/view/5753/42/| publisher =bitsofnews.com| date =2007-06-10| accessdate =2007-07-13}}</ref> [[Ralf Schumacher]] also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Raikkonen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to pass him just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into fith.<ref name="grand">{{cite news| title =Some are born great, and some just survive to the finish | url =http://www.grandprix.com/race/r774racereport.html| publisher =grandprix.com| date =2007-06-10| accessdate =2007-08-20}}</ref>

Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers failed to finish the race, six of them because of accidents. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a [[groundhog]] on the racetrack. This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars were on the same lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all of the incidents and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably.<ref name="f1.com race report">{{cite web | title = Race report|url = http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/6/6259.html| publisher = Formula1.com|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato, in a Super Aguri, overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.<ref name="alonso weekend" /><ref name="grand"/>

[[Austria]]'s [[Alexander Wurz]] drove through the field from 19th at the start to finsh third by taking one pitstop, completing 40 laps on super soft tyes. By finishing third Wurz, recorded his third career podium, in the race that marked ten years since his debut race in F1. [[Nick Heidfeld]] finshed in second place after trailing Hamilton for the majority of the race. The safety car deployments also allowed [[Heikki Kovalainen]] to move up to fouth after starting at the back of the grid. The race was the first time in the 2007 season where a driver from a team other than [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] or [[McLaren]] made the podium.<ref name="f1.com race report"/>

Reaction to the race was mainly focused on Hamilton and the fact that it was his first grand prix victory, making him first black driver to ever win a Formula One race. It was also thought impressive that it had taken only six races for him to win and, in the process, take the lead in the drivers<U+2019> championship at the age of 22. [[Niki Lauda]] said he was "stunned" by the victory and [[Damon Hill]] believed "People should not underestimate what he had achieved in a short space of time". Speculation began about the possibility of him winning the drivers championship.<ref>{{cite news|title= Hill applauds Hamilton's first win | url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59686| publisher=autosport|date = 2007-06-10| accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Sky's the limit for Hamilton| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739559.stm| publisher=BBC|date = 2007-06-10| accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Alonso and the Ferrari team were disappointed with the outcome of the race. By finishing seventh Alonso lost eight points on Hamilton in the drivers championship. Ferrari also lost ground in both the constructors and driver championship by gaining a total of just four points from the race. Alonso believed Hamilton to have been "very lucky" to have won the race and did not congratulate his team-mate after the race. Hamilton's performance was felt to have been faultless and all the more impressive due to four separate deployments of the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ten Conclusions From The Canadian GP| url=http://www.planet-f1.com/story/0,18954,3265_2199840,00.html| publisher=planet-f1.com|date = 2007-06-11| accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>
