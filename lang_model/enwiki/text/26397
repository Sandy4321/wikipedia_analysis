'''''The World Ends with You''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''It's a Wonderful World'''''|<U+3059><U+3070><U+3089><U+3057><U+304D><U+3053><U+306E><U+305B><U+304B><U+3044>|Subarashiki Kono Sekai|literally "''This Wonderful World''"}}, is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' team and [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld console. Set in the modern-day [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] shopping district of Tokyo, ''The World Ends with You'' features a distinctive art style inspired by Shibuya and its youth culture. Development was inspired by elements of Jupiter's previous game, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''. It was released in Japan in July 2007, and in [[PAL region]]s and North America in April 2008.

In the game, Neku Sakuraba and his allies are forced to participate in a game that will determine their fate. The battle system uses many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the touchscreen or by shouting into the microphone. Elements of Japanese youth culture, such as fashion, food, and cell phones, are key aspects of the missions.

''The World Ends with You'' received positive reviews, which praised the graphics, soundtrack, and integration of gameplay into the Shibuya setting. The few common complaints were related to the steep learning curve of the battle system as well as the imprecise touch-screen controls. In the week of its release, the game was the second best-selling DS title in Japan, and the top selling DS title in the US.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The game takes place in a fictional version of the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] shopping district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to a [[Plane (metaphysics)|alternate plane of existence]] called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game.<ref name="erased1">{{cite video game

It is infeasible for the Composer to judge all of humanity by himself, so a filtering system utilizing the Reapers was created: the Reapers' Game. Reapers act as a test, weeding out unfit Players. }}
</ref> By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead (Players) gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of Players in future Games.<ref>{{cite video game

Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the Player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.<ref>{{cite video game

A Player in the UG is invisible to the living in the RG, though one can sometimes read and influence their thoughts. The UG is frequented by creatures called "Noise", which are attracted by the negative feelings of the living. To progress in the Reapers' Game, Players are often required to defeat Noise by killing or "erasing" them.<ref name="ign review"/> However, each Noise exists in two "zones" simultaneously, and can only be defeated by two Players fighting the Noise from separate zones; Players are therefore required to form a pact with another Player to survive the Noise.<ref name="Noise zones">{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Shiki:''' I heard you can only beat the Noise in pairs.

===Characters===
The player assumes the role of Neku Sakuraba, a highly antisocial teenage boy more interested in listening to music than interacting with others. Computer-controlled characters make up the rest of the cast, which includes Players who are paired with Neku.<ref name="Noise zones" /> In the first Game, Neku is paired with Shiki Misaki, a teenage girl who takes on the form of her best friend; her physical appearance was her price of entry for the Game.<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Shiki:''' Because this is what I always dreamed of<U+2014>a new me.

Then I realized. I<U+2019>ll never be Eri. Deep down, I never wanted to be. I was just jealous. The Reaper was right. What I value most is ME!}}</ref> Subsequently, Neku's partner is an intelligent and sly teenage boy, Yoshiya Kiryu, who prefers to be called Joshua. Neku's final partner is Daisukenojo Bito, a Reaper who calls himself "Beat".<ref>{{cite video game

</ref> For the three weeks of the game's story, Sanae Hanekoma is the Producer. Disguised as a Shibuya cafe owner, he guides new Players and narrates the "Secret Reports" that are obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game.

===Story===
The game's story follows Neku over the course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with partners Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners and starts to understand the rules of the Game, he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of [[Hachiko]].<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Shiki:''' You know it. Hey, if we make it through this<U+2026>let<U+2019>s meet up in the RG. You, me, and Beat. You might not recognize me, so<U+2026>I know! I<U+2019>ll bring Mr. Mew with me. We can be a team again!}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Shiki:''' Neku? See you on the other side. You know the meeting place. Hachiko! / '''Neku:''' Heh. It<U+2019>s a date.}}</ref> However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his entry fee for the second week. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from a bomb created by Minamimoto.

Due to Neku and Joshua bending the rules for the game, the game is ruled null and Neku is forced to replay the game a third time.  His entry fee this time is all of the other players, meaning Neku cannot form any pacts and stands no chance against the Noise.  However, Beat immediately defects from the Reapers and rejoins Neku. Neku and Beat find that the Reapers and the entire population of Shibuya are wearing special red pins that cause them to think the same harmonious thoughts. Without any missions to complete, the two venture to the fabled "Shibuya River", which Joshua was looking for during the second week. At the river, they find Megumi Kitaniji, the Game's Conductor. Kitaniji explains that he created the red pins in an attempt to remake Shibuya, which the Composer challenged him to do; if he fails, Shibuya will be erased.<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Kitaniji:''' End<U+2026>Shibuya? But Composer<U+2026>Sir! Why!? / '''Joshua:''' I<U+2019>ve decided to wash my hands of it. It has no future value to me or anyone else. So, I<U+2019>m shutting it down.}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Kitaniji:''' By tearing down the differences between us, I can make the world a paradise! / '''Neku:''' By making everybody think alike?

At that moment, Joshua reappears and reveals himself to be the Composer. Joshua returns the missing part of Neku's memory of death: Joshua himself shot Neku, choosing him to be his [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] in his challenge with Kitaniji.  Minamimoto, who had been trying to usurp the position of Composer, was trying to kill Joshua in his weakened state as a human. After failing to defeat Neku by using his friends against him, Joshua gives Neku one last challenge: To fire upon Joshua to determine the fate of Shibuya. Neku is too conflicted to make a choice, and is shot down by Joshua.<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Neku:''' Huff<U+2026>huff<U+2026> It was you! <U+2026><U+2026> I thought<U+2026> I thought I finally found a friend I could relate to<U+2026> But it was YOU! You killed me! / '''Joshua:''' Hee hee. Now, Neku, why don<U+2019>t we play one last Game? / '''Neku:''' You tricked me<U+2026> / '''Joshua:''' The winner gets to be the Composer, and do whatever he likes with Shibuya. If you win, you decide. If I win, I<U+2019>ll decide. <U+2026>Of course, I<U+2019>ve already decided.}}</ref> Neku finds himself once again at the scramble crossing, confused by events.

The game's credits show scenes seven days later. Neku meets Beat, Rhyme, and Shiki (in her real body) by the statue of Hachiko, indicating that Neku and his friends have finally been returned to the RG.<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = '''Neku''': I can<U+2019>t forgive you, but I trust you.

See you there?}}</ref> Secret reports that can be obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game reveal that Joshua, after seeing the change in personality of Neku over the weeks of playing the game, decides to spare Shibuya, now believing the city to be ideal.<ref>{{cite video game | title = The World Ends with You | platform = [[Nintendo DS]] | developer = [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2008 | quote = However, [the Composer] has stayed his decision to destroy Shibuya.

[<U+2026>] Today, Shibuya has shifted into what We Angels believe to be the optimal parallel world.}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''The World Ends with You'' is an [[action role-playing game]], arranged into three chapters following the three weeks that Neku is involved in the Reaper's Game, with each chapter further divided by each day of the week. The player controls Neku and his partner as they explore Shibuya to complete each day's mission. Although most missions require completion within a certain time for Neku and his partner, this timer is not correlated to the passage of time for the player.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>

Shibuya is divided into several districts, some of which may be inaccessible on certain days or blocked by a wall that can only be removed by satisfying the request of a nearby Reaper, such as erasing Noise symbols, putting on a certain brand of clothing, or bringing an item. Neku can scan the area by activating a special pin. This scan reveals the thoughts of the [[non-player character]]s in the Realground and [[meme]]s, which may help to progress the plot.<ref name="ign review"/> The scan also reveals random Noise symbols that drift about the area, or in some cases, float around a specific character. The player initiates a battle by touching Noise symbols; each symbol constitutes one round of battle. Selecting more than one Noise symbol at a time results in a multi-round battle that gradually increases in difficulty with each round, but conversely leads to greater rewards upon success. Altering the difficulty of the Noise and the amount of health for Neku and his partner also alter the benefits conferred.<ref name="1up review"/>

Each district has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing from the more popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand.<ref name="ign review"/> The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.<ref name="ign review"/>

After completing the game, the player can return to any day in the story and play those events again, keeping the characters' current statistics and inventory. "Secret Reports", written segments that reveal background elements of the story, can be unlocked through this mode by completing specific missions during each day.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/nds/wonderfulworld/reviews/wonderfulworldstrev1.html | title = The World Ends With You - Staff Review | first = Adriaan | last = den Ouden | publisher = [[RPGamer]] | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}</ref> Completing the game allows the player to access "Another Day" from the game's menus, an additional day of missions that explains certain events related to the main storyline. ''The World Ends with You'' has one [[minigame]] called ''Tin Pin Slammer'' (or ''Marble Slash'') that can be played against computer opponents or with up to 3 others via a wireless connection. ''Tin Pin Slammer'' is similar to the marble game [[marble (toy)#Gameplay|ringer]] in that each player attempts to use their pins one at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.

===Pins===
''The World Ends with You'' features "psych pins", decorative [[award pin|pins]] that possess powers that only Neku can activate while wearing them. Psych pins are used for combat, for "Tin Pin Slammer/Marble Slash", or as trade value for money or equipment. Most pins, particularly those used in combat, can become more powerful as the player accumulates "Pin Points" (PP) which can also lead to evolution of the pins into more potent versions. Pin Points are commonly earned through battle, but can also be earned through a period of inactivity with the game, or by interacting with other DS players or random wireless sources. Each of these methods influences the growth of pins within the game.<ref name="ign review"/>

===Combat===
[[Image:Gameplay screen.PNG|right|thumb|Neku and Shiki fighting Noise in different "zones" near the same landmark. Neku's "psych pins" are displayed on the upper left of the bottom screen, and Shiki's card system is displayed along the bottom of the top screen. Their shared health bar splits across both screens on the right side.]]
The game's combat system is called the ''Stride Cross Battle System''. The combat takes place across both screens on the DS, with Neku on the touchscreen and his partner on the top screen, representing the different "zones" of the same local area; the two characters battle the same enemies that exist in both "zones" simultaneously. Neku and his partner are synchronized during battle; they share the same health bar so that even if one character does not take any damage, the pair can fail in battle if the other takes too much.<ref name="ign review"/> A green "light puck" will pass between the characters during battle; when the character has this puck, the damage they inflict is increased. The movement of the light puck is determined by the "sync ratio" between Neku and his partner; the puck stays longer with the character with higher ratios. The player can equip Neku and his partner with clothing that can alter the light puck's speed.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>

The player controls Neku by performing touchscreen actions based on the currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, or holding down on an enemy to inflict damage. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration.<ref name="ign review"/> Each pin has a limited number of uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.<ref name="eurogamer review"/>

Neku's partner on the top screen can be controlled by the player or the game itself. Each of Neku's partners has a card game-based mechanic; for example, Shiki's card game requires the player to match face-down [[Zener cards]].<ref name="ign review"/> The partner can make a basic attack after the player navigates through a pathway of arrows to select one of several shown cards using the directional pad or face buttons.  By navigating to a card that fits within the card game rules, the player earns a star. Once enough stars are collected, the player can launch a powerful "Fusion" attack using both Neku and his partner through the "Harmonizer Pin" that appears on the upper right of the touchscreen(assuming you haven't rearranged where it's to be displayed).<ref name="ign review"/> The player can also help the partner character dodge attacks.<ref name="ign review"/>

==Development==
''The World Ends with You'' was developed by the same team that created the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, with input from [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]], the company that developed ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''. The development of the game started two and a half years before its Japanese release, during the development of ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and the end of development of ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''.<ref name="roundtable1" /> At that time, Nintendo had announced the DS, but it was not yet on the market; [[Square Enix]] asked the team to make a game specifically for the handheld system.<ref name="roundtable1">{{cite web | url = http://member.square-enix.com/na/features/wewy/01/ | title = Creator's Roundtable, Episode 1 | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2007 | accessdate= 2008-06-18}}</ref> The creative team<U+2014>consisting of Tatsuya Kando (director), Tomohiro Hasegawa (co-director), Takeshi Arakawa (planning director), and [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (character design)<U+2014>was able to experience the DS during the "Touch DS" event in November 2004.<ref name="roundtable2">{{cite web | url = http://member.square-enix.com/na/features/wewy/01/ep2_01.php | title = Creator's Roundtable, Episode 2 | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | year = 2007 | accessdate= 2008-06-18}}</ref> From this demonstration, they had envisioned a version of ''Chain of Memories'' in which the card game aspects would be present on the bottom screen and an action role-playing game on the top. As they continued to work on the game, the developers realized that they wanted to use the touchscreen more, to make "a game that can only be played on the DS".<ref name="roundtable2"/> However, they also encountered the problem that by focusing heavily on the touchscreen, the top screen would be ignored. From this, the idea of the dual screen battle system arose.<ref name="roundtable2"/>  Several other options were explored for the top-screen game, including command-based battles or a music game, but once they reviewed the game from the eyes of the player, they ultimately settled on the card-game approach with the player having the option to control the game if they wanted to.<ref name="postmortem"/>  Even with the completion of the Japanese version of the game, the team felt the dual screen system was too much for overseas audiences, and attempted to change the card-game mechanic into a special meter that would fill up with normal attacks from Neku, but this was not completed in time for release.<ref name="postmortem"/>  However, the team was able to alter the "information overload" of the numerous tutorial at the start of the game in the North American release, reducing the amount of text presented as well as allowing the tutorials to be skipped.  The "Active Encounter" system, the ability for the player to select when and how to go into battle, was developed specifically to avoid the issues of "[[Grind (gaming)|grinding]]" that are common with most standard RPG systems.<ref name="postmortem"/>  While they included the mechanics of being able to scan non-playable characters to see their thoughts, the team was not able to integrate this mechanic more into the game.<ref name="postmortem"/>

[[Image:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|Many of the game's sets are modeled after the real [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. The [[scramble crossing]] near [[109 (department store)|the 109 department store]] (far left above) is extensively featured in the game and can be seen in the background of the game's cover.]]

In addition to creating unique gameplay, the designers wanted to build the game around a real location.<ref name="roundtable2"/> Initially, they had planned to use a large number of locations across the entire world as the setting. They narrowed down the settings to specific cities due to practicality issues.

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack to ''The World Ends with You'' was composed and produced by [[Takeharu Ishimoto]]. The game's music encompasses many genres, combining [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronica]], designed to fit the various moods of Shibuya.<ref name="postmortem"/> The song appearing during the credits of the game is "[[Lullaby for You]]" by [[J-pop|Japanese pop]] artist, [[Jyongri]]. Vocal artists featured in the game include Sawa, Makiko Noda, Leah, Ayuko Tanaka, Mai Matsuda, Wakako, Hanaeryca, Cameron Strother, Andy Kinlay, Nulie Nurly, and Londell "Taz" Hicks.<ref name="squenix soundtrack"/>  The developers used [[CRI Middleware]]'s Kyuseishu Sound Streamer, a compression algorithm normally used for voice-overs, to compress the soundtrack and fit more songs on the game media, while replacing full motion video cutscenes with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-style animations to save more space.  The soundtrack on the final version of the game take up approximately one-fourth of the game media.<ref name="postmortem"/>
