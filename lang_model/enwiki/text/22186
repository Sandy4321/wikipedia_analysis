The '''Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco''' (Presidential Memorial Commission for short) is a voter group that sponsored a satirical but real [[ballot initiative]] to rename the [[Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant]], a [[wastewater treatment]] plant in [[San Francisco, California]], after [[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]].

==Ballot initiative==
The initiative is to place the following [[referendum]] before San Francisco voters in the [[general election]] in November 2008:

Through [[grassroots]] organizing and public appearances, organizers obtained more than 12,000 signatures,<ref name=chron>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/24/MNPQ11A3T7.DTL|title=Satire at the ballot box to 'honor' Bush|author=Marisa Lagos|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2008-06-24}}</ref> and on July 17, 2008 the measure was qualified for the November ballot. It will appear on the November 4th, 2008 San Francisco ballot as Proposition R. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/17/MN7A11QU1S.DTL&amp;tsp=1|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=George W.

If passed by a simple majority, the name change will take effect upon the inauguration of the next President on January 20th, 2009.{{update after|2009|01|21}}

The local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] announced its intention to campaign against the measure,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kcbs.com/SF-Group-Plans-Unconventional-Presidential-Honor/2451354|title=SF Group Plans Unconventional Presidential Honor|publisher=KCBS News|date=2008-06-20}}</ref><ref name=fox>{{cite news|title=San Franciscans Want to Put President Bush's Name in the Toilet|date=2008-05-29|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354706,00.html}}</ref> which it described as "loony bin direct democracy."<ref name=chron/>  Officials with the [[San Francisco Public Utilities Commission]], which owns the plant in question, rejected the comparison with President Bush and defended their plant's environmental record.<ref name=chron/>

The ballot pamphlet argument against Proposition R urged San Franciscans to vote against the measure, arguing that, in light of the recent bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it would be more appropriate to name the local bankruptcy court or a consumer credit counseling center after Bush. <ref>http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/elections/Nov2008_VIP_EN.pdf</ref>
