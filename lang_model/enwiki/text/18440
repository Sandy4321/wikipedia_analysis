'''Qaraunas''', (blacks or mixed) or '''Neguderis''', or '''Nikudari''', were a [[Mongol]] group that settled in [[Afghanistan]] and eastern [[Persia]].

== Foundation ==

The word Qarauna derived from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] word ''Khara'' meaning black. At first they were subjects to [[Great Khan]] and served as tamnas or tamachis in Afghanistan. Great Khan appointed their leaders from non-[[Chingisid]] generals such as Dayir and Mungudei. In 1238, they settled near [[India]] to face military forces of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. In 1250's their leader was  Sali who was a general of tatar origin. Muslim lords arranged that 100,000 dinars be brought to Sali Noyan by the ghulcim and in return the commander would withdraw his troops from [[Multan]]. Mongols invaded [[India]] several times for booty and slaves. 

[[Mongke]] Khan ordered Sali and his tamna soldiers to join Hulegu's army in 1253. In 1260, [[Jochi]]d princes Kuli, Baval and Tutar died. Cursed Baval, the father of [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]], was executed by the order of [[Hulegu]] Khan after taking permission from [[Berke]] who was the khan of Jochid Ulus/Golden Horde.  Soon after that, Kuli and Tutar died suspiciously. [[Golden Horde]] soldiers, who served for Hulgeu, feared. They started to move to [[Kipchak]] steppes via [[Derbent]] and other remnants went through Syria to [[Egypt]].  Angered Hulegu punished many soldiers of Golden Horde for [[Battle of Ain Jalut|the defeat of Ain Jalut]]. Mongol general [[Baiju]] was executed as well. To the east, the flight of Jochid troops into Afghanistan in significant numbers led to the creation of the [[Negudar]]i (Nikudari) Mongols or Qaraunas in 1262. Berke ordered general Neguder to raid eastern part of [[Ilkhanate]]. Sometimes, historians call Qara'unas as the Neguderis. This term was derived from the name of Negudar.

== Qara'unas in Mongol Empire ==

Although some scholars claim that this group owed allegiance to no khanate 1290s, it is known that it was largely brought under the [[Chagatai Khanate]] during the reign of [[Alghu]] in 1262. As a result of wars between Mongol khanates, Qara'unas deserted Hulegu and captured Sali bahadur. While majority of Qara'unas was ruled by Chagatai princes, their another group in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] formed the eastern border defensive for [[Abagha]] Khan. He appointed former Chagatai Khan [[Mubarak Shah]] their leader. 

[[Duwa]] recalled his cousin Abdullah and appointed his son [[Qutlugh Khwaja]] a governor there in 1299. The descendants of Duwa had ruled Qara'unas since then. [[Oljeitu]] reasserted his ancestors' claim on Afghanistan and repelled Qara'unas in 1314. Another Chagatai prince [[Yasa'ur]] was given lands in Afghanistan by the latter [[Ilkhan]]. Thanks to his complaisance towards both [[Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, Emperor Renzong of Yuan|Buyantu Ayurbawda]] of the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and Oljeitu, [[Kebek]] reoccupied the territory peacefully. [[Esen Buqa I|Esenbuqa]] and [[Tarmashirin]] were all military governor of Qara'unas and became Chagatai Khans. This military group had attended all [[Mongol invasions of India]] since 1241.

== Rise to power and decline==

Serving under the Khans, they gained confident from them. Because qaraunas were main force for the campaigns in [[Persia]] and [[India]]. Neguderis wintered around [[Ghazna]] and summered in Ghur and Garchistan. According to [[Marco Polo]], they were mixed with [[demographics of India|Indians]] and Turks, because these soldiers were unable to reach [[Mongolia]] to find [[Mongol]] wives. After the death of [[Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur|Qazan Khan]] , Chagatai Khanate split into two parts until it was temporarily reunited under [[Tughlugh Timur]] (1347<U+2013>1363). Chagatai Mongol-Turks fell under the control of semi-nomadic oboghs: the Arlat in the west, the [[Barlas]] in the centre, and the [[Jalayir]] in the north, and two non-tribal military groups, the Qaraunas and the Qa'uchin.
In western part of the khanate was under the control of Qara'unas such as [[amir]] [[Qazaghan]] and his son [[<U+2018>Abdullah (Chagatai Khanate)|<U+2018>Abdullah]]. But [[Suldus]] and Barlas nobles revolted against their rule in 1359.

With the Mongol (Moghul) invasion in 1360, the Qarauna ascendancy failed. In 1362 [[Tamerlane]] (Temur, Timur) rejoined the Qaraunas under Qazaghan's grandson, [[Husayn]]. They freed Transaxonia from Mongols of [[Moghulistan]], whom they considered [[Barbarians]] next year. But in 1365 the Moghuls invaded again. The Qarauna and Barlas forces were defeated.

Quickly after the Khan's fail, Timur and Husayn recovered. They co-ruled Maweranhar and installed puppet khan. Husayn decided to build himself a permanent capital and urban base on the site of [[Balkh]] in Afghanistan and [[Turkestan]], ruined since the time of [[Chingis]], but now to be developed as an anti [[Samarkand]].When ambitious Temur finally revolted in 1370 at the head of his coalition, Husayn had little support left and he was easily defeated and killed. Temur fully subjugated the Qara'unas in 1380s.

During the reign of Temur (d.1405), Qara'unas formed a huge part of his army. [[Babur]] noted that they still spoke Mongolian in the late 15th century.

== Modern descendants ==

The '''Nikudari''' are (or were; Weiers notes that his informants were not aware of this term anymore) a population group of Afghanistan of Mongolic origin. While they don<U+2019>t resemble Mongolians from their physical appearance as the [[Hazara people]] do, they are distinct from them in that the Hazara don<U+2019>t exhibit any Mongolic linguistic peculiarities. The Nikudari, on the other hand, used to speak [[Moghol language|Moghol]] which is probably extinct now. Their tribal name hails from their former military leader, [[Negudar]], who according to [[David Morgan (historian)|Morgan]] was a general of the [[Golden Horde]]<ref>Morgan, David (2007 [1986]): ''The Mongols''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing: 95</ref>, but according to the research of Weiers that Morgan fails to quote was a leader of rebels against [[Abaqa Khan]].<ref>Weiers, Michael (1971): ''Die Sprache der Moghol der Provinz Herat in Afghanistan''. G<U+00F6>ttingen: Opladen:15-24.</ref> [[Hazara people]] are reportedly descendants of them.
