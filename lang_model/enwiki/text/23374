==History==
{{prose|date=January 2011}}
The City of Bath Technical School has a complex history. Its evolution into a specialist school stems from early experiments in Technical Education in Somerset. Its creation arose out of the need to encourage young people to take an interest in the Sciences, and for them to be made aware of the Technical innovations that were occurring in the 19th century.
 
In 1832 the Somerset Industrial School for Boys was founded to accommodate boys at Brougham Hayes on the Lower Bristol road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=205216&idx=23&fromsearch=true|title=Somerset Industrial School, Lower Bristol Road |work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> It was aided in 1833 by the First Treasury Grant for Education (<U+00A3>20,000 for education of poor children).

In 1938 the Report of the committee with special reference to grammar schools and technical high schools (The Spens Report) recommended expansion of technical schools in England to keep pace with the ever changing logistical requiremant of the many outposts in the British Empire. The need to maintain a dominant role (''with the aid of advanced technology'') was deemed a necessary step to take just one year before the outbreak of World War 2.<ref>[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ165353&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ165353 Education Resources Information Center] Retrieved 2009-08-20</ref>

In 1939 the [[Admiralty]] took over many large buildings in Bath which included the Domestic Science College and the hockey pitch and tennis courts, and did not return them until late 1944. The hockey pitch (''and tennis courts'')  were transformed when the Admiralty erected hutments upon them. By 1947 he Bath Education Committee had erected more and redecorated the existing hutments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=310616&idx=2&fromsearch=true|title=Admiralty staff, evacuated from Whitehall to Bath, Orange Grove c.1940

W.G.Walters, a light engineering firm, took over part of the Institute and erected a temporary building in front of the former Governors House. It was December 1945 before the Bath Technical College resumed control of the entire building and by September 1946 it was called the headquarters of the School of Building. The Institute remained an important part of the Bath Technical College, metal-work and wood-working classes were held there for the pupils of the Bath Technical School (''until temporary workshops became available at Brougham Hayes in the early 1960s''). After the [[Second World War]], the College began a new life with the Departments of Engineering, Commerce, Languages and Home craft all based at the Lower Borough Walls while the Department of the Building stayed on at the Twerton Institute and took over the hutments at Brougham Hayes.

In 1942 Mr C.J. (Bill) Hayman transfers from the West Central School to Bath Technical School ( From 1948 he becomes the deputy headmaster).

In 1943 a Report from the Committee on the curriculum and examinations in secondary schools (The Norwood Report) is published. A blueprint of the education act of 1944: Advocated the 3 types of secondary school)

In 1944 the [[Education Act 1944]] was passed by Parliament. It replaced almost all previous legislation and laid the foundations for the current education systems.

In 1945 St. Peter<U+2019>s Church Hall in Dorset Street, Twerton and the nearby annexe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=197314&idx=16&fromsearch=true|title=St Peters Gymnasium, formerly The School Church, Built 1867 c.1890|work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=22nd November 2010}}</ref> In February  the City Council agreed that the Hall be leased (''from the church authority'') for educational purposes for five years from September 1945.

In 1946 Bath City Council publishes its plans for education in response to the requirements to the [[Education Act 1944|education act of 1944]], which proposed that the Secondary Technical School (''at the Bath Technical College'') would become a separate school. This came into operation at St Peters Hall, Twerton in September 1947 when the first 52 11 year old pupils were admitted.<ref>City of Bath Technical School (''1997 Private publication'') Jefferies, Malcolm held at Somerset Records Office [http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives] - B.&.N.E.S. ref 0411/1 to 0411/1/13 (''Not available online'')</ref> The Further Education Sub-Committee (''of the Bath Education Committee'') agreed in 1947 that, in view of the use of St Peter<U+2019>s Hall in September by the eleven year olds, that a second classroom could not be made available to East Twerton Junior School (''which was located next door to the hall'') .They continued to use this building until Weymouth House in the city centre became available in September 1949.

In February 1948, the Council appointed Henry Burt Toft B.Sc., as Principle of the Technical College and Headmaster of the Secondary Technical School; he took up his duties when Major L.J. Castle retired in May 1948;. He was then Headmaster, [[Royal Latin School]], [[Buckingham]] and a former [[Rugby union|rugby]] international having captained the [[Barbarian F.C.]], Lancashire and England.Mr Toft was not in post long before a decision was made to allow him to concentrate on the College by appointing a separate Headmaster for the Secondary Technical School and the Council in March 1949 decided to advertise for this new post. Thomas John Nicholas MA B.Sc., headmaster of the Secondary Technical School, [[Wigan]] was appointed, he was 44 when he started in September 1949 ( in a press report at the time was the phase- ''When the Bath Training College for Domestic Science moves out of the Brougham Hayes building, the Secondary Technical School will move in).''
 
In 1949 Weymouth House School was the main base for the City of Bath Technical school from September 1949 until July 1960. The building was formerly used by The Bath and District National School. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=205215&idx=4&fromsearch=true|title=Weymouth House School c.1930|work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> The site was formerly the gardens of Weymouth House (''designed and built by William Killgrewin the early 1700s''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://art.bathnes.gov.uk/ow23/collections/voir.xsp?id=00101-1321&e=|title=Weymouth House|work=Object number : BATVG : P : 1914.26 |publisher=Victoria Art Gallery Bath|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> part of the house was demolished and the remaining part was incorporated into the new school in 1816.

All the children were temporally transferred to other schools (''many of the seniors went to Walcot Parochial School'') while the building was made safe. Infants used the ground floor until July 1949, when satisfactory arrangements had been made to enable the infants school to close. The upper floors were used by the Technical College for evening classes until 1950, and from that date the Technical School was the sole user. In 1957 St. James Church next to the School was demolished,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=249470&idx=7&fromsearch=true|title=St James Church ready to be demolished 1957|work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> and the site around the school was redeveloped. In 1962 Weymouth House School was demolished, and Marks and Spencer and Woolworths (''now Littlewoods'') developed their stores to cover the site of the school, the playgrounds, St James Street South, Weymouth Street and the site of St James Church.

In 1954 pupils from surrounding areas in [[South Gloucestershire]], [[Somerset]] and [[Wiltshire]] were included into the intake for the first time in its role as a specialist secondary technical school. A sixth form was introduced and a full range of clubs had developed. At this time there were few state educational schools in the west of England offering such facities. The changes in technology that are taken for granted today, and the equipment found in modern educational establishments, (''2009'') were a direct result of  contributions made by pupils that attended these specialist schools.

In 1960 BTS moved to Brougham Hayes into the building formerly used by the Domestic Science College. A new gymnasium block was added to the building. In 1964 the new workshop block was completed, as a result the hutments were demolished and the grounds restored to former use as a small sports facility at Brougham Hayes. Twerton Technical Institute closed shortly afterwards and in 1990 it was transformed into forty one flats and two bungalows. The main sports facilities were now located at Bradford road, Combe Down; some considerable distance from the school building. Annual sports day events were held at the Norwood running track situated where the University of Bath has now been built. The many pupils that travelled to school from outlying districts benefited from the fact that the new school was adjacent to the main Great Western Railway line. The Oldfield Park Halt station was only a short walk away. The car was not the primary form of transport at that time, most people relied upon public transport such as Trains and Buses.<ref>>City of Bath Technical School research (''1990-7'') Jefferies, Malcolm at Somerset Records Office [http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives] - B.&.N.E.S. records ref 1411/1/6</ref>

In 1965 The labour government declared its intention of ending pupil selection ''(at 11 years of age)'' and eliminating separation in secondary education. As a result in 1966 Bath Education Authority issued a report on secondary education in the city which was followed by various proposals but ultimately led to BTS being disbanded.<ref>>City of Bath Technical School research (''1990-7'') Jefferies, Malcolm at Somerset Records Office [http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives] - B.&.N.E.S. records ref 1411/1/6</ref>

In September 1970 The City of Bath Technical School closed when it amalgamated with Westhill Boys School (''founded in 1956'') to become [[Culverhay School|Culverhay Comprehensive School]]. Early in the 1970<U+2019>s a purpose built Culverhay School facility was adapted from the existing West Hill Boys School building constructed in 1956. This took place despite a  protest letter to the Bath Education Authority ''(from the then headmaster F.T. Naylor and the teaching staff'') that the proposal to introduce a new system of technical education in Bath would possibly result in a lowering of educational standards.<ref>>City of Bath Technical School research (''1990-7'') Jefferies, Malcolm at Somerset Records Office [http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives] - B.&.N.E.S. records ref 1411/1/8</ref>

==Emblem==

[[File:City of Bath Technical School Emble 1.jpg|thumb|right|City of Bath Technical School Emblem]]
The school had three badges during its history. <ref>City of Bath Technical School (''Private publication 1997'') Jefferies, Malcolm held at Somerset Records Office - B.&.N.E.S. [http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives] ref 1411/1/8 to 12</ref>The first was the Bath Technical College badge which was a simple design- BTC in thin red letters within a shield outlined with a thin red line- and this lasted until the City of Bath Technical School was created in 1949 The second badge lasted until early 1954 and the only record of it is on the school photograph of March 1950 The third badge, which lasted until 1970, was designed in early 1954 by Mr Ken Box, Head of Art and included the motto, 'NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA '. The literal translation is 'UNLESS THE LORD IN VAIN'. This is not much help. The motto is based on Psalm 127 and the more usual translation is 'EXCEPT THE LORD APPROVE WE LABOUR IN VAIN' while another translation might be 'UNLESS THE LORD IS WITH US OUR EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN'
The badge has the Book of Knowledge open to show the motto, over the City wall with the Avon beneath. The open pages are white with yellow ends, the City wall is yellow, the river Avon white and the background a shade of blue
