There have been other instances when ''Kvinneakt'' was used to make a statement or act as a prop. On April Fools' Day, 1982, the Portland Rainmakers gathered around the sculpture, issued a proclamation condemning nudity, "even in statues, for viewing by the general public", and left the statue covered with a "size 42-plus", lacy bra.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sacred cows foil of fools for April 1|first=Jack|last=Hart|work=The Oregonian|date=April 2, 1982|accessdate=May 10, 2012|volume=132|number=37,992|page=1}}</ref> In 1984 the statue was vandalized with the painted text "Jesus Saves".<ref>{{cite news|title=Statue vandalized|date=January 3, 1984|newspaper=The Oregonian|page=B3}}</ref>  In January 1985, on the day Bud Clark took the oath of office of Mayor of Portland, ''Kvinneakt'' was draped anonymously with a [[sash]] reading "Congratulations".<ref>{{cite news|title=Inaugural ball takes on regal proportions|date=January 3, 1985|accessdate=May 10, 2012|work=The Oregonian|page=B2|first=John|last=Painter, Jr.}}</ref> In 2007 Tom Burkleaux, founder of New Deal Vodka, posted an image of the sculpture on the company's website with the woman's nipples airbrushed off, protesting censorship after the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] deemed the website "offensive".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-6630-gossip_should_have_no_friends.html|title=Gossip Should Have No Friends|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2012|work=Willamette Week|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> In 2012, Century of Action, a project of the Oregon Women's History Consortium, used the sculpture to promote [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] by placing a "Votes for Women" sash across her chest as part of the organization's "Sash Project".<ref>Sources for Century of Action's Sash Project:

==Reception==
''Kvinneakt'' is often referred to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s.<ref name=Gottberg/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/pdfs/1989/03_chapter2-Portland.PDF|title=Chapter 2: Portland's 1972 Downtown Plan: Rebirth of the Public City|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=Bruner Foundation}}</ref> In addition to being somewhat controversial for its use of nudity, the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art. In 1981, Taylor recalled that following the sculpture's first installation one man told him that "he ought to be ashamed of himself."<ref name="returned"/> In 1985 Jeff Kuechle of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' listed the work as one of the city's "worst sculptures".<ref name="rogue's gallery">{{cite news|last=Kuechle|first=Jeff|title=The Rogue's Gallery: Portland's worst sculptures|date=November 24, 1985|newspaper=The Sunday  Oregonian|pages=B1, B13}}</ref> In the article, Claire Kelly, director of [[Portland State University]]'s art and architecture program said, "She's more than simplistic, she's absurd. It's not a piece that belongs on public display."<ref name="rogue's gallery"/> In contrast, ''Monk Magazine'' described the sculpture as "the best-looking girl in Portland" with "her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure".<ref name=Monk/>  According to the magazine, Portland is the only city in the United States with a "flasher statue".<ref name=Monk/>  The sculpture was included in Kate Chynoweth's 2003 book, ''The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest: A Romantic Travel Guide'', as one of Portland's "romantic highlights".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VcoN6DBePmwC&pg=PA2&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest: A Romantic Travel Guide|page=2|first=Kate|last=Chynoweth|publisher=Sasquatch Books|date=October 29, 2003|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>
