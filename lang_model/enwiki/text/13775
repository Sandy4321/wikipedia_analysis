'''Exile''' means to be away from one's home (i.e. [[city]], [[state]] or [[country]]) while either being explicitly refused permission to return and/or being threatened by [[prison]] or [[Capital punishment|death]] upon return. It can be a form of [[punishment]].<ref Name="Hobbes">{{cite book  | last = Hobbes  | first = Thomas  | title = Leviathan; Or, The Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil  | publisher = George Routledge and Sons  | date = 1886  | location =  | pages = Page 145   | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8-QtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&dq=Exile+can+be+a+form+of+punishment.&as_brr=1&ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =  | id =  }}</ref>

It is common to distinguish between ''internal exile'', i.e., forced resettlement within the [[country]] of residence, and ''external exile'', [[deportation]] outside the country of residence. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Exile can also be a self-imposed departure from one's homeland. Self-exile is often practiced as form of protest or to avoid persecution.

Exile was used particularly for political opponents of those in power. The use of exile for political purposes can sometimes be useful for the government because it prevents the exilee from organizing in their native land or from becoming a [[martyr]]. People feared exile and banishment so much because it effectively meant that they were going to die. In European history, at a time prior to Roman invasion, people lived completely co-dependently in farm towns where everyone had a function. Exile represented a severe punishment, particularly for those, like [[Ovid]] or [[Du Fu]], exiled to strange or backward regions, cut off from all of the possibilities of life as well as their families and associates. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] describes the pain of exile in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'':

:<U+00AB>. . . Tu lascerai ogne cosa diletta
:pi<U+00F9> caramente; e questo <U+00E8> quello strale
:che l'arco de lo essilio pria saetta.
:Tu proverai s<U+00EC> come sa di sale
:lo pane altrui, e come <U+00E8> duro calle
:lo scendere e 'l salir per l'altrui scale . . .<U+00BB>

:". . . You will leave everything you love most: 
:this is the arrow that the bow of exile
:shoots first. You will know how salty
:another's bread tastes and how hard it
:is to ascend and descend 
:another's stairs . . ."

:Paradiso XVII: 55-60 

Exile has been softened, to some extent, in the [[19th century|nineteenth]] and [[20th century|twentieth]] centuries, as exiles have received welcome in other countries and have either created new communities within those countries or, less frequently, returned to their [[homeland]]s following the demise of the regime that exiled them.

== Government in exile ==
{{main|Government in exile}}

During a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'etat]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], a government in exile led by the [[Dalai Lama]] in [[India]], who claims to be the legitimate ruler of the historical [[Tibet]]<U+200E>.

== Nation in exile ==
{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}

When large groups, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in ''exile'', or '''[[Diaspora]]'''. Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon]] in 597 BC and again in the years following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the year AD 70. 
After the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the [[uprising]]s (like [[Kosciuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen - or been forced - into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States.The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimea]] was exiled on [[18 May]] [[1944]] to [[Central Asia]] as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967  and 1973  the [[British Government]] forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a [[military base]] today jointly operated by the [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]].

== Tax exile ==
{{main|Tax exile}}

A wealthy citizen who departs from a former abode for a lower tax jurisdiction (a "[[tax haven]]") in order to reduce his/her [[taxation|tax burden]] is termed a ''tax exile''.
