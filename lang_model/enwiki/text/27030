Manning opened the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|2006 season]] against his brother Eli's New York Giants on Sunday Night Football (the first "Manning Bowl").

A second trip to New York, this time to play the Jets, produced another Colts win.

==== 2007 season ====
Manning's [[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] opened the NFL season with 7 wins, pitting them against an undefeated Patriots squad in a match-up that was being called "Super Bowl 41.5". Manning and Addai helped the Colts to a 13<U+2013>7 half-time lead, and an early fourth quarter touchdown upped the lead to 20<U+2013>10. However, Brady led the Patriots to two late touchdowns, to hand Manning his first loss of the season, 24<U+2013>20. Manning finished the game with 225&nbsp;yards passing, including a passing touchdown. He also had a rushing touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20071104_NE@IND|title=Brady leads fourth-quarter rally in Indy as Pats remain unbeaten|publisher=CBS Sportsline|date=2007-11-04|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref>

Manning did not bounce back from the loss well. Against the San Diego Chargers he threw for a career-worst and franchise-record 6 interceptions. Despite this, he was able to rally the Colts from a 23<U+2013>0 deficit to 23<U+2013>21, and gave Adam Vinatieri an opportunity to take the lead with a 29-yard field goal. Vinatieri's miss sunk the Colts to 7<U+2013>2.  Manning did not play particularly well against the Kansas City Chiefs either, throwing no touchdowns. However, he managed to lead the Colts on a late drive for a game-winning field goal, rushing for two yards on 4th and 1 in the process.

'''Week 15 at [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] (W 35<U+2013>31)''': For a record 7th time in a season (35th career), Manning led the Colts to victory after trailing in the 4th quarter on Thursday Night Football.

He was 12/12 in the first half with 2 TD passes on the only two offensive possessions the Colts had in the half.

'''Week 16 vs. [[New York Jets]] (L 29-15)''': Manning completed 14/21 passes for 192 yards to became the fourth QB in NFL history to pass for 50,000 yards, and is the fastest and youngest to reach that mark.

After building a 9-0 lead, the Colts trailed 10-9 when the Jets returned the opening kickoff of the third quarter for a TD. Manning led the Colts on an 81 yard TD drive (two-point conversion failed) to take a 15-10 lead. With 5:36 remaining in the third quarter, rookie back up [[Curtis Painter]] replaced Manning at QB as Colts coach Jim Caldwell began to rest his starters for the remainder of the game. As the crowd booed the decision, Painter fumbled on his second possession and it was returned for the go ahead score. The Jets would outscore the Colts 19-0 after Manning was taken out. When asked about the decision, Manning said, "I was prepared that that potentially could be the case. I wasn't surprised when that news was told to me."<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20091227_NYJ@IND "Colts pass on perfection, pull Manning in loss to Jets"], CBSSports.com</ref>

After running just six plays in the second quarter, the Colts led 10-6 at halftime. The Saints recovered an onside kick to start the second half and took their first lead, 13-10. Manning led a go ahead TD drive to regain the lead. Leading 17-16 at the start of the 4th quarter, [[Matt Stover]] missed a 51 yard field goal for the Colts. The Saints scored the go ahead TD and two-point conversion to take a 24-17 lead with 5:42 left. Manning took over and moved the Colts to the Saints' 31 yard line. Facing a 3rd & 5 with 3:24 left, his pass intended for Reggie Wayne was intercepted by [[Tracy Porter]], who returned it 74 yards for a critical TD and 31-17 Saints lead. Manning drove the Colts down to the 5 yard line in the last minute, but his 4th & goal pass was dropped by Reggie Wayne at the goal line. The Saints won their first Super Bowl, dropping Manning to 9-9 in the postseason (1-1 Super Bowl record).

== Personal life ==
Manning was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He married his wife Ashley in Memphis on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 2001. Ashley was introduced to him by her parents' next-door neighbor the summer before Manning's freshman year in college.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=Judy|title=Meet Mrs. Manning|newspaper=Indianapolis Women|date=2006-08-01|url=http://www.indianapoliswoman.com/archive.asp?r=2006%5Caug%5Cmain-features%5Ccover%5Ccover-feature.txt|accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref>

During the summer, Archie, Peyton, Eli, and Cooper run the Manning Passing Academy, a five day camp which aims to improve the offensive skills of quarterbacks, [[wide receiver]]s, [[tight end]]s, and [[running back]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manningpassingacademy.com/|title=Manning Passing Academy|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> In addition to the Mannings, the camp has included many prominent players from football as coaches, such as Colts wide receivers [[Marvin Harrison]] and [[Reggie Wayne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manningpassingacademy.com/camp_coaches/camp_coaches.htm|title=Manning Passing Academy Camp Coaches|publisher=manningpassingacademy.com|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref>

Peyton, along with Archie, authored a book entitled ''Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy'', which was released in 2000. The book covers Archie's and Cooper's lives and careers, and Peyton's life and career up to the time that the book was released, and examines football from both Archie's and Peyton's points-of-view.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning |first=Archie|authorlink=Archie Manning|coauthors=Peyton Manning|title=Manning|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-105136-5}}</ref>

In 2009, Peyton, Eli, and Archie co-authored a children's book entitled ''Family Huddle,'' which describes in simple text and pictures how the three Manning brothers played football as young boys (Scholastic Press; illustrations by Jim Madsen).

Manning has donated over $8,000 to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians, among them [[Fred Thompson]], [[Bob Corker]], and former President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>[http://newsmeat.com/sports_political_donations/Peyton_Manning.php Political Donations- Peyton Manning]</ref>

An [[ESPN]] ''[[This is SportsCenter]]'' ad from 2006 features the entire Manning family; parents Archie and Olivia, with their sons Peyton, Eli and Cooper, touring the SportCenter studios with Peyton and Eli engaging in [[Wiktionary:Horseplay|horseplay]] behind everybody.

He was also featured in one of a series of [[DirecTV]] commercials where celebrities are seen in their element, then suddenly begin [[fourth wall|addressing the viewer]]. In his commercial they parodied his pre-snap audible routine and known delay in calling for the ball by having him pitch [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] instead of changing the play during a blowout game against the Tennessee Titans. Manning also appears in advertisements for St. Mary's Medical Center in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

Manning also hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with musical guest [[Carrie Underwood]] on March 24, 2007, his 31st birthday.
