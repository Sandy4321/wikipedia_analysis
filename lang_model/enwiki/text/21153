Essex County Courthouse]]  -->'''Daniel Perrin''' (b. 1642 d. 1719) was one of the first permanent [[European ethnic groups|European]] inhabitants of [[Staten Island, New York]]. Known as "[[Huguenot|The Huguenot]]", he arrived in [[New York Harbor]] from the Isle of [[Jersey]] on [[July 29]], [[1665]] aboard the ship ''Philip'', under the command of [[Philip Carteret (Governor)|Philip Carteret]]. He lived in Elizabethtown, part of the [[Elizabethtown Tract]] (now [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]), for a while before moving across the [[Arthur Kill]] and settling on [[Staten Island]]. In 1692 he was granted {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land by Governor [[Benjamin Fletcher]] in an area along the south shore of Staten Island then known as ''Smoking Point''. During the [[Revolutionary War]] this area was known as ''Blazing Star'', and is now known as [[Rossville, Staten Island|''Rossville'']].

Daniel Perrin was married to Maria Thorel on [[February 18]], [[1666]], and they had four sons (he also had three daughters from a previous marriage). Perrin died in Staten Island on [[September 6]], [[1719]]. [http://www.familyorigins.com/users/g/a/g/Mary-A-Gage/FAMO1-0001/d46.htm#P2649]

The Staten Island neighborhood of [[Huguenot, Staten Island|Huguenot]] is named after him and the other Huguenots who settled in the area during the late 17th century and early 18th centuries.
