'''G-banding''' or '''[[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]] banding''' is a technique used in [[cytogenetics]] to produce a visible [[karyotype]] by staining condensed [[chromosome]]s. It is useful for identifying genetic diseases through the photographic representation of the entire chromosome complement.<ref name=Speicher>Speicher, Michael R. and Nigel P. Carter. "The New Cytogenetics: Blurring the Boundaries with Molecular Biology." ''Nature'' Reviews Genetics, Vol 6. Oct 2005.</ref> The [[metaphase]] chromosomes are treated with [[trypsin]] (to partially digest the chromosome) and [[Staining (biology)|stained]] with Giemsa. Dark bands that take up the stain are strongly A,T rich (gene poor). The reverse of G<U+2011>bands is obtained in R<U+2011>banding. Banding can be used to identify chromosomal abnormalities, such as [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]s, because there is a unique pattern of light and dark bands for each chromosome.<ref name=Speicher />

It is difficult to identify and group chromosomes based on simple staining because the uniform color of the structures makes it difficult to differentiate between the different chromosomes. Therefore, techniques like G<U+2011>banding were developed that made "bands" appear on the chromosomes. These bands were the same in appearance on the [[homologous chromosomes]], thus, identification became easier and more accurate. The acid-saline-Giemsa protocol reveals G<U+2011>bands.
