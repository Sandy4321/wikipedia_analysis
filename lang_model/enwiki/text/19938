The '''International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes''' ('''ICSID''') is an [[international arbitration]] institution which facilitates arbitration and [[conciliation]] of legal disputes between international [[investor]]s. The ICSID is a member of the [[World Bank Group]] and is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]]. It was established in 1966 as a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] specialized [[dispute resolution]] institution to encourage international flow of [[investment]] and mitigate non-commercial risks. Although the ICSID is a member of the World Bank Group and receives its funding from the [[World Bank]], it was established as an autonomous institution by a separate treaty drafted by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]'s executive directors and signed by member countries.<ref name="ICSID About 2012">{{Cite web | title = About ICSID | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=ShowHome&pageName=AboutICSID_Home | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="ICSID Organizational Structure 2012">{{Cite web | title = Organizational Structure of ICSID | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=RightFrame&FromPage=Organization%20and%20Structure&pageName=Organization | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}</ref> The ICSID is contracted with and governed by its member countries, but has its own Secretariat which carry out its normal operations. The center facilitates arbitration and conciliation proceedings, allowing independent tribunals and arbitration mechanisms to hold proceedings under its rules, and all contracting member states agree to enforce and uphold arbitral awards in accordance with the ISCID Convention. The ICSID also helps administer dispute resolution proceedings under other treaties and for alternative arbitration mechanisms. The center also performs advisory activities and maintains several publications.

==History==
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]) had made several attempts to create a framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the [[expropriation]] of [[foreign direct investment]]. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed the idea for a [[multilateral treaty|multilateral agreement]] on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts from all parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's Board of Directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The Board of Directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled ''Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States'', and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on March 18, 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention, establishing the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, entered into force on October 14, 1966.<ref name="Reed et al. 2010">{{Cite book | title = Guide to ICSID Arbitration, 2nd Edition | author = Reed, Lucy | author2 = Paulsson, Jan | author3 = Blackaby, Nigel | year = 2010 | publisher = Kluwer Law International | location = The Hague, Netherlands | isbn = 978-9-04-113401-1}}</ref><ref name="ICSID Convention 2006">{{Cite report | title = ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2006 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/CRR_English-final.pdf | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="ICSID About 2012" />

==Governance==
The ICSID is governed by its Administrative Council which meets annually and elects the center's Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, approves rules and regulations, conducts the center's case proceedings, and approves the center's budget and annual report. The council consists of one representative from each of the center's contracting member states and is chaired by the [[World Bank Group#Presidency|President of the World Bank Group]], although the president may not vote. The ICSID's normal operations are carried out by its Secretariat which comprises 40 employees and is led by the Secretary-General of the ICSID. The Secretariat provides support to the Administrative Council in conducting the center's proceedings. It also manages the center's Panel of Conciliators and Panel of Arbitrators. Each contracting member state may appoint four persons to each panel.<ref name="ICSID Convention 2006" />{{rp|15}} In addition to serving as the center's principal, the Secretary-General is responsible for legally representing the ICSID and serving as the registrar of its proceedings. {{As of|2012}}, [[Meg Kinnear]] serves as the center's Secretary-General.<ref name="ICSID Organizational Structure 2012" />

==Activities==
The ICSID does not conduct arbitration or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has two sets of rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed in accordance with the ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention.<ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2011">{{Cite report | title = ICSID 2011 Annual Report | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2011 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&actionVal=ViewAnnualReports&year=2011_Eng | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2010">{{Cite report | title = ICSID 2010 Annual Report | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2010 | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&actionVal=ViewAnnualReports&year=2010_Eng | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="Goldman 2007">{{Cite journal | title = How "Water for All!" policy became hegemonic: The power of the World Bank and its transnational policy networks | journal = Geoforum | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | date = 2007 | pages = 786-800 | author = Goldman, Michael | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718506001382 | accessdate = 2012-08-02}}</ref> Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary.

The ICSID Secretariat may also administer dispute resolution proceedings under other treaties and regularly assists tribunals or disputing parties in arbitrations among investors and states under the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]]'s arbitration regulations. The center provides administrative and technical support for a number of international dispute resolution proceedings through alternative facilities such as the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], and the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name="ICSID Annual Report 2011" />

The ICSID also conducts advisory activities and research and publishes ''Investment Laws of the World and of Investment Treaties''.<ref name="ICSID Publications 2012">{{Cite web | title = ICSID Publications | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDPublicationsRH&actionVal=ViewPublications&reqFrom=Main | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}</ref> Since April 1986, the center has published a semi-annual law journal entitled ''[[ICSID Review|ICSID Review: Foreign Investment Law Journal]]''.<ref name="ICSID Review Journal 2012">{{Cite web | title = ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=ICSIDBibliographyRH&actionVal=IcsidReview | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}</ref>

Although the ICSID's proceedings generally take place in Washington, D.C., parties may agree that proceedings be held at one of a number of possible alternative locations, including the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the [[Regional Arbitration Centres of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee]] in [[Cairo]], in [[Kuala Lumpur]], or in [[Lagos]], the [[Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration]] in [[Melbourne]], the [[Australian Commercial Disputes Centre]] in [[Sydney]], the [[Singapore International Arbitration Centre]], the [[Gulf Cooperation Council Commercial Arbitration Centre]] in [[Bahrain]], the [[German Institution of Arbitration]], the [[Maxwell Chambers]] in Singapore, the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]], and the [[Centre for Arbitration and Conciliation at the Chamber of Commerce of Bogota]].<ref name="ICSID Institutional Arrangements 2012">{{Cite web | title = Institutional Arrangements | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes | url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=RightFrame&FromPage=Co-operation%20agreements&pageName=Coop_with_Oth_Inst | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}</ref>
