The '''WAC''' or '''WAC Corporal''' was the first [[sounding rocket]] developed in the [[United States]].<ref>

It was designed and built jointly by the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] and the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]].<ref name="Boeing">

The WAC Corporal was a liquid-fuel rocket, with fuming [[nitric acid]] and [[aniline]] used as [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]]s and [[furfuryl alcohol]] as [[rocket fuel|fuel]], launched with the help of a solid fuel [[Tiny Tim (rocket)|Tiny Tim]] booster.

The first WAC Corporal dummy round was launched  on September 16, 1945 from [[White Sands Missile Range]] near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]].  After a White Sands V-2 rocket had reached 69 miles on May 10, a White Sands WAC Corporal reached 80&nbsp;km (49&nbsp;mi) on May 22, 1946 <U+2014> the first U.S.-designed rocket to reach the edge of space (under the U.S. definition of space at the time).  On February 24, 1949, a [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper]] (a German [[V-2]] rocket acting as first stage) bearing a WAC Corporal at White Sands accelerated to 5,150 mph to become the first flight of more than five times the speed of sound.<ref name=Winter>{{Citation

Scientists were later surprised when almost a year after the launch, tail fragments of the WAC Corporal rocket that reached 5,150 mph and an altitude of over 250 miles, were found and identified in the New Mexico desert near the launch site.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KZIzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H8QDAAAAIBAJ&dq=white%20sands&pg=2549%2C2699124 "Fragment of Rocket Sets New Mystery"], ''Melbourne, Australia - The Age newspaper'', Jan 31, 1950</ref> 

A few WAC Corporals survive in museums, including one at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] and another in the White Sands Missile Range Museum.

== Name ==
The early U.S. rocket programs were named for [[enlisted rank]]s in the [[United States Army]]:  [[Private (missile)|Private]], [[MGM-5 Corporal|Corporal]], and [[MGM-29 Sergeant|Sergeant]].  When, in the words of former [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] director
[[William Hayward Pickering]], researchers <U+201C>came along with this sounding rocket which really didn<U+2018>t fit the pattern<U+201D> of <U+201C>getting bigger as you went along<U+201D>, the rocket <U+201C>was named after the [[Women's Army Corps|Women<U+2019>s Army Corps]] (WAC)<U+201C>.<ref>
