'''Samsoni Monastery''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: <U+054D><U+0561><U+0574><U+057D><U+0578><U+0576><U+056B> <U+054E><U+0561><U+0576><U+0584>) is a 12th-13th century monastery easiest reached via [[Yenokavan]] in the [[Tavush Province]] of northern [[Armenia]]. It is a small monastic complex that is located in a forested area along the slopes of a mountain approximately 6 km to the south of [[Deghdznuti Vank]] of the 13th c. and not far from the medieval fort of [[Berdakar Fort|Berdakar]].
