'''''Aconit''''' (J1095, formerly [[HMS Aconite (K58)|HMS ''Aconite'']]) was one of the nine [[Flower class corvette|''Flower''-class]] [[corvette]]s lent by the [[Royal Navy]] to the [[Free French Forces|''Force Navales Fran<U+00E7>aises Libres'']] (Free French Naval Forces). During [[World War II]], she escorted 116 [[convoy]]s, spending 728 days at sea. She was awarded the ''[[Croix de la Lib<U+00E9>ration]]'' and the ''[[Croix de Guerre]]'' 1939&ndash;1945, and was cited by the British [[Admiralty]].

==War service==
===Early history 1941-42===
''Aconite'' was built by [[Ailsa Shipbuilding Company]] Ltd at [[Troon]] in [[Scotland]], and was commissioned on 19 July 1941, under ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Levasseur. She was attached to the Free French Naval Forces on 23 July 1941, and assigned to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] escort group on 17 August 1941, joining the Newfoundland Forces.

''Aconit'' took a very active part in the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic]] for two years, protecting convoys sailing from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] via [[Iceland]]. She also took part to the operations in [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]] between 10 and 27 December 1941.

In 1942 ''Aconit'', with three other FNFL corvettes, was assigned to Escort Group B-3 of the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] and served with this group for the rest of the campaign.

===Finest hour 1943===
On 10 and 11 March 1943, ''Aconit'', one of eight warships escorting a large convoy HX228, destroyed two German submarines, [[German submarine U-444|''U-444'']] ([[Oberleutnant]] Albert Langfeld) and [[German submarine U-432|''U-432'']] ([[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]] Hermann Eckhardt).
<ref>"Yankee RN" by Cdr Alex H. Cherry OBE RNVR, published in 1953, has a chapter devoted to ''Aconit'' and Group Leader HMS ''Harvester''.</ref> 
On Tuesday 9 March the convoy was five days out from Newfoundland. At 0800 a plane from a U.S. carrier sighted a U-boat {{convert|10|mi|km}} ahead. At 1500, the carrier was short on fuel and had to turn back. At 1930, an ammunition ship had been hit and on a second ship SS ''Andrea F. Luckenbach'', men were taking to the boats.

[[HMS Harvester (H19)|HMS ''Harvester'']], a [[Havant class destroyer|''Havant''-class destroyer]], under Commander Andre Tait DSO,RN, hunted ''U-444'' by sweeping through the lumbering convoy. A corvette was detailed to rescue survivors as the underwater search went on. Hours passed as the destroyer remained in the attack area. At midnight, {{convert|4|mi|km}} astern of the convoy, silently moving up to regain station, there dead ahead ''U-444'' was surfaced and going at top speed after the convoy. Then the U-boat dived. HMS ''Harvester'' raced over the swirl of the U-boat's dive forcing her to surface by depth charge attacks. Circling at speed HMS ''Harvester'' searched and spotted the prey 500 yards ahead. Making revs for {{convert|27|kn|km/h}} the destroyer rammed ''U-444'', disabling herself in the process. From astern the Free French corvette ''Aconit'' sighted ''U-444'' as HMS ''Harvester'' broke free. ''Aconit'' raced in to ram ''U-444''. 

HMS ''Harvester'', dead in the water, picked up one survivor and ''Aconit'' another four. Cdr Tait ordered ''Aconit'' to rejoin convoy HX228 and with only the damaged starboard propeller shaft turning. HMS ''Harvester'' limped behind at {{convert|9|kn|km/h}}. At 0400 on 10 March, 50 survivors of SS ''William C. Gorgas'' (a [[Liberty ship]] sunk by ''U-757'') were sighted and rescued.  During the morning of 11 March, the remaining shaft broke. A signal was made to ''Aconit'' "Am stopped. Stand by me".

At 1100 the first torpedo from ''U-432'' struck home. As the officers and crew prepared to abandon ship in the middle of the intensely cold Atlantic, the second torpedo raced towards the stricken ship. Everything disintegrated. The Commander, seven officers, 136 ratings and 39 survivors were lost. At this moment, the ''Aconit'' returned to the scene and swiftly avenged ''Harvester'' by forcing ''U-432'' to surface, then sinking her with artillery fire and ramming. During the day, the French corvette picked up 60 survivors from ''Harvester'', including 12 survivors from the ''William C. Gorgas''. ''Aconit'' also captured 12 survivors from ''U-432'', including the second officer in addition to the four rescued from ''U-444''.

The senior surviving officer of ''Harvester'', Lt. J. L. Briggs (who had been Gunnery Control Officer) interviewed the OberLeutnant second-in command of ''U-432'', who had launched both torpedoes "Why did you need to fire the second torpedo so shallow? What did you want to do, kill as many as you could?" OberLeutnant replied "Didn't think you were sinking fast enough."

===To war's end 1943-45===

From 1 to 12 April, ''Aconit'' undertook repairs in [[Glasgow]]. On 21 April 1943, at [[Greenock]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] came aboard and awarded the corvette and her commander the ''[[Ordre de la Lib<U+00E9>ration|Croix de la Lib<U+00E9>ration]]''.

Under major repairs from 1 September to 10 October 1943, her commander was replaced by ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Le Miller. She rejoined the Battle of the Atlantic, attacking a German submarine on 13 December 1943.

''Aconit'' spent the first months of 1944 in [[Casablanca]] and [[Gibraltar]], and on 5 June 1944 she escorted the convoy U-3 from [[Torbay]] to [[France]], coming under attack from German airplanes. During the [[Normandy landings]], she was attached to the 108th escort group, along with Free French ships ''Aventure'', ''Escarmouche'' and ''Renoncule''.

She last fired in anger on 11 April 1945. On 18 April, she undertook minor repairs, and returned to escorting convoys in May, until 5 June 1945, the official date for the end of naval operations in European waters.

==Post war==
''Aconit'' was briefly used by the Naval school, before being given back to the [[Royal Navy]] on 30 April 1947, where she served briefly as '''''Terje XI''''' before being renamed to '''''Terrier Southern''''', and then being sold in July.

== Legacy==
In honour of this unit, three French warships have since been named ''Aconit'' including the modern stealth frigate [[French frigate Aconit|''Aconit'']].
