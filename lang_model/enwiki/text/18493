According to David Askew, "the majority of academic research on the Nanjing Incident is conducted in Japanese,     English and Chinese. Of the three language groups, Japanese has produced the most sophisticated research, with the debate in English lagging decades behind. The most objective Chinese language materials are the collections of various primary sources, including the recollections of many of the Chinese military personnel in Nanjing."  Askew asserts that "the research [written] in Japanese remains superior to that [written] in English and Chinese.<ref name=Askew >{{cite journal |journal=electronic journal of contemporary japanese studies |date=2002-04-04 |title=The Nanjing Incident - Recent Research and Trends |first=David |last=Askew |accessdate=2009-03-24 |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html}}</ref>

The major waves of Japanese treatment of the [[Nanking Massacre]] have ranged from total cover-up during the war, confessions and documentation by the Japanese soldiers during the 1950s and 60's, minimization of the extent of the Nanjing Massacre during the 70's and 80's, official distortion and rewriting of history during the 80's, and total denial of the occurrence of the Nanjing Massacre by some government officials in 1990.<ref name=BasicFacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnd.org/mirror/nanjing/NMNJ.html |title=Basic facts on the Nanking Massacre and the Tokyo War Crimes Trial |year=1990}}</ref>

==During the Sino-Japanese War==

During the war, the Japanese Government kept a tight control over the news media.  As a result, the Japanese public was not aware of the Nanking Massacre or other war crimes committed by the Japanese military. In fact, the Japanese military were always portrayed as heroes.  Japanese officials lied about civilian death figures at the time of the Nanking Massacre, and some Japanese [[Uyoku dantai|ultranationalist]]s are still active in attempting to deny that the killings ever occurred.<ref name=dillon>{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Dana R. |title=The China Challenge |year=2007 |pages=pp. 9-10}}</ref><ref name=gall>{cite book |last=Gallicchio |first=Marc S. |title='The Unpredictability of the Past |year=2007 |pages=p. 158}}</ref>

One brief lapse in the Japanese Government's control over negative depictions of the war was the fleeting public distribution of Tatsuzo Ishikawa's wartime novel, Living Soldier (Ikiteiru heitai), which depicted the grim and dehumanizing effects of the war.  Ishikawa and his publisher tried to satisfy government censors by a deliberate decision to self-censor lines about soldiers 'forag[ing] for fresh meat' and 'search[ing] for women like dogs chasing a rabbit,' while still preserving the overall tone and import of the novel.  The novel was published in 1938 but was pulled from circulation within days; Ishikawa was sentenced to a four month prison term for disturbing 'peace and order.' <ref>{{cite book |author=Li, Fei Fei, Robert Sabella and David Liu (eds) |year=2002 |title=Nanking 1937: Memory and Healing |location=Armonk, NY |publisher=M.E.

==War crimes tribunals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}} 
It was not until the [[Tokyo Trial]] (tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East) and the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal|Nanjing Trial]] that the truth of the Nanking Massacre was first revealed to the Japanese civilians. The atrocities revealed during the trials shocked Japanese society at the time. 

==1950s==
Yoshie Hotta  wrote a series of pieces of historical fiction in the 1950s about the atrocities in Nanjing.

==1960s==
In 1967, Tomio Hora published his seminal account "Nankin Jiken" in which he refuted revisionist denial of the massacre.  This detailed treatment of the incident was the first meaningful and in-depth description of the massacre in Japanese postwar historiography.<ref>Hora, Tomio, "Nankin jiken," (The Nanjing incident) in Kindai senshi no nazo, (Mysteries of modern war history)  Tokyo:  Jimbutsu oraisha, 1967.</ref>

Leftwing journalists in Japan began researching the events of the massacre in the late 1960s; in some cases, these efforts were inspired by the contemporaneous American war in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite |journal |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |title=Response to Herbert P. Bix, "Remembering the Nanking Massacre" |url=http://japanfocus.org/-Joshua_A_-Fogel/1637 |last=Fogel |first=Joshua}}</ref>

==1970s==
International interest in the Nanking Massacre waned into near obscurity until 1972, the year China and Japan normalized diplomatic relationships. 

The debate concerning the killings and rapes took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Also coming under attack were the burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which were said to be fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanking Massacre.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/fiction/index.html |title=THE NANKING MASSACRE: Fact Versus Fiction |last=Higashinakano |first=Shudo |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Japanese journalist [[Katsuichi Honda]] traveled toChina to explore the wartime conduct of the Imperial Army.  Based on his research in China, Honda wrote a series of articles for the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' on the atrocities (such as the Nanjing Massacre) committed by Japanese soldiers during [[World War II]] called "Ch<U+016B>goku no Tabi" (<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+306E><U+65C5>, "Travels in China").{{Fact|date=March 2009}}  The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes.  

The denial movement began with two controversial yet influential articles: an article by Shichihei Yamamoto, "Reply to Katsuichi Honda";<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reply to Katsuichi Honda |first=Shichihei last=Yamamoto |journal=Every Gentlemen |date=March 1972}}</ref> (2) an article by Akira Suzuki, "The Phantom of The Nanjing Massacre". <ref>{{cite journal |title=The Phantom of The Nanjing Massacre |first=Akira |last=Suzuki |journal=Every Gentlemen |date=April 1972}}</ref>

==Japanese history textbooks==
{{seealso|Japanese history textbook controversies}}

On [[June 12]], [[1965]], an author of the school textbook, Professor [[Sabur<U+014D> Ienaga]], sued the Ministry of Education.<ref name="japantimes"/> He claimed that he suffered through his experience that the government's allegedly unconstitutional system of textbook authorization made him change the contents of his draft textbook against his will and violated his right to freedom of expression. This case was ultimately decided in [[Sabur<U+014D> Ienaga|Ienaga]]'s favor in 1997.<ref name="japantimes">{{cite journal |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19970829a1.html |title=Supreme Court backs Ienaga in textbook suit |journal=The Japan Times}}</ref>

The way in which the subject is taught in Japanese schools became the center of controversy in the Japanese textbook controversies of 1982 and 1986.  The Nanking Massacre "was still absent from elementary school textbooks [but] junior high school textbooks such as those published by Nihon shoseki and Ky<U+014D>iku Shuppan in 1975, for instance, mentioned that forty-two thousand Chinese civilians, including women and children, were killed during the Massacre."<ref>{{cite book |author=Fogel |title=The Nanjing Massacre |pages=page 84}}</ref>  Two other textbooks mentioned the massacre but the four other textbooks in use in Japan did not mention it all.  By 1978 the Ministry of Education was able to remove the numbers killed out of all text books in use.

In 1982, the Ministry of Education embarked on a campaign to reframe the presentation of the history of World War II in history textbooks.  History textbooks were reworded to describe the Sino-Japanese War as "advancing in and out of China" instead of "aggression" which was deemed to be a more pejorative term. The Nanjing Massacre was characterized as a minor incident which was sparked by the frustration of Japanese soldiers at meeting strong resistance from the Chinese Army.  These moves sparked strong protests from other Asian countries.
In 1993, Hosokawa Morihiro, prime minister of the first non-Liberal Democratic Party government, called Japan's expansion through Asia in the 1930s and '40s an "aggressive war." Two years later socialist prime minister Murayama Tomiichi expressed "deep remorse" for Japan's colonial rule and aggression.

At the same time, officially endorsed school textbooks were rewritten to reflect these views. For example, six out of the seven junior high school history books approved in 1997 said the Japanese military killed up to 200,000 people in the capture of Nanking and four of those books reported the Chinese estimate of 300,000 people.

Besides total denial, another line of Japanese thought insisted that the scale of the Nanjing Massacre had been exaggerated by the Chinese. This view was expounded by [[Ikuhiko Hata]] in his book "Nanjing Incident" <ref>{{cite book |title=Nanjing Incident |last=Hata |first=Ikuhiko |publisher=Chuo Koron Shinsho |year=1986}}</ref>.  Hata asserted that the number of victims in the Massacre was between 38,000-42,000. He also argued that the killing of surrendered or captured soldiers should not be considered as "Massacre". This book is now considered as the official authoritative history text on the issue by the Japan Ministry of Education.<ref name=BasicFacts />

==1980s==
It was not until the 1980's that the Chinese began a serious study of the Massacre. Their painstaking research of burial records, documents, and interviews, concluded that the massacre took the lives of nearly 300,000 Chinese, thus corroborating the findings of the [[Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]].
 
Masaaki Tanaka's book "Fabrication of Nanjing Massacre" not only denied the Nanjing Massacre denied but laid the blame for the Sino-Japanese war on the Chinese Government.<ref>{{cite book |first=Massaki |last=Tanaka |title=Fabrication of Nanjing Massacre |publisher=Nihon Kyobun Sha |year=1984}}</ref>

In September 1986, the Japanese education minister, Fujio Masayuki, dismissed the Rape of Nanking as "just a part of war."{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

The Japanese distributor of ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987) edited out the [[stock footage]] of the Rape of Nanking from the film.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/NanjingMassacre/NMZCRBR.html |title='Bearing Witness: The granddaughter of survivors of the Japanese massacre of Chinese in Nanjing chronicles the horrors |author=Orville Schell |journal=New York Times -- Book review |date=December 14, 1997}}</ref>

==1990s==
As far as Japanese academics are concerned, the controversy over the occurrence of atrocities ended in the early '90s. Both sides accept that atrocities did occur; however, disagreement exists over the actual numbers.  The debate is focused on the questons of whether to include archival or anecdotal evidence, what time period to use in defining the massacre, and what geographical area to use in defining the massacre. 

===Denial by Japanese government officials===
A number of Japanese cabinet ministers, as well as some high-ranking politicians, have made comments denying the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in [[World War II]].  Among these were General Nagano Shigeto, a World War II veteran and a former chief of staff of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] who was appointed justice minister in spring of 1994.  Shigeto told a Japanese newspaper that "the Nanking Massacre and the rest was a fabrication."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/world/new-tokyo-minister-calls-rape-of-nanking-a-fabrication.html?sec=&spon= |title=New Tokyo Minister Calls 'Rape of Nanking' a Fabrication journal=New York Times |accessdate=1994-05-05}}</ref>

In an interview with Playboy magazine, Tokyo Governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] said, "People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese. It has tarnished the image of Japan, but it is a lie."<ref>Playboy, Vol. 37, No. 10, p 63</ref> Some subsequently resigned after protests from China and [[South Korea]]. 

On November 10, 1990, during a protest by Chinese Americans against the Japanese actions on the island of [[Senkaku Islands|Diao-Yu-Tai]], the Deputy Japanese Consul in Houston asserted that, "the Nanjing Massacre never occurred."

In response to these and similar incidents, a number of Japanese journalists and historians formed the [[Nankin Jiken Ch<U+014D>sa Kenky<U+016B>kai]] (''Nanjing Incident Research Group''). The research group has collected large quantities of archival materials as well as testimonies from both Chinese and Japanese sources.

===Apology and condolences by the prime minister and emperor of Japan===

On August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Surrender of Japan]], the Japanese prime minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war.  He apologized for Japan's wrongful aggression and the great suffering that it inflicted in Asia.  He offered his "heartfelt" apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor Akihito pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan. The emperor offered his condolences and expressed the hope that similar atrocities would never be repeated.

===Iris Chang===

Interest in the West remained muted until the publication of [[Iris Chang]]'s book, [[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]], in 1997. Even though her book was criticized in Japan by both sides of the debate for flaws in accuracy of its historical research, the book raised consciousness of the incident in a much wider Western audience.

===Contemporary debate===
Currently, no notable group in Japan, even among right-wing nationalists, denies that killings did occur in Nanking.  The debate has shifted mainly to the death toll, to the extent of rapes and civilian killings (as opposed to POW and suspected guerrillas) and to the appropriateness of using the word "massacre".  Massacre denialists insist that burial records from the Red Swastika Society and the Chung Shan Tang (Tsung Shan Tong) were never cross examined at the Tokyo and Nanjing trials, arguing therefore that the estimates derived from these two sets of records should be heavily discounted. Although they admit that personal accounts of Japanese soldiers do suggest the occurrence of rapes, they insist that this anecdotal evidence cannot be used to determine the extent of rapes. Moreover, they characterize personal testimonies from the Chinese side to be propaganda. They also point out that, unlike the burial records that document the number of deaths, there are no documented records of the rapes, and so they argue that the allegation of mass rape is unsubstantiated. Massacre denialists also assert that the majority of those killed were POWs and "suspected guerrillas" whose executions they characterize as legitimate, and so they argue the use of the word "massacre" is inappropriate.

However, within the public the debate still continues. Those downplaying the massacre have most recently rallied around a group of academic and journalists associated with the  [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform|Tsukurukai]]. Their views are often echoed in publications associated with conservative, right-wing publishers such as Bungei Shunj<U+016B> and Sankei Shuppan. In response, two Japanese organizations have taken the lead in publishing material detailing the massacre and collecting related documents and accounts. The Study Group on the Nanjing Incident, founded by a group of historians in 1984, has published the most books responding directly to revisionist historians; the Center for Research and Documentation on Japan's War Responsibility, founded in 1993 by [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]], has published many materials in its own journal. 

In 2004, the Japanese Minister of Education expressed a desire to overcome "self-torturing" accounts of Japanese history.

In 2005, violent riots erupted in China over new history textbooks published by right-wing publisher Fusosha which were approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education.

In 2007, a group of around 100 [[Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers.  They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a "political advertisement".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T214128.htm |title=Japan ruling MPs call Nanjing massacre fabrication |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>

On November 2, 2007, the Tokyo District Court upheld a suit filed by Xia Shuqin, a victim of the Nanjing Massacre. Xia had come from a family of nine and was only eight years old at the time of the massacre which claimed the lives of seven of her family members.  Only she and her four-year old sister survived. Xia was stabbed three times with a bayonet and lost consciousness, while her sister, hiding under bed quilts, went unnoticed. However, Japanese massacre denialists argued that Xia<U+2019>s testimony had been fabricated so she sued these writers for defamation of character and won.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:66WNBDfF_uwJ:www.japanfocus.org/products/topdf/3036+Nanking+Massacre+denial&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title=From the Nanjing Massacre to American Global Expansion: Reflections on Asian and American Amnesia |first=Katsuichi |last=Honda}}</ref>
