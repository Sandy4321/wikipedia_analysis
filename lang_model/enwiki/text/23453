The '''Rheic Ocean''' was a [[Paleozoic]] [[ocean]] between the large continent [[Gondwana]] to the south and the microcontinents [[Avalonia]] and others to the north. It formed during the [[Cambrian]] and was destroyed during the [[Hercynian orogeny|Hercynian]] (European name) and [[Alleghenian orogeny|Alleghenian]] (North American name) [[orogeny|orogenies]] during the [[Carboniferous]].

==Geodynamic evolution==
At the beginning of the Paleozoic Era, about 540 million years ago, most of the continental mass on Earth was clustered around the south pole as the paleocontinent Gondwana. The exception was formed by a number of smaller continents, such as [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]]. The Paleozoic ocean between Gondwana, Laurentia and Baltica is called the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. The northern edge of Gondwana had been dominated by the [[Cadomian orogeny]] during the [[Ediacaran]] period. This orogeny formed a [[cordillera]]-type [[volcanic arc]] where [[oceanic crust]] subducted below Gondwana. When a [[mid-oceanic ridge]] [[subduction|subducted]] under an oblique angle, [[extensional tectonics|extensional basins]] developed along the northern margin of Gondwana.<ref>Scenario from Linnemann ''et al.'' (2008)</ref> During the late [[Cambrian]] to [[Early Ordovician]] these extensional basins had evolved a [[rift]] running along the northern edge of Gondwana.<ref>Murphy ''et al.'' (2006); Linnemann ''et al.'' (2007)</ref> The rift in its turn evolved into a mid-oceanic ridge that separated small continental fragments such as Avalonia and [[Carolina (terrane)|Carolina]] from the main Gondwanan land mass.

Avalonia drifted north from Gondwana, the Rheic Ocean grew. The northward movement of Avalonia made the [[Iapetus Ocean]] shrink during the Middle Ordovician to Late Silurian. For much of the Late Ordovician, the Rheic Ocean appears to have widened as fast as today's [[East Pacific Rise]] (at 17&nbsp;cm/year).{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Meanwhile, [[Avalonia]] collided with [[Baltica]] and [[Laurentia]] in the Late Silurian to form [[Laurussia]] during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The Rheic Ocean itself began to close in the [[Devonian]] when Gondwana, probably preceded by terranes that had broken off, drifted towards Laurussia. By the Late [[Devonian]], the Rheic Ocean had become a narrow ocean that was then [[suture (geology)|sutured]] between Gondwana and Laurussia. The ocean closed from east to west, first in what is presently central Europe (the [[Hercynian orogeny]]), then the northeast of North America (Alleghenian orogeny) and northwest of Africa and finally in the southeast of North America ([[Ouachita orogeny]]) and north of South America.

==Name==
The ocean between Baltica and Laurentia was named for [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], in [[Greek mythology]] the father of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], just as the Iapetus Ocean was the predecessor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The ocean between Gondwana and Baltica was then named Rheic Ocean for [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], sister of Iapetus.
