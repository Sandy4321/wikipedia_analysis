==Career==
Canero came up through the youth ranks with [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in 1997, making his first-team debut in August 1999 as a late substitute in the home league win over[[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. Featuring in nearly a dozen matches that season, Canero began season 2000-01 as a first-team regular, scoring his first goals for the club in February 2001 in the [[Scottish League Cup 2000-01#Semi-finals|League Cup semi-final win]] against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and subsequent league win against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]]. Canero scored for [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] at the start of the 2002-03 season and between January and March 2003, scored five goals in six league appearances. By December 2003, Canero was establishing himself as a promising player and with his contract expiring in June 2004, was offered a new three-year deal in December 2003, which amounted to a "60% pay rise".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/3359485.stm|title=Killie offer Canero bumper deal|date=2003-12-31|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> In mid-January, however, Canero was linked with a move to [[Premier League]] side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/3394459.stm|title=Canero to join Leicester|date=2004-01-14|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> and he signed shortly afterwards in a <U+00A3>250,000 deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/3404301.stm|title=Foxes delight for Canero|date=2004-01-19|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> 

Canero didn't make his Leicester debut until mid-March, appearing as a late substitute in the win at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and went on to appear in around half of the remaining fixtures that season, starting once as Leicester were relegated. After undergoing a hip operation and missing the last two games of the season,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/3748933.stm|title=Canero on road to recovery|date=2004-05-26|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> Canero struggled to make an impact in the first team, featuring only six times before the New Year. His last appearance came in November 2004 and after being an unused substitute on several occasions, was released by mutual consent in July 2005, despite featuring for the first time in eight months in an earlier pre-season friendly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/4727353.stm|title=Foxes let midfielder Canero leave|date=2005-07-29|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> He moved to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on a short-term deal in September, before signing with the [[MetroStars]] in January 2006.<ref name="mls bio">{{cite web|url=http://redbull.newyork.mlsnet.com/players/bio.jsp?team=t107&player=canero_p&playerId=can182071&statType=current|title=New York Red Bulls: Roster: Player Bio: Peter Canero|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=Red Bull New York FC}}</ref>  He was waived by the team, now known as Red Bull New York, at the end of the season, after playing very few minutes and being widely considered a disappointment for his salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrofanatic.com/story.jsp?ID=3957|title=A waste of $142,996|date=[[2006-10-04]]|publisher=MetroFanatic.com}}</ref>
