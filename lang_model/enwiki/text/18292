The '''Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording''' was an award presented at the [[22nd Grammy Awards]] in 1980. The [[Grammy Award]]s, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> are presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/|title=Overview|accessdate=February 8, 2010|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

[[Gloria Gaynor]] and [[Record producer|producers]][[ Dino Fekaris]] and [[Freddie Perren]] won the Best Disco Recording award for the song "[[I Will Survive]]". However, because of a backlash against [[disco]], the Academy discontinued the category before the [[23rd Grammy Awards]]. In 1998, a similar category, [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]], began being awarded to honor vocal or [[instrumental]] dance tracks, though there were concerns that the genre would be short-lived much like the disco category.

==Background==
[[Disco]] is a genre of dance music that emerged in the United States during the 1970s.<ref name=Disco>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/14/AR2007121401805.html|title=As the Ball Turns|date=December 16, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|pages=1<U+2013>2}}</ref> The experimental [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of records combined with the newly acquired ability to play longer tracks resulted in a genre well-suited for dancing parties. During 1973<U+2013>74, [[MFSB]]'s "Love Is the Message" displayed "early rumblings of the disco sound", and shortly afterward emerged the songs "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]" by [[Gloria Gaynor]], "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" by [[Van McCoy]], and "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" by [[Donna Summer]].<ref name=Disco/> In 1977, the opening of [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] and the success of the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (which featured [[John Travolta]] and music by the [[Bee Gees]]) added to the popularity of the disco genre. The following year, [[Paradise Garage]] opened in Manhattan's [[West Village]], the New York radio station [[WKTU]] became "all-disco", and the number of [[discoth<U+00E8>que]]s in the nation reached nearly 20,000.<ref name=Disco/> At the [[21st Grammy Awards]] in 1979, ''[[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track]]'', was named [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and the Bee Gees received the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] for their contributions to the [[soundtrack album]].<ref name=OfNote>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30398-2004Dec27.html|title=Of Note|date=December 28, 2004|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company}}</ref><ref name=RockontheNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/popgroup.htm|title=Grammy Awards: Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group|accessdate=July 23, 2010|publisher=Rock on the Net}}</ref> By the end of 1979, the disco industry was estimated to be worth more than $4&nbsp;billion, "more ... than the industries of movies, television or professional sport".<ref name=Inferno>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/disco-inferno-680390.html|title=Disco inferno|date=December 11, 2004|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

However, the disco [[fad]] soon began to decline. On July 12, 1979, just a few months after ''[[Newsweek]]'' had reported on the "[take] over" of disco music, a "tongue-in-cheek" promotional event known as [[Disco Demolition Night]] was held at [[Chicago]]'s [[Comiskey Park]].<ref name="Sarasota">{{cite news|title=Disco night in Chicago a 'turn-on'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GP8cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U44EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5819,1657082&dq|accessdate=October 19, 2010|newspaper=[[Sarasota Journal]]|date=July 13, 1979|location=Sarasota, Florida|page=1C}}</ref> During a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] intermission, [[disc jockey]] [[Steve Dahl]] set ablaze a bin full of disco records, causing a riot within the stadium and gaining international attention.<ref name=Inferno/><ref name=Demolition>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/sports/baseball/05disco.html?_r=1|title=The Night Disco Went Up in Smoke|date=July 4, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=Joe|last=Lapointe}}</ref><ref name="Gettysburg">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nlsyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B-gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4162,1038893&dq|accessdate=October 19, 2010|newspaper=The Gettysburg Times|date=July 13, 1979|location=Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|page=13|title=Fans Have A Blast In Chicago}}</ref> Approximately 10,000 disco records were destroyed, and around 50,000 rioters participated in the event, staying on the field and forcing the [[Chicago White Sox]] to forfeit the second game.<ref name=Boston>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/02/27/burn_baby_burn_disco_inferno_at_the_library/|title=Burn, baby, burn: Disco inferno at the library|first=Stephen|last=Williams|date=February 27, 2005|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> 

Nationally, a "backlash" took hold, as public support for disco music faded.<ref name=Inferno/><ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/quoti-will-survivequot-wins-the-first8212and-last8212grammy-ever-awarded-for-best-disco-recording|title="I Will Survive" wins the first<U+2014>and last<U+2014>Grammy ever awarded for Best Disco Recording|accessdate=July 23, 2010|publisher=[[History (TV channel)|History]]}}</ref> According to author Craig Werner, as quoted in the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the "anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. None the less, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia."<ref name=Inferno/> By 1980 "mainstream disco" had ended, by 1985 WKTU had returned to playing [[rock music]], and by the end of the decade the famous dance venues Studio&nbsp;54, Paradise Garage and Clubhouse had all closed.<ref name=Disco/>

In 1979, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] decided to add a Best Disco Recording category for the [[22nd Grammy Awards]], just as disco was "preparing to die".<ref name=History/> Nominated works for the award included "[[Boogie Wonderland]]" by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], "[[I Will Survive]]" by Gloria Gaynor, "[[Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough]]" by [[Michael Jackson]], "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]" by [[Rod Stewart]], and "[[Bad Girls (song)|Bad Girls]]" by Donna Summer.<ref name=History/><ref name=TheHour>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z540AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Jm4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1238,1635739&dq|title=Grammys Draw a Variety of Nominees|date=January 11, 1980|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]|location=Norwalk, Connecticut}}</ref> On February 27, 1980, during a live telecast from [[Shrine Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]], Gaynor was presented the award for Best Disco Recording.<ref name=TheHour/> Dino Fekaris and [[Freddie Perren]] also received awards as the [[Record producer|producers]] of the track.<ref name=OfNote/><ref name=NARAS>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx|title=Grammy Award Winners|accessdate=July 23, 2010|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}} Note: User must select the "Disco" category as the genre under the search feature.</ref> 

However, because of the decreasing popularity of disco, the Academy eliminated the award category before the 1981 ceremony was to be held.<ref name=History/> According to the organization, disco was "no longer a readily definable separate music form", although its influence had "permeated all types of pop music".<ref name=Anchorage>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TxkfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1667,2987093&dq|title=Streisand, Sinatra head conservative Grammy nomination list|date=January 14, 1981|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|first=Yardena|last=Arar|location=Anchorage, Alaska}}</ref> Despite the award's short span, the award helped solidify Gaynor as one of the best-known female disco artists from the 1970s and the song "I Will Survive" as one of the most recognized and top-selling songs from the genre.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jifrxqe5ldke~T1|title=Gloria Gaynor|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Guide]]}}</ref><ref name=TheAge>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/gloria-gaynor-still-survives/2009/04/15/1239474912961.html|title=Gloria Gaynor still survives|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2010|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|location=Melbourne, Australia}}</ref>
