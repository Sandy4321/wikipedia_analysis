==Plot==
{{See also|List of Cyberchase episodes}}
The show stars three [[Earth]] mathematician children<U+2014>Jackie, Matt and Inez<U+2014>and Digit, a bird-like [[cyborg]]. The series takes place in [[Cyberspace]], the electronic medium of computer networks, in which online communication takes place, with planet-like bodies called "Cybersites", which are based on locations such as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[American Old West]], [[Greek mythology|mythological Greece]], and [[Carnival]]. The guardian of all Cyberspace is Motherboard; her repairman is Dr. Marbles.<ref name="programSummary" /> The three kids and Digit use their math and problem solving skills to stop the evil deeds of the [[List of CyberChase characters#Hacker|Hacker]], a villain who breaks into Motherboard and her networks, and his two cyborg henchmen, Buzz and Delete.

Each Cyberchase episode is followed by "Cyberchase For Real", a live-action educational supplement linking concepts learned in the show to real life experiences.<ref name="programSummary" /> The actors Bianca DeGroat and Harry Matthew A. Wilson are in their thirties, but amusingly act in a manner similar to the age of the target audience. "For Real" is produced by WNET in and around [[New York City]] after production is completed on the animated segments. These "For Real" segments are broadcast exclusively on PBS in the United States where the program runs longer and fill the time gap where there might be breaks for commercials. Some "For Real" segments can also be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyberchase Videos|url=http://pbskids.org/cyberchase/videos/|publisher=Thirteen|accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> As of September 17, 2012, "Oh Noah!", shorts that teach kids to speak Spanish, have replaced the "For Real" segments.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miramar-Garcia|first=Gabriel|title=PBS to broadcast Oh Noah! with Cyberchase for Hispanic Heritage month|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2012091724088/pbs-to-broadcast-oh-noah-with-cyberchase-for-hispanic-heritage-month.html|accessdate=2012-10-14|newspaper=Rapid TV News|date=2012-09-17}}</ref>

===History===
According to the Website, Motherboard (sometimes referred to as "Mother B.") is the "Brain of the giant computer system that oversees all of [[Cyberspace]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/cyberchase/media/games/webisodes-global/how_started.html|title=Cyberchase How it all Started }}</ref> Her technician computer scientist, Dr. Marbles, keeps her functioning properly. Dr. Marbles creates [[Hacker]] as an assistant, but Hacker turns against Motherboard. Digit is the assistant to The Hacker and watches as Hacker steals the Encryptor Chip. He eventually escapes Hacker, after Dr. Marbles banishes Hacker to the Northern Frontier.

==Educational philosophy==
Cyberchase aims to show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it. The series encourages viewers to see, think, and do mathematics in their world. The show and supporting activities have been designed to support math education and reflect the curriculum standards of the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]].<ref name="nctm">{{cite web|url=http://www.nctm.org/ |title=National Council of Teachers of Mathematics |publisher=Nctm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> The show<U+2019>s philosophy is to foster enthusiasm for math, to model mathematic reasoning, to help children improve their problem-solving skills and to inspire all children to approach math with confidence and a "can-do" attitude.<ref name="educationalPhilosophy">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/parents/cyberchase/about-cyberchase/learning-goals |title=Cyberchase Learning Goals |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The series has had a generally positive response.

On the site ''common sense media'', the show was for ages 5 and up and rated 4/5 stars. The reviewer, Joly Herman, commented that "the adventures aren't scary, violent, or sexually inappropriate" but "require fortitude and brain power". Proposed discussion points sprouting from the series include "Can your child take the skills learned in each episode and figure out how to apply it to everyday life?" Herman noted that the only downside was that the adventures did not take place in the "real world" but added that the "For Real" segments solved this problem. The show was given a rating of 3/5 smiley faces under the "The Good Stuff" section.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/cyberchase | title=Cyberchase | accessdate=2011-01-02 | author=Herman, Joly | publisher=common sense media}}</ref>

Carey Bryson of About.com gave the show a rating of 4/5 stars. Bryson noted that the series' explanations of "simple mathematical idea[s]" are "usually explained well and woven throughout the story in a fun and interesting way". The review commended the series for its accessibility: "Children can easily learn from the example in the cartoon story" and praised the "Cyberchase For Real segment that follows each episode". Citing an example from the series using codes, Bryson explained how the show could be used to expand upon the curriculum: "Not only did [her five-year-old] learn about codes, but she also got in a ton of spelling practice". Bryson commended the series: "Educationally, ''Cyberchase'' delivers".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kidstvmovies.about.com/od/cyberchase/fr/Cyberchase.htm | title=Cyberchase - TV Show Review | accessdate=2011-01-02 | author=Bryson, Carey | work=About.com}}</ref>
