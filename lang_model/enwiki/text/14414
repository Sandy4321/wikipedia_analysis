On 6 January 2012, a bomb exploded in the [[Al-Midan]] district of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. According to the Syrian government, a [[suicide bomb]]er attacked buses carrying riot police shortly before an anti-government protest was to begin. It said that 26 people were killed and over 60 were injured.  Most of the victims were civilians, though the Syrian government showed footage of what it claimed to be the funeral of 11 police officers killed in the attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-jan-7-2012-2028|title=Syria Live Blog Sat, 7 Jan 2012, 17:28|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref>

It was the second such bombing since an [[2011<U+2013>2012 Syrian uprising|uprising against the government]] began in early 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/world/middleeast/bomb-attack-in-syrian-capital-kills-25.html|title=Bomb Attack Kills Dozens of People in Syrian Capital|author=Anthoy Shadid|work=The New York Times|date=6 January 2012}}</ref> Two weeks earlier, [[2011 Damascus bombings|a double car bombing]] in Damascus had killed 44 people.

Later, the newly formed [[Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant]] claimed responsibility in a video.

== Background ==
{{expand section|date=January 2012}}
The attack occurred as [[Arab League]] monitors were in the country to see if Syria was abiding by Arab League demands that were said to have sought an end to the violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobileafrik.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9828:syria-tense-as-bomb-victims-mourned&catid=6:foreign-news |title=Syria tense as bomb victims mourned |publisher=Mobileafrik.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> Two weeks earlier, [[2011 Damascus bombings|a double car bombing]] in Damascus had killed 44 people. The government blamed that attack on [[Islamism|Islamist]] militants.

== Bombing ==
Most of the initial information about the attack comes from the Syrian government and [[state media]]. It reported that, at about 10:55,<ref name=sana1>[http://www.sana.sy/eng/337/2012/01/06/392647.htm "Terrorist Bombing in al-Midan Neighborhood in Damascus Causes Tens of Deaths and Injuries, Most Are Civilians"].

The bomb detonated at a traffic light under a concrete [[Overpass|flyover]], shattering windows and destroying several police cars.<ref name=guardian1/> According to Syrian state media, it was estimated that the bomb was 10 kilograms of high explosive.<ref name=sana1/>

Syrian state news agency ''[[Syrian Arab News Agency|SANA]]'' reported that 26 were killed (including 15 who could not be identified) and 63 were hurt.<ref name=sana1/><ref name=nyt1>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/world/middleeast/bomb-attack-in-syrian-capital-kills-25.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 "Bomb Kills Dozens in Damascus, Stoking Suspicions"].

Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said that the bomber "detonated himself with the aim of killing the largest number of people."

=== Aftermath ===
Hundreds of government loyalists later arrived at the scene, some of whom were waving flags and chanting in support of [[President of Syira|Syrian president]] [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref name=guardian1/> According to ''The New York Times'', people living in the neighborhood reported that about an hour after the bombing, security forces and armed loyalists went on "a rampage, shooting randomly and beating and arresting people in the streets".<ref name=nyt1/>

Despite the bombing, anti-government [[Demonstration (people)|protest]]s went ahead in Damascus and elsewhere. The anti-government [[Local coordination committees of Syria|Local Co-ordinating Committees]] said 14 protesters were killed in the suburbs of Damascus later that day.<ref name=bbc1/> It also reported that nine protesters had been killed in [[Hama]], eight were killed in [[Homs]], three were killed in [[Idlib]] and one was killed in [[Deraa]].<ref name=bbc1/> ''SANA'' also reported that an oil pipeline between Hama and Idlib had been blown up by a "terrorist group."<ref name=bbc1/>

== Perpetrators ==
The Interior Minister described the ''[[modus operandi]]'' and "intention to cause mass casualties" as having the "fingerprints of [[al-Qaida]]."<ref name=guardian2/> Syria's interior ministry said the government would "strike back with an iron fist" to what it called "terrorist escalation".<ref name=bbc1/>

Opposition groups accused the government of staging the attack to "sully the opposition<U+2019>s image"<ref name=nyt1/> and validate its own argument that it is "fighting blind violence rather than a pro-democracy movement."<ref name=france24>[http://www.france24.com/en/20120106-powerful-explosion-strikes-central-damascus-midan-syria-sana-assad "Syrian capital rocked by deadly explosion"]. [[France 24]]. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012.</ref> The [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA), the main anti-government paramilitary group, denied involvement and condemned the attack. FSA spokesman Major Maher al-Naimi said: "This is planned and systematic [[state terrorism]] by the security forces of the President Bashar al-Assad".<ref name=france24/> The [[Syrian National Council]] issued a statement reading: "Today's bombings, in the area that has experienced the largest of the anti-regime demonstrations, clearly bear the regime's fingerprints".<ref name=bbc1/> The Syrian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] also blamed the regime.<ref name=nyt1/>

On 7 January, opposition activists accused the government of making fake television footage of the aftermath. The activists pointed to three clips "mistakenly" aired by Syrian state TV. One shows what seems to be an injured man on the ground standing up just before the end of the clip. Another shows a man with a microphone (allegedly a reporter for Syrian state TV) placing "bags of vegetables" in the street to give the impression that some of the victims were civilians shopping in the nearby market. The third video shows a person putting police shields in one of the damaged vans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-jan-7-2012-2113|title=Syria Live Blog Sat, 7 Jan 2012, 18:13|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref>

The same day as the bombing, Syrian opposition leader Ammar Qurabi claimed that the government was planning another bombing in [[Aleppo]] "to terrorize the people". He said he had learned of the plot from Syrian security officials.<ref name=alarabiya1>[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/01/06/186757.html "Syrian opposition figure says Assad<U+2019>s regime plotting a massive blast in Aleppo"]. [[Al Arabiya]]. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012.</ref>

At the end of February a group called the [[Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant]] claimed responsibility for the attack and placed a 45-minute video on the Internet showing its preparation.<ref>[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/29/197781.html "Unknown Islamist group claims suicide attacks in Syria"], [[Al Arabiya News]], 29 February 2012.</ref>
