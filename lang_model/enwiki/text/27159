It was released in the first half of [[1973 in music|1973]] and is the last studio album by the original Mahavishnu Orchestra line-up, before the group dissolved, although ''[[Between Nothingness and Eternity]]'', a live album, was recorded and released later that same year.

As in the case of The Mahavishnu Orchestra's previous album, ''[[The Inner Mounting Flame]]'', ''Birds of Fire'' consists solely of compositions by [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].  This includes the track "Miles Beyond ([[Miles Davis]])", which McLaughlin dedicated to his friend and former bandleader.

The back cover of the LP features a poem entitled "Revelation" by [[Sri Chinmoy]]. A [[remaster]]ed version of the album, on [[CD]], was released in 2000 by [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. It features a facsimile of the LP cover and a new set of [[liner notes]] by [[Bill Milkowski]], as well as photographs of the band.
