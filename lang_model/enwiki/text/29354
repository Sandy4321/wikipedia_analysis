'''Kimberley John Hughes''' (born 26 January 1954) is a former [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er who played for [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]], [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]].

Unfairly, he is remembered more for his poor captaincy record (4 Test wins, 11 draws, 13 losses) and frequent departures by [[Batting_(cricket)#Hook|hooking]] early before building his innings.  He was however one of the most talented batsmen of his generation.  [[Richie Benaud]] said of him in 1980 "I regard him as likely to become one of the all-time great batsmen".<ref>Ryan, p. 179.</ref>

His Australia captaincy record was hindered by a succession of away series (just 7 of his 28 Tests while captain were played in Australia) and an inexperienced team rebuilding itself after the frequent absence and later retirement of several of the senior players in [[Dennis Lillee]], [[Rod Marsh]] and [[Greg Chappell]].  In his captaincy retirement speech, Hughes alluded to his inability to continue in that capacity due to "... constant speculation, criticism and innuendo by former players and sections of the media ...".<ref>Ryan, p. 244.</ref>

==Early life==
Hughes was born on January 1954, at [[Margaret River, Western Australia]], the first child of father Stan, a school teacher and mother Ruth.<ref>Ryan, p. 40.</ref> The Hughes family lived in nearby [[Kudardup, Western Australia|Kudardup]], where Stan was in charge of the one-teacher school. Stan's profession would take the Hughes family across much of the south west of Western Australia including postings at [[Ballidu, Western Australia|Ballidu]], [[Pinjarra, Western Australia|Pinjarra]] and [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]].<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 41.</ref> The Hughes family settled in the Geraldton suburb of [[Wonthella, Western Australia|Wonthella]] and Hughes attended the local Allendale Primary School, where his father was the [[headmaster]].<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 43.</ref>

In Geraldton, the young Hughes played a variety of sports, including [[field hockey|hockey]], [[tennis]] and especially [[Australian rules football]].<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 44.</ref> His boyhood hero was [[Austin Robertson, Jr.]] who played for [[Subiaco Football Club]]; the club that Hughes' father had played for as a young man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/390815.html|title=Best footy forward|work=Cricinfo Magazine|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref> His first organised cricket was as an 11 year old, filling in for the [[Bluff Point, Western Australia|Bluff Point]] Cricket Club under-16 side.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 46.</ref> He was selected for a Geraldton under-16 representative side aged 11, to compete in the junior 'Country Week' tournament in the state capital of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], where his team mates included [[Geoff Gallop]], later [[Premier of Western Australia]]. He was selected again in the Geraldton Country Week team again the following year, where his performances playing against much older boys again to receive some attention from cricket administration.<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 47&ndash;48.</ref>

After Hughes finished primary school, the family moved to Perth. Hughes attended [[City Beach High School]] and played cricket for the Floreat Park (now [[Floreat, Western Australia|Floreat]]) Under-16 side.<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 51, 61.</ref> In his final season at junior level, Hughes scored 555 runs at an average of 46 and took 28 wickets at an average of 6 and was included in the Western Australia [[Colts (sport)|Colts]] squad.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 51.</ref> The next season, aged 15, Hughes made his [[Western Australian Grade Cricket|first grade]] debut for [[Subiaco-Floreat Cricket Club]], captained by former Test player [[Des Hoare]]; Hughes made 36 runs.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 52.</ref> In January 1970, Hughes was selected to play for Western Australia in the national under 19 carnival. His captain, [[Ric Charlesworth]], later described Hughes as "the most gifted junior cricketer I ever saw. No one else comes close."<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 53.</ref> Returning to Perth, Hughes made his first first grade [[century (cricket)|century]] against [[Midland-Guildford Cricket Club|Midland-Guildford]] and finished the season topping the club batting averages.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 54.</ref>

==Cricket career==
===Club cricket and first-class debut===
[[File:WACA north.JPG|thumb|The [[WACA Ground]], the home ground of the Western Australian cricket team and the venue for Hughes' first-class cricket debut.]]
After only nine first grade games, in 1970&ndash;71 Hughes was included in the Western Australian [[Sheffield Shield]] squad. Described at the time by Test [[wicket-keeper]] [[Rod Marsh]] as "a technically perfect batsman", the Perth press speculated he may even make his [[first-class cricket]] debut later that season.<ref name="Ryanp64">Ryan (2009), p. 64.</ref> Instead, Hughes suffered from the "[[Sophomore slump|second-year blues]]" and struggled for runs, averaging only 23 for the season. He was unable to break out of the slump the next two seasons, finding himself out of the state squad.<ref name="Ryanp64" /> In this time he managed to retain selection in the state colts team; in one match against the [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victorian]] colts scoring a dashing 97, before being caught on the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] attempting to make his century from a [[six (cricket)|six]].<ref name="Ryanp67">Ryan (2009), pp. 67&ndash;68.</ref> It would be four years after his maiden first grade century that Hughes would make his second, against [[North Perth Cricket Club|North Perth]].<ref name="Ryanp64" />

In 1973&ndash;74, Hughes was called up to the Western Australian squad. He acted as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] in three successive matches but was unable to break into the playing XI due to the strong Western Australian batting line-up.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 71.</ref> Impatient to play at first-class level, Hughes left for Adelaide mid-season to try his luck at gaining selection for [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], whose batting was not as strong. <ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 71&ndash;72.</ref> He played for [[East Torrens Cricket Club]] and awaited an invitation to play for South Australia; he was not even invited to train with the state squad. His South Australian experiment unsuccessful, Hughes&mdash;disappointed and homesick&mdash;returned to Western Australia.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 75&ndash;76</ref>

Hughes was [[captain (cricket)|captain]]-coach of [[North Perth Cricket Club]] for the 1975&ndash;76 season.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 77.</ref> In November 1975, Hughes finally broke into the Western Australian team, making his first-class debut against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] at the [[WACA Ground]].<ref name="FC debut">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/35/35675.html|title=Western Australia v New South Wales: Sheffield Shield 1975/76|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> In an innings described by New South Wales bowler [[Dave Hourn]] as the "best and most dynamic innings" he had seen in first-class cricket, Hughes continually stepped down the pitch to hit the bowling, even to the pace bowling of [[Len Pascoe]]. He was dismissed for 119, ending a partnership of 205 runs with [[Rob Langer]].<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 78&ndash;79.</ref> He was the fifth Western Australian batsman to make a [[century]] on first-class debut for the state.<ref name="wais">''W.A. Hall of Champions'' inductee booklet. (2006) Published by the [[Western Australian Institute of Sport]]</ref> Later that season, Hughes scored a second century, against [[Clive Lloyd]]'s  touring [[West Indian cricket team|West Indians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/35/35752.html|title=Western Australia v West Indians:  West Indies in Australia 1975/76|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> In his first season for Western Australia, Hughes made 494 runs at an average of 32.93.<ref name="FCBattingBySeason">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1530/f_Batting_by_Season.html|title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Kim Hughes|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref>

In the winter of 1976, Hughes played as a professional for [[Watsonians Cricket Club]], a team based around former students of [[George Watson's College]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Hughes would later call this period "possibly the best six months of my life."<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 91&ndash;93.</ref>

===Test debut===

Against the touring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan team]] in December 1976, Hughes made 137 runs from only 167 balls, placing his name in front of the national [[selector (sport)|selectors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/36/36712.html|title=Western Australia v Pakistanis: Pakistan in Australia 1976/77|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> ''[[The Australian]]'' reported that "[r]arely has a batsman of his limited experience been seen in a more majestic performance".<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 95.</ref> A few weeks later, Hughes was called up as twelfth man for Australia in the New Year's Test match at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG). Substituting on the field for [[Ian Davis (cricketer)|Ian Davis]], he injured his shoulder attempting to catch [[Imran Khan]].<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 93&ndash;94.</ref> Missing the rest of the Pakistan matches, Hughes was included in the Australian team to tour New Zealand. Hughes, again suffering from homesickness, did not play in either of the two Tests.<ref>Ryan, p. 96. Team manager [[Roger Wotton]]: "He was green and homesick" and "He was missing his girlfriend, obviously."</ref>

Four weeks after his marriage, Hughes left for England as a member of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1977|1977 Australian team]].<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 97</ref> The tour was an unhappy one for the Australians, losing the series three Tests to nil to England and the embryonic [[World Series Cricket]] concept caused rifts between the team members.<ref name="Wisden1978">{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152105.html|title=Australia in England, 1977|date=1978|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> Hughes did not play much cricket early in the tour; ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' saying that he was "kept in such idleness that [he] might have claimed [[restraint of trade]]."<ref name="Wisden1978" /> He would finally make his Test debut in the fifth Test, after the series had already been decided. Hughes, bitter about his treatment by the tour selectors, was unhappy. Hughes told a reporter congratulating him about his upcoming Test debut "Those pricks, now they have made me part of their failure".<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 113.</ref> In an uncharacteristic performance, Hughes faced thirty four deliveried before he made his first run. It was the only one he would make that innings, dismissed by [[Mike Hendrick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37507.html|title=England v Australia: Australia in British Isles 1977 (5th Test)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref><ref name="Ryanp113">Ryan (2009), p. 113.</ref> Hughes' teammate [[Geoff Dymock]] would later say, "They threw [Hughes] to the wolves."<ref name="Ryanp113" />

===World Series Cricket years===
World Series Cricket (WSC) divided the Australian team into two camps; those that had signed lucrative contracts with [[Kerry Packer]]'s rebel group and those, like Hughes, who had remained with the establishment [[Australian Cricket Board]] (ACB).<ref>Haigh (2007), p. 57&ndash;59.</ref> Hughes' boyhood idol, Austin Robertson Jr, acted as Packer's agent, signing players to the new cricket venture, eventually signing 13 of the 17 players who toured England; Hughes was a notable omission. Robertson claims that he did not approach Hughes about a WSC contract; Hughes claims that he was approached but indicated his unwillingness.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 102. Robertson said "[Hughes] says I did and I say I didn't."</ref> In September 1977, Hughes made clear his attachment to traditional cricket in a statement. {{quote|It is completely understandable that players approaching retirement or even past players should avail themselves of an opportunity to capitalise on their skills. [...] The necessity for all young players&mdash;and we do have some brilliant ones knocking on the door&mdash;is to dedicate, train long and hard ... That is what I propose to do. That is exactly where I stand.|Kim Hughes|<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 105.</ref>}} 

The first season of the divide saw the ACB bring the 41-year-old [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] out of retirement to captain the Australians against the touring [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1977<U+2013>78|Indians]].<ref>Haigh (2007), pp. 112&ndash;113.</ref> Hughes fell one run short of a century against the tourists for Western Australia but missed out on selection for the first Test at [[the Gabba]] in Brisbane, instead named as twelfth man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37664.html|title=Western Australia v Indians: India in Australia 1977/78|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref><ref>Ryan (2009), p. 127.</ref> Hughes was chosen for the second Test at the [[WACA Ground]] in Perth, where he made 28 in the first innings and a duck in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37685.html|title=Australia v India: India in Australia 1977/78 (2nd Test)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> He was omitted for the third Test in Melbourne but returned for the fourth Test in Sydney. At the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Hughes made 17 and 19, with [[Bishan Singh Bedi|Bishan Bedi]] dismissing him on both occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/37/37752.html|title=Australia v India: India in Australia 1977/78 (4th Test)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> Again, Hughes was left out of the Australian team; at this stage he had not played two Test matches concurrently.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 128.</ref>

Hughes travelled to the Caribbean as a member of the Australian cricket team to play the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1978. During the first match on tour against the [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leeward Islands]] at [[Basseterre]], [[Saint Kitts]], Hughes suffered from [[appendicitis]] and had his appendix removed. The wound became infected and Hughes had to beg team management to be allowed to remain on the tour.<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 131&ndash;132.</ref> Despite his later recovery, he did not play any of the Tests; his personality and attitude to the game did not meet with the approval of the captain, Simpson. A reporter wrote at the time, "Kim Hughes is the most frustrated, disillusioned young man in the West Indies today and with good reason. [...] Never, at any stage, has Simpson considered Hughes a Test prospect."<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 133&ndash;134.</ref>

[[Mike Brearley]] led his [[English cricket team in Australia in 1978<U+2013>79|English team to Australia in 1978&ndash;79]] on the back of his victory over the Greg Chappell-led Australians in 1977.<ref name="Wisden1978-79England">{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153025.html|title=England in Australia, 1978-79|date=1980|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> With Simpson standing down from international cricket, [[Graham Yallop]] was the new Australian captain, leading an inexperienced Australian team, with only [[Gary Cosier]] having played over 10 Tests before the series began; Hughes had only played two Tests.<ref>Yallop, pp. 13&ndash;14.</ref> The Australians were no match for the experienced England team, losing the series and [[the Ashes]] five Tests to one.<ref name="Wisden1978-79England" /> Playing in all six Tests, Hughes scored 345 runs at an average of 28.75; only Yallop scored more runs in what was a poor batting performance by Australia.<ref name="Wisden1978-79England" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/England_in_Australia_1978-79/t_Australia_Batting.html|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: England in Australia 1978/79|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> Hughes' only century came in the first Test at Brisbane. Having been bowled out for 116, in their first innings, Australia had lost three wickets for only 49 runs (49/3) in the second innings when Hughes joined Yallop at the crease. Yallop and Hughes scored 170 runs in partnership before Yallop was dismissed for 102. Hughes continued on and was the last Australian wicket to fall, top-scoring with 129; his maiden Test century. While England won the match by seven wickets, Hughes and Yallop at least made the Australian effort look respectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152180.html|title=First Test Match: Australia vs. England|date=1980|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-14}} "Even if they could not prevent the inevitable, Yallop and Hughes at least brought dignity to Australia's depression"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/38/38681.html|title=Australia v England: England in Australia 1978/79 (1st Test)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref>

===A young captain===
With the Ashes series played and lost, Australia hosted [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] for a two-Test series at the end of the Australian 1978&ndash;79 season. Pakistan won the first Test by 71 runs after [[Sarfraz Nawaz]] took an incredible seven wickets for only one run in the Australian second innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153029.html|title=First Test Match: Australia vs. Pakistan|date=1980|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> Before the second Test, Yallop tore his calf muscle playing for [[Richmond Cricket Club|Richmond]]&mdash;his club side&mdash;and had to withdraw from the Australian team.<ref>Yallop, 139.</ref> Hughes, playing only his eleventh Test, was named as Australian captain; the first Western Australian to lead the national team.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 138.</ref><ref name="1979PakistanSecondTest">{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152196.html|title=Second Test Match: Australia vs Pakistan|date=1980|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref>

Hughes took to the leadership role with enthusiasm, boasting of a "new era".<ref name="Ryanp139">Ryan (2009), pp. 139&ndash;140.</ref> Bowling in the nets before the start of the third day's play, Hughes rolled his ankle and was not able to take his place in the field. While he sat in the dressing room, the Australian team, desperate to end the Pakistan tenth-wicket partnership "[[run out#Running out a batsman "backing up"|Mankaded]]" (run out the batsman at the non-strikers end before bowling the ball) [[Sikander Bakht (cricketer)|Sikander Bakht]].<ref name="1979PakistanSecondTest" /> <ref name="Pakistan1978-79">{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152195.html|title=Pakistan in Australia, 1978-<U+0096>79|date=1980|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> During Australia's second innings, [[Andrew Hilditch]] picked up the ball after a return from a fieldsman and, in an attempt to be helpful, handed it to Sarfraz. Sarfraz [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]]ed for a [[Handled the ball|handling the ball]] dismissal; granted by umpire [[Tony Crafter]].<ref name="1979PakistanSecondTest" /><ref name="Ryanp139"/> While technically within the [[Laws of cricket|laws of the game]] at the time, both these dismissals were generally seen as unsportsmanlike behaviour. Hughes said of his own team's actions, "It was just part of cricket" while condemning the actions of Sarfraz: "It just wasn't cricket".<ref name="Ryanp139" /> In the end, Australia won the second Test and tied the series one Test apiece.

The third Test of the series was played at [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in Leeds. Hughes' Australians had the better of the early part of the match.

Australia was scheduled to tour the West Indies in 1984. The players selected for the tour were presented with official contracts by the Australian Cricket Board.

===Relinquishing the captaincy===
With assistance from Greg Chappell, Hughes wrote his letter of resignation. During the day's play, Hughes confided in his team mates, announcing his decision. [[Allan Border]], his vice-captain, advised him to reconsider; Hughes refused. At the press conference at the end of the day's play, Hughes announced, "I have something to read."<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 241&ndash;243.</ref>{{quote|<!-- Please don't fix the grammar or spelling, it's a quote -->The Australian Cricket Captaincy is something that I've held very dear to me. However playing the game with total enjoyment has always been of the greatest importance.

Press reaction to Hughes' resignation and his emotional state was mixed. Former Australian captain and television broadcaster [[Bill Lawry]] said "The demise of Kim Hughes in Brisbane in a manner equal to be being dragged down like a dingo in the pack and devoured by your own, within and without, was a disgrace."<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 248.</ref> The respected ABC radio broadcaster [[Alan McGilvray]] on the other hand was more blunt: "[Hughes] is a little boy who has not yet grown up."<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 246.</ref> Hughes was widely mocked for his tears, seen as unmanly and un-Australian. [[Barry Humphries]]&mdash;the satirist behind [[Dame Edna Everage]] and [[Sir Les Patterson]]&mdash;wondered if "Kim's [[cricket box]] was on too tight" and claimed that a real Australian in that situation "would simply [[vomiting|chunder]]".<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 254.</ref> In 2002, a British journalist remarked of Hughes' tears as "one inadequate captain getting life so out of proportion as to make a complete clown of himself."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2002/nov/24/cricket.ashes|title=What a carve-up|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|date=24 November 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> It is claimed in the press from time to time that Hughes is now as much remembered for his tears as for his achievements in cricket.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/18/olympics2008.olympicssailing2|title=The crying Games|last=Bull|first=Andy|date=18 August 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-05-27}} "Ever since, memories of Hughes's elegant batting are invariably second to those of him sobbing."</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783354292.html|title=Oh dear, it's a crying game|last=Fuller|first=Mark|date=12 July 2003|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2009-05-27}} "Cricketer Kim Hughes will be remembered as much for his tearful resignation from the Australian captaincy as for his brilliance as a batsman."</ref>

Hughes retained his place in the Australian team for the third Test in Adelaide under new captain, Allan Border. Hughes failed in both innings, scoring a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first innings and only two runs in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45400.html|title=Australia v West Indies: West Indies in Australia 1984/85 (3rd Test)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Hughes joined the Australian team in Melbourne for the fourth Test. Despite warm support from the MCG crowd, Hughes made a humiliating [[pair (cricket)|pair]]; in his last innings he was out from the first ball he faced&mdash;a [[golden duck]]. He would never play in a Test match again.<ref>Ryan (2009) p. 257&ndash;258.</ref> He played in some of the remaining [[One Day International]]s but without success. When the Australian team was chosen for [[Australian cricket team in England in 1985|the tour of England in 1985]], Hughes was not included.<ref>Ryan, p. 259&ndash;260.</ref>

===Rebel===
While the Australian team for England was being selected, the [[South African Cricket Union]] (SACU) was arranging a "rebel" Australian team to [[South African rebel tours#Australian tours 1985<U+2013>86 & 1986<U+2013>87|tour South Africa]]. As a result of the [[apartheid]] policy of the white minority government, South Africa was cast out of the [[International Cricket Council]] and was [[Sporting boycott of South Africa#Cricket|subject to a boycott]].<ref>Harte and Hadfield (1985), pp. 13&ndash;15.</ref> With his old adversaries Greg Chappell as a national selector and Rod Marsh appointed as a selector of the Western Australian team, Hughes felt that his options in Australian cricket was limited and he chose to join the rebel team as the captain.<ref>Ryan (2009), pp. 267&ndash;268.</ref> Hughes was one of the last players to join the rebel team; indeed he was to find out that many of the rebel squad had signed up with the South Africans during the 1983 World Cup, when he was confirmed as captain.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 266.</ref> At a press conference after the announcement of the team, Hughes announced: {{quote|I am going to South Africa with an open, and I hope, intelligent mind. I believe I have the ability to judge right and wrong. I also believe I will be able to comment and suggest ways the situation can be improved. [...] When I stand up in front of schoolchildren and business groups I [will be] in a better position to let the people at home know how the rest of the world lives.|Kim Hughes|<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 265.</ref>}} Hughes was heavily criticised for his decision. [[Desmond Tutu]] called him a hypocrite and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] called him a comforter of racists.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 271.</ref> The criticism was hurtful to Hughes who, seemingly puzzled, remarked to friends "People think I'm a racist."<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 272.</ref>

Following the rebel tour, Hughes returned to Western Australia to play first-class cricket but struggled, and returned to South Africa to play for [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. However, his time ended in acrimony there as well, and after two seasons with Natal he retired from first-class cricket.

Since retirement Hughes has been chairman of selectors for the [[Western Australian Cricket Association]] from 1999 to 2000 and more recently an occasional cricket commentator on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio.<ref>Ryan, pp. 281&ndash;282.</ref>   A dining room at the WACA Ground is named the Kim Hughes Room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waca.com.au/news/detail.asp?offset=125&ID=354|title=Player's Dining Room Named in Honour of Kim Hughes|date=2005-12-20|publisher=[[Western Australian Cricket Association]]|accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>

==Incidents==
In the first Test in Melbourne against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] in 1981-82, he faced the fearsome fast-bowling quartet of [[Michael Holding]], [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]], [[Joel Garner]] and [[Colin Croft]]. Hughes' brave 100[[Not out|*]] out of a total of only 198<ref>[http://aus.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1980S/1981-82/WI_IN_AUS/WI_AUS_T1_26-30DEC1981.html Frank Worrell Trophy, 1981/82, 1st Test]</ref><ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/264366.html Cricinfo - Kim's game of his life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> enabled Australia to win a low-scoring match and take a 1-0 lead in the series. The [[Wisden 100]] ranking of the ''Top 10 Test Innings of all time'' ranked that innings as number nine. 

Hughes is the only cricketer to have hit a six on all five days of a Test match, a feat he achieved in the 1980 [[Centenary Test]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/267538.html|work=Cricinfo|title=Batted on all five days, and 268 in a one-day game|author=Lynch, Steven|date=13 November 2006|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>  On day five of the same match, Hughes hit a six onto the Lord's pavilion roof off the bowling of [[Chris Old]], one of only a handful of players to have done so.<ref>Ryan (2009), p. 176.</ref>
