'''St Gabriel's Church''' is a [[Church of England]] [[parish church]] in [[Walsall]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]].  Its parish includes Fullbrook, [[Bescot]], [[The Delves]], [[Palfrey, West Midlands|Palfrey]], and Tamebridge and Yew Tree.

== History ==

During the development of the area in the 1920s, Fr John Laing, Vicar of Caldmore, reserved a plot of land on Walstead Road for the building of a church, and left a substantial endowment in his will to enable this to happen. Until this time the area was served by the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, which stood on Delves Green.

Construction of St Gabriel<U+2019>s Church began in 1938 and was completed in 1939, being consecrated by Right Reverend Edward Woods, Bishop of Lichfield, on 4 February 1939.<ref>http://www.fifparish.com/stgabrielwalsall</ref> 

A mission church and hall, dedicated to the Annunciation, was built within the parish on the new Yew Tree estate.
