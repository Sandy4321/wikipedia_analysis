The '''Battle of Arras''' was an offensive during [[World War I]] by forces of the [[British Empire]] between [[9 April]] and [[16 May]], [[1917]]. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], and [[Australia]]n troops attacked [[Germany|German]] [[trench warfare|trenches]] near the French city of [[Arras]]. It was planned in conjunction with the French High Command, who were planning a massive attack (the ''[[Nivelle Offensive]]'') about eighty kilometres to the south, with the aim of ending the war in forty-eight hours. At Arras, the British Empire's immediate objectives were more modest: (i) to draw German troops away from the ground chosen for the French attack and (ii) to take the German-held high ground that dominated the plain of Douai. They were successful in both these aims.

The first phase of Arras resulted in important strategic gains for the Allied forces right along the front. The most dramatic of these were the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]]; the taking of the ridges at Monchy and Croisailles; and advances made by [[British Empire|British]] troops east of Arras. There then followed a brief hiatus, during which British and Dominion forces re-organised their lines of communication and the German re-organised and reinforced their defences.

The second phase, sometimes referred to as the ''attrition phase'', started in mid-April. It was largely impelled by the need to continue applying pressure on the Germans as the Nivelle Offensive had failed to live up to expectations. It was characterised by small, localised actions, to consolidate the gains of the first phase and protect the flanks of the newly created [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]. Although mostly successful, the later assaults resulted in high casualties for very little territorial gain.

When the battle officially ended on [[16 May]], British Empire troops had made significant advances, but had been unable to achieve a major breakthrough at any point. New tactics had been battle-tested, particularly in the first phase, and had demonstrated that set-piece assaults against heavily fortified positions could be successful. This sector then reverted to the [[stalemate]] that characterised most of the war on the Western Front.

==Background==
Although the French and British had intended an assault for the spring of 1917, two developments put the plan in jeopardy. Firstly, in February, [[Russia]] declined to commit to a joint offensive, meaning that the planned two-front offensive would be reduced to a French-only assault along the River [[Aisne]]. Secondly, the German Army began to retreat and consolidate positions along the [[Hindenburg Line|Hindenburg line]], thus disrupting the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive.<ref name="strachan a">Strachan, 243-244</ref> In fact, until French troops advanced to compensate, there were no German troops at all in the planned assault sector. Given these factors, there was initially disagreement about whether or not the offensive should go forward. Political turmoil in France meant that the existing government desperately needed a victory to avoid major civil unrest at home, but the British were wary of proceding in view of the rapidly changing tactical situation.<ref name="strachan a"/> However, in a meeting with [[David Lloyd George]], French commanding general [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]] was able to convince the British Prime Minister that, with a diversionary assault by the British, which would draw German troops away from the assault sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed that the French assault on the Aisne would go forward in mid-April, and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior.<ref name="strachan a"/> 

===The opposing armies===

Three Allied armies were already concentrated in the Arras sector. They were deployed, roughly north to south, as follows: the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] under Horne, [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] under [[Hubert Gough|Gough]]. The overall British commander was [[Field-Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]]. The battle plan was devised by General Allenby. Although Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the plan's "great initial success" <ref name = "Sheffield & Bourne">Sheffield & Bourne, 496</ref>, Allenby's "subordinates objected to the way he handled the ... attritional stage" and he was moved sideways to Palestine (where he redeemed his reputation as a first-class general). <ref name = "Sheffield & Bourne"/>

Facing them were two German armies: the [[Sixth Army (Germany)|Sixth Army]] under 73-year-old [[Ludwig von Falkenhausen|General von Falkenhausen]] and the [[Second Army (Germany)|Second Army]] under General [[Georg von der Marwitz|von der Marwitz]] (who was recovering from an illness he had contracted on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]). The armies had been organised into three groups - ''Gruppe Souchez'', ''Gruppe Vimy'', and ''Gruppe Arras'' - deployed in that order north to south.<ref>Nicholls, 39</ref> However, only seven German Divisions were in the line; their remaining divisions were in reserve, to reinforce or counter-attack as required. 

General von Falkenhausen reported directly to General [[Erich Ludendorff]], operational chief of the German High Command ( the ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'', or ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung|OHL]]''). Ludendorff's staff contained several highly innovative and extremely capable officers <ref name = "Lupfer">Lupfer, Chap. 1</ref>, notably Major Georg Wetzell, Colonel Max Bauer, and Captain Hermann Geyer.<ref name = "Lupfer"/> Since December 1916, Ludendorff's staff had been developing counter-tactics to the new Allied Powers tactics used at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Although these battles had been extremely costly for the Allied Powers, they had also seriously weakened the German army. Instructions to put the German counter-tactics (the ''Elastic Defence'') in place had been issued in early 1917. Failure by Falkenhausen to implement these instructions would prove disastrous. <ref name = "Lupfer"/>

==Preliminary phase==

The British plan was well developed, drawing on the lessons of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] of the previous year. Rather than attacking on an extended front, the full weight of artillery would be concentrated on a relatively narrow front of twenty-four miles. The barrage was planned for about a week right along the line, with a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy to take care of more elaborate defences.<ref name ="Nicholls 30">Nicholls, 30-32</ref> During the assault, the troops would advance in waves, with units leapfrogging each other to allow time to consolidate and regroup. But before this, a great deal of preparation was required, much of it innovative in nature.

===The war underground===
Since October 1916, the [[Royal Engineers]] had been working underground.<ref name = "Nicholls 30"/> The Arras region was chalk and easily excavated. Under Arras itself is a vast network (called the ''boves'') of caverns, underground quarries, galleries and sewage tunnels, dating from the Middle Ages. The engineers devised a plan to add newly-constructed tunnels to this network so troops could get up to the battlefield underground, in secrecy and in safety.<ref name = "Nicholls 30"/> The scale of this undertaking was enormous: in one sector, alone, four Tunnel Companies (of 500 men each) worked around the clock in 18-hour shifts for two months. Eventually, they constructed ten kilometres of tunnels, graded as ''subways'' (foot traffic only); ''tramways'' (with rails for pulling hand-drawn) and ''railways'' (light railway lines), with electric lighting provided by its own small powerhouse. <ref name = "Nicholls 30"/> The bulk of the work was done by New Zealanders and [[Bantam (military)|Bantams]] from the mining towns of Northern England. <ref name = "Nicholls 30"/>

As an additional refinement, some of the tunnels stopped short of the German line, with the last few metres ready to blow open by explosives on Zero-Day.<ref name = "Nicholls 30"/> In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine them. <ref name = "Nicholls 30"/> It must have been quite lively.

===Battle in the air===
Dominance of the air over Arras was essential for artillery spotting and for aerial photography of trench systems<ref name = "Nicholls 36">Nicholls, 36</ref>, both of which were coordinated by the 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers. <ref name = "DSA">[http://www.defencesurveyors.org.uk/News/DSA%20History.pdf History of the Defence Surveyors Assocation]</ref> The arrival of the ''Red Baron'', [[Manfred von Richtofen]], and his ''Flying Circus'' led to April 1917 being known as [[Bloody April]]. The average flying life of a [[Royal Flying Corps]] pilot in Arras in April was 18 hours. <ref name ="Nicholls 36"/> Between [[4 April]]-[[8 April]], the [[Royal Flying Corps]] lost 75 aircraft in combat, with the loss of 105 aircrew. <ref name ="Nicholls 36"/> During same period, 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots. <ref name ="Nicholls 36"/>

===Creeping barrage===
To keep enemy action to a minimum during the assault, a "creeping barrage" was planned. Here, gunners lay a mixture of high explosive and shrapnel shells down about one hundred metres in advance of the assaulting troops as they cross no mans land. This had been tried before at the battles of [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]] and the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]]. A creeping barrage presents two technical difficulties. The first is synchronising the movement of the troops to the passage of the barrage: this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling short as the barrels of heavy guns degrade swiftly but at differing rates during fire: the remedy was calculate the rate of degradation of each gun and calibrate it accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, on the day, the creeping barrage kept the Germans in their trenches, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. Additionally, new instaneous fuses had been developed for high explosive shells so that they detonated on impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final 30-minutes of the barrage.

===Counter-battery fire===
The principal danger to assaulting troops came from enemy artillery fire as they crossed the open. This had accounted for over half the casualties at the first day of the Somme. A further complication was the location of German artillery, tucked away behind the ridges. In response, specialist artillery units were created specifically to attack German artillery. Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers <ref name ="Sheffield 2002">Sheffield, 194</ref> who collated data obtained from "flash spotting" and "sound ranging". (Flash spotting involved observers operating in balloons and aircraft recording the location of telltale flashes made by guns whilst firing. <ref name = "DSA"/> Sound ranging used a matrix of microphones to triangulate the location of a gun from the sound it made during firing.<ref name="DSA"/>) On Zero-Day, ([[9 April]]), over 80% of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised (that is, "unable to bring effective fire to bear, the crews being disabled or driven off") by counter-battery fire.<ref name ="Sheffield 2002"/> 

==First phase ==
[[Image:Battle of Arras, April 1917.PNG|right|thumb|250px|Map of the British attack.]]
The preliminary bombardment of Vimy Ridge started on [[20 March]]; and the bombardment of the rest of the sector on [[4 April]].<ref name ="Nicholls 30"/> Limited to a front of only 24 miles, the bombardment used almost 2.7 million shells, over a million more than had been used on the Somme.<ref name="strachan a"/> For the last ten hours of bombardment, [[Poison gas in World War I|gas shells]] were used.<ref name="oldham e">Oldham, 50-52</ref>

Zero-Hour had originally been planned for the morning of [[8 April]] (Easter Sunday), but it was pushed back 24 hours at the request of the French, despite relatively good weather in the assault sector. By the morning of [[9 April]], it was snowing heavily; troop movement was hindered by large drifts and visibility on the battlefield was incredibly poor.<ref name="oldham e"/> Nonetheless, the offensive began at 05:30.

===First Battle of the Scarpe===

The major British assault of the first day was directly east of Arras, with the [[12th (Eastern) Division (United Kingdom)|12th Division]] attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras<U+2014>Cambrai road.<ref name="oldham e"/> After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, as well as the second and third lines of German trenches. At the same time, elements of [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]] began an assault south of the road, with primary objectives of Devil's Wood, [[Tilloy l<U+00E9>s Mofflains]], and the Bois des Boeufs.<ref name="oldham a">Oldham, 53.</ref> The ultimate objective of these assaults was the ''Monchyriegel'', a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy, and an important component of the German defences.<ref name="oldham a"/> Most of the objectives, including Feuchy village, had been gained by the evening of 10 April. However, the Germans were still in control of large sections of trench in between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly in the area of the heavily fortified village of [[Neuville-Vitasse]].<ref name="oldham a"/> The following day, troops from the [[56th (1/1st London) Division|56th Division]] were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the ''Monchyriegel'' was not fully in British hands until a few days later.<ref name="oldham a"/> The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards [[Monchy le Preux]], although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village.<ref>Oldham, 56.</ref>

One reason for the success of the offensive in this sector was the failure of German commander von Falkenhausen to employ [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]]'s new innovation, the ''Elastic Defence''. In theory, the enemy was allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counterattack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, however, von Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front, and they were unable to arrive in time for a useful counterattack on either 10 or 11 April.<ref name="Keegan NY">Keegan (New York), 325-6</ref> When it became apparent that a major factor in the British success was command failures within his own army, Ludendorff removed several staff officers, including General von Falkenhausen.<ref name="oldham c"/>

===Battle of Vimy Ridge===

{{details|Battle of Vimy Ridge}}
[[Image:Canadians vimy ridge.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Canadian machine gun squad at Vimy Ridge]]
At roughly the same time, in perhaps the most carefully crafted portion of the entire offensive, the Canadian Corps launched an assault on Vimy Ridge. Advancing behind a creeping barrage, and making heavy use of machine guns <U+2013> eighty to each brigade, including one [[Lewis Gun|Lewis gun]] in each platoon <U+2013> the corps was able to advance through about 4,000 yards of German defences, and captured the crest of the ridge at about 13:00.<ref name="strachan c">Strachan, 244-246</ref> Many military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander [[Arthur Currie]] and constant training, as well as the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon.<ref name="strachan c"/> Rather than a general attempt to capture the ridge, each unit had individual objectives to achieve, and had rehearsed them extensively. This allowed small units to continue to advance even if officers were killed or communication broke down, thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front.<ref name="strachan c"/>

===First Battle of Bullecourt===

South of Arras, the plan called for two divisions, the [[British 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division|British 62nd Division]] and [[4th Division (Australia)|Australian 4th Division]] to attack either side of the village of [[Bullecourt]] and push the Germans out of their fortified positions and into the reserve trenches.<ref name="oldham b">Oldham, 66.</ref> The attack was initially scheduled for the morning of [[10 May]], but the tanks intended for the assault did not arrive due to the weather, and it was delayed by 24 hours. Unfortunately, the order to delay did not reach all units in time, and two battalions of the [[West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Own)|West Yorkshire Regiment]] attacked, and were driven back with significant losses.<ref name="oldham b"/> Despite protests from the Australian commanders, the attack was resumed on the morning of [[11 April]]; mechanical failures meant that only 11 tanks were able to advance in support, and the limited artilery barrage left much of the [[barbed wire]] in front of the German trenches uncut. Additionally, the abortive attack of the previous day alerted German troops in the area to the impending assault, and they were better prepared than they had been in the Canadian sector.<ref name="liddell hart">Liddell Hart</ref> Misleading reports about the extent of the gains made by the Australians deprived them of necessary artillery support and, although elements of the 4th Division briefly occupied sections of German trenches, they were ultimately forced to retreat with heavy losses.<ref name="liddell hart"/> In this sector, the German commanders correctly employed the ''Elastic Defence'', and were able to counterattack effectively.<ref name="oldham c"/>

===German reaction===

On [[12 April]], the military critic of the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' <ref name = "Times 13 Apr"> Quoted in ''The Times'', [[13 April]], 1917, page 6</ref>, a Berlin daily newspaper, wrote: "We have to count on reverses like that near Arras. Such events are a kind of tactical reverse,. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects ie breaking through on the part of the aggressor, then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel."  The same day, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]''<ref name = "Times 13 Apr"/> (a Frankfurt daily) commented "if the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war".

==Second phase ==

{{cquote|"The great value of our recent advance here lies in the fact that we have everywhere driven the enemy from high ground and robbed him of observation. [H]aving secured these high seats [Vimy, Monchy and Croisailles] and enthroned ourselves, it is not necessarily easy to continue the rapid advance. An attack down the forward slope of high ground, exposed to the fire of lesser slopes beyond, is often extremely difficult and now on the general front <U+2026>there must intervene a laborious period, with which we were familiar at the Somme, of systemic hammering and storming of individual positions, no one of which can be attacked until some covering one has been captured". '''The Times'''<ref>''The Times'', [[20 April]] 1917, "Winning of the High Ground", p 6</ref>}}

Although the First Phase had seen significant Allied Powers gains right along the battlefield, it failed to provide the opportunity to break through into open country at any point. Meanwhile, General Ludendorff had become increasingly frustrated at Falkenhausen's inability to contain the Allied assault. Ludendorff sent reinforcements to the Arras sector<ref name="strachan c"/> and instructed Third Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Fritz von Lossberg, to assume operational control of the line.<ref name = "Lupfer"/> ("Von Lossberg was later [to become] legendary as the fireman of the Western Front, always sent by OHL to the area of crisis".<ref name = "Lupfer"/>) 

The Second Phase saw the Allied Powers continuing to press the attack east of Arras. This was partly to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive<ref name="Keegan NY"/>; partly to keep the initiative<ref name = "Lupfer"/>; and partly because - in concert with the imminent French attack at Aisne - they still held out hope of breaking through.<ref name = "Lupfer"/>) When, from [[16 April]] onwards, it became apparent that the Nivelle Offensive was not going as planned, the pressure on Field-Marshal Haig mounted even more to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector.

===Second Battle of the Scarpe===

On [[23 April]], the British launched an assault east from Wancourt towards [[Vis en Artois]]. Elements of the [[30th Division (United Kingdom)|30th]] and [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th]] Divisions made initial gains, and were in fact able to secure the village of [[Gu<U+00E9>mappe]], but could advance no farther east and suffered heavy losses.<ref>Oldham, 60-61.</ref> Farther north, German forces counterattacked in an attempt to recapture [[Monchy le Preux]], but troops from the [[The Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Royal Newfoundland Regiment]] were able to hold the village until reinforcements from 29th Division arrived.<ref>Oldham, 62.</ref> British commanders determined not to push forward in the face of stiff resistance, and the attack was called off the following day, [[24 April]].

===Battle of Arleux===

Although the Canadian Corps had been able to capture Vimy Ridge, the difficulty encountered in making advances to the south left the position vulnerable. On [[28 April]], British and Canadian troops launched an attack towards [[Arleux]] in order to secure the south-eastern flank of the Canadian position.<ref name="worcester">[http://www.worcestershireregiment.com/wr.php?main=inc/bat_14 Online history of the Worcestershire Regiment].</ref> Arleux was captured by Canadian troops with relative ease, but the British troops advancing on [[Gavrelle]] met stiffer resistance. The village was secured by early evening, when a German counterattack forced a brief retreat. Elements of [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division|63rd Division]] were brought up as reinforcements and the village was held, although subsequent attacks on [[29 April]] failed to net any more advances.<ref name="worcester"/> Despite achieving the limited objective of securing the Canadian position on Vimy Ridge, casualties were high, and the ultimate result was disappointing.<ref name="oldham c">Oldham, 38-40</ref>

===Second Battle of Bullecourt===
[[Image:Hindenberg line bullecourt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Hindenburg Line]] near [[Bullecourt]], seen from the air.]]
After the initial assault failed to penetrate the German lines around Bullecourt, British commanders made preparations for another attempt. British artillery began an intense bombardment of the village, which was virtually destroyed by [[20 April]].<ref name="oldham d">Oldham, 69.</ref> Although this attack was initially planned for 20 April, it was pushed back a number of times, and finally set for the early morning of [[3 May]].<ref name="oldham d"/> At 03:45, elements of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] attacked east of Bullecourt village, intending to pierce the [[Hindenburg Line]] and capture [[Hendecourt]], while British troops from [[British 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division|62nd Division]] attempted to capture Bullecourt itself.<ref>Oldham, 60-70.</ref> German resistance was fierce, and when the offensive was called off on [[17 May]], very few of the initial objectives had been met. The Australians were in possession of much of the German trench between Bullecourt and [[Riencourt]], but had been unable to capture Hendecourt. To the west, British troops were ultimately able to push the Germans out of Bullecourt, but, in doing so, incurred considerable losses, and also failed to advance north-east to Hendecourt.<ref>Oldham, 71.</ref>

===Third Battle of the Scarpe===

After securing the area around Arleux at the end of April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try and breakthrough the ''Boiry Riegel'' and reach the ''Wotanstellung'', a major German defensive fortification.<ref name="oldham c"/> This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt, in order to present the Germans with a two pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on [[3 May]]. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances, and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties.<ref name="oldham c"/> Although this attack was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the relationship between tanks, infantry, and artillery, which they would later apply in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]].<ref name="oldham c"/>

==Aftermath==

[[Image:Battle of Arras 1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An article commemorating the battle; from a South African newspaper.]]
By the standards of the Western front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties, and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Twenty-five [[Victoria Cross]]es were subsequently awarded [[VCs of the First World War - Arras & Vimy Ridge (1917)|(see list)]].

Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector.<ref name="strachan c"/> In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies, but one or two counterpoints should be noted. Firstly, after the initial gains and light casualties of the initial assault, the offensive ground to a halt and casualty rates soared. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day.<ref name ="Keegan NY"/> Furthermore, despite the number of German troops transferred to the Arras sector, the French [[Nivelle Offensive]] to the southeast did not bring the war to an end as promised. And, finally, despite significant early gains, the British were unable to effect a breakthrough, and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation.<ref name= "Keegan NY"/> <ref name="strachan c"/>

===Casualties===
The most quoted Allied casualty figures are those in the returns made by Lt-Gen Sir George Fowke, Haig's adjutant-general. His figures collate the daily casualty tallies kept by each unit under Haig's command. <ref>Preserved at the British [[Public Records Office]] </ref> Third Army casualties were 87,226; First Army 46,826 (including 11,004 Canadians at Vimy Ridge); and Fifth Army 24,608; totalling 158,660.<ref name="Nicholls 210">Nicholls, 210-211</ref>  
German losses by contrast are more difficult to determine. ''Gruppe Vimy'' and ''Gruppe Souchez'' suffered 79,418 casualties but the figures for ''Gruppe Arras'' are incomplete. Additionally, German records excluded those "lightly wounded".<ref name = "Nicholls Falls"/> Captain Cyril Falls (the British official battle historian) estimated that 30% needed to be added to German returns for comparison with the British". <ref name = "Nicholls Falls">Falls, cited by Nicholls, 211</ref> Falls makes "a general estimate" that German casualties were "probably fairly equal". <ref name = "Nicholls Falls"/> Nicholls puts them at 120,000.<ref name = "Nicholls 210"/>; and Keegan at 130,000<ref>Keegan (London), 352</ref>.
