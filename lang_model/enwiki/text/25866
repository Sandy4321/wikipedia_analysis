The '''Zoo TV Tour''' (also written as '''ZooTV''', '''ZOO TV''' or '''ZOOTV''') was a worldwide [[concert tour]] by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. Staged in support of the album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 1992 through 1993. To mirror the new musical direction that the group took with ''Achtung Baby'', the tour was intended to deviate from their past and confound expectations of the band. In contrast to U2's austere stage setups from previous tours, the Zoo TV Tour was an elaborately-staged multimedia event. It satirised television and media oversaturation by attempting to instill "[[sensory overload]]" in its audience. To escape their reputation for being overly serious, U2 embraced a more lighthearted and self-deprecating image on tour. Zoo TV and ''Achtung Baby'' were central to the group's 1990s reinvention.

The tour's concept was inspired by disparate television programming, the desensitising effect of mass media, and "[[morning zoo]]" radio shows. The stage featured dozens of large video screens that showed visual effects, video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases. Live satellite link-ups, [[channel surfing]], [[prank call]]s, and video confessionals were incorporated into the shows. Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and facetious; on stage, Bono performed in-character as several personae he conceived, including "The Fly", "Mirror Ball Man", and "MacPhisto". In contrast to other U2 tours, each of the Zoo TV shows opened with six to eight consecutive new songs before older material was played.

Comprising five legs and 157 shows, the tour began in [[Lakeland, Florida]] on 29&nbsp;February 1992 and finished in [[Tokyo, Japan]] on 10&nbsp;December 1993. The first four legs alternated between North America and Europe, before the final leg visited Australasia and Japan. After two arena legs, the show's production was expanded for stadiums for the final three legs, which were branded "Outside Broadcast", "Zooropa", and "Zoomerang/New Zooland". Although the tour provoked a range of reactions from music critics, it was generally well-received. Along with being the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, Zoo TV sold around 5.3&nbsp;million tickets over its five legs. The band's 1993 album ''[[Zooropa]]'', which expanded on Zoo TV's mass media themes, was recorded during a break in the tour, and its songs were played in 1993. The tour was depicted in the [[Grammy Award]]<U+2013>winning 1994 concert film ''[[Zoo TV: Live from Sydney]]''. Zoo TV is regarded as one of the most memorable tours in rock history<U+2014>in 2002, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''{{'}}s Tom Doyle called it "the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band".<ref name="Q-int"/>

==Conception==
{{Quote box|quote="... I sort of took the overview position of saying, 'What do you want? You don't want a stage show where everything fits neatly into place and it's all nicely organized and people know exactly where the center of attention is at all moments.' That isn't what the music is about now, and it certainly isn't what this concept of a new Europe is about, so how can we make a stage show that has some of the feeling of defensiveness and chaos and [[information overload]]...?"|source=<U+2014>[[Brian Eno]], on asking U2 about their plans for concerts<ref name="milkit" />|width=27%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

The first ideas for Zoo TV emerged during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, when various aspects of radio programming intrigued U2, particularly the large radio audience their Dublin concerts acquired.<ref name="usa030692"/> The wild antics of "[[morning zoo]]" radio programmes inspired the band with the idea of potentially taking a [[pirate radio]] station on tour.<ref name="m234">McCormick (2006), pp. 234<U+2013>235</ref> They were also interested in using video as a way of making themselves less accessible to their audiences.<ref name="zootv-talent">{{cite journal|title=Zoo TV Station Talent|journal=Propaganda|date=1992-06|issue=16}}</ref> The band developed these ideas in late 1990 while recording ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' in Berlin at [[Hansa Studios]]. They watched television coverage of the [[Gulf War]] on [[Sky News]], which was the only English programming available. When tired of hearing about the conflict, they tuned into local programming to see "bad German soap operas" and automobile advertisements.<ref name="m234" /> The band believed that cable television had blurred the lines between news, entertainment, and [[home shopping]] over the previous decade, and they wanted to represent this on their next tour.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 13</ref>

The juxtaposition of such disparate programming inspired U2 and ''Achtung Baby'' co-[[record producer|producer]] [[Brian Eno]] to conceive an "audio-visual show" that would display a rapidly-changing mix of live and pre-recorded video on monitors.<ref name="milkit">DeRogatis (2003), pp. 194<U+2013>195</ref><ref name="m234" /> The idea was intended to mock the desensitising effect of mass media.<ref name="ach-stations" /> Eno is credited in the tour programme for the "Video Staging Concept",<ref name="tv-station">{{cite journal|title=Tuning Into Zoo TV Station|journal=Propaganda|date=1992-06|issue=16}}</ref> and he clarified, "the idea to make a stage set with a lot of different video sources was mine, to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... The idea of getting away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material."<ref name="eno-prop">{{cite journal|title=Eno|journal=Propaganda|date=1992-06|issue=16}}</ref>

[[File:U2 Trabant @ Hard Rock Cafe Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Trabant from the tour's lighting system now resides in a [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Berlin.|alt=A car with bright coloured squares painted on the exterior is tilted slightly to its left side at the bottom of a spiral staircase.]]
While on a break from recording, the band invited production designer [[Willie Williams (set designer)|Willie Williams]] to join them in [[Tenerife]] in February 1991. Williams had recently worked on [[David Bowie]]'s [[Sound+Vision Tour]], which used film projection and video content, and he was keen to "take rock show video to a level as yet undreamed of".<ref>McGee (2008), p. 135</ref> The band played Williams some of their new music<U+2014>inspired by [[alternative rock]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[electronic dance music]]<U+2014>and they told him about the "Zoo TV" phrase that Bono liked.<ref name="zootv-talent" /> Williams also learned about the band's affection for the [[Trabant]], a German automobile that derisively became a symbol for the [[fall of Communism]]. Williams thought their fondness for the car was "deeply, deeply bizarre",<ref name="zootv-talent" /> but nonetheless, he incorporated it into his ideas for the tour. In May, he brainstormed the idea to construct a lighting system using Trabants by hanging them from the ceiling and hollowing them to carry spotlights.<ref name="1000days">{{cite journal|title=1,000 Days of Zoo TV, Part One|journal=Propaganda|date=1994-05|issue=19}}</ref>

On 14&nbsp;June 1991, the first tour production meeting was held, with Williams, the band, [[band manager|manager]] [[Paul McGuinness]], artist Catherine Owens, and production managers Steve Iredale and Jake Kennedy in attendance. Williams presented his ideas, which included the Trabant lighting system and the placement of video monitors all over the stage; both notions were well-received.<ref name="zootv-talent" /><ref name="1000days" /> Eno's original idea was to have the video screens on wheels and constantly in motion, although this was impractical.<ref name="eno-prop" />  Williams and the group proposed many ideas that did not make it to the final stage design. One such idea, dubbed "Motorway Madness", would have placed billboards advertising real products across the stage, similar to their placement beside highways.<ref name="flan32" /> The idea was intended to be ironic, but was ultimately scrapped out of fear of being accused of [[selling out]].<ref name="flan32" /> Another proposed idea involved building a giant doll of an "achtung baby", complete with an inflatable penis that would spray on the audience, but it was deemed too expensive and was abandoned.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 36</ref>

By August, a prototype of a single Trabant for the lighting system was completed, with the innards gutted and retrofitted with lighting equipment, and a paint job on the exterior.<ref name="1000days" /> Williams spent most of the second half of 1991 designing the stage.<ref name="tv-station" /><ref name="1000days" /> Owens was insistent that her ideas be given priority, as she thought that men had been making all of U2's creative decisions and were using male-centred designs.<ref name="flan32" /> With bassist [[Adam Clayton]]'s support, she recruited visual artists from Europe and the United States to arrange images for use on the display screens. These people included video artist [[Mark Pellington]], photo/conceptual artist [[David Wojnarowicz]], and satirical group [[Emergency Broadcast Network]], who digitally manipulate sampled image and sound.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 34</ref> Pellington envisaged a collection of text phrases into the visual displays, inspired by his working with artist [[Jenny Holzer]].<ref name="spin">{{cite journal|title=Even Bigger Than the Real Thing|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|first1=Martin|last1=Scholz|first2=Jean-Francois|last2=Bizot|first3=Bernard|last3= Zekri|date=1993-08|pages=60<U+2013>62, 96|volume=9|issue=5}}</ref> The idea was first put into practice in the video for ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s lead single, "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]".<ref>"Zoo TV: The Inside Story" (DVD documentary), ''Zoo TV: Live from Sydney''.</ref> Bono devised and collected numerous phrases during development of the album and the tour.<ref name="spin" /> Additional pre-recorded video content was created by Eno, Williams, [[Kevin Godley]], Carol Dodds, and Philip Owens.<ref name="1000days" />

On 13&nbsp;November, U2 settled on the "Zoo TV Tour" name and the plans to place video screens across the stage and build a lighting system out of Trabants.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 138</ref> McGuinness led a trip to East Germany to buy Trabants from a recently closed factory in [[Chemnitz]],<ref name="flan32">Flanagan (1996), p. 32</ref> and in January 1992, Catherine Owens began to paint the cars.<ref name="zootv-talent" /> As she described, "The basic idea was that the imagery on the cars should have nothing to do with the car itself."<ref name="zootv-talent" /> One such design was the "fertility car", which sported blown-up newspaper [[personal ad]]s and a drawing of a woman giving birth while holding string tied to her husband's testicles.<ref name="flan32"/> Williams and Chilean artist Rene Castro also provided artwork on the cars.<ref name="fistful"> "A Fistful of Zoo TV" (DVD documentary), ''Zoo TV: Live from Sydney''.</ref>

==Stage design and show production==

The Zoo TV stages were designed by Willie Williams, U2's stage designer since the [[War Tour]] of 1982<U+2013>1983. In place of U2's austere and minimalist productions of the 1980s,<ref name="zootv-talent"/> the Zoo TV stage was a complex setup, designed to instill "[[sensory overload]]" in its audience.<ref name="hpfeature" /><ref name="usa081292"/> The set's giant video screens showed not only close-ups of the band members performing, but also pre-recorded video, live television transmissions (intercepted by a satellite the group brought on tour), and text phrases.<ref name="mcg143" /> Electronic, tabloid-style headlines ran on scrawls at the ends of the stage.<ref name="nydn081392"/> The band's embracing of such technology was meant as a radical departure in form, and as a commentary on the pervasive nature of technology.<ref name="nyt031592"/><ref name="ach-stations" /> This led many critics to describe the show as "ironic".<ref name="ach-stations" />

Several versions of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs were indoors and used the smallest of the sets, which included four&nbsp;Vidiwalls ([[Philips]]-branded giant television screens); six&nbsp;painted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36&nbsp;television monitors; and a [[B-stage]], a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp.<ref name="dlp140">de la Parra (2003), p. 140</ref> A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a [[deejay|DJ]] booth and a [[disco ball|mirror ball]].<ref name="concert" />

To redesign the set for the North American outdoor stadium leg<U+2014>dubbed "Outside Broadcast"<U+2014>Williams collaborated with stage designers [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]] and Jonathan Park, both of whom had worked on [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|Steel Wheels Tour]] stage set. The set was expanded to include a {{convert|248|by|80|ft|m|adj=on}} stage, and the Vidiwalls were supplemented by four larger mega-video screens.<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 151</ref> Williams faced difficulties in designing the outdoor lighting system, as the stage did not have a roof. He settled on using the venues' house spotlights and strategically placed lights in the structure behind the band.<ref name="concert">Moody (1998), pp. 196<U+2013>204</ref> The spires of the stage, intended to resemble [[Radio masts and towers|transmission towers]], were tall enough that the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] required them to have blinking warning lights.<ref name="usa081292"/> The stage's appearance was compared to the techno-future cityscapes from ''[[Blade Runner]]''<ref name="usa081292"/> and the works of [[cyberpunk]] writer [[William Gibson]].<ref name="ach-stations"/> The B-stage was located at the end of a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalk]]. The larger set used 176&nbsp;speaker enclosures, 312&nbsp;{{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} [[subwoofer]]s, 592 {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} mid-range speakers, 18&nbsp;[[Video projector|projector]]s, 26&nbsp;on-stage microphones, two&nbsp;[[Betacam]] and two&nbsp;[[Video-8]] handheld video cameras, and 11&nbsp;Trabants suspended by cranes over the stage.<ref name="fistful" /><ref name="usa081292" /> The outdoor stage used for the 1993 legs of the tour was smaller due to budget concerns, and it discarded the Trabants hung from cranes, instead featuring three&nbsp;cars hanging behind the drum kit.<ref name="concert" /><ref name="dlp160">de la Parra (2003), p. 160</ref> All of the projection screens were replaced with "video cubes", as the projectors were not bright enough for the European summer nights, when daylight remained later into the evening.<ref name="concert" />

To realise the video production ideas, the equivalent of a [[Production control room|television studio control room]]<U+2014>costing [[United States dollar|US$]]3.5&nbsp;million<U+2014>was built for the tour.<ref name="prop-tour">{{cite journal|title=Sixty-Nine Things You May Not Have Known About Life in the Zoo|journal=Propaganda|issue=17|date=1993-01}}</ref><ref name="tv-station" /> Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called [[CD-i]]. It used five&nbsp;broadcast camera systems, 12&nbsp;[[Laser Disc]] players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12&nbsp;directors, 19&nbsp;video crew members, and two separate [[Live sound mixing|mix stations]] to operate.<ref name="fistful" /> Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist [[The Edge]] said, "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance."<ref name="hpfeature">{{cite journal|url=http://hotpress.com/archive/434728.html|title=Achtung Station!|journal=[[Hot Press]]|first=Bill|last=Graham|date=1992-05-21|accessdate=2011-04-22}} {{subscription required}}</ref> This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Feast for the Ears and a Riot for the Eyes|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Adam|last=Sweeting|date=1992-05-28}}</ref> Eno recommended that the band film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place.

The 180-person crew traveled in 12&nbsp;buses and a chartered jet known as the Zoo Plane.<ref name="usa081292"/><ref name="rs-zwo"/> For the American stadium shows, 52&nbsp;trucks were required to transport 1,200 [[short ton]]s (1,089 [[tonne]]s) of equipment, {{convert|3|mi|km}} of cabling, 12&nbsp;forklifts, and a {{convert|40|ST|0|adj=on}} crane; the million-dollar stage was constructed in a 40-hour process with the help of 200&nbsp;local labourers.<ref name="prop-tour" /><ref name="usa081292"/> The sound system used over one&nbsp;million watts and weighed {{convert|30|ST|0}}.<ref name="fistful" />

Rehearsals for the tour began in December 1991 at The Factory in Dublin.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 139</ref> During this time, Eno consulted the band on the visual aspects of the show.<ref name="tv-station" /> The band found it challenging to recreate all the sounds of the new album.

Unlike many of the group's previous tours, which began ahead of or coincident with the release of a new album, Zoo TV started four months after ''Achtung Baby'' was released, giving fans more time to familiarise themselves with the new songs. By opening night, the album had already sold three&nbsp;million copies in the US and seven&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref name="usa030692"/><ref name="nyt031592">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/15/arts/pop-music-a-chastened-u2-comes-down-to-earth.html|title=A Chastened U2 Comes Down to Earth|first=Larry|last=Rohter|authorlink=Larry Rohter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=1992-03-15|page=H33|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> The first two legs of the tour, 32 shows in North America and 25 in Europe, were indoor arena shows.

In Europe, ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets had gone on sale at box offices.<ref name="dlp146">de la Parra (2003), p. 146</ref> In many cases, tickets were limited to two-per-person to deter scalping.<ref name="britqueue" /> Due to the production costs and relatively small arena crowds, the European arena leg lost money. McGuinness had planned larger outdoor concerts in Berlin, Turin, Poland, and Vienna to help the tour break even, but only the Vienna concert occurred.<ref name="dlp146" />

==Show overview==
===Pre-show===
Between the support acts and U2's performance, a [[disc jockey]] played records. For the 1992 legs, Irish rock journalist and radio presenter [[BP Fallon]] filled the role. Originally hired to write the Zoo TV tour programme,<ref name="mcg141">McGee (2008), p. 141</ref> he played music from inside a Trabant on the B-stage, while providing commentary and wearing a cape and top hat.<ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 123<U+2013>125, 348</ref> His official title was "Guru, Viber and DJ".<ref name="mcg141" /> He hosted ''Zoo Radio'', a November 1992 distributed radio special that showcased select live performances, audio oddities, and half-serious interviews with members of U2 and the opening acts.<ref name="zooradio"/> At the group's suggestion, Fallon eventually published a book about the tour entitled ''U2 Faraway So Close''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=BP|authorlink=BP Fallon|title=U2, Faraway So Close|publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]]|year=1994|location=London|isbn=0-86369-885-9}}</ref> [[Paul Oakenfold]], who became one of the world's most prominent club DJs by the decade's end, replaced him later on the tour.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 473</ref>

The concert began with a fixed sequence of six to eight consecutive ''Achtung Baby'' songs, a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s.<ref name="mcg143">McGee (2008), p. 143</ref> For the opening song, "[[Zoo Station]]", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white [[Noise (video)|video noise]].<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 61</ref> "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]" usually followed, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly-changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included "Taste is the enemy of art", "Religion is a club", "Ignorance is bliss", "Watch more TV", "Believe" with letters fading out to leave "lie", and "Everything you know is wrong".<ref name="superfly" /> (During the first week of the tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.<ref>McGee (2008), pp. 144<U+2013>145</ref>) Before "[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]", Bono [[channel surf]]ed through live television programming,<ref name="tv-station" /><ref name="rs-zwo" /> and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a [[camcorder]].<ref name="nyt031192" /><ref>{{cite news|title=U2: Musical Masters of the Visual Medium|newspaper=[[The Daily Yomiuri]]|publisher=Yomiuri Group|first=W.

In a ''Zoo Radio'' interview, The Edge described the visual material that accompanied the first three songs:<ref name="zooradio"/>

{{blockquote|"'Zoo Station' is four minutes of a television that's not tuned in to any station, but giving you interference and shash and almost a TV picture. 'The Fly' is information meltdown<U+2014>text, sayings, truisms, untruisms, oxymorons, soothsayings, etc., all blasted at high speed, just fast enough so it's impossible to actually read what's being said. 'Even Better Than the Real Thing' is whatever happens to be flying around the stratosphere on that night. Satellite TV pictures, the weather, shopping channel, cubic zirconium diamond rings, religious channels, soap operas..."}}

"[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]" featured a [[belly dance]]r on-stage. For the 1992 indoor legs, Florida resident Christina Pedro was the dancer. Tour choreographer Morleigh Steinberg assumed the role starting with the Outside Broadcast leg.<ref name="mcg143" /> "[[One (U2 song)|One]]" was accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as [[Mark Pellington]]-directed video clips of [[American Bison|buffalo]]s leading to a still image of [[David Wojnarowicz]]'s "Falling Buffalo" photograph.<ref name="nyt031192"/> For "[[Until the End of the World (song)|Until the End of the World]]", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behavior of the past.<ref name="nyt031592" /> Beginning with Outside Broadcast, the band began playing "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]" afterwards.<ref name="u2gigszoo" /> During "[[Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World]]", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].<ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 61-62, 341</ref> At this point in the show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of "[[Dirty Old Town]]".<ref>McGee (2008), p. 145</ref>

This practice has continued on their subsequent tours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12435-2004Oct30.html|title=In Concert, But Not Live|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|first=Sean|last=Daly|date=2004-10-31|page=A01|accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Recorded vocals Are In Sync With Many Stage Shows|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|publisher=The Star Tribune Company|first=Jon|last=Bream|date=2005-02-27|page=8F}}</ref>

Zoo TV was one of the first large-scale concerts to feature a B-stage, where performances were intended "to be the antidote to Zoo TV".<ref name="zooradio">{{cite audio|title=Zoo Radio|url=http://www.bpfallon.com/audio.html|date=1992-11-27|medium=Syndicated radio broadcast|location=United States|people=[[BP Fallon]] (host and co-creator)}}</ref> Here, the four members played quieter numbers, such as acoustic arrangements of "[[Angel of Harlem]]", "[[When Love Comes to Town]]", "[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]", and [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Satellite of Love]]".<ref name="u2gigszoo" /> Many critics compared the B-stage performances to "[[busking]]" and singled them out as the shows' highlights.<ref name="hpfeature" /><ref name="sfchron" />

After leaving the B-stage, U2 often played "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]",<ref name="u2gigszoo" /> with performances of "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]" and "[[Running to Stand Still]]" following. For "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and [[swastika]]s;<ref name="tv-station" /><ref name="greatestshow" /> during "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then spiking his arm during the final lyric.<ref>Brothers (1999), p. 260</ref> Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares came out from either end of the B-stage,<ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 290, 444</ref> before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight.<ref name="nyt081592"/> "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]" was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from ''The Joshua Tree''{{'}}s photo shoot.<ref name="rockbig">{{cite journal|title=Rock and Roll Should Be This Big!|journal=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|first=Stuart|last=Bailie|date=1992-06-13}}</ref> U2 often finished their set with "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" while a clip from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s famed "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]" speech was played on the video screens.<ref name="rs-zwo"/> The group was initially unconvinced that the leap from the rest of the show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance.<ref name="rs-zwo"/> The group alternated performances of "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u2gigs.com/I_Still_Havent_Found_What_Im_Looking_For-s54.html|title=U2 I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For|publisher=U2Gigs|accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref>

===Encore===
Commencing with the Outside Broadcast leg,<ref name="mcg151" /> clips from the tour's "video [[confessional]] booth" were displayed on the set's screens between the main set and the encore. Concertgoers were encouraged to visit the booth prior to the concert and say whatever they wanted. These "confessions" varied from a woman flashing her breasts to a man revealing he had killed his friend in a car accident.<ref name="m237">McCormick (2006), p. 237</ref> Once the encore began, Bono would return as a different alter ego<U+2014>Mirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Performances of "[[Desire (U2 song)|Desire]]"<U+2014>accompanied by images of [[Richard Nixon]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Paul Gascoigne]], and [[Jimmy Swaggert]]<U+2014>were meant as a criticism of greed;<ref name="rockbig" /> cash rained the stage and Bono often portrayed Mirror Ball Man as an interpretation of the greedy preacher described in the song's lyrics.<ref name="flan62">Flanagan (1996), p. 62</ref> Bono often made a [[crank call]] from the stage as his persona of the time.<ref name="rockbig" /><ref name="m237" /> Such calls included dialing a [[phone sex]] line, calling a [[taxi cab]], ordering 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor delivered 100 pizzas during the show), or calling a local politician.<ref name="m237" /><ref name="flan245" /> Bono regularly called the [[White House]] in an attempt to contact President Bush. Though Bono never reached the President, Bush did acknowledge the calls during a press conference.<ref name="m237" /><ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 99</ref>

"[[Ultraviolet (Light My Way)]]" and "[[With or Without You]]" were frequently played afterwards.

On 11&nbsp;June 1992, [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Ulvaeus]] of [[ABBA]] appeared on-stage in Stockholm for the first time in years to perform "[[Dancing Queen]]" with the band,<ref name="mcg148">McGee (2008), p. 148</ref> which U2 had frequently performed on the tour up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u2gigs.com/Dancing_Queen-s131.html|title=U2 Dancing Queen|publisher=U2Gigs|accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref> Other guest performers on the tour included [[Axl Rose]],<ref name="prop-tour" /> Jo Shankar,<ref name="dlp160" /> and [[Daniel Lanois]].<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 154</ref>

On 19&nbsp;June 1992, during the European indoor leg, U2 played the "[[Stop Sellafield]]" concert in Manchester, alongside [[Kraftwerk]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], and [[Big Audio Dynamite II]], to protest the operation of a second nuclear reactor at Sellafield.<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 141</ref> For the group's performance, the stage was made to resemble their Zoo TV stage. The following day, the band participated in a demonstration organised by [[Greenpeace]] in which protesters landed on the beach at Sellafield in rubber dinghies and displayed 700 placards for the waiting media.<ref name="mcg148" />

At the first Outside Broadcast show on 12&nbsp;August 1992 at Giants Stadium, Lou Reed performed "Satellite of Love" with the band;<ref name="mcg151">McGee (2008), p. 151</ref> he and Bono dueted using their contrasting vocal styles.<ref name="nydn081392">{{cite news|title=Zoo Story: At Giants Stadium, U2 projects itself into the future, casting off classic-rock stodginess|first=Jim|last=Farber|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|date=1992-08-13|page=37}}</ref><ref name="app081492"/> Bono re-confirmed the singer's influence on the band by announcing, "Every song we're ever written was a rip-off of a Lou Reed song."<ref>{{cite news|title=Outdoor U2 Extravaganza Much The Same As Indoor Show|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|first=Roger|last=Catlin|date=1992-08-13|at=section Calendar, p. 8}}</ref> For the second show and the remainder of the tour, a taping of Reed singing the song was used for a virtual duet between him and Bono.<ref name="mcg151" /> 

Novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] joined the band on stage in London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 11&nbsp;August 1993, despite the death [[fatw<U+0101>]] against the author and the risk of violence arising from his controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.<ref name="rs-zwo"/> In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that "real devils don't wear horns".<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 308</ref> In 2010, Clayton recalled that "Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stairway to Devon <U+2212> OK, Somerset!|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|date=2010-07|page=101|author=U2|issue=288}}</ref>

==Sarajevo satellite link-ups==
As the 1993 Zooropa leg unfolded, U2 became concerned with the uncertain political situation of post-Communist Europe and the resurgence of [[radical nationalism]].<ref name="rs-zwo"/> A number of these European shows featured live satellite link-ups with people living in war-torn [[Sarajevo]] during the [[siege of Sarajevo]]/[[Bosnian War]]. The transmissions were arranged with help from American aid worker [[Bill Carter]]. Before their 3&nbsp;July show in [[Verona]], Italy, the band met with Carter to give an interview about Bosnia for [[Radiotelevision of Bosnia-Herzegovina|Radio Televizija Bosne I Hercegovina]].<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 277</ref><ref name="m252">McCormick (2006), pp. 252<U+2013>253</ref> Carter described his experiences helping Sarajevo citizens while surviving the dangerous living conditions.<ref name="link">{{cite journal|url=http://hotpress.com/archive/443692.html|title=A Crucial Link|journal=[[Hot Press]]|first=Bill|last=Graham|date=1993-08-11|accessdate=2011-04-22}} {{subscription required}}</ref> While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned the theme of the Zooropa leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring Bosnia, Carter sought Bono's help.<ref>Carter (2003), p. 170</ref> He requested that U2 go to Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the "media fatigue" that had occurred from covering the conflict.<ref name="m252" /> Bono wanted the band to play a concert there, but their tour schedule prevented this, and McGuinness believed that a concert there would make them and their audience targets for the Serbian aggressors.<ref name="m252" />

Instead, the group agreed to use the tour's satellite dish to conduct live video transmissions from their concerts to Carter in Sarajevo.<ref name="m252" /> Carter returned to the city and was able to assemble a video unit. The band had to purchase a satellite dish to be sent to Sarajevo and had to pay a <U+00A3>100,000 fee to join the [[European Broadcasting Union]].<ref name="link" /> Once set up, the band began satellite link-ups to Sarajevo on nearly a nightly basis, the first of which aired on 17&nbsp;July 1993 in [[Bologna]], Italy.<ref name="flan300">Flanagan (1996), pp. 300<U+2013>306</ref> To connect with the EBU satellite feeds, Carter and two co-workers had to traverse "[[Sniper Alley]]" at night to reach the Sarajevo television station, and they had to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers.<ref name="flan300" /><ref name="j49">Jackson (2008), pp. 48, 49</ref> This was done a total of ten times over the course of a month. Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience.<ref name="flan300" /> These grim interviews deviated from the rest of the show, and they were completely unscripted, leaving the group unsure of who would be speaking or what they would say.<ref name="m252" /> U2 stopped the broadcasts in August 1993 after learning that the siege of Sarajevo was being reported on the front of many British newspapers.<ref name="j49" /> Though this trend had begun before the first link-up, Nathan Jackson suggested that U2's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans, and to the British public indirectly.<ref name="j49" />

Reactions to the transmissions were mixed, triggering a media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy.<ref name="rs-zwo"/> The Edge said, "A lot of nights it felt like quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed by a lot of people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering."<ref name="m252" /> Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment.<ref name="m252" /> In 2002, he said, "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something."<ref name="Q-int">{{cite journal|title=10 Years of Turmoil Inside U2|first=Tom|last=Doyle|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|date=2002-11|issue=196}}</ref> During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via the satellite transmission, "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die."<ref name="m252" /> Some people close to the band joined the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] charity project, including Brian Eno.<ref name="m252" /> Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV".<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 307</ref> U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, [[U2 concert in Sarajevo|eventually fulfilling this commitment]] on their 1997 [[PopMart Tour]].<ref name="m277">McCormick (2006), pp. 277, 279</ref>

==Bono's stage personae==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bono]] -->
Bono assumed a number of costumed alter egos during Zoo TV performances. The three main personae that he used on stage were "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]", "Mirror Ball Man", and "MacPhisto". Additionally, during performances of "Bullet the Blue Sky" and "Running to Stand Still", he appeared on-stage wearing a military utility vest and cap, and a microphone headset. As this character, he ranted and raved in an act he said was set in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 141</ref>

The group decided to alter their image by being more facetious, and it was an attempt to escape their reputation for being overly serious and self-righteous.<ref name="ach-stations" /> Bono said, "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided to have some fun being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves."<ref name="m234" /> The Edge said, "We were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing U2 and starting all over again."<ref name="nyt031592"/> The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.<ref name="fricke" /> 

===The Fly===
[[File:Bono as The Fly Cleveland 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Bono with black hair, black sunglasses, and a black leather attire speaks into a microphone.|Bono as his on-stage alter ego, "The Fly"]]
Bono conceived the alternate persona, "The Fly", during the writing of the song of the same name. The character began with Bono wearing an oversized pair of [[blaxploitation]] sunglasses, given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald, to lighten the mood in the studio.<ref name="mcg134-5">McGee (2008), pp. 134<U+2013>135</ref><ref name="comp">McCormick (2006), pp. 224<U+2013>225, 227, 232</ref> Bono wrote the song's lyrics as this character, composing a sequence of "single-line aphorisms".<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 102</ref> He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, describing his outfit as having Lou Reed's glasses, [[Elvis Presley]]'s jacket, and [[Jim Morrison]]'s leather pants.<ref name="legends" /> To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black.<ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 97, 521</ref>

Bono began each concert as The Fly and continued to play the character for most of the first half of the concert. In contrast to his earnest self of the 1980s, as The Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with "swagger and style", exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star;<ref name="mcg143" /> he publicly stated, and adopted the mindset, at the time that he was "licensed to be an egomaniac".<ref name="zooradio"/><ref name="forus">{{cite journal|title=Let's Hear It For... Us!|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|first=Paul|last=Du Noyer|date=1993-01|issue=76}}</ref> He often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels.<ref name="rs-fly"/> He said, "That rather cracked character could say things that I couldn't",<ref name="comp" /> and that it offered him a greater freedom of speech.<ref name="ach-stations" />

===Mirror Ball Man===
As the Mirror Ball Man, Bono dressed in a shining silver [[Lam<U+00E9> (fabric)|lam<U+00E9>]] suit with matching shoes and cowboy hat.<ref name="flan62" /> The character was meant to parody greedy American [[televangelist]]s, showmen, and car salesman, and was inspired by [[Phil Ochs]]' Elvis persona from his 1970 tour.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 61</ref> Bono said that he represented "a kind of showman America. He had the confidence and charm to pick up a mirror and look at himself and give the glass a big kiss. He loved cash and in his mind success was God's blessing. If he's made money, he can't have made any mistakes."<ref name="m228" /> As the character, Bono spoke with an exaggerated [[Southern American English|Southern American accent]]. Mirror Ball Man appeared during the show's encore and made nightly prank calls, often to the White House.<ref name="flan62" /> Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour, but replaced him with MacPhisto for the 1993 legs.<ref name="flan228" />

===MacPhisto===
MacPhisto was created to parody the devil and was named after [[Mephistopheles]] of the [[Faust]] legend.<ref name="flan228">Flanagan (1996), pp. 228<U+2013>231</ref> Initially called "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold suit with gold platform shoes, pale make-up, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head.<ref>McGee (2008), pp. 160<U+2013>161</ref> As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, similar to that of a down-on-his-luck character actor.<ref name="flan228" /> The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man.<ref name="rs-zwo"/><ref name="flan228" /> The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical ''[[The Black Rider]]''.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 158</ref> Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows.<ref name="lat042097"/> According to Bono, "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days."<ref name="m248">McCormick (2006), p. 248</ref>

Bono continued making crank calls as MacPhisto, but the targets would change with the location of the concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by attempting to engage them in character as the devil.<ref name="flan245">Flanagan (1996), p. 245</ref> He enjoyed making these calls, saying, "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment."<ref name="m248" /> The band intended for MacPhisto to add humor while making a point. Said The Edge, "That character was a great device for saying the opposite of what you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor."<ref name="m248" /> A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the [[C. S. Lewis]] novel ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 434</ref><ref>Scharen (2006), p. 197</ref>

U2 recorded their next album, ''[[Zooropa]]'', from February to May 1993 during an extended break between the third and fourth legs of the tour.

On 9&nbsp;September 1992, a portion of U2's performance at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] was broadcast live to the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]].

Two November 1993 Zoomerang shows in Sydney were filmed as part of a worldwide television broadcast. The 26&nbsp;November show was to be a rehearsal for the production crew for the official filming the following night. However, Clayton, who began drinking excessively on the latter stages of the tour, suffered an [[Blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)|alcoholic blackout]] from the previous night and was unable to perform.<ref name="u2byu2-255"/> [[Guitar technician|Bass guitar technician]] Stuart Morgan filled in for him, marking the first time any group member had ever missed a show.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Reviews written during the initial arena legs reflected the dramatic change in U2's approach. Many critics published favourable reviews about the tour; the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised the special effects for supplementing the music. The reviewer wrote, "The often-surrealistic effects always served the songs, not the other way around." The review concluded, "this magnificent multimedia production will serve as a pinnacle in rock's onstage history for sometime to come".<ref name="sfchron">{{cite news|title=U2 Pushes the Limits of Rock Shows|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|first=Joel|last=Selvin|date=1992-04-20|page=E1}}</ref> [[Edna Gundersen]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that U2 was dismantling its myth and wrote that the show was "a trippy and decadent concert of bedazzling visuals and adventurous music".<ref name="usa030692">{{cite news|title=U2's rock 'n' roll Zoo|first=Edna|last=Gundersen|authorlink=Edna Gundersen|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=1992-03-06|page=1D}}</ref> ''[[Hot Press]]''{{'}} Bill Graham said of the show, "U2 don't so much use every trick in the book as invent a whole new style of rock performance art." For Graham, the tour resolved any doubts he had about the band<U+2014>particularly about Bono<U+2014>following their reinvention with ''Achtung Baby''.<ref name="hpfeature" />

Other critics indicated befuddlement as to U2's purpose. The ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'' wrote that the long string of ''Achtung Baby'' song presentations that opened the show made one forget about the band's past, and that "almost everything you knew about U2 a couple years ago is, in fact, wrong now".<ref name="app032092">{{cite news|title=A new U2|first=Matty|last=Karas|newspaper=[[Asbury Park Press]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=1992-03-20|page=C1}}</ref> ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' said that the band shortchanged its music with its video presentations and that especially during the opening sequence, "one was only aware of the music as a soundtrack to the real 'show'".<ref name="nsl032092">{{cite news|title=U2 concert missing musical magic, mystery|first=Jay|last=Lustig|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=1992-03-20|page=61}}</ref>  It concluded by saying that the group had lost the sense of mystery and yearning that made it great and that they had succumbed to the style of music videos.<ref name="nsl032092"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' acknowledged that U2 was trying to break its former earnest image and that they were a "vastly improved band" for being "trendy" and "funny"; still, he commented, "U2 wants to have its artifice and its sincerity at the same time<U+2014>no easy thing<U+2014>and it hasn't yet made the breakthrough that will unite them."<ref name="nyt031192">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/11/arts/review-rock-u2-restyled-with-props-and-a-nod-to-the-fringes.html|title=U2 Restyled, With Props and a Nod to the Fringes|first=Jon|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=1992-03-11|page=C17|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>

The stadium legs of the tour received more consistent praise than the arena shows.

===Fan reaction===
The group and the music industry were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand.<ref name="rs-fly"/> During the first week of shows, Bono said, "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure." He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned he had no intention of resisting the glamour and fame: "Oh, but it's ''fun'' to be carried away by the hype. Where would you be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening."<ref name="usa030692"/> Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values,<ref name="ach-stations"/> while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to ''[[VH1's Legends]]'', "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac".<ref name="legends">{{cite episode|title=U2|series=[[VH1's Legends|Legends]]|network=[[VH1]]|season=1|number=6|airdate=1998-12-11}}</ref> Many Christian fans were offended the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.<ref>Thompson (2000), pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

By the outdoor legs, many fans knew what to expect, and Pareles observed that Bono's admonitions to never cheer a rock star were greeted with idolatrous applause; he concluded that the show's message of skepticism was somewhat lost on the audience and that, "No matter what Bono tells his fans, they seem likely to trust him anyway."<ref name="nyt081592"/> By the end of the tour's first year, U2 had won over many fans. In a 1992 end-of-year readers' poll, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' voted U2 "The Best Act in the World Today".<ref name="forus" /> The band's almost clean sweep of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s end-of-year readers' poll<U+2014>which included "Best Artist", "Best Tour", and Bono as "Sexiest Male Artist"<U+2014>reconfirmed for the magazine they were "world's biggest rock band".<ref name="rs-fly">{{cite journal|title=Behind the Fly|first=Alan|last=Light|authorlink=Alan Light |journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=1993-03-04|issue=651|pages=42+}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Readers Go For U2|agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Torstar]]|date=1993-02-16|page=C2}}</ref>

===Commercial performance===
On the opening leg, U2 sold 528,763&nbsp;tickets and grossed US$13,215,414 in 32&nbsp;shows.<ref name="dlp146" /> The 70-plus North American shows in 1992 grossed US$67&nbsp;million, easily the highest amount for any touring artist that year.<ref name="wapo010693">{{cite news|title=U2, Dead Top '92 Concert Sales|first=Richard|last=Harrington|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=1993-01-06|page=C7}}</ref> At the time, this was the third-highest such total, behind The Rolling Stones' 1989 [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|Steel Wheels Tour]] and [[New Kids on the Block]]'s 1990 [[The Magic Summer Tour|Magic Summer Tour]].<ref name="wapo010693"/> Ticket sales in America and Europe for the year 1992 were 2.9&nbsp;million.

==Impact and legacy==
For the Zoo TV Tour, U2 embraced the "rock star" identity they had struggled with and were reluctant to accept throughout the 1980s.<ref name="ach-stations" /><ref name="spin" /> They drew celebrity attention, including American presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]], and attracted the fashion crowd during parts of the tour, and they began partying more than they had in the past.<ref name="Q-int"/><ref name="u2byu2-243"/> Clayton's romantic relationship with [[supermodel]] [[Naomi Campbell]] and Bono's friendship with supermodel [[Christy Turlington]] made them the subjects of unwanted tabloid attention.<ref name="u2byu2-243">McCormick (2006), pp. 243<U+2013>244</ref> By the time of the Zoomerang leg, Clayton's relationship with Campbell was fracturing and he was drinking frequently. After missing the group's 26&nbsp;November 1993 show in Sydney from an alcoholic blackout, Clayton quit drinking altogether.<ref name="u2byu2-255"/> The incident resulted in tensions within the group in the tour's final weeks. The Edge began dating the belly dancer Morleigh Steinberg during the tour,<ref name="mcg143" /><ref name="mcg150" /> and the two later married in 2002.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 317</ref>

The tour's two-year length, then U2's longest, exhausted the band as the final legs unfolded.<ref name="u2byu2-255">McCormick (2006), pp. 255<U+2013>256</ref> Following the conclusion of Zoo TV, U2 took an extended break from recording as a group. Mullen and Clayton moved into [[Manhattan]] apartments in New York City, where they sought out music lessons to become better musicians.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 505</ref> The Edge and Bono spent most of 1994 living in newly-renovated houses in the [[South of France]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 259<U+2013>261</ref> 

After the tour, although The Fly character was retired, Bono began to wear tinted glasses, similar to his Fly sunglasses, in most public appearances.

As the tour drew to a close, the group entered prolonged discussions about creating a Zoo TV television channel in partnership with MTV.<ref name="flanagan-504">Flanagan (1996), pp. 477<U+2013>478, 504<U+2013>505, 511, 522</ref> This never materialized, but in 1997, MTV ran a brief mini-series called ''Zoo-TV'', which featured [[Emergency Broadcast Network]] extending their tour role in creating contemporary surrealist satirical video.<ref name="wired041197">{{cite journal|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/04/3098|title=MTV Opens Cage for Wild Zoo-TV|first=David|last=Kushner|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=1997-04-11|accessdate=2011-04-04}}</ref> U2 endorsed the effort as a representation of what the tour would have been like as a news magazine,<ref>{{cite news|title='Zoo TV': U2's Principles Minus Band's Principals|first=Steve|last=Hochman|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=1996-06-30|page=60}}</ref> but their direct role was limited to providing half-financing and outtakes from the ''Zooropa'' album.<ref name="wired041197"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine said the series "pushe[d] the edge of commercial<U+2014>even comprehensible<U+2014>television".<ref name="wired041197"/>

U2's subsequent concert tour, 1997's [[PopMart Tour]], followed in Zoo TV's footsteps by mocking another social trend, this time consumerism. Paul McGuinness said the group wanted "the production [of PopMart] to beat Zoo TV", and accordingly, the tour's spectacle was a further shift away from their austere stage shows of the 1980s; PopMart's stage featured a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} LED screen, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} golden arch, and a mirrorball lemon.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 270<U+2013>271</ref> Although critics were much less receptive to PopMart, Bono considers the tour to be their best: "Pop(Mart) is our finest hour.

The [[Pixies]]' stint as a support act produced a controversy that partially contributed to their break-up.<ref name="flan361" >Flanagan (1996), pp. 361<U+2013>363</ref> In July 1992, ''Spin'' featured a controversial cover story titled "U2 On Tour: The Story They Didn't Want You to Read", which detailed author [[James Greer|Jim Greer]]'s travels on the tour's first weeks with his unidentified girlfriend (who turned out to be Pixies' bassist [[Kim Deal]]).

In 1993, following tensions within the group, Francis announced the Pixies had dissolved.<ref name="flan361" />

In 2005, during their [[Vertigo Tour]], the group often played a mini-Zoo TV set<U+2014>"Zoo Station", "The Fly", and "Mysterious Ways"<U+2014>as part of the first encore; performances of "Zoo Station" included the interference in background visual effects and "The Fly" used similar flashing text effects on the LED screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/live-review-u2-go-old-school-in-cali-20050329|title=Live Review: U2 Go Old School in Cali|last=Baltin|first=Steve|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=2005-03-29|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blinded by the Light|last=Boyd|first=Brian|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sofiaecho.com/2005/07/18/646365_when-u2-comes-to-town|title=When U2 comes to town|last=Dimitrova|first=Christina|newspaper=[[The Sofia Echo]]|date=2005-07-18|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Spettacoli/2005/07_Luglio/18/u2.shtml|title=U2, decalogo del triplo concerto|last=De Ponti|first=Roberto|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=2005-07-15|accessdate=2011-03-27|language=Italian}}</ref>
