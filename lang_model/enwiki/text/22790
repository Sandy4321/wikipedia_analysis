'''The Color Changin' Click''' or '''CCC''', also known as '''Chamillitary''', is a rap group which was started by rapper [[Chamillionaire]] and [[Paul Wall]] which also features [[rappers]] such as [[Lew Hawk]], [[50/50 Twin]], [[Rasaq]] (Chamillionaire's younger brother),  and [[Yung Ro]]. 

==Biography==
===Chamillionaire and Paul Wall===
Friends since childhood, Paul and Chamillionaire broke into the music industry by doing promotions for various southern hip-hop entities such as [[Cash Money Records]]. Eventually, they got jobs doing promotions for [[Swishahouse]]. While there, they recorded a demo for [[Swishahouse]] that gained a lot of attention, and soon people wanted to know who made it. Paul and Chamillionaire kept asking Swishahouse CEO [[Michael 5000 Watts]] to let them get a couple of verses on some mixtapes. However, they were constantly put to the side for other artists, and when they did get a chance to perform, they weren't getting paid well. Eventually, Paul and Chamillionaire decided to break out on their own and left Swishahouse. 

The pair signed with [[Paid in Full Entertainment]], a record label owned by the Madd Hatta, and released ''[[Get Ya Mind Correct]]'' in 2002. It was an instant hit in Houston, selling over 200,000 copies independently and getting nominated by the Source as one of the finalists for the indie album of the year in 2002.

However, disputes over money and artistic direction led to friction between Paul and Cham. They were set to release their second album, ''[[Controversy Sells]]'', but the lingering issues led the group to split before the album saw the light of day. ''Controversy Sells'' did eventually get released in 2004. Paul decided to return to Swishahouse, while Cham started his own label, [[Chamillitary Entertainment]]. His younger brother [[Rasaq]], [[Yung Ro]], [[50/50 Twin]], and [[OG Ron C]] are signed to the label.

Paul and Cham's relationship was further strained by Paul's friendship with [[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]]. Cham claims that Jones was saying foul things behind his back while being cool with him in person. For Cham's part, he says that he doesn't know if a reconciliation with Paul is forthcoming, stating that they have both grown into different people (although he left the possibility open), but he wants nothing to do with Jones.

==Controversy==
[[Rasaq]] was allegedly jumped and punched in the back of the head by [[Paul Wall]] at a nightclub. These claims were denied by Paul Wall, and Chamillionaire denied that anyone was hurt at all. He also expressed his disappointment in Paul Wall, claiming that they "all used to be family", and expressing dismay in the state of affairs. While Chamillionaire and Paul Wall have since ended any friction toward each other (after performing Ridin' on [[BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'', Chamillionaire confirmed that he and [[Paul Wall]] had settled all problems and had no friction towards each other, citing that it had taken "so long" to get to where they were in their success), Chamillionaire has contemplated working with his estranged business partner again and even touring together [http://sohh.com/articles/article.php/9714].
