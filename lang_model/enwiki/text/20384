The '''Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)''' is an organization comprising universities located in North America that offer graduate programs in the field of art [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]]. Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers. 

==History==
[[File:Corning Museum of Glass.jpg|thumb|left|The Corning Museum of Glass, site of the first conference held by the North American graduate programs in conservation]]The first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated.<ref name="ANAGPIC book">{{cite book|last=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property, Histories & Alumni|date=2000|publisher=ANAGPIC|location=Buffalo, NY|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/histalum_full.pdf}}</ref> This five-day conference entitled, "Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials," was organized by Dr. [[Robert H. Brill]], the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; [[State University of New York at Oneonta | Cooperstown Graduate Program]], [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library | Winterthur]]/[[University of Delaware]], [[Intermuseum Conservation Association]], [[New York University]], [[Canadian Conservation Institute]], and the [[Fogg Art Museum]]. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as "Extreme Conservation" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers.<ref name="ANAGPIC book">{{cite web}}</ref>

The Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen<U+2019>s University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record.<ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws">{{cite web|last=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=ANAGPIC Bylaws|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/bylaws.htm|publisher=Conservation OnLine (CoOL)|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>  

==Mission==

The general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to <U+201C>help serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.<U+201D><ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws">{{cite web}}</ref> 

In order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the [[International Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the [[American Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC).<ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws">{{cite web}}</ref> 

At least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson.<ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws">{{cite web}}</ref>

===<big>Buffalo State College, SUNY, Art Conservation Department</big>===
[[File:Rockwell hall.JPG|thumb|right|Rockwell Hall at Buffalo State College, where graduate courses in art conservation are held.]] Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. [[Buffalo State College|Buffalo State]] is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Art Conservation - Buffalo State|url=http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history|publisher=Buffalo State College|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>  Buffalo State's campus also hosts the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] and located across the street from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]].

===<big>Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies</big>===

<big>'''Overview'''</big>

The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the [[Harvard Art Museums]]<U+2019> collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from [[classic antiquity | antiquity]] to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the <U+FB01>rst institution in the United States to use scienti<U+FB01>c methods to study artists<U+2019> materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University<U+2019>s [[Fogg Museum]]. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They o<U+FB00>er three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can re<U+FB01>ne their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research.<ref name=Straus>{{cite web|title=Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/straus|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>

===<big>New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts</big>===

The Conservation Center of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer<U+2019>s approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems.<ref name="NYU History">{{cite web|title=History of the Center|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/history.htm|publisher=Institute of Fine Arts, New York University|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref> Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Master<U+2019>s in art history and Advanced Certificate in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America. 

<big>'''Program Overview'''</big>

'''Art History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation'''

*''First Year'' - Students gain an understanding of materials and technology, with a heavy emphasis on direct observation. No treatment is carried out during the first year, apart from simple treatment methodologies carried out in ''Principles of Conservation''.
