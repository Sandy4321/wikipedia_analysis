The '''2010<U+2013>11 Miami Heat season''' was the 23rd season of the [[Miami Heat]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). In the regular season, the Heat finished first in the [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast Division]] with 58<U+2013>24 record, and made the [[NBA Playoffs]] for the 3rd consecutive year as the Eastern Conference's No. 2 seed (behind the Chicago Bulls).

With the acquisition of free agents [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] in the off season, the Heat opened up the season with extraordinarily high expectations,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramsey|first=Denton|title=LeBron James Miami Heat: 25 Marquee 2010 One-on-One Matchups for Big 3|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/497188-lebron-james-miami-heat-25-marquee-2010-one-on-one-matchups-for-big-3|publisher=Bleacher Report.com|accessdate=October 21, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101025115258/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/497188-lebron-james-miami-heat-25-marquee-2010-one-on-one-matchups-for-big-3| archivedate= October 25, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Joseph|title=Miami Heat still a work in progress|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/11/13/1923385/miami-heat-still-a-work-in-progress.html|publisher=Miami Herald.com|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref> with many expecting a championship in the first year of the new lineup, and with team stars [[Chris Bosh]], [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[LeBron James]] predicting an NBA championship in their first season together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Bosh: Heat's goal title or bust|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5455118|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100816034328/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5455118| archivedate= August 16, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However they fell just short by losing to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the NBA Finals.

Even though the Heat's season ended in disappointing fashion, they enjoyed a successful season, despite a slow 9<U+2013>8 start to the regular season. They finished the regular season with 58 wins, their third-most in franchise history, won the Southeast Division, and were second in the Eastern Conference. [[Pat Riley]] was named [[NBA Executive of the Year]]. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh were all selected to the [[2011 NBA All-Star Game]], the most Heat players in an All-Star game in franchise history. LeBron James earned [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA First Team]] honors, while Dwyane Wade earned All-NBA Second Team honors.

In the [[2011 NBA Playoffs|NBA Playoffs]], Miami defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[2011 NBA Playoffs#Bracket|First round]], [[Boston Celtics]] in the [[2011 NBA Playoffs#(2) Miami Heat vs. (3) Boston Celtics|Eastern Conference Semifinals]],and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the [[Conference Finals]] all in 5 games.

==Summary==
===Offseason===
The Miami Heat entered NBA Free Agency in 2010 with nearly $46 million in [[salary cap]] space, with the ability to re-sign free agent Dwyane Wade, and add two of the [[NBA]]'s top players, [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]]. According to [[Fox Sports Radio]]'s [[Stephen A. Smith]], speaking on his show just days after the [[NBA Draft]], the Heat were "highly likely" to sign all three players.<ref name="blogs.wsj.com">{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/08/lebron-james-picks-miami-stephen-a-smith-was-right/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=LeBron James Picks Miami: Stephen A. Smith Was Right | date=July 8, 2010}}</ref> The [[New Jersey Nets]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Dallas Mavericks]] and the Miami Heat were in negotiations to sign [[LeBron James]]. On July 7, 2010, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh agreed to terms with the Miami Heat. Then on July 8, 2010, LeBron James held an hour-long special to announce his decision on ESPN  to commit to playing with the Heat.<ref name="tvguide.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/LeBron-James-Miami-1020311.aspx|title=LeBron James Leaves the Cleveland Cavaliers for Miami Heat}}</ref> Later that evening, the Heat announced the trade of [[Michael Beasley]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for a pair of second round picks and cash considerations.<ref name="google.com">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iz-zLam0eHBUMcM9Pgdt-_QGQM0Q]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>  The three are called the SuperFriends by many sportswriters and commentators, most notably those for ESPN, because all three were taken in the top five of the 2003 NBA Draft and because they have become good friends over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ |title=ESPN: The Worldwide Leader In Sports |publisher=ESPN |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110615182949/http://espn.go.com/| archivedate= June 15, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On July 8, 2010, it became official that NBA superstars and gold medal winning [[United States national men's basketball team|Beijing Olympic teammates]] [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Chris Bosh]] would be joining Miami. The Heat completed sign-and-trade deals, sending a total of four future first-round and two second-round picks to the Cavaliers and Raptors for James and Bosh (both signing 6 years and $110.1 million contracts). Dwyane Wade re-signed with the Heat for $107.59 million for six years. All three stars have early termination clauses in their contracts, allowing them to become free agents again in the summer of 2014. The final year on all three deals, for 2015<U+2013>16, is a player option.<ref name="kansascity.com">[http://www.kansascity.com/2010/07/10/2075054/cavaliers-receive-four-draft-picks.html]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref><ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com">{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/basketball/nba/07/09/lebron.bosh.ap/index.html }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5368003 |title=Sources: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh sign with Miami Heat for $15M less each |publisher=ESPN |date=July 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The three made their debut at the 2010 Summer Heat Welcome Party at the [[American Airlines Arena]] on July 9, where they were introduced as ''The Three Kings'' by Heat play-by-play announcer and event co-host [[Eric Reid]].<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gHG3AMVw-CGtPxYhkoio-K9KEIowD9GRSLU80]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships: "Not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven".<ref>{{cite interview |last1=Wade|first1=Dwyane|last2=Bosh|first2=Chris|last3=James|first3=LeBron|interviewer=[[Eric Reid]]|title=On Stage Interview with Wade, Bosh and James - July 9, 2010|date=July 10, 2010|work=NBA.com|url=http://www.nba.com/heat/news/on_stage_interview_wade_bosh_james_2010_07_10.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wharton|first=David|title=Miami's upgrade status holds lessons for Clippers|date=January 10, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/10/sports/la-sp-miami-heat-20120111|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> Howard Beck of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the national fan reaction to the party: "Everyone saw something: greatness, arrogance, self-indulgence, boldness, cowardice, pride, friendship, collusion, joy, cynicism, heroes, mercenaries."<ref name="Beck B-12">{{cite news

By taking less than maximum salaries, Wade, James and Bosh opened the door for the Heat to further continue its roster makeover with the resigning of [[Udonis Haslem]] and signing of veteran swingman and teammate of Haslem at the [[University of Florida]], [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]] for dual 5 year deals worth a combined $45 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/sfl-miami-heat-mike-miller-s071520,0,2362927.story |title=Miami Heat finally completes Mike Miller signing, more to follow |publisher=Sun Sentinel |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110622092050/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/sfl-miami-heat-mike-miller-s071520,0,2362927.story| archivedate= June 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In order to fill the voids at forward and center, the Heat signed James's former teammate in Cleveland, [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]] to a two year deal for the veterans minimum at $2.8 million, resigning [[Joel Anthony]], and signing power forward [[Juwan Howard]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gutierrez |first=Israel |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/13/1728903/zydrunas-ilgauskas-follow-lebron.html |title=Zydrunas Ilgauskas follows LeBron James to Miami Heat <U+2013> Miami Heat |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> In the guard department, the Miami Heat resigned guard [[Carlos Arroyo]] and signed former Celtics player [[Eddie House]] to a two-year contract for the veteran minimum of $2.8 million.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wojnarowski |first=Adrian |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=Aj57vuxe5KqcmBaAxZ4J6285nYcB?slug=aw-eddiehouse072910 |title=House returns to Heat as latest addition <U+2013> NBA <U+2013> Yahoo!

The Miami Heat began the regular season with much hype going into their first game against the Eastern Conference Champs, the Boston Celtics. Many considered the Miami Heat as the team to break the single season record of 72 regular season victories set by the [[Chicago Bulls]].<ref name="Araton B11">{{cite news |last=Araton |first=Harvey |title=With Stars Aplenty, Heat Looks for Leader |date=March 8, 2011 |page=B11 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/sports/basketball/08dribble.html?_r=1&scp=16&sq=miami+heat&st=nyt |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x78M6mi8 |archivedate=March 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Season===

On the opening game of the season, broadcast on the [[TNT Network]] and featuring the debut of reigning two-time NBA MVP James in a Miami uniform alongside Chris Bosh, the game was the most-watched NBA contest ever on cable television. The game earned a 4.6 rating, delivering 7.4 million total viewers and 5.3 million households, beating the Chicago Bulls vs. Los Angeles Lakers on February 2, 1996.<ref>[http://sportifi.com/news/Heat-vs-Celtics-draws-record-ratings-139283.html Heat vs. Celtics draws record ratings <U+2013> Miami Heat News]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

The Heat lost the opening game 88<U+2013>80 and got off to a 9<U+2013>8 start due in large part to inconsistent play and injuries to key role players [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]] (thumb) and [[Udonis Haslem]] (foot). After losing four out of five games, including a Saturday night loss to the Dallas Mavericks on November 27, the team called a players-only meeting with the intent to get players to communicate with each other. Much of the speculation was that Spoelstra could lose his job and that Heat president [[Pat Riley]] would return as coach, especially after a well publicized incident when James "bumped" into Spoelstra during a timeout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/pat-riley-miami-heat-return-to-coaching-inevitable-112410 |title=Pat Riley's return to Miami Heat bench is inevitable <U+2013> NBA News &#124; FOX Sports on MSN |publisher=Msn.foxsports.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

After the players-only meeting, the team pulled together a 12-game win streak (10 of them by double-digits) and limited the opposition under 100 points in all those games. During the winning streak, James led the Heat to defeat his former team by scoring 38 points (tying a Heat record for points in a quarter with 24 in the third) in a game that drew nearly 7.1 million viewers and earned a 25.4 rating in Miami. [[ESPN 3D]] aired its first NBA game in the [[3D television|third dimension]] on December 17, 2010 when the Heat defeated the [[New York Knicks]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playerpress.com/articles/12728-lebron-calls-wade-worst-finisher-in-the-league |title=LeBron Calls Wade Worst Finisher in the League &#124; PlayerPress.com <U+2013> Sports Commentary, News, Rumors, Blogs, Photos, Videos by Pro Athletes and Fans |publisher=PlayerPress.com |date=February 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/12/tv-ratings-for-lebron-james-return-to-cleveland-soar-sky-high-top-eagles-texans-matchup.html |title=TV Ratings For LeBron James' Return to Cleveland Soar Sky-High, Top Eagles-Texans Matchup <U+2013> NBA |publisher=NESN.com |date=December 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Todd |url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/ESPN-Gets-3-Dimensional-With-LeBron-Tonight-112085994.html |title=ESPN Gets 3-Dimensional With LeBron Tonight |publisher=NBC Miami |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The Heat set a franchise record for wins in December with 15 and set an NBA record for consecutive road victories in a calendar month with 10 (including the Christmas Day match-up with the reigning two-time champs, [[Kobe Bryant]]'s [[Los Angeles Lakers]] which the team won 96<U+2013>80).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/558436-miami-heat-season-review-is-it-safe-to-call-the-heat-an-elite-team |title=Miami Heat Season Review: Is It Safe To Call the Heat an Elite Team? |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

During a postgame chat with [[Sun Sports]]' [[Jason Jackson]] on January 3, 2011, LeBron James joked "I see we sell out 99.1 percent on the road, so we call ourselves the Heatles off the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], so every time we take our show on the road we bring a great crowd", giving the Heat's famed trio the unofficial nickname.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/04/heat-players-nickname-themselves-the-heatles/ |title=Heat players nickname themselves "The Heatles" &#124; ProBasketballTalk |publisher=Probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110714160907/http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/04/heat-players-nickname-themselves-the-heatles/| archivedate= July 14, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On January 27, 2011, via fan voting, LeBron James (forward) and Dwyane Wade (guard) were selected to be starters for the Eastern Conference at the [[2011 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], becoming the second pair of teammates to be selected as All-Star starters in franchise history ([[Shaquille O'Neal]] and Dwyane Wade; [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006]] and [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|2007]]). A few days later, forward [[Chris Bosh]] was selected as a reserve, marking the first time in Heat history the team had sent three players to the All-Star game in a single season.

Like the 2005<U+2013>06 championship season, the Heat were criticized for being unable to beat the top-caliber teams of the NBA. This criticism though would just grow more and more as the regular season was beginning to wind down. Despite beating their division rival [[Orlando Magic]] two of three games, sweeping the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] 2<U+2013>0, and beating both the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] once, they lost to the defending Eastern Conference champion [[Boston Celtics]] three times, were swept by the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] who swept the season series and continued their regular season dominance against Miami for their 16th straight victory dating back to the 2004<U+2013>05 season. 

[[File:Dwyane Wade and LeBron James.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Teammates Dwyane Wade (3) and LeBron James (6) during a game, often referred to as the Dynamic Duo.]] In order to improve for the playoffs, the Heat signed guard [[Mike Bibby]], who agreed to forfeit the $6.2 million he was owed by the Washington Wizards for the next season so that he could become a free agent and sign a league minimum contract with a contender. In the process, the Heat released [[Carlos Arroyo]].  In Bibby's first game on March 3, the Heat were leading the Magic by 24 points in the third quarter before the Heat were outscored 40<U+2013>9 and lost 99<U+2013>96.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magic ride late 40<U+2013>9 run past Heat |date=March 3, 2011 |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=310303014 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}</ref> The following night against the Spurs, who held the NBA's best record (51<U+2013>11), the Heat lost 125<U+2013>95, their most lopsided loss of the year and their fourth loss in five games.<ref name="espn.go.com">{{cite news |title=Tony Parker sparks Spurs in return to starting lineup |date=March 4, 2011 |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=310304024 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}</ref> In their next game against the Bulls, the Heat had a 12-point lead in the first half, but ended up losing 87<U+2013>86 after two failed shots by James and Wade in the last 6 seconds of the game.

On March 27, Wade, James, and Bosh became the second trio in NBA history to have at least 30&nbsp;points and 10&nbsp;rebounds in the same non-overtime game (a home win against the [[Houston Rockets]]), matching [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Wayne Embry]] and [[Jack Twyman]] for the [[Cincinnati Royals]] in a loss to the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] on February 2, 1961. Additionally, it was the first time that a team's trio recorded 20&nbsp;points and 10&nbsp;rebounds in consecutive games since [[Sidney Wicks]], [[Lloyd Neal]] and [[John Johnson (basketball)|John Johnson]] accomplished the feat with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in March 1975. It was also the first time in Heat franchise history that three players scored 30&nbsp;points in the same game.<ref>{{cite web|author=9:19 |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/5608/heats-big-three-make-history |title=Heat's Big Three make history <U+2013> Heat Index Blog |publisher=ESPN |date=February 2, 1961 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

The 2011 Heat finished with a 58<U+2013>24 record, third best in team history and a second overall seed, behind the Chicago Bulls, who had the NBA's best record. Additionally, the Heat finished 5th in the NBA in attendance with 810,930 behind Mavericks, Cavaliers, Trail Blazers, and Bulls in that order (100.9% capacity). The Heat faced the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and eliminated them in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Heat defeated their rival [[Boston Celtics]] in five games, winning a dramatic overtime Game 4 in Boston and a come-from-behind Game 5 victory at home to finish the series.  In the [[Eastern Conference Finals]], the Heat faced the Chicago Bulls. After being blown out by 21 points by the Bulls in Game 1, the Heat took home-court by defeating Chicago in Game 2, and winning their home Games 3 and 4, the latter of which came in overtime. In Game 5 in Chicago, the Heat made a historic comeback; after being down 77<U+2013>65 with 3:14 left, the Heat went on an 18<U+2013>3 run to win, 83<U+2013>80, capped by a key four-point play from Dwyane Wade and clutch shooting from LeBron James.<ref>{{cite web|author=8:30&nbsp;pm ET, May 26, 2011United Center, Chicago, IL |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=310526004&period=4 |title=Miami Heat vs. Chicago Bulls <U+2013> Play By Play <U+2013> May 26, 2011 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The Heat advanced to the [[2011 NBA Finals]] to face the Dallas Mavericks, who had defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Oklahoma City Thunder. The series was a rematch of the 2006 NBA Finals, in which Dallas won the first two games and then lost four straight to Miami. The Heat won Game 1 in Miami, 92<U+2013>84, but in Game 2, the Heat were leading the Mavericks by 15 points with 6:20 left in the fourth quarter before the Heat were outscored 22<U+2013>5 and lost, 95<U+2013>93. The Heat won Game 3 in Dallas 88<U+2013>86 with the game-winning basket scored by Chris Bosh. The Mavericks won Game 4, 86<U+2013>83, holding LeBron James to a career playoff-low 8 points. The Mavericks won Game 5 and took a 3<U+2013>2 series lead with a 112<U+2013>103 victory. That was the first time since March 6 that the Heat had lost two consecutive games, including the regular season, playoffs, and the NBA Finals. In Game 6, Dallas defeated Miami, 105<U+2013>95, to win the 2011 NBA Finals in six games, 4<U+2013>2. James's 17.8 points per game in the Finals was the largest drop off in points from a regular season to an NBA Finals (down 8.9 points from 26.7) in NBA history.<ref>[http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/06/hot_corner_with_nba_title_at_s.html Hot Corner: With NBA title at stake, LeBron James was a big flop | al.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He only averaged three points in the fourth quarters in the series, and he received the brunt of the criticism for the team's loss to Dallas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kevin Durant, Thunder pull away from Heat, win Game 1|date=June 12, 2012|work=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=320612025|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68OZJcouX|deadurl=no|archivedate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>

==Season in review==
The Miami Heat entered NBA free agency in 2010 with nearly $46 million in [[salary cap]] space, with the ability to re-sign free agent Dwyane Wade, and add two of the [[NBA]]'s top players, [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]]. According to [[Fox Sports Radio]]'s [[Stephen A. Smith]], speaking on his show just days after the [[NBA Draft]], the Heat were "highly likely" to sign all three players.<ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/> The [[New Jersey Nets]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Dallas Mavericks]] and Miami Heat were in negotiations to sign LeBron James. On July 7, 2010, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh agreed to terms with the Miami Heat. Then on July 8, 2010, James held an hour-long special to announce his decision on ESPN to commit to playing with the Heat.<ref name="tvguide.com"/> Later that evening, the Heat announced the trade of [[Michael Beasley]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for a pair of second-round picks and cash considerations.<ref name="google.com"/>  The three are called the SuperFriends by sportswriters and commentators for ESPN, because all three were taken in the top five of the 2003 NBA Draft and because they have become good friends over the years.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/ ESPN: The Worldwide Leader In Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On July 8, 2010, it became official that NBA players and gold medal-winning [[United States national men's basketball team|Beijing Olympic teammates]] James, Wade, and Bosh would be joining the Heat. The Heat completed sign-and-trade deals, sending a total of four future first-round and two second-round picks to the Cavaliers and Raptors for James and Bosh (both signing six-year, $110.1 million contracts). Wade re-signed with the Heat for $107.59 million for six years. All three have early-termination clauses in their contracts, allowing them to become free agents again in four years, in the summer of 2014. The final year on all three deals, for 2015<U+2013>16, is a player option.<ref name="kansascity.com"/><ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5368003 Sources: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh sign with Miami Heat for $15M less each <U+2013> ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The three made their debut at the 2010 Summer Heat Welcome Party at the [[American Airlines Arena]] on July 9, where they were introduced as ''The Three Kings'' by Heat play-by-play announcer and event co-host [[Eric Reid]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Howard Beck of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the national fan reaction to the party: "Everyone saw something: greatness, arrogance, self-indulgence, boldness, cowardice, pride, friendship, collusion, joy, cynicism, heroes, mercenaries."<ref name="Beck B-12"/>

By taking less than maximum salaries, Wade, James and Bosh opened the door for the Heat to further continue its roster makeover with the re-signing of [[Udonis Haslem]] and signing of veteran swingman and teammate of Haslem at the [[University of Florida]], [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]], for dual five-year deals worth a combined $45 million.<ref>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/sfl-miami-heat-mike-miller-s071520,0,2362927.story Miami Heat finally completes Mike Miller signing, more to follow <U+2013> ''Sun Sentinel''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In order to fill the voids at forward and center, the Heat signed James's former teammate in Cleveland, [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]], to a two-year deal for the veteran's minimum at $2.8 million, re-signed [[Joel Anthony]], and signed power forward [[Juwan Howard]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/13/1728903/zydrunas-ilgauskas-follow-lebron.html Zydrunas Ilgauskas follows LeBron James to Miami Heat <U+2013> Miami Heat <U+2013> MiamiHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the guard department, the Miami Heat re-signed guard [[Carlos Arroyo]] and signed former Celtics player [[Eddie House]] to a two-year contract for the veteran's minimum of $2.8 million.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=Aj57vuxe5KqcmBaAxZ4J6285nYcB?slug=aw-eddiehouse072910 House returns to Heat as latest addition <U+2013> NBA <U+2013> Yahoo! Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rookies [[Dexter Pittman]] and [[Da'Sean Butler]], along with [[NBA Summer League]] standouts [[Patrick Beverley]] and [[Kenny Hasbrouck]], also signed contracts.

The Miami Heat began the regular season with much hype going into their first game against the Eastern Conference Champs, the Boston Celtics. Many{{Who|date=February 2012}} considered the Miami Heat as the team to break the single-season record of 72 regular season victories set by the [[Chicago Bulls]].<ref name="Araton B11"/> The opening game of the season, broadcast on the [[TNT Network]] and featuring the debut of reigning two-time NBA MVP James in a Miami uniform alongside Chris Bosh, was the most-watched NBA contest ever on cable television. The game earned a 4.6 rating, delivering 7.4 million total viewers and 5.3 million households, beating the Chicago Bulls vs. Los Angeles Lakers on February 2, 1996.<ref>[http://sportifi.com/news/Heat-vs-Celtics-draws-record-ratings-139283.html Heat vs. Celtics draws record ratings <U+2013> Miami Heat News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Heat lost the opening game 88<U+2013>80 and got off to a 9<U+2013>8 start due in large part to inconsistent play and injuries of key role players [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]] (thumb) and [[Udonis Haslem]] (foot). After losing four out of five games, including a Saturday night loss to the Dallas Mavericks on November 27, the team called a players-only meeting with the intent to get players to communicate with each other. Much of the speculation was that Spoelstra could lose his job and that Heat president [[Pat Riley]] would return as coach, especially after a well publicized incident when James "bumped" into Spoelstra during a timeout.<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/pat-riley-miami-heat-return-to-coaching-inevitable-112410 Pat Riley's return to Miami Heat bench is inevitable <U+2013> NBA News | FOX Sports on MSN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After the players-only meeting, the team pulled together a 12-game win streak (10 of them by double-digits) and limited the opposition under 100 points in all those games. During the winning streak, James led the Heat in defeating his former team by scoring 38 points (tying a Heat record for points in a quarter with 24 in the third) in a game that drew nearly 7.1 million viewers and earned a 25.4 rating in Miami. [[ESPN 3D]] aired its first NBA game in the [[3D television|third dimension]] on December 17, 2010 when the Heat defeated the [[New York Knicks]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].,<ref>[http://www.playerpress.com/articles/12728-lebron-calls-wade-worst-finisher-in-the-league LeBron Calls Wade Worst Finisher in the League | PlayerPress.com <U+2013> Sports Commentary, News, Rumors, Blogs, Photos, Videos by Pro Athletes and Fans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nesn.com/2010/12/tv-ratings-for-lebron-james-return-to-cleveland-soar-sky-high-top-eagles-texans-matchup.html TV Ratings For LeBron James' Return to Cleveland Soar Sky-High, Top Eagles-Texans Matchup <U+2013> NBA <U+2013> NESN.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/ESPN-Gets-3-Dimensional-With-LeBron-Tonight-112085994.html ESPN Gets 3-Dimensional With LeBron Tonight | NBC Miami<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Heat set a franchise record for wins in December with 15 and set an NBA record for consecutive road victories in a calendar month with 10 (including the Christmas Day match-up with the reigning two-time champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]], which the team won 96<U+2013>80).<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/558436-miami-heat-season-review-is-it-safe-to-call-the-heat-an-elite-team Miami Heat Season Review: Is It Safe To Call the Heat an Elite Team? | Bleacher Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During a post-game chat with [[Sun Sports]]' [[Jason Jackson]] on January 3, 2011, LeBron James joked "I see we sell out 99.1 percent on the road, so we call ourselves the Heatles off the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], so every time we take our show on the road we bring a great crowd", giving the Heat's trio the unofficial nickname.<ref>[http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/04/heat-players-nickname-themselves-the-heatles/ Heat players nickname themselves <U+201C>The Heatles<U+201D> | ProBasketballTalk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On January 27, 2011, via fan voting, James (forward) and Wade (guard) were selected to be starters for the Eastern Conference at the [[2011 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], becoming the second pair of teammates to be selected as All-Star starters in franchise history ([[Shaquille O'Neal]] and Dwyane Wade; [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006]] and [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|2007]]). A few days later, forward Chris Bosh was selected as a reserve, marking the first time in Heat history the team had sent three players to the All-Star game in a single season.

Like the 2005<U+2013>06 championship season, the Heat were criticized, for being unable to beat the top-caliber teams of the NBA. This criticism though would just grow more and more as the regular season was beginning to wind down. Despite beating their division rival [[Orlando Magic]] two of three games, sweeping the Lakers 2<U+2013>0, and beating both the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] once, they had lost to the defending Eastern Conference champion [[Boston Celtics]] three times, swept by the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] who swept the season series and continued their regular season dominance against Miami for their 16th straight victory dating back to the 2004<U+2013>05 season. 

In order to improve for the playoffs, the Heat signed guard [[Mike Bibby]], who agreed to forfeit the $6.2 million he was owed by the Washington Wizards for the next season so that he could become a free agent and sign a league-minimum contract with a contender. In the process, the Heat released [[Carlos Arroyo]].  In Bibby's first game on March 3, the Heat were leading the Magic by 24 points in the third quarter before the Heat were outscored 40<U+2013>9 and lost 99<U+2013>96.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magic ride late 40<U+2013>9 run past Heat |date=March 3, 2011 |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=310303014 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}</ref> The following night against the Spurs, who held the NBA's best record (51<U+2013>11), the Heat lost 125<U+2013>95, their most lopsided loss of the year and their fourth loss in five games.<ref name="espn.go.com"/> In their next game against the Bulls, the Heat had a 12-point lead in the first half, but they ended up losing 87<U+2013>86 after two failed shots by James and Wade in the last 6 seconds of the game. It was the Heat's 12th and 13th consecutive missed shots with a chance to tie or lead a game in the final 10 seconds of regulation or overtime. James had missed four in the four-game losing streak. It was the Heat's fourth straight loss, and the fourth time since February 24 they had lost after a double-digit lead.<ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/> The Heat were 2<U+2013>5 since the All-Star break, 5<U+2013>13 in games decided by five or fewer points and 14<U+2013>18 against teams with winning records.<ref name="Wallace"/> After the game, there were reports of players crying in the locker room afterwards.<ref name="sun-sentinel.com"/> On March 10, the Heat beat the Lakers, 94<U+2013>88, and ended their five-game losing streak while also ending the Lakers' eight-game winning streak.<ref name="http"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Bresnahan |first=Mike |title=Lakers give one away against the Heat, 94<U+2013>88 |date=March 10, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-sp-lakers-heat-20110311,0,6781293,full.story |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x72Y8HtT |archivedate=March 11, 2011}}</ref>

On March 27, Wade, James, and Bosh became the second trio in NBA history to have at least 30&nbsp;points and 10&nbsp;rebounds in the same non-overtime game (a home win against the [[Houston Rockets]]), matching [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Wayne Embry]] and [[Jack Twyman]] for the [[Cincinnati Royals]] in a loss to the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] on February 2, 1961. Additionally, it was the first time that a team's trio recorded 20&nbsp;points and 10&nbsp;rebounds in consecutive games since [[Sidney Wicks]], [[Lloyd Neal]] and [[John Johnson (basketball)|John Johnson]] accomplished the feat with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in March 1975. It was also the first time in Heat franchise history that three players scored 30&nbsp;points in the same game.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/5608/heats-big-three-make-history Heat's Big Three make history <U+2013> Heat Index Blog <U+2013> ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The 2011 Heat finished with a 58<U+2013>24 record, third best in team history and a second overall seed, behind the Chicago Bulls, who had the NBA's best record. Additionally, the Heat finished 5th in the NBA in attendance with 810,930, behind the Mavericks, Cavaliers, Trail Blazers, and Bulls in that order (100.9% capacity). The Heat faced the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and eliminated them in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Heat defeated their rival [[Boston Celtics]] in five games, winning a dramatic overtime Game 4 in Boston and a come-from-behind Game 5 victory at home to finish the series.  In the [[Eastern Conference Finals]], the Heat faced the [[Chicago Bulls]]. After being blown out by 21 points by the Bulls in Game 1, the Heat took home-court by defeating Chicago in Game 2, and winning their home Games 3 and 4, the latter of which came in overtime. In Game 5 in Chicago, the Miami Heat made a historic comeback; after being down 77<U+2013>65 with 3:14 left, the Heat went on an 18<U+2013>3 run to win, 83<U+2013>80, capped by a key four-point play from Wade and clutch shooting from James.<ref>http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=310526004&period=4</ref> The Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the Dallas Mavericks, who had defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Oklahoma City Thunder. This series was a rematch of the 2006 NBA Finals, in which Dallas won the first two games and then lost four straight to Miami. The Heat won Game 1 in Miami, 92<U+2013>84, but in Game 2, the Heat were leading the Mavericks by 15 points with 6:20 left in the fourth quarter before the Heat were outscored 22<U+2013>5 and lost, 95<U+2013>93. Miami won Game 3 in Dallas 88<U+2013>86 with the game-winning basket scored by Chris Bosh. They would lose to the Mavericks in six games falling just short of capturing their 2nd NBA Championship. Dwyane Wade averaged 26.5 points and 7.0 rebounds, the highest scorer on the team, while LeBron James averaged 17.8 points, and 7.1 rebounds which was the largest drop off in points from a regular season to an NBA Finals in NBA history.<ref>http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/06/hot_corner_with_nba_title_at_s.html</ref>
