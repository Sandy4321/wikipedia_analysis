{{nihongo|'''''Warning from Space''''' or '''''Mysterious Satellite'''''|<U+5B87><U+5B99><U+4EBA><U+6771><U+4EAC><U+306B><U+73FE><U+308F><U+308B>|Uch<U+016B>jin Tokyo ni arawaru|Spacemen Appear in Tokyo}} is a [[Japanese science fiction]] [[tokusatsu]] [[Cinema of Japan|film]] released in January&nbsp;1956 by [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]], and was the first [[Japan]]ese [[science fiction film]] to be produced in color. In the film's plot, [[starfish]]-like [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] disguised as humans travel to Earth to warn of the imminent collision of a [[rogue planet]] and Earth. As the planet rapidly accelerates toward Earth, a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear device]] is created at the last minute and destroys the approaching world.

The film, directed by [[Koji Shima]], was one of many early Japanese monster films quickly produced after the success of [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' in 1954. The film was loosely based on a novel by Gentaro Nakajima. After release, the film was met with negative reviews, with critics calling it "bizarre" and accusing it of using [[science fiction]] [[clich<U+00E9>]]s. ''Warning from Space'' influenced many other Japanese science fiction films, such as ''[[Gorath]]''. The film, along with other 1950s science fiction films, influenced director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who would later direct ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.

==Plot==
A small ship travels to a rotating [[space station]]. Aboard the station, a group of [[starfish]]-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, [[flying saucer]]s are spotted over the skies of [[Tokyo]], baffling scientists. A [[journalist]] tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies that there is not enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an [[observatory]], Professor Isobe spots an [[unidentified flying object|object]] in his [[telescope]] apparently releasing smaller objects.

Isobe discusses his findings with Kumara and a physician, Dr. Matsuda, who takes photographs of the object, though they turn out to be unclear. But they can still deduce the object has a high energy output. Meanwhile, the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s have been unsuccessfully attempting to contact humans. They appear in lakes and rivers, frightening fishermen and sailors. One of the aliens manages to get a photo of Hikari Aozora, a famous Japanese entertainer. They plan to have one of the aliens mutate to look like Aozora. Back aboard the space station, one of the Pairan leaders, Ginko, volunteers to slowly mutate into the human form.

[[File:Warning from Space Pairans.jpg|left|thumb|The asteridian Pairans in discussion aboard the space station.]]
On Earth, Toru, Isobe's son, discovers the disguised alien floating in the water. After her rescue, she exhibits [[superhuman]] characteristics such as jumping ten feet and [[Teleportation|materializing]] in different places. Soon, she disrupts Dr. Matsuda's work on a [[weapon of mass destruction|nuclear device]], explaining she understands the complex equations he was writing and warning against the [[nuclear winter|effects]] of a device. Shortly afterwards, as the team of scientists discuss her abnormal traits, Ginko reveals her true identity, explaining she is from Paira, a world on the same [[orbit]] as Earth but on the [[Counter-Earth|opposite side]] of the [[Sun]]. She then announces her mission, to warn Earth of an [[impact event|imminent collision]] of a [[rogue planet]], which is dubbed "Planet R" by the media. They appeal to the World Congress about the situation, but are ejected. Only after they prove evidence of Planet R and its rapid [[gravitational acceleration|acceleration]] does the World Congress launch its [[nuclear weapon]]s, which are ineffective.

In the meantime, spies have abducted Matsuda and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device. Matsuda does not comply and is eventually left tied to a chair in a remote building. As the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] heats up because of the approaching Planet R, Ginko again arrives to learn why it hasn't been destroyed yet. Using Pairan technology they rescue Matsuda and the formula for the device. They watch as the device is fired at Planet R destroying it. Earth's atmosphere immediately begins to cool, saving humanity.

In his biography of [[Stanley Kubrick]], author [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]] traces Kubrick's interest in science fiction films, which led to his ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', to the Japanese [[Kaiju|kaiju eiga]] films of the 1950s, including ''Warning from Space'', with its "nameless two-metre-tall black starfish with a single central eye, who walk ''[[en pointe]]'' like ballet dancers."<ref name="stan" /> Baxter notes that despite their "clumsy model sequences, the films were often well-photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well-designed and well-lit sets."<ref name="stan" />
