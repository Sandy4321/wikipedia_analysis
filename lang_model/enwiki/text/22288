==History==
[[Image:WestAusMap-doton-Narrogin.png|right|Location of Narrogin, Western Australia]]

Narrogin is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] name, having been first recorded as "Narroging" for a pool in this area in 1869. The meaning of the name is uncertain, various sources recording it as "bat camp", "plenty of everything" or derived from "gnargagin" which means "place of water".<ref>{{LandInfo WA|c|N|2007-01-17}}</ref>

The first Europeans into the Narrogin area were Hillman and his survey party who surveyed the track between Perth and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1835. They passed only 10 km west of the present site of Narrogin. In time they were followed by the occasional shepherd who drove his [[sheep]] into the area seeking good pastures.

The area was first settled in the 1860s and 1870s when pastoralists moved and settled in isolated outposts. The population was so scattered that there was no incentive in establishing a town.

The arrival of the [[Great Southern Railway (Western Australia)|Great Southern Railway]] in July 1889 initiated the first hint of a town. The railway company was in search of good reliable watering points along the route from Perth to Albany. The company which had won the railway contract, the WA Land Company, duly purchased Narrogin pool and it was around this pool that the town developed.

Narrogin was officially declared a town in June 1897 and it was gazetted as a municipality on [[13 April]] [[1906]]. The early years of settlement were hard with farmers relying on [[Santalum spicatum|sandalwood]] cutting and the bark from mallet trees (it was used as a tanning agent) to compensate for poor returns from [[wheat]] and sheep.

Narrogin remained a major rail centre until the late 1970s when competition from road transport saw a reduction in the railways workforce from some 280 people to fewer than a dozen in 1995.

==Narrogin Today==
Narrogin's previous role as a major railway junction has acted as an attractor for agricultural service industries as well as government departments and agencies. The town has accumulated significant public infrastructure - mainly in the health and education areas. This infrastructure serves as the base for the modern regional centre that Narrogin has become today. Unlike many other rural regional centres throughout Australia, Narrogin is enjoying a strong and constant growth of approximately 2% per year, though at the expense of surrounding areas.<ref>[http://www.narrogin.wa.gov.au/ Narrogin Shire Council]</ref>

==Notable residents==
[[Barry Cable]], the star [[Perth Football Club|Perth]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] [[Australian Football League|AFL]] player came from Narrogin.

It is also the birthplace of field hockey player [[Bevan George]], who won the gold medal with the Australian Men's Team at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]. Also born in Narrogin is [[Brian Glencross]], a retired Australian [[field hockey]] player and coach of the [[Hockeyroos|Australian Women's Team]], Australian cricketers [[Brad Hogg]] and [[Shaun Marsh]], and Australian Foreign Minister, [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]].

[[Albert Facey]], author of [[A Fortunate Life]], lived a period of his life in Narrogin.
