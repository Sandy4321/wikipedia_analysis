'''''Es ist das Heil uns kommen her''''' (originally: ''Es ist das heyl vns kommen her'', English: '''''Salvation now has come for all''''' or more literally: It is our salvation come here to us) is a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] hymn in 14 stanzas by [[Paul Speratus]]. It was first published as one of eight songs in 1524 in the [[first Lutheran hymnal]], the Achtliederbuch,<ref name=julian>{{cite book|last=Julian|first=John|title=A dictionary of hymnology: setting forth the origin and history of Christian|year=1892|publisher=C.

==Origins==
According to tradition, Speratus wrote this hymn while he was in prison in [[Olomouc]], condemned for his evangelical beliefs to death by fire. Only by the intercession of friends was he released, on condition that he leave Moravia.<ref name=Tschackert>{{cite book|last=Tschackert|first=Paul|title=Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Volume 35|year=1895|publisher=Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|pages=123<U+2013>135|url=http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Speratus,_Paul|language=German|quote=...only through the intercession of respected aristocrats was he rescued from death by fire, to which he had been condemned ...  in this prison he composed the Protestant hymn "There is salvation come forth to us."}}nur durch die F<U+00FC>rbitte angesehener Magnaten vor dem Feuertode, zu dem er verurtheilt war, gerettet...er in dieser Haft das evangelische Glaubenslied <U+201E>Es ist das Heil uns kommen her<U+201C> gedichtet hat</ref>

The text by Speratus is based on Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=3|verse=28}}.<ref>"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." ''Rom.'' 3:28 [[King James Version|KJV]]</ref><ref name=hymnary>{{cite web|title=People " Speratus, Paulus, 1484-1554 " Texts|url=http://www.hymnary.org/person/Speratus_P|publisher=Calvin College|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>  and expresses Luther's teaching about [[salvation]]. According to Scott Hendrix, "It not only emphasizes justification by faith alone but it also underlines the vitality of that faith manifested in service to others.<ref name=hendrix182>{{cite book|last=Hendrix|first=Scott H.|title=Early Protestant Spirituality|year=2009|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=0-8091-4211-2|pages=182<U+2013>5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=avrRiKpF_jgC}}</ref> A modern English version of the hymn's first stanza, which appears on the back cover of Hendrix's book ''Early Protestant Spirituality'', is as follows:
::Salvation unto us has come
:::by God's free grace and favor;
::Good works cannot avert our doom,
:::they help and save us never.
::Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone,
::who did for all the world atone,
:::He is our mediator.

Speratus set his words to the tune of an Easter chorale from the 15th century, ''Freu dich, du werte Christenheit''.<ref name="tune">{{cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/CM/Es-ist-das-Heil.htm |title=Chorale Melodies used in Bach's Vocal Works / Es ist das Heil uns kommen her |publisher=bach-cantatas.com |year=2005 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

==Influence==
The story of Luther's being moved to tears when he first heard this hymn, from a beggar outside his window in Wittenburg, has been retold by many authors.<ref name=beggarstory>{{cite book|last=d'Aubign<U+00E9>|first=Jean Henri Merle|title=History of the Reformation in the sixteenth century|year=1846|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zpoHAAAAQAAJ|quote=The Reformer, who had never till then heard that Christian hymn, listened with delight and astonishment; and what further angmented these feelings, was the foreign accent of the person who sang. "Again! again!" he exclaimed when the beggar had finished. He then asked him where the hymn could have come from; the tears rushed from his eyes when the poor man told him that it was from the shores of the Baltic that a shout of deliverance was resounding as far as Wittenberg; and then, clasping his hands, he thanked God with a joyful heart.}}</ref><ref name=lamb>{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=Robert|title=Free thoughts on many subjects|year=1866|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|pages=139<U+2013>140|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PjECAAAAQAAJ|quote=It is related of him by Seckendorf, the historian of the Reformation, that, as he was one day sitting in his study at Wittenberg; he was affected to tears by hearing a beggar singing in the streets the hymn of Paul Speratus, 'Es ist das Heil uns kommen her...", and that he at once felt how powerful an instrument he had in such compositions set to good music for the propagation of his startling doctrines.}}</ref><ref name=winkworth>{{cite book|last=Winkworth|first=Catherine|title=Christian Singers of Germany|year=1884|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/winkworth/singers.reforma2.html|accessdate=29 July 2011|pages=123<U+2013>4|quote=...sounds to us like a bit out of the Augsburg Confession done into rhyme. But in his own day it was as popular as Luther's hymns, and Luther himself is said to have given his last coin to a Prussian beggar from whom he heard it for the first time.}}</ref>

The [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition of the Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], lists "Salvation now has come for all" as one of the Lutheran hymns "which at the time produced the greatest effect, and are still best remembered."<ref name=encbrit11>{{cite book|title=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 14|year=1910|pages=188|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6_ctAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> It has been translated into English by many authors, including [[Miles Coverdale]] ("Now is our health come from above," 1539), [[Henry Mills (translator)|Henry Mills]] ("Our whole salvation doth depend On God's free grace and Spirit," 1845), and [[Catherine Winkworth]] ("Salvation hath come down to us," 1869).<ref name=hymnary/>

==Musical settings==
The hymn, focused on essential Lutheran teaching, was frequently set for organ and for voices.

===Organ settings===
[[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]] composed ''Prelude and Chorale Variations'' (two variations). [[Samuel Scheidt]] composed four parts as No. 46 of ''Das G<U+00F6>rlitzer Tabulaturbuch'' (1650). [[Matthias Weckmann]] wrote ''Chorale Variations''. [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] composed a [[chorale prelude]], BuxWV 186, in [[C major]]. Chorale Prelude were further composed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow]] and [[Johann Gottfried Walther]] (LV 84).<ref name="tune" />

Between 1708 and 1714, while [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was court organist at the ducal court in [[Weimar]], he compiled chorale preludes for the liturgical year in his [[Orgelb<U+00FC>chlein]] and included it as a [[catechism]] hymn, BWV 638. [[Georg Friedrich Kauffmann]] published a Chorale Prelude in Leipzig in 1733. [[Johann Ludwig Krebs]] also wrote a Chorale Prelude. In 1902 Max Reger included the chorale in his ''Fifty-two Chorale Preludes'', Op. 67, in 1914 again in his Op. 135a.<ref name="tune" />

===Choral settings===
[[Arnold von Bruck]] composed a setting for four voices, published in 1544. [[Hans Leo Hassler]] wrote a four-part setting, [[Johann Hermann Schein]] set it twice with basso continuo, once for two sopranos (1618), once for four parts (1627). [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] composed in 1719 a sacred [[cantata]] on a text by [[Erdmann Neumeister]] ''Es ist das Heil uns kommen her''.<ref name="tune" />

Bach used the stanzas 11 and 12 in several of his [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s in 1716, 1723 and 1724. Between 1732 and 1735, he used twelve stanzas as the base for his [[chorale cantata]] of the ''[[Es ist das Heil uns kommen her, BWV 9|same name, BWV 9]]''. [[Johannes Brahms]] composed it in 1860 as one of two [[motet]]s for a five-part mixed chorus [[a cappella]], Op. 29, a four-part chorale followed by an "elaborate fugal variation on the chorale melody".<ref name="tune" />
