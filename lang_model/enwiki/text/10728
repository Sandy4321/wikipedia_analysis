'''New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''' is a movie released after [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]] by ''On Jen Hui'' as a remake of the novel created by [[Wang Du Lu]]. The movie is in a similar vein to the version produced by [[Ang Lee]]. 

The movie is a compilation of a [[television series]] that ran previously and combines the episodes into a full length film. Like the television series, the show was filmed on direct video but was free of interlacing or compression errors despite the low budget required to create scenes.

The movie was released nearly four years after the production of Ang Lee's adaptation, and due to its low production status never gained a high market share. Its acting and poor quality also prompted sites like the [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] to neglect a review of the movie and its general price being in [[bargain bin]] status. It was generally received as poor or mediocre by reviewers and critics.

Additionally, the movie lacked any significant stars in the acting roles, such as [[Chow Yun Fat]] for the role of ''Li Mu Bai'' and [[Michelle Yeoh]] for ''Yu Shu Lien''

The DVD was released in a two CD-set which included bonus and original footage and a soundtrack.

== Plot ==
'''New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''' is generally similar to the telling of [[Wang Du Lu]] and somewhat similar to the earlier released movie by [[Ang Lee]], but it omits and changes key points recognized by viewers of the first movies. It also explains the story of the novel more deliberatively due to the increased run timeframe.

Yuk Jiao Lung takes up kung fu with the former rebel master Jade Fox as a way to escape an undesirable arranged marriage, while simultaneously, sword master Li Mu Bai falls in love with Yu Shu Lien when she arrives to avenge the murder of her parents. When the Green Destiny Sword turns up stolen, and the notorious female thief Jade Fox arrives to finish the ordeal, the four become enmeshed in a tangle of adventure, vengeance, and betrayal.

== Reception ==
Unlike ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', which was accepted by most international consumers and became a broad success save for its Asian origins, '''New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''' was considered very low-budget and was criticized for its lack of actors and poor acting.

Many English reviewers also noted it was poor in comparison to the original, and that its similarities were few and far between, such as the fight scenes being animated strangely and its direct mode of film from its television series being sub-par.

However, some have endorsed its release and support its longer storyline, detailed costumes, and general adherence to the original source material.
