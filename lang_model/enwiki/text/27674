The '''SS ''Canadiana''''' was a [[passenger ferry]] that primarily operated between [[Buffalo, New York]] and the [[Crystal Beach, Ontario #History|Crystal Beach Amusement Park]] at [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada]] from 1910 to 1956.<ref name="heritage">{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Canadiana Revisited| work =| publisher = WNY Heritage Press| date = 2006| url = http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2006/canadiana_revisited/canadiana_revisited.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =18 July 2009 }}</ref> 

After being sold in 1956 the ''Canadiana'' changed owners numerous times and by 1983 she was berthed in [[Ohio]] needing major restoration.<ref name="heritage" /> A nonprofit group, the "Friends of the Canadiana",  brought the ship back to Buffalo in 1984 with a hope of restoring her to service.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Mission Statement| work = The Canadiana - The Organization - Directions and Goals.| publisher = The S.

==Construction==

The ''Canadiana'' was built at the Buffalo Dry Dock on Ganson Street in 1910 and was the last passenger vessel to be built in Buffalo.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Story of the S.S. Canadiana| work =| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.itcanada.com/~cessna/Story.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =17 July 2009 }}</ref>
She was designed by marine architect [[Frank E. Kirby]] who would go on later to design the largest [[side wheel]] excursion ships built for the [[Great Lakes]], the [[USS Sable (IX-81)|''Greater Buffalo'']] and the ''Greater Detroit''.<ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Greater Buffalo & The U.S.S.

The completed ship was {{convert|215|ft|m}} long and a {{convert|54|ft|m}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] amidships.<ref name="heritage" /> She was powered by one [[Steam Engine #Multiple expansion engines|coal fired triple-expansion]] steam engine that produced 1,446 [[horsepower #Indicated horsepower|horsepower]] and a single propeller provided propulsion.<ref name="heritage" /> The ''Canadiana'' also had a cutout in the main deck to allow passengers to view the "workings" of the engine. <ref name="heritage" />

The ''Canadiana'' was fitted with brass railings, red mahogany trim from [[Honduras]] and bevelled mirrors. She was designed to be a premier vessel designed not only for transportation but also for pleasure.<ref>{{cite book| last = Rossi| first = Erno| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Crystal Beach| publisher = Seventy Seven Publishing| date =| location =| pages = 140, 141| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5QE3lHEuOmsC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=ss+canadiana&source=bl&ots=PbPUGye1MB&sig=i41JTEZzeMRibHnzdlbiNZvOaJg&hl=en&ei=TwdhSvfOCJGHlAfvnsicDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7| doi =| id = 
| isbn = }}</ref>  Originally intended to carry 3500 passengers, it was decided by the [[United States Coast Guard]] that 1800 was a safer number.  With the reduction in passenger capacity, the ship's owners found room to construct the largest dance floor of any steamer ever placed on the [[Great Lakes]]. <ref>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =About the S.S.

==History==

After her completion, the ''Canadiana'' joined her sister ship, the ''Americanna'', which had been built in 1908.<ref name="heritage" /> Both ships would make round trip passages between Buffalo and Crystal Beach until the ''Americanna'' was sold in 1929.<ref name="heritage" /> Although the ''Canadiana'' was popularly known as "The Crystal Beach Boat", she would occasionally make journeys to other destinations including [[Port Colborne, Ontario]]. Nevertheless, Crystal Beach remained its primary destination. 

After the completion of the [[Peace Bridge]] in 1927, which allowed automobile traffic between Buffalo and Crystal Beach, some of the popularity of the ''Canadiana'' was lost.<ref name="heritage" /> Ticket prices were kept low in order to attract the necessary patrons to made the ship profitable. <ref name="heritage" /> During World War II, the ''Canadiana'' saw an increase in business. This was due, in part, to gas rationing because of the war.<ref name="Rossi">{{cite book| last = Rossi| first = Erno| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Crystal Beach| publisher = Seventy Seven Publishing| date =| location =| pages = 141, 142| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5QE3lHEuOmsC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=ss+canadiana&source=bl&ots=PbPUGye1MB&sig=i41JTEZzeMRibHnzdlbiNZvOaJg&hl=en&ei=TwdhSvfOCJGHlAfvnsicDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7| doi =| id =| isbn = }}</ref> A British pilot, who was flying with the Canadian Air Force, was killed when he lost control of his aircraft while "buzzing" the ''Canadiana'' during World War II as well.<ref name="Rossi" />

In its last year of service an "incident" happened onboard the ''Canadiana''. While returning from Crystal Beach to Buffalo on the evening of May 30, 1956, violence erupted between several youths. The group of belligerents, made up of  whites and African-Americans, left little doubt that [[racism]] was a factor in the incident.<ref>{{cite news  | title = FBI Studies Teen Riot on Excursion | pages = 29 | publisher = The Charleston Gazette | date = 1956-06-01 | accessdate = 2008-06-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Rossi| first = Erno| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Crystal Beach| publisher = Seventy Seven Publishing| date =| location =| pages = 144, 145| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5QE3lHEuOmsC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=ss+canadiana&source=bl&ots=PbPUGye1MB&sig=i41JTEZzeMRibHnzdlbiNZvOaJg&hl=en&ei=TwdhSvfOCJGHlAfvnsicDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7| doi =| id = 
| isbn = }}</ref> This incident, along with shrinking revenues, made continued operation of the ship uneconomical. The 1956 season proved to be the last for the ''Canadiana'' and she was sold.

After being sold, the ''Canadiana'' was involved in an accident on July 30, 1958. While on her normal excursion trip traveling upstream on the [[Maumee River]] from her berth in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bob-Lo Island]], the ''Canadiana'' was struck  by a railroad [[swing bridge]] and damaged.<ref>{{cite court|litigants = Philip E.

===Restoration efforts===

The group "Friends of the Canadiana" was formed in 1983 to try to save the ship. She was purchased by the group and towed back to Buffalo during September 1984.<ref name="historical" /> In July 1988, after being stripped down for restoration, the ''Canadiana'' was towed to the Marsh Engineering Dock at Port Colborne, Ontario for drydocking.<ref name="historical" /> When restoration plans were not realized the remaining hull of the ''Canadiana'' was cut up for scrap in 2004.<ref name="spree" /><ref>{{cite web | title = Great Lakes & Seaway Shipping News Archive | url = http://www.boatnerd.com/news/archive/8-02.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> The ships engine was salvaged and returned to Buffalo to be part of a planned exhibit.<ref>{{cite web| last = Sommer| first = Mark| authorlink =| coauthors =
