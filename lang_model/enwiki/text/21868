Most recently, Twain will have her own series, ''Why Not? with Shania Twain'', that is set to premiere on the [[OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network]] on May 8, 2011.


==Early years==
Shania Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], daughter of Clarence and Sharon Edwards. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother then moved to [[Timmins]],[[Ontario]] with Eilleen and her sisters Jill and Carrie Ann. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an [[Ojibwa]], and they had two more children, Mark and Darryl. Jerry adopted the girls, legally changing their last name to Twain. Because of her connection to her stepfather, in the past, people had presumed Twain's ancestry was Ojibwa, but she stated in an interview that her biological father was part [[Cree]].<ref name=youtube>{{Citation|url=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qY5T83wF3zA |title=YouTube&nbsp;<U+2014> Interview (Tore P<U+00E5> Sporet, Norway) |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref> As well, through her mother she is a descendant of [[Zacharie Cloutier]].<ref name="Ref_d">{{cite web|url=http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/home_en.htm |title=Genealogies of Madonna, Celine Dion, Hillary Clinton and Camilla, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall - All cousins! |publisher=Perche-quebec.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> Her maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]], [[Kildare]], [[Ireland]].<ref name="Ref_e">{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=zcloutier&id=I053 |title=WorldConnect |publisher=Wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

Eilleen Twain had a hard childhood in Timmins. Her parents earned little and there was often a shortage of food in the household. Eilleen did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. In the remote, rugged community, she learned to hunt and to chop wood. At one point, while Jerry was at work, her mother drove the rest of the family {{convert|425|mi|km}} south to a [[Toronto]] homeless shelter for assistance.<ref name="Ref_f">Shania's interview in the January 2005 [[Readers Digest]].</ref> Back in Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to make ends meet, often earning twenty [[Canadian dollar|dollar]]s between midnight and one in the morning performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing arts school on the road.<ref name="Ref_h">[http://www.shaniaforums.com/archive/index.php/t-34295.html Shania Twain Interview]. [[Today with Des and Mel]]. ITV Productions</ref> She has said of the ordeal, "My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought 'I hate this'. I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived".<ref name="Ref_i">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=41}}</ref> Twain wrote her first songs at the age of ten, ''Is Love a Rose'' and ''Just Like the Storybooks'' which were fairy tales in rhyme.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=51">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=51}}</ref> She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, "was very different from performing them and became progressively important".<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=51"/>

In the early 1980s, Twain spent some time working with her father's [[reforestation]] business in northern Ontario, a business that employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said "I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs".<ref name="Ref_j">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=62}}</ref>

==Music career==
===Career as Eilleen Twain===
At 13, Eilleen was invited to perform on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] television's the ''[[Tommy Hunter]] Show''. While attending [[Timmins High and Vocational School]] in [[Timmins]], she was also the singer for a local band called "Longshot" which covered Top 40 music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After graduating from Timmins High in July 1983, Twain was eager to expand her musical horizons.<ref name="Eggy 2005 p=88">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=88}}</ref> After the demise of the band Longshot, Twain was approached by a cover band led by [[Diane Chase]] called "Flirt" and they toured all over Ontario.<ref name="Eggy 2005 p=88" /> Twain also began taking singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett and would often clean his house in payment for her lessons.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=89}}</ref> In the autumn of 1984, Twain's talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in a ''Country Music News'' article: "Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals".<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89"/> Campbell happened to be making an album by Canadian musician (and present-day [[CKTB (AM)|CKTB]] radio personality) Tim Denis at the time and Twain was featured on the backing vocals of the song ''Heavy on the Sunshine''.<ref name="Ref_k">{{Citation|url=http://www.610cktb.com/shows/510269 |title=61.0 CKTB |publisher=61.0 CKTB |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080331113001/http://www.610cktb.com/shows/510269 |archivedate = March 31, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89" /> Campbell later took Twain to Nashville to record some demos, which Twain found particularly difficult to finance. She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, saying "I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]" and [[Hank Williams]]' "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]". Her voice reminded me of [[Tanya Tucker]], it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She's a star, she deserves an opportunity".<ref name="Ref_l">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=90}}</ref> Bailey later said "She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who's lived sixty years".<ref name="Ref_m">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=91}}</ref> [[File:Kenogami.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lake Kenogami]] where Twain spent much time practicing in 1985.]] Bailey acquired the contract from Stan Campbell and Twain moved into Bailey's home on Lake Kenogami where she practiced her music every day for hours. In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to [[Nashville]] to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song ''Too Hot to Handle''. She also demo-ed songs with Cyril Rawson but the demos were without success, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown [[Kirkland Lake]].<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=92">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=92}}</ref>
There she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier and drummer Randy Yurko and formed a new band, moving three months later to [[Bowmanville]], near Toronto. In late summer 1986 Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet John Kim Bell, a half [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=92"/> In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the [[National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]] at the [[Roy Thompson Hall]] in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star [[Bernadette Peters]], jazz guitarist [[Don Ross (guitarist)|Don Ross]], and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Her performance received little acclaim, but it convinced Bell, who hated pop music, that Twain should stay well away from it and concentrate on country music.<ref name="Ref_n">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=101}}</ref>

It was then on November 1, 1987, that Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car accident back in Timmins.<ref name="Ref_o">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=103}}</ref> As a result Twain moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and then took them all to [[Huntsville, Ontario]]. There, she supported them by earning money performing at the nearby [[Deerhurst Resort]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===1993<U+2013>1994: ''Shania Twain''===
A couple of years passed and Twain's siblings got older and moved out on their own. Twain assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for Twain to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including [[Mercury Nashville Records]], who signed her within a few months.<ref name="allmusic">{{Citation|unused_data=TWAIN&sql=11:dxfwxqq5ldhe~T1|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=SHANIA|title=Shania Twain&nbsp;<U+2014> Biography|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>
During this time, she changed her name to Shania, an [[Ojibwa]] word which means "on my way".

Twain's [[Shania Twain (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1993 in North America and garnered her audiences outside of Canada. The album only reached #67 on the US Country Albums Chart, but it gained positive reviews from critics.<ref name="musicianguide">{{Citation|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003683/Shania-Twain.html|title=Shania Twain Biography|last=Shelton|first=Pamela|publisher=Musician Guide.com|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> The album failed to sell significant copies initially, although Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] six years later by the [[RIAA]], denoting sales of over a million. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with "[[What Made You Say That]]" and "[[Dance with the One That Brought You]]". The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's "Rising Video Star of the Year" award.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===1995<U+2013>1996: ''The Woman in Me''/popularity established===
When [[rock music|rock]] [[record producer|producer]] [[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]] heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at [[CMA Music Festival|Nashville's Fan Fair]] in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within just weeks. Lange and Twain either wrote or co-wrote the songs that would form her second studio album, ''[[The Woman in Me (Shania Twain album)|The Woman in Me]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{Citation

</ref> Ironically all the songs selected for ''The Woman in Me'' were rejected by Mercury Records for her first album. Record executives were stunned when they listened to the album. It was unlike anything else in country music.<ref>Dickerson, James L. Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music, Schirmer Trade Books, 2005, p. 165.</ref> 

''The Woman in Me'' was released in the spring of 1995. The album's first single, "[[Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?]]" went to #11 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]]. This was followed by her first Top 10 and #1 hit single, "[[Any Man of Mine]]". Twain had further hits from the album, including the title track which peaked at #14 and three additional #1 hits: "[[(If You're Not in it for Love) I'm Outta Here!]]", "[[You Win My Love]]", and "[[No One Needs to Know]]".<ref name="allmusic"/>
As of 2007, it had sold more than 12 million copies.<ref name=RIAA>{{Citation|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=RIAA Top 100 Albums |publisher=Riaa.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>
The album was a quick breakthrough. Shania performed selected international venues and television shows with Nashville guitarist Randy Thomas (co-writer of the song "[[Butterfly Kisses (song)|Butterfly Kisses]]") and Stanley T., formerly with the Beach Boys. Mercury Record's promotion of the album was based largely upon a series of sexy [[music videos]].<ref name="book544">{{Citation|last=Wolff|first=Kurt|title=Country Music: The Rough Guide|editor=Orla Duane|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd.|location=London, England|pages=544<U+2013>545|chapter=Ch. 13 - Hunks, Hat Acts, and Young Country Darlings: Nashville in the 1990s}}</ref>

''The Woman in Me'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]] as well as the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Album of the Year; the latter group also awarded Twain as Best New Female Vocalist.

==Worldwide success==
===1997<U+2013>2001: ''Come On Over''===
In 1997, Twain released her follow-up album, ''[[Come On Over (Shania Twain album)|Come On Over]]''. This was the album that would establish her as a successful crossover singer. Slowly, the album started racking up sales. It never hit the top spot, but with the multi-chart hit single "[[You're Still the One]]", sales skyrocketed. Other songs like "[[Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)|Don't Be Stupid]]", "[[You've Got A Way]]", "[[Man! I Feel Like a Woman!]]", "[[That Don't Impress Me Much]]" and "[[From This Moment On (Shania Twain song)|From This Moment On]]" joined the 12 songs that eventually saw release as singles. "From This Moment On" is a duet with singer [[Bryan White]] and there was even a pop version as well.

The album stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 39 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician.<ref name="Harris2005">{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2005/11/06/1295562.html|title=Biopic looks at Twain's early years|last=Harris|first=Bill|date=2005-11-07|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref> It is also the eighth biggest-selling album by any type of artist in the US.<ref name=RIAA /> Songs from the album won four Grammy Awards during this time, including [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Female Country Performance]] (for "You're Still the One" and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!") for Twain. Lange won Grammys for "You're Still the One" and "[[Come on Over (song)|Come on Over]]". 

Despite the album's record sales it wasn't able to top the ''Billboard'' 200, peaking at #2. In 1999, the "Come on Over" album was remixed for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband were looking for. "Come on over" went to #1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in Great Britain and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. The songs that had finally drawn European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles "That Don't Impress Me Much", a #3 in the UK and Top 10 hit in Germany in the summer of 1999, and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" which peaked at #3 in both the UK and France in autumn of that year. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200, remaining in the Top 20 for 99 weeks.

Twain's mainstream pop acceptance was further helped by her appearance in the 1998 first edition of the ''[[VH1 Divas]]'' concert where she sang alongside [[Mariah Carey]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Aretha Franklin]], and also by [[VH1]]'s 1999 heavily aired ''[[Behind the Music]]'', which concentrated on the tragic aspects of her early life as well as her physical attractiveness and Nashville's early resistance to her bare-midriff [[music video]]s.

In 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager [[Jon Landau]], a veteran of many large-scale tours with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The [[Come on Over Tour]] shows were enthusiastically received by audiences around the globe and answered critics{{Who|date=July 2007}} who speculated that she could not perform live.

In 2000, Twain was initially scheduled to release a [[Christmas]] album, but plans to release one were cancelled later in the year.<ref name="Brunner2000">{{Citation|last=Brunner |first=Rob |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,90037,00.html |title=Shania Twain cancels her Christmas album |publisher=Ew.com |date=2000-12-01 |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>

===2002<U+2013>2004: ''Up!''===
[[File:ShaniaTwain2.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Shania Twain, 17 February 2004]]
After a change in management <U+2014> QPrime replaced Landau&nbsp;<U+2014> and a two year break, Twain and Lange returned to the studio. ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'' was released on November 19, 2002. About a year later, Twain kicked off the [[Up! Tour]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], Canada on September 25, 2003.

''Up!'' was released as a double album, with three different discs<U+2014>pop (a red CD), country (a green CD), and international (a blue CD). For North American markets, the pop disc was paired with the country disc and in international markets, the pop disc was paired with the world music disc. ''Up!'' was given four out of five stars by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, and debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. ''Up!'' reached #1 in Germany, #2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, ''Up!'' was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for one and a half years.

The international music disc was remixed with [[India]]n-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The new versions were produced by Simon and [[Diamond Duggal]], brothers from [[Birmingham]], England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" which retained the Indian influence.<ref name="Ref_p">{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/communities/masti/2003/03/16/diamond_duggal.shtml |title=Shania's 'Asian inspiration' talks it 'Up!' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>

Twain's popularity in UK was reflected by numerous appearances on the long-running music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing singles from ''Come on Over'' from 1999. In 2002 an entire special show was dedicated to her on sister show [[TOTP2]], in which Twain herself introduced some past performances of her greatest hits and new singles from ''Up!''

The first single from the album, "[[I'm Gonna Getcha Good!]]" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at an impressive #24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit #4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single "[[Up! (song)|Up!]]" reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but failed to reach the pop Top 40.

The second European single became the mid-tempo song "[[Ka-Ching!]]" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching #1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France.

The third single from the album would be the most successful in the US. The romantic ballad "[[Forever and For Always]]" was released as a single in April 2003 and peaked at #4 on the country chart and #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and made as well the ''Billboard'' Top 20. Again success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with "Forever and For Always" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. Further singles were "[[She's Not Just a Pretty Face]]" a country Top 10 hit, while the last US single, "[[It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing]]", made the Top 20 on both Country and AC.

Due to the enormous European success of ''Up!'' and its first three singles, two more singles were released in the second half of 2003 with up-tempo "[[Thank You Baby]]" (#11 in the UK, Top 20 in Germany) and just before Christmas the romantic, acoustic ballad "When You Kiss Me", at least a minor hit in both territories. The title track "Up!" also saw a single release in a limited edition of European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. In January 2008, ''Up!'' had sold 5.5 million copies in the U.S. and was certified by the RIAA as 11x platinum (the organization counts double albums as two units).<ref name = RIAA/>

In 2003, Twain participated in the [[Dolly Parton]] tribute album ''[[Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton|Just Because I'm a Woman]]'', covering Parton's classic "[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]", with backing vocals by [[Alison Krauss]]. The cover peaked at #57 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts as an album cut. During the [[Super Bowl XXXVII#XXXVII Halftime show|Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show]] Twain performed two songs, "[[Man! I Feel Like a Woman!]]" and "[[Up! (song)|Up!]]"

===2004<U+2013>2005: ''Greatest Hits''===
[[File:ShaniaTwain3.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Shania Twain, live in Wembley, UK, 16 February 2004]]
In 2004, she released the ''[[Greatest Hits (Shania Twain album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, with three new tracks. As of 2008, it has sold over four million copies in the U.S.<ref name = RIAA/> The first single, the multi-format duet "[[Party for Two]]", made the country top ten with [[Billy Currington]], while the pop version with [[Sugar Ray]] lead singer [[Mark McGrath]] made top ten in the United Kingdom and Germany. The follow-up singles, "[[Don't! (Shania Twain song)|Don't!]]" and "[[I Ain't No Quitter]]" did not fare as well. The former made Top 20 on Adult Contemporary, while the latter did not gain enough airplay to crack the Country Top 40.<ref name="Ref_1965">{{Citation|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p42121|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Shania Twain > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=1965-08-28 |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>

In August 2005, she released the single "[[Shoes (Shania Twain song)|Shoes]]" from the ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' soundtrack.

==2006 onwards==
At the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] in Las Vegas on May 16, 2007, Twain said she was currently writing songs for a new album, and was doing a "lot of soul searching" and "indulging in the writing."

Twain joined Canadian singer [[Anne Murray]] on the song "[[You Needed Me]]" on Murray's ''[[Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends]]'' album released November 13, 2007 in Canada, and on January 15, 2008 in the U.S.<ref name="Ace2007">{{Citation|author=Ace Burpee |url=http://www.hot103live.com/node/564957 |title=Anne Murray Releases Special Duets Album Entitled "Anne Murray Duets: Legends & Friends" |publisher=Hot103live.com |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2009-10-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429040523/http://www.hot103live.com/node/564957 |archivedate = April 29, 2008}}</ref>
On November 12, 2008 Twain made her first television appearance since her split from ex-husband Robert "Mutt" Lange, where she appeared as a surprise presenter at the 42nd CMA Awards.<ref name="Ref_2008">{{Citation|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1599226/shania-twain-returns-to-nashville-as-cma-awards-presenter.jhtml |title=Shania Twain Returns to Nashville as CMA Awards Presenter |publisher=Cmt.com |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>

In early January 2009, Internet forums were reporting that Twain was planning to make an announcement regarding her new album on January 26, 2009 but on the 22nd a spokesperson from Mercury Nashville told ''Country Weekly'' that no new album would be coming "anytime soon".

In June 2009, Twain released a letter to her fans explaining the delays in the release of her next album.<ref name="Ref_r">{{Citation|url=http://www.shaniatwain.com/news-item.asp?item=newsItem-090612.asp|title=A Personal Message From Shania|accessdate=2009-07-18|work=www.shaniatwain.com}}</ref> In August 2009, at a conference in Timmins, Ontario, a spokesman for Twain's label said a new record from the singer is still "nowhere in sight".<ref name="Ref_s">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hXuSCP3NIxiV24l6RZi0J4-hXv4w Shania's label rep: New album from country superstar is 'nowhere in sight']{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> On August 17, 2009, [[Entertainment Weekly|EW]] announced that Twain would be a guest judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' in Chicago, for the show's August 30 and 31 episodes.<ref name="AI">{{Citation|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/08/17/american-idol-shania-twain-rumored-next-guest-judge/|title='American Idol': Shania Twain will be next guest judge|work=ew.com|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> On January 1, 2010, Shania carried the [[Olympic Flame|Olympic Torch]] through her hometown as part of the [[2010 Winter Olympics torch relay]].<ref name="Ref_t">{{Citation|url=http://shaniatwain.com/news.html?articleID=36 |title=Shania Twain |publisher=Shania Twain |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>

In a 2009 study to determine what measurable parameters create "beauty", scientists correlated a set of measures for the positions of various facial features in women with ratings of attractiveness.
