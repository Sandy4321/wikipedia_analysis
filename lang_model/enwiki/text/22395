'''George O. Jackson, Jr.''' (b. 1941 in Houston, Texas) is a photographer who documented the seasonal religious festivals of the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The photography project, called '''The Essence of Mexico''', was conducted from 1990 through 2001 and resulted in more than 75,000 color images of the traditional rites and ceremonies of more than 60 different indigenous cultural groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=Descriptive Summary, George O.

== Early Life ==

Jackson is the eldest son of the late George O. Jackson, Sr., an insurance executive, and Dolores Mar<U+00ED>a de Llano Villarreal. He frequently uses his maternal family name in his professional work, exhibiting under the name George O. Jackson de Llano. His mother's family came from the state of [[Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]] in northern Mexico, where his maternal great-grandfather, Rub<U+00E9>n Villareal, owned silver mines. In around 1910, at the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Villareal moved his family from [[Lampazos de Naranjo]] in Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n to the border city of [[Laredo, Texas]], where Jackson grew up. His mother<U+2019>s father was a descendant of Manuel Mar<U+00ED>a de Llano, who served as mayor of [[Monterrey]] and twice as governor of Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n during the 19th century. Jackson<U+2019>s great uncle, Rodrigo de Llano, was the publisher of [[Exc<U+00E9>lsior]], a major newspaper in [[Mexico City]], from 1924 until his death in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biographical Sketch|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00119/lac-00119.html#scopecontent}}</ref>
==== Education ====

Growing up on the border in a bicultural household, Jackson was raised a Catholic and often traveled through Mexico visiting with family and friends. An indifferent student, Jackson graduated in 1960 from [[Riverside Military Academy]] in Georgia and  attended the University of Texas at Austin in 1961.

==== Business Career ====

In the 1970s Jackson frequently traveled in search of rare palms and cycads to the jungles of southern Mexico where he came in contact with indigenous communities, their traditional customs and festivals, and in 1977 he took up photography.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biographical Sketch|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00119/lac-00119.html#scopecontent}}</ref>    During this time he developed and sold two restaurants in Houston, Hofbrau Steaks (1977) and the Cadillac Bar (1978).<ref>{{cite news|last=Woodard|first=Tracey Taylor|title=Fusion energy: Texas chef merges Southwest, Orient|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n23_v23/ai_7672701/|newspaper=Business Library|date=June 5, 1989}}</ref>  He also received a commission to design and decorate the historic Gage Hotel in [[Marathon, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Plocheck|first=Katie|title=Marfa Refried|url=http://ricedesignalliance.org/2010/marfa-refried|publisher=Rice Design Alliance|date=April 8, 2010}}</ref>   In 1989 a third Houston restaurant, Palacio Tzintzuntzan, opened briefly and failed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calkins|first=Laurel Brubaker|title=Tzintzuntzan, Bertha's close trendy doors|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-8955189/tzintzuntzan-bertha-close-trendy.html|publisher=Houston Business Journal|date=February 5, 1990}}</ref>  By this time Jackson had created his first photography collection, the '''Parklane Collection''', a series of photographs of the Houston skyline taken between 1984 and 1990 from his 28th floor apartment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Patricia|title='Parklane' looks to the sky/Jackson focuses on skyline|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_433176/parklane-looks-to-the-sky-jackson-focuses-on-skyli.html|newspaper=The Houston Chronicle|date=Jan. 3, 1987}}</ref>  With the closing of Palacio Tzintzuntzan in 1990, Jackson began the project of photodocumenting the major festivals of each of Mexico<U+2019>s indigenous folk cultures. <ref>{{cite book|title=Visions of the West: Art and Artifacts from the collection of J.P.

== The Essence of Mexico Project ==

'''The Essence of Mexico Collection''', which includes original color slides and audio recordings, documents <U+201C>more than 330 festivals held in communities spanning twenty-three states and the Federal District of Mexico, and encompass more than sixty different indigenous tribes.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|title=Essence of Mexico Collection, Scope of Contents and Note|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00119/lac-00119.html}}</ref>  The festivals are classified into four types: ritual agricultural calendar festivals, festivals honoring patron saints, deities, and virgin protectors of villages, groups, or labor; pilgrimage sanctuaries, and family-based rituals such as births, deaths, and weddings. The photographs are of dances, masks and costumes, music and songs, ceremonies, ritual battles, feasts, folk art and ephemera. In addition, some 8,800 of the 76,124 images are of landscapes, architecture, flora, fauna, and people Jackson encountered on his way to and from frequently remote and isolated festival locations during the decade he was living in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scope and Contents Note|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00119/lac-00119.html#scopecontent}}</ref>
Roberto Tejada, now distinguished professor of art history at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX, wrote about the photographs in the Essence of Mexico Collection: <U+201C>These seasonal celebrations are cultural patterns that point back to the uncertainty of the years that followed the near-total destruction of Mexico-Tenochtitlan. In addition, they articulate the severe processes that gradually led to the precarious condition of New Spain and its day to day contact between Spanish colonialists and the multiple indigenous communities in urban centers and countryside alike.<U+201D><ref>{{cite journal|last=Tejada|first=Roberto|title=Contact: Christians and Moors, Image and Ritual in Mexico.
