==Positive drug test==

In May 2011, Cielo tested positive for the banned substance [[furosemide]].  Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight, but is also a masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs.  Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who tested positive for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation.  Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination.<ref>{{cite news|title =Brazilian swimmer Cesar Cielo let off with warning despite positive test|last=| first=|url =http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/brazilian-swimmer-cesar-cielo-let-off-with-warning-despite-positive-test/story-e6frfglf-1226086072213|newspaper =Herald Sun|date =2011-07-02|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zrqyAupz|archivedate =2011-07-02|accessdate =2011-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warnings Given to Cesar Cielo, Three Other Brazilian Swimmers, After Positive Drug Test |url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/27408.asp|publisher=''Swimming World Magazine''|author=|date=2011-07-01|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> [[FINA]] appealed Cielo's case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) and CAS kept the warning for Cielo.  CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated to bring about the failed drugs test. CAS explained that they had become convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed to improve athletic performance or mask the use of some other substance capable of improving performance.<ref>[http://globoesporte.globo.com/aquaticos/noticia/2011/07/tas-explica-decisao-e-reconhece-uso-arriscado-do-suplemento-por-cielo.html CAS arguments] {{pt}}</ref>

The CAS decision allowed Cielo to compete in the 2011 World Swimming Championships in [[Shanghai]], generating controversy among other competitors. Notably, Kenyan swimmer [[Jason Dunford]] flashed a "thumbs down" to the audience after Cielo's win in the 50 metre butterfly (Dunford finished seventh in the race).<ref>http://espn.go.com/olympics/swimming/story/_/id/6815407/pharmacy-blamed-world-champion-swimmer-cesar-cielo-positive-doping-test</ref>
