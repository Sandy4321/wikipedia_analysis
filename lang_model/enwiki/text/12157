'''Zac Brown Band''' is an<!--don't add Grammy Award winning, that's undue weight--> American country/folk band based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The lineup consists of Zac Brown ([[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[guitar]]), Jimmy De Martini ([[fiddle]], vocals), John Driskell Hopkins ([[bass guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]), Coy Bowles (guitar, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), [[Chris Fryar]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]), [[Clay Cook]] (guitar, keyboards, [[mandolin]], [[steel guitar]], vocals), and [[Daniel de los Reyes]] (percussion). The band has toured throughout the United States, including a slot on the [[2009 Bonnaroo Music Festival|2009]] and [[2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival|2010]] [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]. They have also recorded four studio albums, and charted eight Number One singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts: "[[Chicken Fried]]", "[[Toes (song)|Toes]]", "[[Highway 20 Ride]]", "[[Free (Zac Brown Band song)|Free]]", "[[As She's Walking Away]]", "[[Colder Weather]]", "[[Knee Deep]]" and "[[Keep Me in Mind (Zac Brown Band song)|Keep Me In Mind]]", in addition to the singles "[[Whatever It Is]]" and "[[No Hurry]]", which peaked at number 2 on the same chart.

== College ==
Brown attended the [[University of West Georgia]], where he was a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]] fraternity. He was also a camp counselor at Camp Mikell in Toccoa, Ga. & Camp Glisson, a United Methodist summer camp located in Dahlonega, GA.<ref>{{cite web| title = Alumni News| publisher = The Kappa Alpha Order Journal| date = Summer 2007| ayahoo.com/september-11-anniversary-video/}}</ref>

== Formation ==
In 2002, the [[Zac Brown]] Band was formed and they began traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year. The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by a drummer and a bass guitarist. In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown (today, it is called Southern Ground for legal reasons).

In 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia called "Zac's Place" where the fare was southern-style cooking. A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs as well as folk and jam band festivals. 2004 also saw the release of the Zac Brown Band's first independent album, ''Far from Einstyne''.

It was also in 2004 when Brown added violinist/fiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the Zac Brown Band According to an interview with De Martini, he explained that Wyatt Durette, Brown's frequent songwriting collaborator, was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]] at the time, where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed. Durette suggested De Martini to Brown, who was wanting a "lead instrument" in his band, as well as a harmony singer. After doing several performances with the band at the club, Brown asked De Martini to become a permanent member, to which De Martini gladly obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenville.metromix.com/music/article/q-and-a-jimmy/1470971/content|title=Q&A: Jimmy DeMartini of Zac Brown Band|author=Matt Wake|publisher=Metromix Greenville|date=2009-09-17|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>

In 2005, the Zac Brown Band released its second independent album, ''Home Grown''. That same year, John Driskell Hopkins joined the band as its bass guitarist and baritone vocalist. Hopkins, who was well known in the Atlanta area as the leader of the band Brighter Shade, first met Brown in 1998 at an [[open mic]] event hosted by Hopkins and they remained friends since then. Additionally, Hopkins also co-produced the ''Home Grown'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johndriskellhopkins.com/John_Driskell_Hopkins/John_Driskell_Hopkins.html|title=John Driskell Hopkins|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>

In 2006, the Zac Brown Band recorded ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' with producer Keith Stegall. It was also in 2006 when Coy Bowles joined the band alternating on guitar and keyboards. Bowles and Brown first met in the late 1990s when they were both students at the University of West Georgia, where Bowles was studying biology. Bowles also vividly remembers seeing Brown perform for the first time. He explains, "I walked into a restaurant and Zac was singing and playing guitar. I heard a couple tunes and turned to my buddy and said, 'That dude might have the richest and loudest voice I ever heard!' I don<U+2019>t even think Zac had a microphone and you could hear him all across the bar.<U+201D>

Bowles then transferred to Atlanta's [[Georgia State University]] to study music. He subsequently became involved in Atlanta's various music scenes, and eventually formed Coy Bowles and the Fellowship in 2004. Two years later, Bowles decided to reconnect with Brown. Through mutual friends, he learned that the Zac Brown Band was scheduled to perform in Atlanta one evening. Bowles and Brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other, which ended with Brown inviting Bowles to sit in with his band at that night's performance, which Bowles gladly accepted. To return the favor, Bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the Fellowship a couple of months later, which in turn resulted in Brown and his band sitting in at that gig.

This turn of events continued for eight months until Bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with Brown's band and his own band and other activities, thus making a difficult decision to put the Fellowship on an indefinite hiatus and become a permanent member of the Zac Brown Band, as that was what he enjoyed the most.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/music/about-zbb/|title=About ZBB << Coy Bowles|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/coy/about/|title=About << Coy Bowles|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>

In 2008, the Zac Brown Band signed to Live Nation Artists Records (in association with Brown's own Home Grown label), but not before Chris Fryar became yet another addition to the band. An [[Alabama]] native, Fryar attended [[North Texas State University]] and the [[Mississippi University for Women]] and made a name for himself in the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2011/05/and_the_beat_goes_on_gardendal.html|title=The beat goes on: Gardendale drummer Chris Fryar earns fame, stays humble in Zac Brown Band (video)|author=Mary Colurso|publisher=The Birmingham News|date=2011-05-27|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref> According to Fryar, a mutual friend recommended him to Brown, who was in need of a new drummer for the band. Fryar, who in turn had just finished a stint with a previous band, subsequently auditioned and shortly afterward became the Zac Brown Band's newest member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/static/ads/landing_pages/4343_zacbrownband/4343_landing_page.html|title=Landshark Lager - Proud Sponsor of Zac Brown Band|accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref>

==Commercial success==
The Zac Brown Band's debut single, "[[Chicken Fried]]", was originally recorded in 2003 and included on the ''Home Grown'' album, but later re-recorded and released to country radio in 2008. This song was also recorded by [[The Lost Trailers]], whose 2006 recording was released as a single but withdrawn after Brown decided that he wanted to release it himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4477828-1.html |title= BNA Forced To Swap Trailers' Single |accessdate=2008-06-19 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2006-03-15 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref> Brown also co-wrote "Simple Life", a song recorded by The Lost Trailers on their 2006 [[The Lost Trailers (album)|self-titled album]].

In October 2008, [[Atlantic Records]] acquired distribution of "Chicken Fried" after Live Nation Artists closed. The band's album ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' was released under Atlantic Records' newly re-established country division in association with the Home Grown/Big Picture label on November 18 of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3id8aa242bcb47ed804f91b0962b4527df |title=Zac Brown Band Signs With Atlantic  |accessdate=2008-10-29 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2008-10-29 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> "Chicken Fried" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts that same month, making them the first country band to reach No.&nbsp;1 with a debut single since [[Heartland (country music band)|Heartland]] did so in 2006 with "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/charts/chart_alert/e3iac81cb9ace3320f8be5a577c0bd8f3ef |title=Beyonce's 'Fierce' Debut Leads Pre-Turkey Day Chart  |accessdate=2008-12-07|date=2008-11-26 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

In July 2012, Zac Brown Band debuted their new CD, "Uncaged," which was well received. Billboard considered the album to be the best country album of 2012 as of its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/the-615/zac-brown-band-uncaged-track-by-track-review-1007537952.story#/column/the-615/zac-brown-band-uncaged-track-by-track-review-1007537952.story|title=Zac Brown Band, 'Uncaged': Track-by-Track Review|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref>

== Inclusion of Clay Cook ==
In January 2009, two months after "Chicken Fried" went to No.&nbsp;1, Atlanta native Clay Cook joined the Zac Brown Band as its multi-instrumentalist and high tenor vocalist. Cook had previously collaborated with [[John Mayer]] and [[Shawn Mullins]], and was also a member of the [[The Marshall Tucker Band|Marshall Tucker Band]] for two years prior to joining the Zac Brown Band. According to Cook, he and Brown actually both attended and graduated from high school together, but were never acquainted with each other during that period.
He explains how he first met Brown:
{{quote|We ran into each other (in) 2003 in a club scene in Atlanta, where I think my band opened up for his band...ever since then, we've been friendly...and I think he just thought I was a singer-songwriter for a long time; and then we were on a (music) cruise ship together...and I was playing with the Marshall Tucker Band at the time, and (Brown)'s band (also participated in the cruise)...and he actually got to see me play the guitar...and then he realized, 'I need this guy in my band,' I guess.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj69DZ-FHTE|title=ExploreMusic chats with Clay Cook|publisher=YouTube|date=2010-12-10|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>}}

Brown himself admits his strong desire to add Cook to the lineup, for he believed Cook's musicianship would enhance the Zac Brown Band's overall musical style:

{{quote|I<U+2019>d been tryin<U+2019> to get him in the band for three years, and you know, it<U+2019>s been a journey, but I always knew [he could make us better]. I<U+2019>m a harmony fanatic. I love big harmonies and things, and we didn<U+2019>t have a high tenor, and Jimmy [De Martini], my fiddle player, sings a lot of the high stuff now, but havin<U+2019> somebody that can actually sing on top of that, we<U+2019>ve added a four-part harmony now that<U+2019>s searing, and the guy<U+2019>s a monster player, too."<ref name=gactv.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5942665,00.html|title=Zac Brown Band Expands On ''The Foundation''|publisher=GAC News|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>}}

With the new Zac Brown Band lineup completed, the band released its second single, "[[Whatever It Is]]," which went to No.&nbsp;2. In October 2009, a third single, "[[Toes (song)|Toes]]," became the band's second Number One. The album's fourth single, and third No.&nbsp;1, was "[[Highway 20 Ride]]". "[[Free (Zac Brown Band song)|Free]]" was the album's fifth single and on the week of August 21, 2010, it also peaked at Number One.

== Inclusion of Daniel de los Reyes ==
On April 25, 2012, it was announced via the Zac Brown Band's website that percussionist [[Daniel de los Reyes]] had joined the band on a permanent basis. De los Reyes had previously performed with the band as a touring musician and participated in the recording of their album ''[[Uncaged]]''. De los Reyes has also performed with artists and groups such as [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/zac-brown-talks-new-album-uncaged-out-july-10-new-band-member-and-search-for-that-pulse/2012/04/25/gIQA0wYKgT_story.html|title=Zac Brown talks new album <U+2018>Uncaged,<U+2019> out July 10, new band member and search for <U+2018>that pulse<U+2019>|publisher=Washington Post|date=2012-04-25|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>
