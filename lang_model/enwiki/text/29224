[[Image:NES Punch Out.png|frame|right|The starting match in ''Mike Tyson's Punch-Out'', against Glass Joe.]] 
'''''Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!''''' (1987) is a [[cartoon]]ish [[boxing]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] designed, developed, and published by [[Nintendo]].  It is a sequel to the arcade game ''[[Punch-Out!!]]''. The game features a boxer named ''[[Little Mac]]'' working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers; leading to a final fight with real-life boxer [[Mike Tyson]].   
   
==Gameplay==   
The game requires good reflexes in reaction to the computer-controlled boxers' moves, as the more advanced boxers give very little indication of their coming moves.  ''Punch-Out!!'' incorporates enough variety to be a challenge to even the most experienced of players. Still, many have mastered ''Punch-Out!!'' by learning the computer-controlled boxers' consistent patterns.

[[Mario]] plays a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] as the [[referee]] and [[List of Punch-Out!! boxers#Doc Louis|Doc Louis]] serves as [[List of Punch-Out!! boxers#Little Mac|Little Mac]]'s faithful trainer and corner man.

==The opponents==
The opponents the player has to face in the four boxing circuits are:

*[[List of Punch-Out!! boxers#King Hippo|King Hippo]] (Hippo Island) - The largest of the WVBA contenders, Hippo's only weakness is his enormous stomach. Once knocked down, he is never able to get up.

==Other versions==   
In 1990, towards the end of the NES's run, the game was re-released as ''Punch-Out!!'', with the Tyson character replaced by [[Mr. Dream]].  Mr. Dream fought in the same fashion as Tyson, but had cosmetic changes to his face and skin color.  Contrary to popular belief Tyson was
removed not because of his 1991 rape conviction of Miss Black Teen America, but because of a contract dispute with Nintendo and his title loss to Buster Douglas.  Tyson was actually removed from the game before he was convicted of rape.

This game was inspired by the 1984 [[arcade game]] ''[[Punch-Out!!]]'', also by Nintendo, as is its sequel ''[[Super Punch-Out!!]]''.  The arcade version does not use Tyson's image or name, but many of the other characters are taken from one of the two arcade games.  Glass Joe, Bald Bull, and Mr. Sandman are from Punch-Out!!, while Great Tiger, Soda Popinski (aka Vodka Drunkenski), and Super Macho Man are from Super Punch-Out!!.  Furthermore, Piston Honda is nearly identical to Punch-Out's [[Piston Hurricane]] without visual alterations.

In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', one of the unlockable NES games is ''Punch-Out!!'' (Mr. Dream version).  This is one of the rarer NES games to get.

One of the microgames in ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]'' for the Wii involves the player taking on the role of Mario as the referee and counting down Glass Joe, Von Kaiser, and Bald Bull.

===Virtual Console===

This game is also slated to appear in [[Virtual Console (Wii)|Virtual Console]], though it is most likely that only the ''Punch-Out!!'' version (with Mr. Dream) will be the one available due to licensing issues and Tyson's current image.
