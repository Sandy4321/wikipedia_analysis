'''Hurricane Floyd''' was the sixth named storm, fourth [[hurricane]], and third major hurricane in the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Floyd triggered the third largest evacuation in US history (behind [[Hurricane Gustav]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], respectively) when 2.6&nbsp;million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to September 19, peaking in strength as a very strong Category&nbsp;4 hurricane<U+2014>just short of the highest possible rating<U+2014>on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It was among the largest [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]]s of its strength ever recorded.

Floyd struck [[The Bahamas]] at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then paralleled the [[East Coast of the United States]], causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm weakened significantly, however, before making landfall in [[North Carolina]] as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] region and into [[New England]].

The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in [[eastern North Carolina]], adding more rain to an area hit by [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and $4.5&nbsp;billion (1999&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|4500000000|1999}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) in damage.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Floyd 1999 track.png}}
Floyd originated as a [[tropical wave]] that exited the coast of [[Africa]] on September 2. It moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until September 7, when a curved band of deep convection developed over the center in response to a developing anticyclone. At this point, the [[National Hurricane Center]] designated it as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was approximately {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. A strong ridge of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters, allowing it to strengthen to Tropical Storm Floyd on September 8.<ref name="tcr">{{

[[Image:Hurricane Floyd 1999-09-14.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of Hurricane Floyd]]

Although a large storm, Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification. On September 10 it organized enough to reach hurricane status, and Floyd approached major hurricane strength on September 11 while north of the [[Leeward Islands]]. The central Atlantic [[tropical upper tropospheric trough|upper tropospheric trough]], along with an [[cold-core low|upper-level low]] in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]], produced vertical [[wind shear]] over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A turn to the west, caused by building of high pressures, was followed by a period of rapid intensification: in 24&nbsp;hours maximum sustained winds increased from {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, while the pressure dropped to {{convert|921|mb|inHg}} by morning on September 13.<ref name="hurdat_1999_6">{{

[[Image:Hurricane Floyd (1999).jpg|left|thumb|Hurricane Floyd at its North Carolina landfall]]

Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category&nbsp;5 status on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale]] for 12&nbsp;hours while crossing the Bahamas, making landfalls on [[Eleuthera]] and [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] islands,<ref name="tcr"/> before an [[eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle]] weakened it to a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The new, larger eyewall contracted slightly, and the hurricane briefly re-intensified to Category&nbsp;4 status. A strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, steering Floyd to the northwest. It paralleled the eastern [[Florida]] coast {{convert|110|mi|km}} off shore, and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper-level shear.<ref name="tcr"/> The storm remained extremely large, however; at its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of {{convert|580|mi|km|abbr=on}}, making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded.<ref name="Legacy">{{cite web|author=Herring, David|year=2000|title=Hurricane Floyd's Lasting Legacy|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2008-10-04|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/FloydIntro/}}</ref>

Floyd accelerated to the north and northeast, and weakened greatly to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane with {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds at its [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] landfall on September 16. After crossing over North Carolina and southeastern [[Virginia]], it briefly re-entered the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] before reaching [[Long Island]] on September 17. The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over southern [[Maine]] late on September 17. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast, and after passing over the [[Canadian Maritimes]], it was absorbed by a cold front to the east of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Although Floyd's track prediction was above average while out at sea, the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years. The official forecasts did not predict Floyd's northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall.<ref>{{

In New York City, public schools were closed on September 16, 1999, the day Floyd hit the area. This was a rare decision by the city, as New York City public schools close on average once every few years.

With a death toll of 57, Hurricane Floyd was the deadliest [[United States]] hurricane since [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972. The storm also was one of the costliest in the nation's history, amounting to $4.5&nbsp;billion (1999&nbsp;USD; $5.3&nbsp;billion in 2006 U.S. dollars). Most of the deaths and damage were from inland, freshwater flooding in eastern North Carolina.

===Southeastern United States===
Although over a million Florida residents were evacuated, the state was only lightly affected by Hurricane Floyd. Strong waves and tropical storm-force winds resulted in significant beach erosion on the east coast of Florida, as well as the loss of some boat piers in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard]] and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia Counties]]. Moderate rainfall occurred along the coastline, amounting to a maximum of {{convert|3.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. Floyd's winds downed hundreds of trees, damaging 357 houses. Damage in northeast Florida amounted to $46.5&nbsp;million (1999&nbsp;USD; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|46500000|1999}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD), a fraction of what was originally expected.<ref name="tcr"/>

The states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]], although threatened by the storm, were largely spared when it turned northward. Some areas of eastern South Carolina reported up to {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain.<ref name="tcr"/>

===North Carolina===
[[Image:Floyd- Property Damage.gif|left|thumb|alt=A picture of a damaged beach house|Coastal property damage at [[Pine Knoll Shores, North Carolina]]]]
North Carolina received the brunt of the storm's destruction. In all, Hurricane Floyd caused 35 fatalities in North Carolina, much of them from freshwater flooding, as well as billions in damage.

[[Image:Floyd1999NCLandfall.gif|right|thumb|alt=An animated map showing rain moving over North Carolina|Radar imagery of Hurricane Floyd making landfall in North Carolina.]]
The storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to {{convert|9|<U+2013>|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} along the southeastern portion of the state. The hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes, most of which caused only minor damage. Damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the storm's passage.<ref name="tcr"/>

Just weeks prior to Floyd hitting, [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] brought up to {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain to southeastern North Carolina. When Hurricane Floyd moved across the state in early September, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of {{convert|19.06|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. Though it moved quickly, the extreme rainfall was due to Floyd's interaction with an approaching cold front across the area.<ref name="tcr"/>

Extensive flooding led to overflowing rivers; nearly every river basin in eastern North Carolina reached 500&nbsp;year or greater flood levels.<ref name="usgs-flooding"/> Most localized flooding happened overnight; Floyd dropped nearly {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain during the hours of its passage and many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes. The National Guard and the Coast Guard performed nearly 1700 fresh water rescues of people trapped on the roofs of their homes due to the rapid rise of the water. By contrast, many of the worst affected areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm, as the water accumulated in rivers and moved downstream (see flood graphic at right).

The passage of [[Hurricane Irene (1999)|Hurricane Irene]] four weeks later contributed an additional six in (150&nbsp;mm) of rain over the still-saturated area, causing further flooding.

The [[Tar River]] suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} above flood stage. Flooding began in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], as much as 30% of which was underwater for several days. In [[Tarboro, North Carolina|Tarboro]], much of the downtown was under several feet of water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flooding in Tarboro and Princeville|publisher=Daniel Design Associates|url=http://www.danieldesign.com/tarboro.htm|accessdate=2008-10-04}}</ref> Nearby, the town of [[Princeville, North Carolina|Princeville]] was largely destroyed when the waters of the Tar poured over the town's levee, covering the town with over {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} of floodwater for ten days.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Princeville|publisher=Town Of Princeville, North Carolina|url=http://www.townofprincevillenc.com/history.html|accessdate = 2006-03-11 (BROKEN)}}</ref> Further downstream, [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]] suffered very heavy flooding; damages in [[Pitt County]] alone were estimated at $1.6&nbsp;billion (1999&nbsp;USD, $1.87&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="extremes0999"/> [[Washington, North Carolina|Washington]], where the peak flood level was observed, was likewise devastated.

The [[Neuse River]], [[Roanoke River]], [[Waccamaw River]], and [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the [[Cape Fear River]] basin was west of the peak rainfall areas, the city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels.

[[Manville, New Jersey]] was hit nearly as hard, with record-breaking floods coming from the Raritan River and the nearby [[Millstone River]], which join in Manville.  Princeton University in Princeton, NJ, for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink, advised students in dorms not to shower, and provided bottled drinking water.

The [[Rochelle Park, New Jersey]] hub of [[Electronic Data Systems]] was inundated by the nearby [[Saddle River (Passaic River)|Saddle River]], disrupting service to as many as 8,000 ATMs across the United States.<ref name="rochelle park eds">{{cite news

[[Image:Floyd1999RadarPANYNJDMP.gif|250px|thumb|left|Floyd's rain affecting the Mid-Atlantic.]]Still a large tropical cyclone when it hit the Mid Atlantic states, Floyd produced a strong storm surge, peaking at {{convert|2.8|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a storm tide of {{convert|9.34|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] with effects felt in parts of northern Pennsylvania including the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metro area]]. Some 1,260,000 citizens across the three states lost power because of the storm, and flooding left many in Pennsylvania homeless.<ref name="extremes0999"/>

In [[New York]], over 10&nbsp;inches of rain triggered [[mudslide]]s on the bluffs overlooking the [[Hudson River]] near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===New England ===
{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Floyd in New England}}
Floyd caused large power outages and flood damage across New England, with over five inches (130&nbsp;mm) of rain being dropped over most of the area. [[Danbury, Connecticut]] received up to {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain from the storm, resulting in extensive flooding in the city and surrounding areas. Mudslides were reported in the [[Berkshire Mountains]] of western [[Massachusetts]]. Several major highways and a countless number of local roads in Connecticut and Massachusetts were closed for several days due to flooding, and downed trees and power lines. Because New England had been in a severe [[drought]] leading up to Floyd, the storm's floodwaters quickly receded.<ref name="extremes0999"/>  East of Floyd's center, large trees were uprooted by the storm's 70&nbsp;mph winds, causing widespread power outages and minor structural damage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Canada ===

The remnants of Floyd continued into Canada entering the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]]'s area of responsibility on the evening and regional offices in [[Quebec]] and [[Atlantic Canada]] on September 16. Floyd became an extratropical low pressure system gradually losing strength and accelerating in the upper flow. In general, winds were below {{convert|90|km/h|mph}} over Canada. However near [[Quebec City]] (Quebec province), the weather station on [[<U+00EE>le d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] recorded gusts up to {{convert|119|km/h|mph}},<ref name="EC3">{{

==Aftermath==
===Criticism of FEMA===
[[Image:Floyd Tar River Flooding.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding in [[Greenville, North Carolina]] on the [[Tar River]]]]
The Hurricane Floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, [[Jesse Jackson]] complained to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Director [[James Lee Witt]] on his [[CNN]] program ''Both Sides Now'', "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... [it's] an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina." Witt responded, "We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly. And I think you're going to see a<U+2014>I think the people there will see a big difference [within] this next weekend!"<ref>{{

===Ecological effects===
[[Image:Floyd runoff.png|thumb|left|alt=A satellite image depicting run-off offshore of North Carolina|Runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane]]
Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds.

In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in [[Pamlico Sound]] and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after [[Hurricane Fran]] and [[Hurricane Bonnie (1998)|Hurricane Bonnie]], and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.<ref name="Legacy"/>

Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the Neuse River. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in Hurricane Fran, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.<ref name="usgs-flooding"/>

===Retirement===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the hurricane's destruction in North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired the name ''Floyd'' in the spring of 2000; it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with ''Franklin'' in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]].
