===Career===
Benson had an early role on the daytime soap ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' (1971-72). As a film star, Benson was popular for roles of teens in coming-of-age films, such as in 1972's ''[[Jory]]'' (his screen debut), and as ''Billy Joe McAllister'' in ''[[Ode to Billy Joe (film)|Ode to Billy Joe]]'' (1976). He was listed as one of twelve "Promising New Actors of 1976" in John Willis' Screen World, Vol. 28. [1976].

Other notable performances include ''[[Death Be Not Proud]]'' and ''[[Lucky Lady]]'', both in 1975, and ''[[One on One]]'' in 1977. Also in 1977 came the TV movie ''[[The Death of Richie]]'', co-starring actor [[Ben Gazzara]]. In 1981, he costarred with [[Rod Steiger]] in the film ''[[The Chosen]]''. 

In [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated feature film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', Benson demonstrated his vocal abilities by providing the voice of [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]. Some critics claim he did such a good job the voice was nearly unrecognizable as Benson's.  He would later reprise the role in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts series|Kingdom Hearts]]'' [[role-playing game]] series. This role led to other [[voice acting|voice]] work for animated features, including the widely popular [[Prince Valiant]] cartoon series. Benson also lends his voice to some [[computer and video game]] work, such as the voice of Prince Alexander in the computer game ''[[King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow]]''.

Benson directed over 101 episodes of sitcoms including [[Friends]], [[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina]], and an entire season of ''[[Ellen]].'' The Ellen sitcom paid homage to Benson's final [[Ice Castles]] line ("We forgot about the flowers.") in one episode.

===Personal life===
Benson is currently a visiting professor at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], having previously taught at [[Appalachian State University]] and the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name="Benson1">{{cite web
