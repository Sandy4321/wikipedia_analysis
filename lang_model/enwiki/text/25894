|accessdate=2006-12-14 }}</ref> Colbert created this definition of the word during the inaugural episode ([[October 17]], [[2005]]) of his satirical television program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', as the subject of a segment called [[The W<U+00F8>rd]]. It was named [[Word of the Year]] for 2005 by the [[American Dialect Society]] and for 2006 by [[Merriam-Webster]].<ref name="dialectsoc">{{cite web|url=http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year by American Dialect Society |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="mw">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm|title=Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref>

By using the term as part of his satirical routine, Colbert sought to criticize the use of "truthiness" as an [[appeal to emotion]] and tool of [[rhetoric]] in contemporary socio-political discourse.<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44705 |title=Interview: Stephen Colbert |author=Nathan Rabin |publisher=A.V.

==Origin of term==
Stephen Colbert came up with the idea of ''truthiness'' just moments before filming the premiere episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on [[October 17]], [[2005]]. <ref name="newsweek">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ |title=The Truthiness Teller |author=Marc Peyser |publisher=Newsweek |date=[[2006-02-13]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> He introduced the term in the first segment of the episode, in the following monologue: <ref name="word"/>

<blockquote><p>I will speak to you in plain, simple English. And that brings us to tonight's word: 'truthiness.' Now I'm sure some of the 'word police,' the 'wordinistas' over at [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's]] are gonna say, 'hey, that's not a word'. Well, anyone who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books.</p>
<p>I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today. 'Cause face it, folks; we are a divided nation. Not between [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], or [[American conservatism|conservatives]] and [[American liberalism|liberals]], or [[top (sex)|top]]s and [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]s. No, we are divided between those who think with their head, and those who ''know'' with their ''heart.''</p>
<p>Consider [[Harriet Miers]]. If you 'think' about Harriet Miers, of course her nomination's absurd. But the president didn't say he 'thought' about his selection. He said this:</p>
:(''video clip of [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]:'') 'I know her heart.'
<p>Notice how he said nothing about her brain? He didn't have to. He ''feels'' the truth about Harriet Miers.</p>
<p>And what about [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|Iraq]]? If you ''think'' about it, maybe there are a few missing pieces to [[rationale for the Iraq War|the rationale for war]]. But doesn't taking [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]] out ''feel'' like the right thing?</p></blockquote>

Colbert gave an [[Out of character|out-of-character]] interview with ''[[The Onion]]'''s [[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]], in which he responded to the question, "What's your take on the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart?" by elaborating on the critique he intended to convey with the word ''truthiness'':<ref name="avclub"/>
<blockquote><p>Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word...</p>
<p>It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the President because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a [[dichotomy]] in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true?...</p>
<p>Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I ''feel'' it to be true, but that ''I'' feel it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality.</p></blockquote>

Colbert had unknowingly reinvented the word ''truthiness'',<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/|title=The Truthiness Teller |author=Marc Peyser |publisher=Newsweek |date=[[2006-02-13]]|accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> which has a history in literature and appears in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) as a derivation of ''truthy'', and is indicated as rare or dialectal. Colbert's definition of the word was a novel invention, because the OED defines it as a variation of straightforward truthfulness. The prior existence of the word was brought to public attention by linguist and OED consultant Benjamin Zimmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002586.html|accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Language Log: Truthiness Or Trustiness?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/ |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Benjamin Zimmer homepage }}</ref>

==Rapid adoption by news media==
After Colbert's introduction of the term "truthiness", it quickly became widely used and recognized. Within a few months of its introduction by Colbert, "Truthiness" was discussed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. The [[February 13]], [[2006]], issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine featured an article on ''The Colbert Report'' titled "The Truthiness Teller."<ref name="newsweek"/> It recounted the career of the word ''truthiness'' since its popularization by Colbert.

===Television news coverage===
Six days after Colbert introduced ''truthiness'', [[CNN]]'s ''Reliable Sources'' featured a discussion of ''The Colbert Report'' by host [[Howard Kurtz]], who played a clip of Colbert mentioning truthiness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0510/23/rs.01.html |title=CNN Reliable Sources |author=Howard Kurtz (transcript) |publisher=CNN |date=[[2005-10-23]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

On the same day, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'' also reported on truthiness, prompting Colbert to respond by saying: "You know what was missing from that piece? Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised. ''Nightline'''s on opposite me<U+2026>"

===''The New York Times'' coverage===
In its [[October 25]], [[2005]] issue, eight days after the premiere episode of the ''Report'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran its third article on ''The Colbert Report'', penned by [[Alessandra Stanley]] and titled "Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482 |title=Bringing Out The Absurdity Of the News |author=Allesandra Stanley |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2005-10-25]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> The article specifically discussed the segment on ''truthiness'', although the ''Times'' misreported the word as ''trustiness''. In its [[November 1]], [[2005]] issue, the ''Times'' ran a correction clarifying that the W<U+00F8>rd had been ''truthiness'', not ''trustiness''. On the next episode of the ''Report'', Colbert took the ''Times'' to task for the error, (incorrectly) pointing out (with ironic relish) that ''trustiness'' is "not even a word".<ref>Many dictionaries (e.g. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html American Heritage], [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=trustiness Merriam-Webster], New Oxford Dictionary of English, etc.) offer definitions for ''trustiness''.</ref>

In its [[December 25]], [[2005]] issue, the ''Times'' again discussed ''truthiness'', this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's [[zeitgeist]], in an article titled "2005: In a Word; Truthiness" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting ''truthiness'', Steinberg said, "the [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html?ei=5090&en=0ad1e6ef6392c7da&ex=1293166800&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1137484544-pMx4vqbEIRjCInvXH5mFzg |title=2005: In A Word: Truthiness |author=Jacques Steinberg |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2005-12-25]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

In the [[January 22]], [[2006]] issue, columnist [[Frank Rich]] used the term ''truthiness'' seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito", to discuss [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] portrayals of several issues (including the [[Samuel Alito]] nomination, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] response, and [[Jack Murtha]]'s wartime record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word ''truthiness'' had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'' magazine reported on Rich's use of ''truthiness'' in his column, saying he "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882874 |title='NY Times' Frank Rich Taking Book Leave |author= |publisher=Editor and Publisher |date=[[2006-01-22]] |accessdate=2006-01-23 }}</ref><!-- Link now behind subscriber wall, but see contemporaneous access at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truthiness&diff=36386344&oldid=36321279, title at http://www.google.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.editorandpublisher.com%2Feandp%2Fnews%2Farticle_display.jsp%3Fvnu_content_id%3D1001882874&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official -->

The [[January 30]], [[2006]] issue of the ''Times'' included an article titled "How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness" by David Carr, although the article itself did not refer to ''truthiness''. Because the editors write the headlines in all stories for the ''Times'', the ''truthiness'' reference must have been added by the editors to describe the theme of Carr's article.<ref name="carr">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html |title=How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness |author=David Carr |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2006-01-30]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

''The New York Times'' published two letters on the dinner in its [[May 3]], [[2006]] edition, under the headline "Truthiness and Power".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/opinion/l03colbert.html?ex=1149652800&en=be69d253b7aa626d&ei=5070 |title= Truthiness and Power|author=Gloria D. Howard; William M. Phillian |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2006-05-03]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

==Widespread recognition==
Usage of "truthiness" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On [[January 5]], [[2006]], etymology professor [[Anatoly Liberman]] began an hour-long program on [[public radio]] by discussing ''truthiness'' and predicting that it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/programs/midmorning/listings/mm20060102.shtml |date=[[2006-01-05]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Where words come from }}</ref> His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the ''Macmillan English Dictionary'' featured ''truthiness'' as its Word of the Week a few weeks later. <ref name="mac">{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Word of the Week Archive}}</ref> ''Truthiness'' was also selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. Global Language Monitor, which tracks trends in languages, named ''truthiness'' the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, ''[[Wikipedia in popular culture#Wikiality|wikiality]]'', as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list. <ref name='top-tv-word-reuters'>{{cite news | url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=televisionNews&storyID=2006-08-27T165048Z_01_N27277446_RTRIDST_0_TELEVISION-EMMYS-WORDS-DC.XML | title="Truthiness," "Wikiality" named TV words of year | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=[[August 27]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref> <ref name='top-tv-word-language-monitor-website'>{{cite web | url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/wst_page11.html | title='Truthiness' and 'Wikiality' Named Top Television Buzzwords of 2006 Followed by 'Katrina', 'Katie,' and 'Dr. McDreamy' | publisher=Global Language Monitor | date=[[August 27]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-08-28 }}</ref>

On [[January 1]], [[2007]], [[Lake Superior State University]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] released its annual list of words it wants banned from the English language. "Truthiness" was among them, along with other words like "awesome" and celebrity couple nicknames like "Brangelina" and "TomKat." In response, on [[January 8]], [[2007]] Colbert stated that Lake Superior State University was an attention seeking second-tier state school.

===American Dialect Society's Word of the Year===
On [[January 6]], [[2006]], the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that ''truthiness'' was selected as its 2005 [[Word of the Year (American Dialect Society)|Word of the Year]].<ref name="dialectsoc"/> The Society described its rationale as follows:
<blockquote>In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted truthiness as the word of the year. First heard on ''The Colbert Report'', a satirical mock news show on The [[Comedy Central]] Channel<nowiki></nowiki><nowiki></nowiki>, truthiness refers to the quality of stating concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As Stephen Colbert put it, 'I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart.'</blockquote>
Apparently after realizing that ''truthiness'' was found in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the Society later changed the wording of this press release on their website, from "First heard on ''The Colbert Report''<U+2026>" to "Recently popularized on ''The Colbert Report''<U+2026>"

===Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year===
On [[December 10]], [[2006]], the Merriam-Webster dictionary announced that ''truthiness'' was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year, based on a reader poll, by a 5-to-1 margin over the second-place word ''google''.<ref name="mw"/> "We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs," said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. "'Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4389349.html|title=Colbert's 'truthiness' pronounced Word of the Year|author=Adam Gorlick|publisher=AP/Houston Chronicle|date=[[2006-12-08]]}}</ref> However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary.  In response to this omission, during "the word" segment on [[December 12]], [[2006]] Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured truthiness. To make room for the definition of "truthiness" (including a portrait of Colbert), the definition for the word "try" was removed with Colbert stating that it should have "tried harder."  He also sarcastically told viewers to 'not' download the new page and 'not' glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.

==Use in political and social commentary==
===James Frey controversy===
The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an editorial in its [[January 16]], [[2006]] issue titled "The Truthiness Hurts," crediting the rise of ''truthiness'' as serendipitously providing an apt description of the [[Oprah Book Club]] controversy over [[James Frey]]'s semi-fictional memoir ''[[A Million Little Pieces]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |title=The Truthiness Hurts |author=Chicago Tribune editorial board |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |date=[[2006-01-16]] |accessdate=2006-02-01 }}</ref><!-- see contemporaneous access at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truthiness&diff=37600469&oldid=37592567 --> ''Truthiness'' was also used to describe the Frey controversy by ''[[USA Today]]'' in its [[January 15]], [[2006]] issue,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-15-truth-debate_x.htm |title=Truth falls to "Pieces" after suspect memoir |author=Marco R. della Cava |publisher=USA Today |date=[[2006-01-15]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> by several other publications including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and by the television news program ''[[Nightline]]'' on its [[October 23]] and [[January 26]] editions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/opinion/22rich.html&OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&OP=716faa15Q2FJfr@JRGUhhRJaYYXJYlJaaJhsjpjhpJaaUj!Q5D0Q5DR1v |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |author=Frank Rich |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2006-01-22]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

[[Oprah Winfrey]] also discussed ''truthiness'' with [[Frank Rich]] on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column "Truthiness 101" Rich had recently published in the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml|date=[[2006-01-26]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Oprah Winfrey Show (transcript) }}</ref> They also mentioned Colbert's role in popularizing "truthiness."<ref name="carr"/>

On [[January 27]], [[MSNBC]] ran a commentary titled "Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert," making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a "small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness," but also opportunistic and too little too late.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11044071/ |title=Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness |author=Jon Bonn<U+00E9> |publisher=MSNBC |date=[[2006-01-27]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

===In the Canadian Parliament===
In 2006, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leadership contender [[Ken Dryden]] used ''truthiness'' as an extensive theme in a speech in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]].  The speech dealt critically with the current government's Universal Child Care Plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kendryden.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=64&Itemid=8&lang=en |date=[[2006-05-04]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Truthiness }}</ref> Dryden defined truthiness as "something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true."

===MoveOn===
[[MoveOn]] and Brave New Films launched a satirical petition campaign against Stephen Colbert and ''Truthiness'' entitled "Stop the Falsiness" in anticipation of MoveOn founder Eli Pariser's appearance on ''The Report''.

==Further use by Colbert==
After introducing "truthiness", Colbert has repeatedly referred to "truthiness" and his original definition of it, both on and outside of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.

===Alleged snubbing by the Associated Press, and Colbert's response===
The [[Associated Press]] reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |title=Honestly, "truthiness" is selected the word of 2005 |author=Heather Clark |publisher=The Seattle Times / Associated Press |date=[[2006-01-07]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:
<blockquote>Michael Adams, a professor at [[North Carolina State University]] who specializes in [[lexicology]], said "truthiness" means "truthy, not facty." "The national argument right now is, one, who's got the truth and, two, who's got the facts," he said. "Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going to make much progress."</blockquote>
On each of the first four episodes of the ''Report'' after the selection of ''truthiness'' as ''Word of the Year'', Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his "On Notice" board, and Associated Press reporter [[Heather Clark]], the author of the article, to his "Dead to Me" board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/notice/index.jhtml |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: On Notice (A Glaring Omission) }}</ref> On the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the "Threat-Down",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/threatdown/index.jhtml |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: Threatdown }}</ref> one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of [[bears]]. On the following episode he called Michael Adams and asked for an apology. Though Michael Adams never apologized, Colbert "accepted" his "apology", and took him "off notice".

====The Associated Press response to Colbert====
On [[January 13]], the first day after the four-day run of abuse of the AP on the ''Report,'' the AP ran a story about ''The Colbert Report'' being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled "Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |title=Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America |author=Jake Coyle |publisher=CBS News / Associated Press |date=[[2006-01-13]] |accessdate=2006-11-07 }}</ref> As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of ''truthiness''; excerpts of the story are:
<blockquote><p>"<U+2026>When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a [[tongue-in-cheek]] crusade, not unlike the kind his muse [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] might lead in all seriousness."</p>
<p>"'It's a [[sin|sin of omission]]<U+2026>' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday<U+2026>.'It's like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] still being alive and not asking him what ''[[Hamlet]]'' is about,' he said."</p>
<p>"The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s<U+2026>.'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.'"</p>
<p>"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as ''The New York Times'' wrote, 'a summation of what (Colbert) sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]] and [[CNN]].'"</p>
<p>"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized [[weapons of mass destruction]] reporting leading up to the [[Iraq War]]. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'"</p></blockquote>
On [[January 14]], Clark herself responded in an article titled "Exclusive 'News' <U+2014> I'm dead to Stephen Colbert."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |date=[[2006-01-14]]|accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Exclusive "News": I'm Dead to Stephen Colbert }}</ref> She furthered the rise of "truthiness" in published English in conceding, "Truthiness be told, I never had seen ''The Colbert Report'' until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week<U+2026>.But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time<U+2026>It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact."

===Arianna Huffington===
On [[January 31]], [[2006]], [[Arianna Huffington]] used ''truthiness'' on the [[Huffington Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/will-americas-new-love-a_b_14809.html |date=[[2006-01-31]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=Will America's New Love Affair With the Truth Extend to Bush's SOTU Speech? }}</ref> Huffington later appeared as a guest on the [[March 1]], [[2006]], episode of ''The Colbert Report.'' She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word ''truthiness''. During the interview, Colbert declared, "I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness's father." Huffington corrected him, citing [[Wikipedia]], that he had merely "popularized" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: "Fuck them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=59703 |date=[[2006-03-01]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos (Arianna Huffington) }}</ref>

===Veritasiness===
Also in 2006, after Colbert delivered the commencement speech at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] in [[Galesburg, Illinois]], he was presented with both an honorary degree and a purple T-shirt bearing a logo that reads, "[[Veritas]]iness Tour", creating a semi-[[Latin]]ized version of ''truthiness''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002613019 |title=Colbert Tells College Graduates: Get Your Own TV Show |author= E&P Staff |publisher=Editor and Publisher |date=[[2006-06-04]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

On [[April 29]], [[2006]], Colbert was the featured guest at the [[White House]] [[White House Correspondents' Association|Correspondents' Dinner]] and, in President Bush's immediate presence, described Bush's thought processes by repeating almost verbatim some of his original description of ''truthiness''. Colbert's effort at the WHCA dinner prompted ''truthiness'' to hit a new popularity peak in blog postings following the dinner <U+2014> even though he did not actually use the word at the dinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogpulse.com/trend?query1=truthiness&label1=&query2=&label2=&query3=&label3=&days=180&x=23&y=13 |date= |accessdate=2006-05-02 |title=Trend results: Truthiness }}</ref>

''Editor and Publisher'' again used ''truthiness'' to describe Colbert's criticism of President Bush, in an article published the same day entitled "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner <U+2014> President Not Amused?" ''E&P'' reported that the "blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush<U+2026> left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" and that many people at the dinner "looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting <U+2014> or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power."<ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29">{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363|publisher=Editor and Publisher|title=Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner <U+2014> President Not Amused?|author=E&P Staff|date=[[April 29]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-05-07}}</ref> ''E&P'' reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published a letter to the editor asserting that "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002426165 |title=Tuesday's Letters: Colbert Offensive, Colbert Mediocre, Colbert a Hero, Colbert Vicious, Colbert Brave  |author=E&P Staff |publisher=Editor and Publisher |date=[[2006-05-02]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref>

On the same weekend, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published transcripts of segments from ''The Colbert Report'' under the heading "dept. of truthiness;"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/29/AR2006042900126.html |title=Dept. of Truthiness: The Colbert Rapport |author= |publisher=The Washington Post |date=[[2006-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> [[Salon.com|Salon]] covered Colbert at the White House dinner in an article entitled "The Truthiness Hurts: Stephen Colbert's brilliant performance unplugged the Bush myth machine<U+2014>and left the clueless D.C. press corps gaping;"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |title=The truthiness hurts |author=Michael Scherer |publisher=Salon |date=[[2006-05-01]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 }}</ref> and the popular news program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on [[CBS]] featured an interview with Colbert by [[Morley Safer]], in which Safer discussed truthiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml |date=[[2006-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's "Fake" Newsman }}</ref>

Writing six months later in a column entitled "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] called Colbert's after-dinner speech a "cultural primary" and christened it the "defining moment" of the United States' [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].<ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/opinion/05rich.html | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | title=Throw the Truthiness Bums Out | first=Frank | last=Rich | authorlink=Frank Rich | date=[[November 5]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref><ref name="washpost-bubble-trouble">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/11/07/BL2006110700726_5.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Bubble Trouble | first=Dan | last=Froomkin | authorlink=Dan Froomkin | date=[[November 7]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref>

===Colbert ascribes truthiness to Wikipedia===
[[Image:Wikiality.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Colbert introduces the term "[[wikiality]]" as a theme related to truthiness.]]

In "The W<U+00F8>rd" on, July 31 2006, Colbert claimed that [[Wikipedia]] is an example of truthiness, and that it is his favourite website. He ironically praised Wikipedia, saying, "I love Wikipedia... any site that's got a longer entry on truthiness than on [[Lutherans]] has its priorities straight." He went on to say,

<blockquote>You see, any user can change any entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true.<U+2026> If only the entire body of human knowledge worked this way. And it can, thanks to tonight's w<U+00F8>rd: Wikiality. Now, folks, I'm no fan of reality, and I'm no fan of encyclopedias. I've said it before. Who is Britannica to tell me that George Washington had slaves? If I want to say he didn't, that's my right. And now, thanks to Wikipedia, it's also a fact. We should apply these principles to all information. All we need to do is convince a majority of people that some factoid is true.<U+2026> What we're doing is bringing democracy to knowledge.<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=72347 The Colbert Report / Comedy Central recording] of The W<U+00D8>RD "Wikiality", [[Comedy Central]], [[July 31]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT8BQALp9Cc YouTube recording] of [[The Colbert Report]], "Wikiality", [[Comedy Central]], [[July 31]] [[2006]].</ref></blockquote>
