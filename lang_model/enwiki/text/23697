'''''The Young Victoria''''' is a 2009 [[period drama]] film based on the early life and reign of [[Queen Victoria]], and her marriage to [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. The film was directed by [[Jean-Marc Vall<U+00E9>e]] and written by screenwriter [[Julian Fellowes]]. [[Graham King]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York]], and Tim Headington served as the film's producers. The film starred [[Emily Blunt]], [[Rupert Friend]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Jim Broadbent]] among a large ensemble cast.

Fellowes sought to make the film as historically accurate as possible. With this in mind, he hired [[Academy Award]]-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] and historical consultant [[Alastair Bruce, 5th Baron Aberdare]]. Filming for ''The Young Victoria'' took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, various aspects of the film have been criticized for historical inaccuracies. 

[[Momentum Pictures]] released the film in the United Kingdom, where it appeared in theaters on 6 March 2009. [[Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group]] opened ''The Young Victoria'' in [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on 18 December 2009 through [[Apparition (company)|Apparition]]. Critical reception was generally positive, and it scored a 76 percent rating on film review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based upon 139 reviews. The film was nominated for three [[82nd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], winning the 2010 [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]]. The film also won for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair|Best Make-Up and Hair]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[63rd British Academy Film Awards]].

== Plot ==
[[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria of Kent]] is the [[heiress presumptive]] to the throne during the last years of the reign of her uncle [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]]. She is raised under a strict set of rules devised by her mother (her [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|father]] having died when Victoria was a baby), the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]] and [[comptroller]] of the Duchess's household, [[John Conroy|Sir John Conroy]], who calls it the "[[Kensington System]]." Conroy hopes that William IV will die while Victoria is still a minor, thus the Duchess would be appointed Regent, and he would be the [[power behind the throne]] through his considerable control of the Duchess. Victoria grows rebellious and resentful of her mother and Conroy's oppressive control of her every move.  During an illness, her mother and Conroy attempt to force Victoria to sign papers that would make Conroy her personal secretary upon her majority.  Although weak and ill, Victoria is strong enough to vehemently refuse this ploy, throwing the papers on the floor. 

Her uncle [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I of Belgium]] wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Belgium]]. He realizes his sister, the Duchess, exerts little influence over Victoria and decides to have his nephew [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] seduce Victoria. Albert is trained by [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]] to learn Victoria's interests, including her favorite novels, music and opera. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by her uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert has returned home. 

To maintain control over Victoria, Conroy and the Duchess keep her away from the King's court, and are unhappy when she insists on attending the King's birthday reception. At the reception in [[Windsor Castle]], the King, stating his wish to be closer to Victoria, insults her mother in public twice. The King increases Victoria's income but this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King is outraged and sends the [[Whig (British political party)|liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] to advise her. Victoria agrees to appoint Lord Melbourne as her private secretary, and he appoints her [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], including the [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]]. 

King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], she announces, "I am young, but I am willing to learn. And I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people. I look for your help in this." Victoria moves into the recently completed [[Buckingham Palace]]. The Queen Dowager, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] advises Victoria against accepting all of Lord Melbourne's proposed ladies-in-waiting, but he persists. Lord Melbourne and Albert begin a battle for influence over Victoria. Albert goes to England to spend more time with Victoria. They bond further, dancing during her coronation and Albert hints at going further with their relationship but Victoria resists. 

Lord Melbourne loses a vote in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], leading Victoria to invite [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] of the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]] to form a new government. However, Victoria refuses to allow Peel to replace her ladies-in-waiting, who are allies of Lord Melbourne. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation, allowing Melbourne to continue as prime minister. The subsequent [[Bedchamber crisis|crisis]] damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. The loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters. She invites Albert to England and proposes marriage.

Victoria and Albert have a loving marriage, but Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness in the household. Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow Albert to take on more duties, which he does. He reorganizes the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. He also becomes Victoria's primary adviser, rejecting the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. He overreaches when he goes over Victoria's head in a matter with foreign diplomats, leading to a fierce argument between the two. One morning, while riding in a carriage together, Victoria is fired upon by a would-be assassin. Albert shields her, and his bravery leads to their reconciliation. 

The final title card explains that Victoria and Albert had nine children. Their descendants are the royal families of [[British Royal Family|Britain]], [[Spanish Royal Family|Spain]], [[Swedish Royal Family|Sweden]], [[Norwegian Royal Family|Norway]], [[House of Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>|Yugoslavia]], [[House of Romanov|Russia]], [[House of Gl<U+00FC>cksburg|Greece]], [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Romania]] and [[House of Hohenzollern|Germany]]. They reigned together for 20 years. Albert died from [[typhoid fever]] at age 42. In memory of him, Victoria had his clothes laid out every day until her death at age 81. Victoria and Albert championed reforms in education, welfare and industry. They also supported arts and sciences that were celebrated in [[the Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Victoria remains the longest reigning British Monarch to date.

==Production==
===Conception and writing===
It was [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York]] who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], and had written two books about her with the help of a historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both "fought for their love" in the midst of public scrutiny.<ref name=bruniinterview>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/movies/13ferguson.html?adxnnl=1&ref=movies&adxnnlx=1311878205-3F9WUNGwRGFzglZN3d3upA |first=Frank|last=Bruni |authorlink=Frank Bruni | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Duchess of York as Film Producer | date=10 December 2009 | accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> A friend set up a meeting with producer [[Graham King]],<ref name=bruniinterview/> to whom she pitched the idea along with several others.<ref name=wpostreinvent>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/18/AR2009121800070_2.html |first=Mary |last=Jordan |authorlink=Mary Jordan (journalist)| work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=With her film 'The Young Victoria," Sarah Ferguson reinvents herself yet again | date=20 December 2009 | accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> At the time wrapping up his work on ''[[The Departed]]'',<ref name=bruniinterview/> King, a native of Great Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years.<ref name=prodnotes/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-435236/Fergie-help-Scorsese-make-royal-film-life-Young-Victoria.html |first=|last=| work=[[The Daily Mail]] | title=Fergie to help Scorsese make royal film on life of 'Young Victoria'| date=9 February 2007 | accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> The producer later remembered, "she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria<U+2019>s early life: the precise span covered in ''The Young Victoria''. [After that the film] just fell into place."<ref name=bruniinterview/> King brought frequent collaborator [[Martin Scorsese]] on board as a co-executive producer, as the [[Academy Award]]-winning director knew "pretty much all there is to know about British history".<ref name=telegraphreview/> 

''[[Gosford Park]]'' screenwriter [[Julian Fellowes]] contacted King to present ideas for a script, and according to the producer, "[Fellowes] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks."<ref name=telegraphreview/> Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese.<ref name=prodnotes/> Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he wary of copying "the horror of biopics," where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, he thought it would be better suited for a television series or for another film.<ref name=filmprogramme/>

For the film's director, King wanted someone "who would steer us away from the traditional BBC-type costume drama," and "make a period movie for an [[MTV]] audience".<ref name=telegraphreview/> By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film ''[[C.R.A.Z.Y.]]'' by French-Canadian filmmaker [[Jean-Marc Vallee]], and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallee on their very first meeting.<ref name=telegraphreview/> Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallee agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time."<ref name=latimesblunt/> Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm going to do it my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I liked about her, this energy. [Victoria] was special and had this mystical quality."<ref name=latimesblunt/>

Academy Award-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] heard about the script and contacted King, who in turn hired her. Powell was granted exclusive access to Victoria's wedding dress and coronation robes while researching.<ref name=telegraphreview/> Based upon his work on ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' and his German nationality, Hagen Bogdanski was selected as the director of photography.<ref name=prodnotes/> Fellowes enlisted his friend [[Alastair Bruce, 5th Baron Aberdare]]'s help with the coronation ceremony's historical authenticity, which led to Bruce's employment as the film's historical consultant, his first film credit.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.sky.com/home/the-young-victoria-royal-expert-alastair-bruce-sees-history-in-the-making-on-the-set-of-new-movie/article/15230774 |first=Alastair|last=Bruce |authorlink=Alastair Bruce, 5th Baron Aberdare | publisher=[[Sky News]] | title=Sky Man Plays Key Role In Hollywood Film | date=27 February 2009 | accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref>

===Casting===

For the title role, King required the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress [[Emily Blunt]] read the script, and aware other actresses would fight for the part, she approached King early in the search process.<ref name=amcinterview>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/01/emily-blunt-interview.php |first=Jennifer |last=Vineyard| publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] | title=Q&A - Young Victoria's Emily Blunt Talks About Loosening the Corset and Letting It Rip | date=29 January 2010 | accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> Blunt later admitted she had a "non-existent knowledge" of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen "was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, and she was in a job where she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting".<ref name=amcinterview/> They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her [[Golden Globes]] acceptance speech for ''[[Gideon's Daughter]]''.<ref name=prodnotes/> Blunt noted, "I thought [Victoria] was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong-willed, was very fascinating to me... In my life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all the time. And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress."<ref name=latimesblunt>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/01/entertainment/ca-victoria1 |first=Mark |last=Salisbury | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Emily Blunt is 'The Young Victoria' | date=1 November 2009 | accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to [[Windsor Castle]], where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself.<ref name=amcinterview/>

Determined not to use any big Hollywood names,<ref name=telegraphreview/> King looked at many European actors before settling on British actor [[Rupert Friend]]. They were aware of him from the 2005 film ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]''. Vallee noted, "I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right. He had a very good understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He really looks the part, he looks so romantic!"<ref name=prodnotes/> Co-producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend "our [[Scarlett O'Hara]] search". They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height (6ft 1in) also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed "Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty."<ref name=telegraphreview/> The actor also thought their relationship was not "a gooey love story"; rather, their arguments showed it "wasn't an easy road by any means".<ref name=prodnotes/> Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano.<ref name=telegraphreview/> He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of "put[ting] in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other."<ref name=prodnotes/>

[[Paul Bettany]] was cast as Lord Melbourne despite being roughly twenty years too young for the part. Vallee explained, "We couldn't find a 58-year-old actor who was sexy and good-looking enough. Paul was a more than good enough actor to age from the inside, and he plays him as a great politician and a great seducer."<ref name=telegraphreview/> Early in the casting process the crew wanted to cast [[Miranda Richardson]] as the Duchess of Kent, and believed she had such great chemistry with Blunt that it became "genuinely uncomfortable watching them in a scene, as the scenes are so intense and real."<ref name=prodnotes/> [[Jim Broadbent]] and [[Mark Strong]] joined the cast as King William IV and Sir John Conroy, respectively,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.screendaily.com/young-victoria-cast-bulks-up-with-broadbent-richardson/4033835.article |first=Jeremy |last=Kay | work=[[Screen Daily]] | title=Young Victoria cast bulks up with Broadbent, Richardson | date=1 August 2007| accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> as did [[Harriet Walter]] as Queen Adelaide.<ref name=prodnotes/> Sarah Ferguson's elder daughter, [[Princess Beatrice of York]], made her film debut in a small cameo role.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-482973/Princess-Beatrice-appear-film-Victorias-royal-ascent.html |first=Baz |last=Bamigboye | work=[[The Daily Mail]] | title=Princess Beatrice to appear in film about Victoria's royal ascent | date=28 September 2007 | accessdate=20 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/article2273894.ece |first=Nadia |last=Mendoza | work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | title=Princess stars in Bea movies | date=26 February 2009 | accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>

In consideration of the expense of a film shot in England, King initially sought to film in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, he came to the realization that it was vital ''The Young Victoria'' be filmed in its native country for authenticity.<ref name=prodnotes/> Due to The Duchess of York's status and connections with the British royal family, ''The Young Victoria'' was able to film in many actual palaces and other landmarks.<ref name=bruniinterview/><ref name=wpostreinvent/> The film had a ten-week shoot starting in August 2007.<ref name=prodnotes>{{cite news| url=http://thecia.com.au/reviews/y/images/young-victoria-production-notes.pdf |first=|last=| publisher=Cinematic Intelligence Agency | title=The Young Victoria production notes | date= | accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> Scenes set at [[Westminster Abbey]] were filmed at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in September and October,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/7775430.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]] | title=Study examines cathedral's impact | date=10 December 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref> and [[Ham House]] was substituted for [[Kensington Palace]].<ref name=prodnotes/> [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Lancaster House]], and [[Ditchley Park]] doubled for internal scenes of the monarch's main residence, [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name=prodnotes/> Other scenes filmed at [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Arundel Castle]] in [[West Sussex]], [[Wilton House]] near [[Salisbury]], [[Balls Park]], and [[Belvoir Castle]] in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=prodnotes/> Week four of shooting was especially intensive, as filming was done at a different site each day, including Osterley Park, [[Old Royal Naval College|Greenwich Naval Base]], Ham House, [[Novello Theatre]] and Hampton Court.<ref name=telegraphreview/>

== Historical accuracy ==
Fellowes strove to make the script free of [[anachronism]]s, to the point where he became upset when actor [[Jim Broadbent]] ad-libbed and told someone to "Enjoy the meal" during a dinner scene, a phrase not proper for the time period.<ref name=nottinghaminterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Interview-Julian-Fellowes-Young-Victoria/story-12176435-detail/story.html |title=Interview: Julian Fellowes on The Young Victoria |first=Jennifer |last=Scott |work=[[Nottingham Post]] |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The writer commented, "Everything I have put into it is based entirely on fact. It just happens to be a story that not many people are familiar with."<ref name=telegraphreview/> Fellowes has remarked that while he would not alter the "fundamental truth", such as the characters' real relationships to each other, he strove to "use episodes to illustrate the journey you're taking your characters, and with them, your audience".<ref name=filmprogramme/>

[[File:2nd V Melbourne.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Unlike in the film, Lord Melbourne ''(pictured)'' was in actuality forty years Victoria's senior.]]

Although largely faithful to a selection of historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events in order to [[artistic license|increase dramatic potential]].<ref name=Tunzelmann>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/05/young-victoria |title=The Young Victoria: less chess, more Hungry Hungry Hippos |first=Alex |last=von Tunzelmann |authorlink=Alex von Tunzelmann |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/complete-english-history-in-movies/15.asp |title=The Complete History of England - In Movies - The Young Victoria (2009) |first=|last=|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/movies/Film-Review-Young-Victoria-.5045550.jp |title=Film Review: Young Victoria |work=[[The Scotsman]] |first=Alistair |last=Harkness |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's ''[[The Film programme|Film Programme]]'' that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.<ref name=filmprogramme>{{Cite episode |title=The Film Programme 06 March 2009 |series=The Film programme |serieslink=The Film programme |credits=[[Francine Stock]], [[Julian Fellowes]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4]] |airdate=3 March 2009 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/filmprogramme/filmprogramme_20090306.shtml}}</ref>

Another departure from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Unlike in the film Albert was not present at the ceremony; the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic.<ref name=filmprogramme/> According to Fellowes, "The scene where he (Conroy) is trying to make her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it's completely true", and "The scene in [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] where the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King]] stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two-thirds of his speech is what he actually said!"<ref>

===Critical reception===
The film currently holds a 76 percent 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 139 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/young_victoria# |title=The Young Victoria (2009) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave ''The Young Victoria'' a B+; he gave praise to Emily Blunt's performance and concluded, "''The Young Victoria'' has a subtler flow than you might expect, and at times it's calmer than you may like. Director Jean-Marc Vall<U+00E9>e's images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded <U+2028> princess fantasy <U+2014> it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20326004,00.html |title=The Young Victoria Review |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "frivolously entertaining film" and believed it was "directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vall<U+00E9>e".<ref name=nytimesreview/> Dargis finished her review, "Despite the filmmakers<U+2019> efforts to persuade us that ''The Young Victoria'' is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the movie<U+2019>s pleasures are as light as its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria<U+2019>s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours."<ref name=nytimesreview>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/movies/18young.html |title=Poor Little Royal Girl: A Melancholy Monarch |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Manohla |last=Dargis|authorlink=Manohla Dargis|date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>

Ide found Victoria and Albert's relationship to be "persuasive and rather charming," and praised the performances of both the main and supporting cast, particularly noting Bettany's scene-stealing performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5845713.ece |title=The Young Victoria |work=[[The Times]] |first=Wendy |last=Ide |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>

Less positive was [[Peter Bradshaw]], film critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who gave the film two out of five stars. While initially looking forward to Blunt's performance, he believed the "black-belt minx" actress was "never really allowed to let rip. All that coiled feline sensuality stay[ed] coiled".<ref name=guardianreview/> He thought the queen's relationship with Prince Albert "very, very unsexy", as their devotion "makes for a boring movie".<ref name=guardianreview/> Bradshaw did however praise the power dynamics around Victoria, but concluded "I spent an hour and three-quarters waiting for this movie to start. Where was the tang and the zing and the oomph of Fellowes's cracking script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park?"<ref name=guardianreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/06/the-young-victoria-film-review |title=Film review: The Young Victoria |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>
