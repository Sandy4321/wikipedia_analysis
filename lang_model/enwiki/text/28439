"'''Schoolin' Life'''" is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] for the deluxe edition of her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles album)|4]]'' (2011), which was sold exclusively at [[Target Corporation|Target]], in the United States. It was written by Knowles, [[The-Dream|Terius Nash]], Shea Taylor as well as [[Carlos McKinney]] while production was handled by Knowles, The-Dream, and Los Da Mystro. [[DJ Swivel|Jordan Young]], also known by his stage name DJ Swivel, mixed the song at New York's Jungle City Studios. Containing elements of [[dance-pop]] and [[disco]] music, "Schoolin' Life" is an [[tempo|uptempo]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[funk]] song, in which Knowles employs [[Death growl|guttural vocals]] and uses her [[whistle register]]. Having a [[retro]] nature, the song is built on a 1980s-inspired dance [[Beat (music)|beat]], and is instrumentally complete with old school [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum kit]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, and [[Horn (instrument)|horns]].

Lyrically, the song features Knowles schooling everyone from their 20s to their 50s. She gets feisty as she reflects on lessons she learned in her own life and affirms that she hasn't certified as a teacher, a preacher or a doctor, but is willing to perform their various duties regardless. "Schoolin' Life" was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted its aural resemblance to [[Prince (singer)|Prince]]'s prime work, praised its production, and coined it as one of the catchiest upbeat songs Knowles has ever recorded. It appeared on several critics' lists of the best songs of 2011. Following the release of ''4'', "Schoolin' Life" charted at number 155 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korean International Singles Chart]]. The song was used in the eighth season of the American television [[reality program]] and dance competition ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (season 8)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''. It was part of Knowles' [[set list]] during her [[revue]] ''[[Revel Presents: Beyonc<U+00E9> Live]]''.

"Schoolin' Life" was written by Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles, [[The-Dream|Terius Nash]], Shea Taylor, and [[Carlos McKinney]].

<blockquote>
I spent a lot of time after [Knowles] left the studio tightening up the rough. In fact, I'm sure she let me mix it just because I loved the track so much! I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals <U+2014> but a lot of it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.<ref name="sound" />
</blockquote>

Around 100 [[Track (CD)|tracks]] were used on "Schoolin' Life"; they were roughly split with 50 for the music and 50 for the vocals. As stated by Swivel, musically the aim of the mix was to take a large number of tracks and create a perfect balance. So, he used Waves<U+2019> Metaflanger on the percussion and some of the snares, and spent some time EQ<U+2019>ing. Swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on the lead vocal. The lead-vocal bus was multed to a second bus, and one of them was entirely crushed on a 50:1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold. He elaborated, "It creates a very gritty distorted sound in there, really low to taste, and it fills in the lead vocal very nicely. The crushed vocal runs quietly underneath."<ref name="sound" />

After completing the lead vocals, Swivel decided to rework the 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn<U+2011>out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: "There were a lot of tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and it was pretty much the last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track."<ref name="sound" /> The bar one [[guitar]] track of "Schoolin' Life" was entirely programmed. Similarly, the live [[drum]] section in the hook was actually done with programmed drums. Once the mixing was over, Swivel's impression were as follows:

<blockquote>
['Schoolin' Life] absolutely had to have its own space. There are percussion elements and a few random sounds in there too, plus the nice guitar track, but certainly the main challenge was for all of these tracks to be well balanced and individually audible. It really is very easy to overlook something like that, which can potentially completely change the sound of a record.<ref name="sound" />

He called "Schoolin' Life" as one "among the proper album's finest moments".<ref name="pitch"/> Daniel Koren of PMA noted that the song recalls some of The-Dream's most Prince-esque tracks, "Fast Car" and "Yamaha".<ref name="pma"/> Ian Walker of [[AbsolutePunk]] wrote:

<blockquote>
'I Miss You' and bonus track 'Schoolin' Life' both showcase opposite sides of that magnificent decade's musical spectrum. The former is a stripped down track carried mostly by a hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allowing Knowles and her morosely beautiful voice center stage ... The latter picks up the pace, peppered liberally with old-school horns and crashes. Knowles details her experiences growing up, but parallels can be drawn to the maturation she's going through on this very album. More than any song, 'Schoolin' Life' literally oozes confidence, providing an endearing edge to an already catchy track.<ref name="abs"/>
