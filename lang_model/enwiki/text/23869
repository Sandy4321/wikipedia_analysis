'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] ([[February 6]], [[1911]] &ndash; [[June 5]], [[2004]]) was the 40th [[President of the United States]] (1981<U+2013>1989) and the 33rd [[Governor of California]] (1967<U+2013>1975). Born in Illinois, Reagan moved to [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s, where he became an actor, President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), and a spokesman for [[General Electric]]. Reagan became involved in politics during his work for General Electric and switched parties from [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] in 1962. After delivering his "[[A Time for Choosing]]" speech in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s Presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California Governorship, which he won in 1966 and again in 1970. Defeated for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|Republican presidential nomination in 1968]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]], he won the nomination, as well [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|as the election, in 1980]].

Reagan advocated less government regulation of the economy, spoke against the welfare state, and argued that people should be allowed to keep most of what they earned,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy| accessdate= 2007-08-22|publisher =Council on Foreign Relations|date =June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M.}}</ref> though it is arguable to what extent this vision was achieved as president. He introduced fiscally-expansive economic policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]." After surviving an [[Reagan Assassination Attempt|assassination attempt]] during his first term, overseeing a period of economic growth,<ref name="Economic Growth">{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/longterm/longterm.htm|title=Taxes and Long-Term Economic Growth| accessdate= 2007-06-26|publisher =United States Congress|date=February 1997}}</ref> and ordering a [[Invasion of Grenada|military operation in Grenada]], Reagan was [[United States presidential election, 1984|reelected in a landslide]] in 1984. His administration soon saw a number of [[Reagan administration scandals|scandals]], however, most notably the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. 

Reagan instituted his policy of "[[peace through strength]]" in an [[Cold War|arms race]] with the Soviet Union. He rejected [[d<U+00E9>tente]] and confronted [[Communism]], famously portraying the USSR as an "[[Evil Empire]]" and [[Reagan Doctrine|supporting anti-Communist movements worldwide]]. He negotiated with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to shrink both countries' nuclear arsenals and help bring a peaceful end to the [[Cold War]].<ref>Appleby, Joyce (2003), pp. 924&ndash;26.</ref> Reagan left office in 1989 and was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 1994.

==Early life==
[[Image:Ronald Reagan in Dixon, Illinois, 1920s.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Reagan as a teenager in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]], [[Illinois]]]]
Reagan was born in an [[apartment]] above the [[Ronald Reagan Birthplace|local bank building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], [[Illinois]] on [[February 6]], [[1911]] to John "Jack" Reagan and Nelle Wilson Reagan. As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed him "Dutch", due to his "fat little Dutchman"-like appearance, and his "Dutchboy" haircut.<ref name= "Ronald Reagan Facts">{{cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/facts.html|title=Ronald Reagan Facts|accessdate= 2007-06-09|publisher=Reagan Foundation}}</ref> The nickname stuck with him throughout his youth. Reagan's family briefly lived in several Illinios towns, including [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], until 1919, when they returned to Tampico and lived above the [[H.C.

==Entertainment career==
===Radio and film=== 
[[Image:Ronald Reagan in Cowboy From Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan starred in ''Cowboy From Brooklyn'' in 1938]]
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan worked at radio stations [[WOC]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], and then [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games.<ref name= "Innocents at Home">{{cite book |last= Wills |first= Garry |title= Reagan's America: Innocents at Home |origyear= 1987 | publisher= Doubleday |location= Garden City, NY |pages= 109<U+2013>110}}</ref> While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studio.

His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939, he had appeared in 19 films.<ref name="Reagan Films">{{cite web |url= http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp |title= Ronald Reagan Hollywood Years | publisher = The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> Before  the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp|George "The Gipper" Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''.

===Military service===
After completing 14 home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve on [[April 29]] [[1937]], as a private assigned to Troop B, 322nd [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] at Des Moines, Iowa.<ref name= "Reagan in the Military"/> He was appointed [[Second Lieutenant#United States of America|Second Lieutenant]] in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on [[May 25]] [[1937]], and on [[June 18]] was assigned to the 323rd Cavalry.<ref name= "ACR Homepage">{{cite web |url= http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/ | publisher= 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment | title = History of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment |accessdate= 2007-03-07}}</ref>

Having served for five years in the Army Reserve, Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on [[April 18]] [[1942]]. Due to his nearsightedness, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas.<ref name="USSRR">{{cite web |url= http://www.reagan.navy.mil/about_reagan/ball_cap/ball_cap.htm |title= USS Ronald Reagan: Significance of Horse and Rider | publisher = U.S. Navy | accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at [[Fort Mason]], California, as liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office. Upon the request of the [[Army Air Force]] (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the Cavalry to the AAF on [[May 15]] 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the 1st Motion Picture Unit in [[Culver City, California]]. On [[January 14]] [[1943]] he was promoted to First Lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of ''This Is The Army'' at [[Burbank, California]]. Following this duty, he returned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit and was promoted to Captain on [[July 22]] [[1943]].<ref name= "Reagan in the Military"/>

In January 1944, Captain Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in [[New York City]] to participate in the opening of the sixth War Loan Drive. He was assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit, Culver City, California on [[November 14]] [[1944]], where he remained until the end of the World War II. He was recommended for promotion to Major on [[February 2]] 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on [[July 17]] of that year. He returned to [[Fort MacArthur]], California, where he was separated from active duty on [[December 9]] 1945.<ref name= "Reagan in the Military"/> By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF.<ref name= "Reagan in the Military">{{cite web |url= http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/military.html |title= Military service of Ronald Reagan | publisher = Ronald Reagan Presidential Library | accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>

===Television and SAG President===
[[Image:Ronald Reagan and General Electric Theater 1954-62.jpg|thumb|right|Television star Ronald Reagan as the host of General Electric Theater]]
Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and moved to television as the host of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', earning approximately $125,000 per year ($800,000 in 2006 dollars), until he was fired by General Electric in 1962.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/presidents/article-214225|title= Reagan, Ronald| publisher =Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.| accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.pbs.org/newshour/biography_pages/reagan/biography.html | title = Ronald Reagan 1911<U+2013>2004 | publisher = PBS Online NewsHour | accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref>  His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. 

Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in 1941, serving as an alternate. Following World War II, he resumed service and became 3rd Vice President in 1946.<ref name="SAG">{{cite web| url= http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html | title= Screen Actors Guild Presidents: Ronald Reagan | publisher = Screen Actors Guild | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was elected. He would subsequently be chosen by the membership to seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959.  Reagan led SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]], [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) hearings and the [[Hollywood blacklist]] era.<ref name="SAG"/>  

In 1947, as SAG President, Reagan testified before HUAC regarding the influence of Communists in the motion picture industry. Strongly opposed to communism, he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles, stating, "As a citizen, I would hesitate to see any political party outlawed on the basis of its political ideology. However, if it is proven that an organization is an agent of foreign power, or in any way not a legitimate political party&mdash;and I think the government is capable of proving that&mdash;then that is another matter. [...] but at the same time I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment."<ref name="HUAC">[http://www.twcnet.edu/cschutz/history-page/Consensus/Reagan-huac-testimony.html House Un-American Activities Committee Testimony Ronald Reagan.] Tennessee Wesleyan College, ([[October 23]] [[1947]]).

Reagan met actress [[Nancy Davis]] in 1949 after Davis contacted then-President of the Screen Actors Guild Reagan to help her with issues regarding her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood (Davis was mistaken for another Nancy Davis). Nancy described their meeting by saying, "I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close."<ref name= "Love Story"/> They were engaged at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on [[March 4]], [[1952]] at the Little Brown Church in the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref name= "Little Brown Church">{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places,0,1844441.story?page=2|title= Noteworthy places in Reagan's life|accessdate=2007-04-11|date= [[June 5]] 2004|publisher= The Baltimore Sun}}</ref> Ronald and Nancy Reagan had two children: [[Patti Davis|Patti]] (born 1952) and [[Ron Reagan|Ron]] (born 1958).

==Early political career==
An admirer of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Reagan supported the [[New Deal]] as well as the presidential candidacies of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956, and that of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960, as a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. His political loyalties soon shifted to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], however, for he thought that the Democrats had repudiated [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s beliefs and created a larger government.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 132</ref> Following the election of [[John F. Kennedy]], Reagan formally switched parties in 1962, saying "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."<ref name="LA Times Obituary 2"/> During his work for General Electric, Reagan wrote his own speeches, laboring diligently and daily upon his prose. Although he had speechwriters later in the White House, he continued editing, and even occasionally writing, many of them.<ref>Rollyson, Carl E. 2006. American Biography. iUniverse. 197</ref>

Two years after switching parties, Reagan joined the campaign of conservative Presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]]. Speaking on Goldwater's behalf, Reagan revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech given on [[October 27]], [[1964]]: "The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government set out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing."<ref name= "A Time for Choosing">{{cite web|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/40_reagan/psources/ps_choose64.html | title= A Time for Choosing | publisher = PBS | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The address soon became known as the "[[A Time for Choosing|Time for Choosing]]" speech, and is considered the speech that launched Reagan's political career.<ref>Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 36</ref>

==Governor of California, 1967<U+2013>1975==
[[Image:GOVREAGAN.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald and Nancy Reagan celebrate Reagan's gubernatorial victory at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California]]
California Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and charisma after his "Time for Choosing" speech,<ref name= "Governor of California">{{cite web |url= http://www.californiagovernors.ca.gov/h/biography/governor_33.html |title= Governor Ronald Reagan | | publisher = Governors of California, California State Libary | accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> and nominated him for [[Governor of California]] in 1966. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: "to send the welfare bums back to work", and in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], "to clean up the mess at Berkeley".<ref name="kahn">{{cite web | author = Kahn, Jeffery | publisher = UC Berkeley News | date = [[8 June]] 2004 | title= Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a target | accessdate=2007-03-30 | url= http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml}}</ref> He was elected, defeating two-term governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. "Pat" Brown]], and was sworn in on [[January 3]], [[1967]]. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.<ref>Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 47 </ref> 

Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the Presidential waters in 1968 as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement which included those from the party's far right. Reagan won the pledges of some 600 delegates, but [[Richard Nixon]] received 98% of the votes needed for the nomination.

[[Image:NIXONSandREAGANS.jpg|thumb|right|The Reagans meet with then-President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] in July of 1970]]
Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. In 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#"Bloody Thursday" and Its Aftermath|People's Park protests]] at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent [[California Highway Patrol]] officers onto the campus to quell the riots.<ref name="Cannon50">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50 </ref> On [[May 15]] of that year, the riots increased, and the officers resorted to using firearms, shooting and killing a 25-year-old San Jose, California man and injuring others.<ref name="Cannon50"/> Reagan then called out 2,200 [[United States National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to the university to crack down on the rioters.<ref name="Cannon50"/>

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act", in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50"/> The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51"/> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].<ref name="Cannon51"/>  He maintained that position later in his political career, [[wikiquote:Ronald Reagan#Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation .281983.29|writing extensively about abortion]].<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1984).  ''[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/10456929?tab=holdings Abortion and the conscience of the nation]''. Nashville: T. Nelson.  ISBN 0840741162 </ref>

Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" [[Jesse Unruh]], but chose not to seek a third term. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.<ref name= "Rest of Me"/> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[California v. Anderson|People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on [[April 12]], [[1967]], when Aaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin|San Quentin's]] gas chamber. 

===1976 presidential campaign===

First row, left to right: Senator [[Bob Dole]], Nancy Reagan, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, [[Susan Ford]], and [[Betty Ford]]]]
In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate; like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]] became the key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html |title= Biography of Gerald R. Ford | publisher = The White House | accessdate= 2007-03-29}} Ford considered himself a "a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs".</ref> He relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager [[John Sears]] of winning a few primaries early to seriously damage the lift-off of Ford's campaign, such as his victories in North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy disintegrated. Reagan ended up losing New Hampshire and later Florida.<ref name= "1976 Republican Results">{{cite web |url= http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html |title= 1976 New Hampshire Presidential Primary, [[February 24]] [[1976]] Republican Results | publisher = New Hampshire Political Library |accessdate= 2007-03-30}}</ref>

As the party's [[1976 Republican National Convention|1976 convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory, in thanks partly to New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania delegates. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Republican Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of Pennsylvania as his running mate. Nonetheless, Ford narrowly won, with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union.

===1980 presidential campaign===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1980}}
[[Image:Reagan 1980 campaign.jpg|thumb|right|Reagan campaigns with Nancy in South Carolina, 1980]]
The 1980 presidential campaign, led by [[William J. Casey]], was conducted in the shadow of the [[Iran hostage crisis]], with media networks reporting frequently on Carter's unavailing efforts to free the hostages. On the domestic front, Reagan attacked Carter's inability to deal with double-digit inflation, soaring interest rates, high unemployment, and slow economic growth. With respect to the economy, he quipped, "I'm told I can't use the word depression. Well, I'll tell you the definition. A recession is when your neighbor loses his job; depression is when you lose your job. Recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his!"<ref name= "Reagan Quotes">{{cite web |url=http://www.uncoverthenet.com/quotes/dir/559/1.php|title= Famous Ronald Reagan Quotes|accessdate=2007-04-02|year= 2007|publisher= UTN Enterprises Inc.}}</ref> Reagan also stated that America's military had fallen behind that of the Soviet Union, and that d<U+00E9>tente was a failure. 

Reagan's showing in the [[U.S. presidential debate|televised debates]] boosted his campaign. He deflected President Carter's criticisms with remarks like "there you go again", and a closing question to the audience in which he asked, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 221</ref> During the campaign, there was some speculation that former President Gerald Ford was to be the Vice Presidential nominee, but Reagan declined when Ford offered a power-sharing arrangement that would elevate the position of the vice-presidency. Instead, Reagan selected his opponent in the primaries, [[George H. W. Bush]], who had extensive international experience.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 216</ref>

Reagan swept to a landslide, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and  Washington, D.C.). Reagan won 50.7% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and Independent [[John B. Anderson]] (a liberal Republican) received 6.7%.<ref name= "1980 Results">{{cite web |url= http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980 |title= 1980 Presidential Election Results | publisher = Dave Liep's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> With the aid of [[Reagan Democrats]], blue collar Democrats who voted for him, he was able to carry states such as Michigan, New York and Massachusetts. [[United States Senate elections, 1980|Republicans captured the Senate]] for the first time since 1952, and [[United States House elections, 1980|gained 34 House seats]], but the Democrats retained a majority.

During his Presidency, Ronald Reagan pursued policies that reflected his optimism in individual freedom, expanded the [[American economy]], and contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref name="Freidel84">Freidel, Frank (1995), p. 84 </ref> The "Reagan Revolution", as it came to be known, aimed to reinvigorate American morale, and reduce the people's reliance upon government.<ref name="Freidel84"/> As President, Reagan kept a series of leather bound diaries, in which he talked about daily occurrences of his presidency, commented on current issues around the world (expressing his point of view on most of them), and frequently mentioned his wife, [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]].

In his first inaugural address on [[January 20]], [[1981]], which Reagan himself wrote,<ref>Murray, Robert K. & Blessing, Tim H. (1993); p. 80</ref> he addressed the the country's economic malaise arguing: "Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem." The Reagan Presidency began in an historic manner: just 30 minutes into his inaugural address, [[Iran Hostage Crisis|52 American hostages, held by Iran for 444 days]] were set free.<ref name="Iran Hostage Crisis">{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2021.html|title=Iran Hostage Crisis: November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981|accessdate= 2007-05-11|year= 2005|publisher= Online Highways}}</ref>.

====Assassination attempt====
{{main|Reagan assassination attempt}}
On [[March 30]], [[1981]], only 69 days into the new administration, Reagan, his press secretary [[James Brady]], and two others were struck by gunfire from a deranged would-be assassin, [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]. Missing Reagan<U+2019>s heart by less than one inch (2.5 cm), the bullet instead pierced his left lung, which likely saved his life.

===="Reaganomics" and the economy====
{{main|Reaganomics}}
[[Image:REAGANWH.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Reagan's official portrait hangs in the White House]]
When Reagan entered office, the American economy's [[inflation]] rate stood at 11.83%, and [[unemployment]] at 7.1%. Reagan implemented policies based on [[supply-side economics]], seeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-board [[tax cuts]].<ref name="Cannon99">Cannon, Lou (2001) p. 99</ref><ref name="Appleby923924">Appleby, Joyce (2003), pp. 923<U+2013>924</ref> He aimed to reduce the growth of domestic government spending, cut back on excess regulation, and institute a sound currency policy which would end inflation.<ref name= "Reaganomics">{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Reaganomics.html|title=Reaganomics|accessdate= 2007-05-22|author=William A.

His policy of "[[peace through strength]]" resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup, including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Bartels, Larry M.|title=Constituency Opinion and Congressional Policy Making: The Reagan Defense Build Up|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1991|volume=85| issue=2|pages= 457&ndash;474}}</ref>

Reagan reappointed [[Paul Volcker]] as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], and in 1987 appointed monetarist [[Alan Greenspan]] to succeed him. Some economists, such as [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Robert A. Mundell]], argue that Reagan's tax policies invigorated America's economy, and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.<ref name="Reagan's Economic Legacy"/> Other economists, such as Nobel Prize winner [[Robert Solow]], argue that the deficits were a major reason why Reagan's successor, [[George H.W.

====War on Drugs====
Midway into his second term, Reagan declared more militant policies in the "[[War on Drugs]]". He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.<ref name="TimeLamar">{{Citation | last =Lamar, Jr. | first =Jacob V. | title =Rolling Out the Big Guns   | journal =Time Magazine   | date= [[1986-09-22]] | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}</ref><ref name= "The Drug War">{{cite web |url= http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm |title= The Drug War as Race War |accessdate= 2007-04-11 |author= Randall, Vernellia R |date= [[April 18]] 2006|publisher= The University of Dayton School of Law}}</ref> On [[October 27]], [[1986]], President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law, which budgeted $1.7 billion dollars to fund the War on Drugs, and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.<ref name="PBS Frontline">{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/ | title= Thirty Years of America's Drug War | publisher = PBS Frontline | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>

The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population, because of the differences in sentencing for [[Crack cocaine|crack]] versus powder [[cocaine]].<ref name="PBS Frontline"/> Critics also charged that the administration's policies did little to actually reduce the availability of drugs or crime on the street, while resulting in a great financial and human cost for American society.<ref name= "Stop the Drug War">{{cite web |url= http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/341/reagan.shtml | publisher = stopthedrugwar.org | title= The Reagan-Era Drug War Legacy | date = [[2004-06-11]] | accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use.<ref name= "Youth Trends">{{cite web |url= http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html | title=  NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends | publisher = National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref><ref name= "Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=PBS Frontline|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it probably had a good effect in terms of decreasing initiation and use.

[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], [[Nancy Reagan]], made the War on Drugs one of her main priorites, by founding the "[[Just Say No]]" anti-drug association, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in [[recreational drug use]] by offering various ways of saying "no". Mrs. Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.<ref name="Just Say No!">{{cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4297405/|title=The 'just say no' first lady| publisher =MSNBC| date = [[February 18]], [[2004]] | accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

====Judiciary====
During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 280</ref> That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. In his second term, Reagan elevated [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed [[Warren Burger]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], and named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the vacant seat. However, in 1987, Reagan lost a significant political battle when the Senate rejected the nomination of [[Robert Bork]], but [[Anthony Kennedy]] was eventually confirmed in his place.

====Lebanon and Grenada, 1983====
{{main|Invasion of Grenada}}
[[Image:REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan meets with Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]] of [[Dominica]] in the [[Oval Office]] about ongoing events in [[Grenada]].]]
American peacekeeping forces in [[Beirut]], a part of a multinational force (MNF) during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], were attacked on [[October 22]], [[1983]]. The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]], in which 241 American servicemen were killed by suicide bombers, was the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], and the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States military since the first day of the [[Tet offensive]]. Reagan called the attack "despicable," pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon, and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in [[Baalbek]], Lebanon, which housed Iranian Revolutionary Guards believed to be training [[Hezbollah]] fighters,<ref>{{cite paper|title=Anne Dammarell et al. v.

Besides a few shellings, there was no serious American retaliation, and the Marines were moved offshore where they could not be targeted. On [[February 7]], 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon. This was completed on [[February 26]]: the rest of the MNF was withdrawn by April.

Three days later, U.S. forces invaded [[Grenada]], where a 1979 ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'' had established a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government aligned with the Soviet Union and Cuba. The Grenadan government began military expansion and construction of an international airport with Cuban assistance. On [[October 13]], 1983, a faction led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power. A formal appeal from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited the regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St. George's University as adequate reasons to invade.

===1984 presidential campaign===

[[Image:ElectoralCollege1984-Large.png|thumb|right|1984 Presidential electoral votes by state. Reagan (red) won every state, with the exception of [[Minnesota]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in [[Dallas, Texas]], on a wave of positive feeling bolstered by the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]] that summer. He became the first American president to open a summer Olympic Games held in the United States.<ref name= "LA Olympics">{{cite web |url= http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html |title= Los Angeles 1984 | publisher = Swedish Olympic Committee | accessdate=2007-03-07}} </ref>

Reagan's opponent in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, many wondered if he was up to the task of being president for another term.<ref name= "The Debate">{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp |title= The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan| publisher = National Review Online | date = [[October 04]], 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, stating, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," which generated applause and laughter from members of the audience, and even from Mondale himself.<ref name= "1984 Presidential Debates">{{cite web |url= http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/ |title= 1984 Presidential Debates| publisher = CNN | accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]], Reagan was re-elected, winning 49 of 50 states. The president's landslide victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota (by 3800 votes) and the District of Columbia. Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes total (of 538 possible), and received 58.8% of the popular vote to Mondale's 40.6%.<ref name= "Election Results">{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1984|title=1984 Presidential Election Results| publisher = David Leip| accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

===Second term, 1985<U+2013>1989===
[[Image:President Reagan being sworn in for second term in the rotunda at the U.S. Capitol 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as President in the Capitol Rotunda]]
Reagan was sworn in as President for the second time on [[January 20]], [[1985]], in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. The public ceremony took place in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] the next day, because [[January 20]] fell on a Sunday, and thus no public celebration was held. [[January 21]] was one of the coldest days on record in [[Washington, D.C.]], and due to the low temperatures inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol.

On [[July 13]], [[1985]], Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon, causing the first-ever invocation of the Acting President clause of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]],<ref name="25th Amendment">{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/812.html|title=What is the 25th Amendment and When Has It Been Invoked?|publisher=History News Network|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> and on [[January 5]], [[1987]], Reagan underwent surgery for prostate cancer which caused further worries about his health. At the time, the President was 76 years old.

In 1985, Ronald and Nancy Reagan visited a cemetery in [[Bitburg|Bitburg, Germany]], where Reagan was to lay a wreath. Some Jewish leaders criticized him for deciding to visit the cemetery, after they discovered that 47 [[Waffen SS]] men were buried there.<ref>Reeves, Richard (2005), p. 249</ref> [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Elie Wiesel]] pleaded with Reagan not to go, stating, "May I, Mr. President, if it is possible at all, implore you to do something else, to find a way, to find another way, another site."<ref>Reeves, Richard (2005) p. 250</ref> Reagan argued that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], and in the end, two retired generals laid the wreath in the cemetery with Reagan present.<ref> Reeves, Richard (2005) p. 255</ref>In 1983, and again in 1984, Reagan told prominent Israelis and American Jews <U+2014> notably Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] of Israel, [[Simon Wiesenthal]], and Rabbi Martin Hier of [[Los Angeles]] <U+2014> of his personal experience ''vis-<U+00E0>-vis'' the [[Holocaust]], saying "I was there" and that that he himself had assisted personally at the liberation of Nazi death camps; in fact, he was in a film unit in Hollywood that processed raw footage it received from Europe for newsreels, but Reagan was not in Europe during the war.<ref>Morris (1999), p. 113 </ref>

Reagan's administration was criticized for its slow response to the [[HIV]]-[[AIDS]] epidemic, until the illness of movie star and national icon [[Rock Hudson]] became public news in July 1985, by which time over 10,000 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS, and over 6,000 had died.<ref name= "AIDS">{{cite web |author=Osmond, Dennis H | url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-01-03#S1.4X|title=Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in the United States|publisher=University of California San Francisco|date=March 2003|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> 

====Immigration====
In 1986, Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA). The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately 3 million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to [[January 1]], 1982 and lived there continuously. Critics of the act claim that its laws subjecting employers to sanctions were without teeth and that it failed to stem illegal immigration.<ref>{{cite web | author = Graham, Otis | date = [[January 27]], 2003 | url = http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html | title = Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake | publisher = The American Conservative | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans."<ref>Reagan, Ronald ([[November 6]], 1986) [http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/110686b.htm Statement on Signing the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.] Collected Speeches, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

In 1986, the Reagan Administration was found to have illegally sold arms to [[Iran]] to fund the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]], which was specifically outlawed by act of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=CNN| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/reagan.years/whitehouse/iran.html|title=The Iran Contra scandal| date =2001| accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> The [[Iran-Contra Affair]] became the largest [[American political scandals|political scandal]] in the United States during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|last = Parry| first = Robert|title = NYT's apologies miss the point |publisher = consortiumnews.com|date = [[2004-06-02]]|url = http://www.consortiumnews.com/2004/060204.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot's existence and quickly called for an Independent Counsel to investigate, but while the arms sales and hostage releases were going on, Reagan allegedly signed a presidential finding authorizing the actions after they had begun.<ref>{{cite news | title = Witness Says Poindexter Did Not Hide Missile Deal Iran-Contra: But CIA official testifies former White House aide omitted facts during briefing of lawmakers| author = Jackson, Robert L | publisher = Los Angeles Times | date = [[March 24]], [[1990]]}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]], whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed,<ref>{{cite journal | author= Morrison, Fred L. | title=Legal Issues in The Nicaragua Opinion| journal=American Journal of International Law | year=January 1987 | volume=81 | issue=| pages= 160-166| url= http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/55750.html}}</ref> ruled that the U.S. had violated international law in Nicaragua<ref>{{cite news|title = Managua wants $1B from US; demand would follow word court ruling | work =Associated Press | publisher = Boston Globe| date = [[June 29]], 1986}}</ref> due to its treaty obligations and the customary obligations of international law not to intervene in the affairs of other states.

Reagan appointed two Republicans and one Democrat ([[John Tower]], [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Edmund Muskie]], known as the "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, thus making the diversion of funds to the Contras possible.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy| date =2004| accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy| date =2004| accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref>

In a famous address on [[June 8]], [[1982]] to the [[British Parliament]], Reagan called the Soviet Union an "[[Evil Empire]]" that would be consigned to the "ash heap of history."

[[Image:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan speaks at the [[Berlin Wall]], and challenges [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall]]!"]]
Ronald Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet Leader to go further with his reforms. Gorbachev agreed to meet Reagan in four summit conferences around the world: the first in Geneva, Switzerland, the second in Reykjav<U+00ED>k, Iceland, the third held in Washington, D.C., along with the fourth summit in Moscow, Russia.<ref name= "Summits">{{cite web |url=http://www.ronaldreaganweb.com/ronaldreaganweb/ReaganGorbachevSummitMeetings.htm|title=Reagan-Gorbachev Summit Meetings|accessdate= 2007-05-14|publisher= ronaldreaganweb.com}}</ref> Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to look at the prosperous American economy, they would embrace free markets and a free society. Gorbachev, facing severe economic problems at home, was swayed.<ref name= "The Thawing of the Cold War"/>

Speaking at the [[Berlin Wall]], on [[June 12]], [[1987]], Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further: {{cquote|General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, [[tear down this wall]]!}}

When Gorbachev visited Washington, D.C. for the third summit in 1987, he and Reagan signed the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty]] at the White House (they finalized it a year later), which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.<ref name="INF Treaty">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/inf1.html#treaty|title= INF Treaty|accessdate=2007-05-28|publisher= US State Department|}}</ref>

In his autobiography ''An American Life'', Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted, his warm feelings for Gorbachev, and his concern for Gorbachev's safety because he pushed reforms so hard: "I was concerned for his safety," Reagan wrote. "I've still worried about him. How hard and fast can he push reforms without risking his life?"<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 720 </ref>  In 1990, the Berlin Wall was torn down and a year later the Soviet Union collapsed.

====Close of the Reagan era====
In 1988 George H. W. Bush, Reagan's Vice President, was elected President of the United States. On [[January 11]], [[1989]] Reagan addressed the nation for the last time on television from the [[Oval Office]], nine days before handing over the presidency. On the morning of [[January 20]], Ronald and Nancy Reagan escorted the Bushes to the Capitol Building, where Bush took the [[Oath of Office]]. The Reagans then boarded a [[Marine One|Presidential helicopter]], and flew to [[Andrews Air Force Base]] in Maryland. There, they boarded the [[VC-137C SAM 27000|Presidential Jet]] and flew to California<U+2014>to their new home in the wealthy suburb of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Reagan was the oldest president to have served (at 77), surpassing [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was 70 when he left office in 1961.

In 1992, President Reagan established the [[Ronald Reagan Freedom Award]] with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.

As the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed his mental capacity and his family decided that he would live in quiet isolation. On [[February 6]], [[2001]], Reagan reached the age of 90, becoming the third former President to do so (the other two being [[John Adams]] and [[Herbert Hoover]]). Just three weeks before, Reagan had undergone hip-replacement surgery; because of this and his Alzheimer's disease, his 90th birthday was a low-key celebration with his family at his home in Bel-Air. With the progression of the disease, Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent, and Nancy Reagan told CNN's [[Larry King]] that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that "Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was."<ref name= "Nancy Reagan Reflects">{{cite web |url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/04/lklw.00.html |title= Nancy Reagan Reflects on Ronald | publisher = CNN transcripts, Larry King Live Weekend | date = [[March 4]] 2001 | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> Since his diagnosis and his death, Mrs. Reagan has become a [[stem-cell research]] advocate, urging [[United States Congress|Congress]] and President [[George W.

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a strong faith in the goodness of people, stemming from the teachings of his mother, Nelle's, optimistic faith.<ref>Kengor, Paul (2004), p. 16 </ref> The young Ronald Reagan learned Christian tolerance, a strong sense of personal responsibility, sobriety, and faith in the goodness of God's creation.<ref>Kengor, Paul (2004), p. 10 </ref> Reagan was opposed to discrimination, recalling a time in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]] when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there.

Reagan died at his home in Bel-Air, California, at 1:00 PM PDT on [[June 5]], [[2004]]. A short time after his death, Nancy Reagan released a statement saying: "My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has passed away after 10 years of Alzheimer's Disease at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers." Reagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California later in the day, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American Flags in the grass.<ref>{{cite news | last = Leigh | first = Andrew | date = [[June 07]] [[2004]] | url= http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/leigh200406071201.asp |title= Saying Goodbye in Santa Monica | publisher = National Review | accessdate=2007-03-09 |format= |work= }}</ref> On [[June 7]], his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where a brief family funeral service was held.

On [[June 9]], Reagan's casket was flown to Washington D.C. where he became the 10th United States president to [[lie in state]]. In the thirty-four hours that it lay there, 104,684 people filed past the coffin.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.uscapitolpolice.gov/pressreleases/2004/pr_06-11-04.php | title = Lying In State for former President Reagan | date = [[June 11]], [[2004]] | publisher = U.S. Capitol Police | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>

On [[June 11]], a [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|state funeral]] was conducted in the [[Washington National Cathedral]], and presided over by President George W. Bush. Eulogies were given by former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], former Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], and both Presidents Bush. Also in attendance were [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and many world leaders, including British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr<U+00F6>der]], Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], and interim presidents [[Hamid Karzai]] of Afghanistan, and [[Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer|Ghazi al-Yawer]] of Iraq.

After the funeral service, the Reagan entourage was flown back to California<U+2014>to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library<U+2014>where another service was held, and President Reagan was interred. He is the second longest-lived president in U.S. history and was the first United States president to die in the 21st century. His was the first state funeral in the United States since that of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1973.

Reagan is one of America's most popular presidents. In several recent [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|ratings]] of American presidents, he ranked high.  A [[Gallup Organization]] February 2007 poll asked respondents to name the greatest president in U.S. history; Reagan came in second, capturing 16% of the vote, after [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pollingreport.com/wh-hstry.htm |title= Presidents and History | publisher = pollingreport.com | accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> He ranked fifth in an ABC 2000 poll of the public and ninth in a [[Rasmussen Reports]] 2007 poll of Americans.
