The '''Sablatnig P.III''' was an airliner produced in Germany in the early 1920s.<ref name="JEA">Taylor 1989, p.787</ref> 

==Development==
A contemporary account identifies the P.III as Germany's first aircraft purpose-designed as a commercial passenger plane.<ref name="Flight 521">"The Sablatnig P.3 Monoplane", p.521</ref><ref name="WagnerPIII"/> It was a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane of conventional design powered by a single engine in the nose (either a 200-hp Benz, or a 260-hp Maybach).<ref name="Flight 521"/> Later the British 258-hp [[Armstrong Siddeley Puma]] engine was the usual power plant.<ref>Wagner 1987 p. 259</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Papers by Command, Volume 9|author=Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons|page=21}}</ref> The crew of two, a pilot and a navigator or mechanic, were accommodated in separate open cockpits in tandem. These were behind the enclosed six seat passenger cabin in the center of the fuselage.<ref name="Flight 525">"The Sablatnig P.3 Monoplane", p.525</ref> Passengers entered the cabin through a door directly from the ground, rather than having to climb over the side of the aircraft, or up a ladder. The P.III's cabin offered passengers the comfort of an expensive automobile.<ref name="WagnerPIII"/> The structure was of wood throughout, with the fuselage skinned in plywood.<ref name="Flight 523<U+2013>24">"The Sablatnig P.3 Monoplane", p.523<U+2013>24</ref> The wings and horizontal stabiliser folded for storage or rail transport, and indeed, P.IIIs carried their own tent as a portable hangar.<ref name="Flight 524">"The Sablatnig P.3 Monoplane", p.524</ref><ref> [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200524.html FLIGHT page 524]</ref><ref name="WagnerPIII"/>

==Operational history==
This aircraft was one of the few approved as a civilian, not military type by the [[IL<U+00DC>K]] (''Interallierte Luftfahrt-<U+00DC>berwachungs-Kommission'', Inter-allied Aviation Control Commission) for production in Germany after World War I.<ref name="HPM">Hirschel, Prem & Madelung 2004, p.56</ref> However under the Treaty of Versailles all aircraft production was forbidden in Germany for a period of six months during the year 1920, and all existing aircraft, both military and civilian, and including aircraft built after the end of World War I, had to be either handed over to the Allied military or destroyed. As a result Sablatnig ceased building aircraft. Apparently the existing P.IIIs were either hidden or smuggled out of Germany.

17 Sablatnig P.IIIs were registered in Germany in and after 1921. Fritz Sablatnig, the owner of the [[Sablatnig]] company, estimated total production at 30 to 40 examples, including 12 made in Estonia by Dwigatel.<ref> Wagner 1987 p. 262></ref>   

The P.III entered service with a number of airlines in Germany and other countries, including [[Lloyd Luftverkehr Sablatnig]], [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], [[Danish Air Express]], [[Aeronaut (airline)|Aeronaut]], as well as with the [[Swiss Air Force]].<ref name="JEA"/>
