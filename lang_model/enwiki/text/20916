'''Toughened''' or '''tempered glass''' is [[glass]] that has been processed by controlled [[heat treatment|thermal]] or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass.  Tempered glass is made by processes which create balanced internal stresses which give the glass strength. tempered glass will usually shatter into small fragments instead of sharp shards when broken, making it less likely to cause severe injury and deep lacerations. For its safety and strength, tempered glass is used in a variety of demanding applications, like for vehicle windows, glass doors and tables, as a component of [[bulletproof glass]], for diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware.

==Properties==
Toughened glass is strong, has enhanced thermal resistance, and breaks into small cuboid fragments rather than shards and is less likely to cause injury.  

The greater contraction of the inner layer during manufacturing induces compressive stresses in the surface of the glass balanced by tensile stresses in the body of the glass. This compressive stress on the surface of the glass is typically as high as 50 MPa. It is this compressive stress that gives the toughened glass an increased strength. This is because any surface flaws tend to be pressed closed by the retained compressive forces, while the core layer remains relatively free of the defects which could cause a crack to begin. However, the toughened glass surface is not as hard as annealed glass and is slightly more susceptible to scratching. To prevent this, toughened glass manufacturers apply various coatings and/or laminates to the surface of the glass.

Tempered glass must be [[annealed glass|annealed]] to remove its internal stresses before cutting or grinding.

The strain pattern resulting from tempering can be observed with polarized light or by using a pair of [[polarized]] sun glasses.

==Uses==
Toughened glass is used when strength, thermal resistance and safety are important considerations.  The most commonly encountered tempered glass is that used for side and rear windows in automobiles, used for its characteristic of shattering into small cubes rather than large shards.  Tempered glass is also used in buildings for unframed assemblies (such as frameless doors), structurally-loaded applications, and any other application that would become dangerous in the event of  human impact. Toughened glass is used in some cell phones such as the [[Apple iPhone]] and [[LG Secret]] due to its scratch-resistant properties.

Rim tempered indicates a limited area such as the rim of the glass or plate is tempered and is popular in food service.

===Cooking and baking===
Some forms of tempered glass are used for [[cooking]] and [[baking]].  Manufacturers include [[Pyrex]], [[Corelle]], and [[Arc International (tableware)|Arc International]].

==Manufacturing==
Toughened glass is made from [[annealing (glass)|annealed glass]] via a thermal tempering process. The glass is placed onto a roller table, taking it through a furnace that heats it above its annealing point of about 720 <U+00B0>C. The glass is then rapidly cooled with forced air drafts while the inner portion remains free to flow for a short time.

An alternative chemical process involves forcing a surface layer of glass at least 0.1mm thick into compression by [[ion exchange]] of the sodium ions in the glass surface with the 30% larger potassium ions, by immersion of the glass into a bath of molten potassium nitrate. Chemical toughening results in increased toughness compared with thermal toughening, and can be applied to glass objects of complex shape.<ref>H.G. Pfaender (1996) Schott guide to glass.

==Advantages==
The term toughened glass is generally used to describe fully tempered glass but is sometimes used to describe heat strengthened glass as both types undergo a thermal 'toughening' process.

There are two main types of heat treated glass, heat strengthened and fully tempered. Heat strengthened glass is twice as strong as annealed glass while fully tempered glass is typically four to six times the strength of annealed glass and withstands heating in microwave ovens. The difference is the residual stress in the edge and glass surface. Fully tempered glass in the US is generally above 65 MPa while Heat Strengthened glass is between 40 and 55 MPa.

It is important to note that while the strength of the glass does not change the deflection, being stronger means that it can deflect more before breaking.{{fact|date=January 2008}} Annealed glass deflects less than tempered glass under the same load, all else being equal.

==Disadvantages==
Toughened glass must be cut to size or pressed to shape before toughening and cannot be re-worked once toughened. Polishing the edges or drilling holes in the glass is carried out before the toughening process starts. Due to the balanced stresses in the glass, damage to the glass will eventually result in the glass shattering into thumbnail-sized pieces. The glass is most susceptible to breakage due to damage to the edge of the glass where the tensile stress is the greatest, but shattering can also occur in the event of a hard impact in the middle of the glass pane or if the impact is concentrated (for example, striking the glass with a point). Using toughened glass can pose a security risk in some situations due to the tendency of the glass to shatter completely upon hard impact rather than leaving shards in the window frame<ref>{{cite book | first1=Robert L. | last1=O'Block | first2=Joseph F. |last2=Donnermeyer | first3=Stephen E.| last3=Doeren | title=Security and Crime Prevention | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=1991| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qE13qQz7OJgC&pg=PA118 | quote=The security value of tempered glass, however, is questionable. Although it will resist a brick or rock, it is susceptible to sharp instruments such as ice  picks or screwdrivers. When attacked in this manner, tempered glass tends to crumple easily and quietly, leaving no sharp edges.}}

==History==
The first patent on tempered glass was held by chemist [[Rudolph A. Seiden]], born in 1900 in Austria.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Though the underlying mechanism was not known at the time, the effects of "tempering" glass have been known for centuries. In the 1640s, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert of Bavaria]] brought the discovery of what are now known as "[[Prince Rupert's Drops]]" to the attention of the King. These are teardrop shaped bits of glass which are produced by allowing a molten drop of glass to fall into a bucket of water, thereby rapidly cooling it. The teardrops were often used by the King as a [[practical joke]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}
