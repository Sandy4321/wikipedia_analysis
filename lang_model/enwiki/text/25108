The '''Military history of the United States''' spans a period of less than two and a half centuries. Over the course of those years, the [[United States]] grew from an alliance of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] without a professional [[Armed force|military]], to one of [[Earth]]'s military [[superpowers]] as of [[2006]].

==Overview==
''Main articles: [[Military of the United States]] and [[Military budget in the United States]]''

Until the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], the military presence in what became known as the United States was organized by each [[U.S. state]] as a voluntary or conscripted [[militia]]. Since 1789, the [[United States Constitution]] has provided authority for the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to levy taxes and to raise a navy and national militia. Federal legislation eventually led to the modern nationalized system of military in the country. Historically, the amount of money the U.S. government spends on the military has often been a politically contentious issue.

As of 2006, the U.S. military consisted of an [[United States Army|army]], [[United States Navy|navy]], [[United States Air Force|air force]] and [[United States Marine Corps|marine corps]] under the command of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. There also is the [[United States Coast Guard]], which is controlled by the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. In each of these branches of military, the [[President of the United States]] is the [[commander in chief]] of the armed forces. In addition, each state has a [[United States National Guard|national guard]] commanded by the state's [[governor]] and coordinated by the [[National Guard Bureau]]. The President of the United States has the authority during national emergencies to assume control of individual state national guard units.

==Timeline==
===Colonial wars (1620<U+2013>1774)===
The beginning of the United States military lies in civilian frontiersmen, armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness.  These were organized into local militias for small military operations, mostly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes but also to resist possible raids by the small military forces of neighboring European colonies.  They relied on the support of the [[United Kingdom|British]] regular army and navy for any serious military operation.

In the early years of the [[British colonization of North America]], military action in the colonies that would become United States were the result of conflicts with Native Americans, such as in the [[Pequot War]] of [[1637]] and [[King Philip's War]] in [[1675]]. Slave uprisings such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] in [[1739]], and inter-colonial conflicts, such as the [[Pennamite Wars]] and the activities of the [[Green Mountain Boys]], were also a part of the colonial military experience.

Beginning in [[1689]], the colonies also frequently became involved in a [[French and Indian Wars|series of wars]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] for control of [[North America]].

===War of Independence (1775<U+2013>1783) ===
{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}
[[Image:Yorktown-peale.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail from ''Washington and his Generals at Yorktown'' (c. 1781) by [[Charles Willson Peale]]. [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] (far left) is at Washington's right, the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] to his immediate left.]] 

Ongoing [[American Revolution|political tensions]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] became a crisis in 1774 when the British placed the [[province of Massachusetts]] under [[martial law]]. While shooting began at [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in [[1775]], the [[Continental Congress]] appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief of the newly created [[Continental Army]], which was augmented throughout the war by colonial [[militia]]. General Washington was no great battlefield tactician&mdash;he lost more battles than he won&mdash;but [[Fabian Strategy|his overall strategy]] proved to be sound: keep the army intact, wear down British resolve, and avoid decisive battles except to exploit enemy mistakes.

The British, for their part, lacked both a unified command and a clear strategy for winning. With the use of the [[Royal Navy]], the British were able to capture coastal cities, but control of the countryside eluded them. A British [[Saratoga campaign|invasion from Canada]] in 1777 ended with the disastrous surrender of a British army at [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]]. [[France]] and [[Spain]] then entered the war against Great Britain.

A shift in [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|focus to the southern American states]] resulted in a string of victories for the British, but [[guerrilla warfare]] and the tenacity of General [[Nathanael Greene]]'s army prevented the British from making strategic headway. A French naval [[Battle of the Chesapeake|victory in the Chesapeake]] led to the surrender of a British army at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] in 1781, resulting in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, which recognized the independence of the United States.

Since many Americans of the revolutionary generation had a strong distrust of permanent (or "[[standing army|standing]]") armies, the Continental Army was quickly disbanded after the Revolution. General Washington, who throughout the war deferred to elected officials, averted [[Newburgh conspiracy|a potential crisis]] and submitted his resignation as commander-in-chief to Congress after the war, establishing a tradition of civil control of the U.S. military.

=== Early national period (1783<U+2013>1815) ===
{{Main articles|[[Northwest Indian War]], [[Quasi-War]], [[Barbary Wars]], [[Tecumseh's War]], [[Creek War]], [[Peoria War]], [[War of 1812]]}}

Following the American Revolution, the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western [[frontier]]. The United States was a minor military power during this time, having only a modest army and navy. A traditional distrust of standing armies, combined with an exaggerated belief in the effectiveness of amateur militia, precluded the development of well-trained units and a professional [[officer corps]]. [[Jeffersonian]] leaders preferred a small army and navy, fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars, and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power.

In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the British had ceded the lands between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] to the United States, without consulting the Native Americans who lived there. Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began [[Northwest Ordinance|dividing up these lands]] for settlement. This provoked a war in the [[Northwest Territory]] in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the [[Battle of the Wabash]] in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a [[Legion of the United States|newly trained army]] to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1795.

When [[revolutionary France]] declared [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1793|war on Great Britain]] in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the [[Jay Treaty]], which was favorable to Great Britain, led to an undeclared "[[Quasi-War]]" with France. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1801, the United States won a string of victories in the [[Caribbean]]. George Washington was called out of retirement to head a "provisional army" in case of invasion by France, but President [[John Adams]] managed to negotiate a truce.

[[Image:Battle erie.jpg|left|300px|thumb|"We have met the enemy and they are ours." Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s [[Battle of Lake Erie|victory on Lake Erie]] in 1813 was an important turning point in the [[War of 1812]]. (Painting by William H. Powell, 1865)]]

In 1801, the United States fought another undeclared war, this time with the city-state of [[Tripoli]]. When President [[Thomas Jefferson]] discontinued the custom of paying [[tribute]] to the [[Barbary States]], the [[First Barbary War]] followed. After the [[USS Philadelphia (1799)|U.S.S. ''Philadelphia'']] was captured in 1803, Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship, preventing Tripoli from using or selling it. In 1805, after [[William Eaton]] captured the city of [[Darnah|Derna]], Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty. The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping, until the [[Second Barbary War]] in 1815 ended the practice.

By far the largest war the United States fought in this era was the [[War of 1812]]. When Great Britain and France went to [[Napoleonic Wars|war again in 1803]] with renewed vigor, the United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. This proved difficult, and the United States finally declared war on Great Britain in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the [[Royal Navy]], the U.S. attacked the [[British Empire]] by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip.  The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front ([[Tecumseh's War]] and the [[Creek War]]) were more successful. After defeating [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1814, Great Britain was able to send troops from Europe to America, leading to the [[burning of Washington]] on [[25 August]] [[1814]]. A second British offensive was defeated by [[Andrew Jackson]] at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. By this time, diplomats in Europe had worked out a [[Treaty of Ghent|peace treaty]], restoring the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.

=== Continental expansion (1816<U+2013>1860) ===
{{Main articles|[[Seminole Wars]], [[Black Hawk War]], [[Mexican-American War]], [[Utah War]]}}

With the independence of the United States established, military efforts then focused on ensuring a dominant role on the continent, an idea which came to be known as "[[Manifest Destiny]]."

Although the War of 1812 ended as a stalemate between the United States and Great Britain in 1815, the frontier war essentially continued into 1818 with the [[Seminole Wars|First Seminole War]].
After the War of 1812 came the [[Seminole Wars]], the [[Black Hawk War]], and the era of [[Indian Removal]].

The [[Texas Revolution]] was a war fought from [[October 2]], [[1835]] to [[April 21]], [[1836]] between [[Mexico]] and the breakaway province of Texas.  In February 1836, Santa Anna led his army into Texas; delayed by the defense of the [[Alamo]], he overwhelmed it and shot the prisoners. The Texans declared their independence on March 2, 1836. [[Sam Houston]] led a successful retreat, but other insurgents were defeated at Goliad; Santa Anna shot the prisoners.  But he was defeated and captured at San Jacinto on April 21; Santa Anna signed  a treaty recognizing Texas independence and its expanded boundaries.  The government in Mexico City repudiated the treaty and vowed to subdue Texas, a position that led to the [[Mexican-American War]] with the United States in 1846. 


US U.S. troops were sent to the Utah region in the [[Utah War]] to reassert federal primacy in the region. 

===American Civil War (1861<U+2013>1865) ===
{{main|American Civil War}}
[[Image:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dead soldiers lie where they fell at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], the bloodiest day in American history. [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] after this battle.]]
Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]] and those south of it, primarily centered on the "peculiar institution" of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government.  During the [[1840s]] and [[1850s]], conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent.  Beginning with [[South Carolina]] in late [[1860]], states in the South [[Secession|seceded]] from the United States.  On [[April 12]] [[1861]], forces of the South (known as the [[Confederate States of America]] or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]], whose garrison was loyal to the forces of the North (who represented the United States or simply the Union).

The '''[[American Civil War]]''' caught both sides unprepared.  Both the Union and the Confederacy had to build their armies practically from scratch.  Both sides sought a quick victory focused on the respective nearby capitols of [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Richmond, Virginia]], but neither side would surrender their national identity cheaply.  Even after the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], many were slow to accept that war would last much longer than a single campaign.  However, it spilled across the contintent, and even to the high seas.  Much of the vast resources of America would be consumed before it would be resolved.  

The American Civil War is sometimes called the "first modern war" due to the use of mass [[conscription]], military [[railroad]]s, [[trench warfare]], [[submarine]]s, [[ironclad]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[rifles]].  It introduced the modern world to the horrors of [[total war]].

=== Post-Civil War era (1865<U+2013>1917) ===
:''[[History of the United States (1865-1918)]]''
The scope of the Civil War was as great as many of those in Europe, and the United States began to see itself as potential player on the world stage.  With the country now stretching to the Pacific, eyes turned to overseas.  The motivation behind the [[Spanish-American War]], [[Philippine-American War]], and U.S. involvement in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] are debated among historians.

====Indian Wars (1865<U+2013>1890)====
{{main|Indian Wars}}
After the Civil War, work began in earnest on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], linking California with the eastern states. Many Native American tribes of the [[Great Plains]] resisted this encroachment. Generals from the Civil War such as [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]] were assigned to conquer any Indians who offered military resistance to the building of the railroad and the expansion of the United States.

====Spanish-American War (1898) ====
{{main|Spanish-American War}}

The [[Spanish-American War]] took place in 1898, and resulted in the [[United States|United States of America]] gaining control over the former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], most notably [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]].

====Philippine-American War (1899-1913)====
{{main|Philippine-American War}}
[[Image:Manila646 1899.jpg|right|thumb|300px|U.S. soldiers of the First Nebraska volunteers, company B, near Manila, 1899]]
The [[Philippine-American War]] was between the armed forces of the [[United States]] and the [[Philippines]] from 1899 through 1913.

This conflict is also known as the "Philippine Insurrection."  This name was historically the most commonly used in the U.S., but Filipinos and an increasing number of American historians refer to these hostilities as the "Philippine-American War," and, in 1999, the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] reclassified its references to use this term.

====Banana Wars====
The Banana Wars is a term used to describe US intervention in Latin America from the end of the [[Spanish American War]] in 1898 until 1935.  These wars include involvement in [[Cuba]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]] with the [[Panama Canal Zone]], [[Haiti]] (1915-1935), [[Dominican Republic]] (1916-1924) and [[Nicaragua]] (1912-1925) & (1926 - 1933). 

Most notable of these conflicts was when U.S. forces [[U.S. occupation of Veracruz, 1914|occupied the Mexican city]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] for over six months in 1914, in response to the [[April 9]], [[1914]] "[[Tampico Affair]]," which involved the brief arrest of U.S. sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President [[Victoriano Huerta]].  The incident came in the midst of poor diplomatic relations with the United States, related to the ongoing [[Mexican Revolution]].

In response to the Tampico Affair, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] ordered the Navy to occupy Veracruz.  Huerta was overthrown and a regime more favorable to the U.S. was installed.  The incident, however, worsened U.S.-Mexican relations for many years.

====The Boxer Rebellion====
The [[Boxer Rebellion]] was an uprising against [[Western world|Western]] commercial and political influence in [[China]] during the final years of the 19th century.  The U.S. contributed army and marine units, the [[China Relief Expedition]], to an international joint force which captured [[Peking]] and forced a Chinese capitulation. By August 1900, over 230 foreigners, thousands of Chinese [[Christian]]s and unknown numbers of rebels, their sympathisers and other Chinese had been killed in the revolt and its suppression.

=== First World War (1917-1918) ===
The United States tried to remain neutral when [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. However Washington insisted on its neutral right to send ships without them being attacked by German submarines.  The ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American entry.  However the U.S. had deliberately kept its army small, and mobilization took a year. Meanwhile the U.S. sent more supplies and money to Britain and France, and started the first peacetime draft. Economic mobilization was much slower than expected, so the decision was made to send divisions to Europe without their equipment, relying instead on British and French supplies.  By summer 1918 a million "doughboys" were in Europe under the command of [[John J. Pershing]], with 25,000 more arriving every week. The failure of Germany's spring offensive meant they had exhausted their manpower reserves and were unable to launch attacks or even defend their lines, Meanwhile the German homefront revolted and a new German government signed a conditional surrender, the Armistice, ending the war on November 11, 1918.

===Between the wars (1918<U+2013>1941)===
====Russian Revolution====
The so-called [[Polar Bear Expedition]] was the involvement of U.S. troops, during the tail end of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], in fighting the [[Bolshevik]]s in [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Russia]] in [[1918]] and [[1919]]

=== Second World War (1941-1945) ===
[[Image:WW2 Japonese Surrender USS-Missouri.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Japan formally surrenders aboard the USS ''Missouri'' in Tokyo Bay]]
During the [[interwar period]] the United States again reduced its military, but mobilized to its largest levels for the ensuing [[World War II|Second World War]]. The [[World war|global conflict]] started in the 1930's and raged until 1945, involving most of the peoples of the world.  It was the most extensive and costly war in  history as well as the history of the United States.

US involvement in World War II was initially limited to providing [[Lend-Lease|war material and financial support]] to the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[China]].  The US entered officially on [[7 December]] [[1941]] with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]] on [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, followed by attacks on US and British possessions across the Pacific.  On 11 December, the remaining [[Axis powers]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], declared war on the US, drawing the US firmly into the war and removing all doubts about the global nature of the conflict.

The loss of 8 battleships and 2 thousand sailors and airmen at Pearl Harbor forced the US to rely on its remaining [[aircraft carrier]]s, which won a major victory over Japan at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] just 6 months into the war. The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an [[Pacific War|island hopping]] campaign across the central and South Pacific in 1943-45, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the [[Battle of Okinawa]].  During 1942 and 1943, the US deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the [[strategic bombing]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[occupied Europe]] and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] in November, 1942, [[Operation Husky|Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] in 1943, [[D-Day|France]] in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the Soviet invasion from the east. That led to the [[Victory in Europe Day|surrender of Nazi Germany]] in May 1945.  In the Pacific, the US experienced much success in naval campaigns during [[1944]], but bloody battles at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] in [[1945]] led the US to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of lives.  The U.S. used [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to shock the Japanese leadership, which (combined with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria) quickly brought about the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender of Japan]]. 

Despite the crippling effects of the [[Great Depression]], the United States was able to mobilize quickly, eventually becoming the dominant military power in most theaters of the war (excepting only eastern Europe and mainland China), and the industrial might of the US economy is widely cited as a major factor in the [[Allies|Allies']] eventual victory in the war. Early in the war, the US military was perceived by some observers to be too "green" and untested to be of much use other than cannon fodder against experienced German and Japanese troops, but the US acquitted itself well and established a modern military tradition as an elite and well-trained force. Strategic and tactical lessons learned by the US, such as the importance of [[air superiority]] and the dominance of the [[aircraft carrier]] in naval actions, continue to guide US military doctrine more than 60 years later.

World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country's greatest triumph, and the soldiers of World War II are frequently referred to as "the greatest generation" for their sacrifices in the name of liberty. Over 16 million served (about 13% of the population), and over 400,000 were killed during the war; only the [[American Civil War]] saw more Americans killed. The US entered the war, like many other nations, as a country struggling with economic and social problems and unsure of its identity.  It emerged as one of the two undisputed [[superpower]]s along with the [[Soviet Union]], and unlike the Soviet Union, the US homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war.  The importance of US military and political power in world affairs since 1945 cannot be overstated; the outcome of the war and the fortunes of the victors have shaped world events to this day.

During and following the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom developed an increasingly strong defence and intelligence relationship. Manifestations of this include extensive basing of US forces in the UK, shared intelligence, shared military technology (e.g. nuclear technology), shared procurement (mainly British purchases of American weapon systems). See: ''[[Special relationship]]''.

''For specific units, see [[List of United States Army divisions during World War II]].''

===Cold War (1945<U+2013>1991) ===
{{main|Cold War}}
Following the second world war, the United States emerged as a global [[superpower]] vis-a-vis the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. In this period of some forty years, the United States provided [[foreign military aid]] and direct involvement in [[proxy war]]s against the [[Soviet Union]]. It was the principal foreign actor in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] during this era. Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under a concept of [[mutually assured destruction]] with the Soviet Union.

====Postwar Military Reorganization (1947)====
The [[National Security Act of 1947]], meeting the need for a military reorganization to complement the U.S. superpower role, combined and replaced the former Department of the Navy and War Department with a single [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]-level Department of Defense. The act also created the [[NSA|National Security Council]], the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]], and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].

====Korean War====
The [[Korean War]] was a conflict between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] ([[Republic of Korea]], or [[ROK]]). It was also a Cold War [[proxy war]] between the [[United States]] and its [[United Nations]] allies and the [[Communism|communist]] powers of the [[Soviet Union]] (also a UN member nation) and the [[People's Republic of China]] (which later also gained UN membership). The principal combatants were North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the United States, [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the [[United Nations]]. Allies of North Korea included the People's Republic of China, which supplied military forces, and the Soviet Union, which supplied [[combat advisors]] and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the Chinese and North Korean troops. In the United States, the conflict was termed a [[police action]] under the aegis of the United Nations rather than a war, largely in order to remove the necessity of a Congressional [[declaration of war]].

The war started badly for the US and UN.  North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of [[1950]] and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming [[Douglas MacArthur]] commander of its forces, and US-ROK forces acting under the UN auspices held a perimeter around [[Pusan]], gaining time for reinforcement.  MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]], cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea.  As UN forces continued to advance toward the [[Yalu River]] on the border with Communist China, MacArthur and [[U.S. President]] [[Harry Truman]] came into serious disagreement about military objectives and resolution of the conflict. In November, 1950, after public warnings that MacArthur had dismissed, the Chinese Army poured across the border and sent UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. MacArthur was later relieved of his command by Truman for insurbordination, and while some feared the conflict might spark another world war, negotiations beginning shortly after MacArthur's dismissal eventually resulted in a stalemate and armistice in [[1953]], with the two Koreas remaining divided at the [[38th Parallel]].  North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and US forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of US foreign policy.

====Bay of Pigs Invasion====
The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] (also known in Cuba as '''Playa Gir<U+00F3>n''' after the beach in the [[Bay of Pigs]] where the landing took place) was a CIA-planned and funded landing by armed Cuban exiles in southwest [[Cuba]] in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]] in 1961.  The [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administrations had made the judgment that Castro's shift toward the [[Soviet Union]] could not be tolerated, and moved to overthrow him. However, the invasion failed miserably and proved to be a major international embarrassment for the Kennedy administration, and has become both a symbol and example of '[[groupthink]]' and poor [[decision making]]. Although not an operation by U.S. military forces, consideration was given by the Kennedy administration to providing air support to the exile forces or exploiting any success of the invasion with reinforcement by [[U.S. Marines]].

====Dominican Intervention====
''Main article: [[Operation Power Pack]]''

On April 28, 1965, 400 Marines were landed in Santo Domingo to evacuate the American Embassy and foreign nationals after dissident Dominican armed forces attempted to overthrow the ruling civilian junta..  By mid-May, a peak strength of 23,850 U.S. soldiers, Marines, and Airmen were in the Dominican Republic and some 38 naval ships were positioned offshore.  They evacuated nearly 6,500 men, women, and children of 46 nations, and distributed more than 8 million tons of food.

====Vietnam War====
{{main|Vietnam War}}
[[Image:Stamp-ctc-vietnam-war.jpg|thumb|The Vietnam War was one of the longest military conflicts in U.S. history.]]
The [[Vietnam War]] was a [[war]] fought between [[1957]] and [[1975]] on the ground in [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] and bordering areas of [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] (''see'' [[Secret War]]) and in the [[strategic bombing]] (''see'' [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]) of [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam|North Vietnam]]. In [[Vietnam]], the conflict is known as the "American War." 

Fighting on one side was a [[coalition]] of forces including the [[Republic of Vietnam]] ([[South Vietnam]] or the "RVN"), the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Philippines]]. Participation by the [[South Korea]]n military was financed by the [[United States]], but [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] fully funded their own involvement. Other countries normally allied with the [[United States]] in the [[Cold War]], including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], refused to participate in the [[coalition]], although a few of their [[citizen]]s volunteered to join the U.S. forces.  The U.S. and its allies fought against the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) as well as the [[National Liberation Front]] (NLF, also known as [[Viet Cong]]), a guerilla force within South Vietnam.  The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the [[Soviet Union]], turning Vietnam into a [[proxy war]].  

The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of [[containment]] of [[Communism]] in south Asia, but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles, corruption and incompetence in the [[ARVN|Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], and ever increasing protests at home.  The [[Tet Offensive]] in 1968, although a major military defeat for the NLF, marked the psychological turning point in the war.  NLF forces appeared to be everywhere at once, even overrunning the US embassy in [[Saigon]], supposedly one of the most secure places in the country, and news anchor [[Walter Cronkite]], in a famous broadcast from the battlefield, pronounced the war "unwinnable."  After more than 57,000 dead and many more wounded, US forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory, and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by North Vietnam and unified.  The chaotic evacuation of the US embassy in April 1975, as NVA forces closed in on the city, made for enduring images of desperate souls clinging to helicopter skids, trying to escape Communist rule.

Even today, Vietnam is a politically divisive subject in the U.S.  Some view Vietnam as a noble, if flawed, cause; "the only war that America lost" is a phrase occasionally used.  Others see the conflict as a quagmire; a waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests.  Military service during Vietnam is still an issue in U.S. presidential campaigns, more than 30 years after US troops left the country, and fears of another "quagmire" have been major factors in U.S. military planning since 1975.

====Tehran hostage rescue====
Following the [[Iranian revolution]] and the resulting [[Iran hostage crisis]] a military operation named [[Operation Eagle Claw|Eagle Claw]] attempted to rescue the hostages using a combination of special forces and helicopter evacuation, but the rescue failed with the destruction of several aircraft in an accident in the Iranian desert. The failure was attributed to inappropriate equipment, incomplete and unrealistic planning, and the lack of joint service training. Despite its size, the mission had significant effects on U.S. military doctrine and training.

====Grenada====
In October, 1983, alarmed by a violent power struggle in [[Grenada]], the U.S. quickly assembled an international coalition and dispatched paratroopers, Marines, Rangers, and special operations forces to the island in [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]]. Over a thousand Americans were on the island. The invasion force quickly moved to seize the entire island, eventually taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners from a variety of [[East Bloc]] nations.

====Beirut====
''Main article: [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]]''

In [[1983]] fighting between [[PLO|Palestinian refugees]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] factions reignited that nation's long-running civil war. A UN agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee security. The U.S. stationed marines in an urban compound including a multi-story dormitory, once a hotel; [[Marine barracks bombing|a terrorist bombing]] destroyed the building, killing 241 Marines. Subsequently the U.S. Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon proper.

====Panama====
[[Operation Just Cause]] was a [[1989]] invasion of Panama, mainly from U.S. bases within the former [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]], to oust dictator [[Manuel Noriega]], whose government was becoming a [[narco-state]]. The U.S. did not wish to turn over to Noriega control of the [[Panama Canal]] (which it was bound to do under treaty) due to the canal's strategic importance.

===Post-Cold War era (1991&ndash;present) ===

Following the end of the [[Cold War]], the United States armed forces fought numerous [[limited war]]s as a self-envisioned constabulatory force. It began a "[[War on Terrorism|global war on terrorism]]" after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

====Gulf War====
The [[Persian Gulf War]] was a conflict between [[Iraq]] and United Nations member states, specifically a coalition force of 34 nations led by the [[United States]]. The lead up to the war began with the [[Iraq|Iraqi]] invasion of [[Kuwait]] in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the [[United Nations]] against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January [[1991]], resulting in a decisive victory for the coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths.  Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as "permanentely disabled" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs ([http://www.ngwrc.org/?page=article&id=158 National Gulf War Resource Center]; see also [[Gulf War Syndrome]]).  The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired [[missile]]s on [[Israel|Israeli]] and Saudi cities.

In retrospect, the scale of the coalition's victory was not a foregone conclusion. Before the war, many observers believed the US and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during [[World War II]].  After nearly 50 years of [[proxy war]]s, and constant fears of another war in Europe between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], some thought the Gulf War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme.  Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with [[Iran]], and they were well-equipped with late model [[Soviet]] tanks, jet fighters and anti-aircraft weapons; in comparison, the US had no major combat experience since its withdrawal from [[Vietnam]] nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.

However, the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on [[17 January]] [[1991]], coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhemling technological advantages of the US, such as [[stealth aircraft]] and [[infrared]] sights, quickly turned the air war into a "turkey shoot." The heat signature of any tank foolish enough to start its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from [[wild weasel]] aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they zeroed in on impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]], and by the time the ground forces invaded on [[24 February]], many Iraqi troops were so happy to be alive that they quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces. 

After just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control, US President [[George H. W. Bush]] ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.

Following the Gulf War, in order to protect minority populations, the US, Britain, and France declared and maintained [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]] in northern and southern Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested. The no-fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no-fly zones in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation. 

Additionally, following the discovery of an aborted assassination plot aimed at former President George H.W. Bush, Navy ships bombed Iraqi intelligence facilities with cruise missiles in June [[1993]].

====Somalia====
US troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in [[Somalia]] beginning in [[1992]]. By [[1993]] the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]], whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from [[Pakistan]]. During a failed attempt at capturing Aidid, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the [[Battle of Mogadishu]]. 19 American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob. US forces were quickly withdrawn, and the incident had a profound effect on US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention. The book [[Black Hawk Down]] was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later movie of the same name.

====Yugoslavia====
During the war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990's, the US operated in Bosnia. The USA was one of the NATO member countries who bombed Yugoslavia between March 24th and June 9th 1999 during the [[Kosovo War]].

===War on Terrorism (2001&ndash;present)===
The [[War on Terrorism]] is a global effort by the governments of several countries (primarily the [[United States]] and its principal allies) to neutralize international groups it deems as [[terrorism|terrorist]] (primarily [[radical Islamist]] terrorist groups, including [[al-Qaida]]) and ensure that [[rogue nations]] no longer support terrorist activities.  It has been adopted as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

====Afghanistan====
The [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] in order to depose that country's [[Taliban]] government and destroy training camps associated with al-Qaida is understood to have been the opening, and in many ways defining, campaign of the broader war on terrorism. The emphasis on special forces, political negotiation with autonomous military units, and the use of proxy militaries marked a significant change from prior U.S. military approaches.

===Iraq War (2003&ndash;present)===

After the lengthy [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] leave [[Iraq]], which was refused, a [[Coalition of the willing|coalition]] led by the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] fought the Iraqi army in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  Approximately 250,000 [[United States]] troops, with support from 45,000 [[United Kingdom|British]], 2,000 [[Australia|Australian]] and 200 [[Poland|Polish]] combat forces, entered [[Iraq]] primarily through their [[staging area]] in [[Kuwait]]. ([[Turkey]] had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi [[peshmerga|Kurdish militia]], estimated to number upwards of 50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, Hussein and the [[Ba'ath Party]] were forcibly removed, followed by an extended period of military [[Military occupation|occupation]] while civil government was re-established (see [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005]]).

During the disarmament crisis, the US and its allies made their case for war based on a few main points, including human rights, violations of UN sanctions, and ties to terrorism, but the key [[casus belli]] was generally considered to be Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with US demands for a full accounting of Iraq's program of [[weapons of mass destruction]].  The intelligence services of a number of countries, including the US, UK, France and Russia, were on record as believing Iraq had a large clandestine program, constituting a threat to US national security, and it was with this assertion that US President [[George W. Bush]] made his case for [[pre-emptive war]] to Congress and the American people.  

However, in the aftermath of the war, it quickly became apparent that Hussein had no such weapons program.  Only a very few WMD components were found, none of which backed up the claim of a massive hidden program.  Debate continues to rage in the US Congress and media over the failure of US intelligence to provide accurate reports before the war.  Many Americans, including prominent members of Congress, claim Bush and other administration officials lied or misled the country based on doctored intelligence reports.  Others claim that the reports were wrong in the first place, that the case for war was made on the intelligence available at the time, and that the WMD concern was not the only reason for going to war.  So far, no "smoking gun" evidence of a cover-up or conspiracy has been revealed.

The [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] also linked the invasion of Iraq to the War on Terrorism, claiming that Hussein was giving safe haven to and supporting terrorist groups.  This claim resonated strongly in America after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], with many believing that any state using terror means should be fought, regardless of whether the state had committed actions against the US.  However, the case for war was not based directly on the 9/11 attacks, and although the Bush administration strongly suggested ties at some level between Hussein and [[Al-Qaeda]], it did not accuse Hussein of complicity in the specific events of 9/11.
