{{Infobox yttrium}}
'''Yttrium''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+026A>tri<U+0259>m}}) is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Y''' and [[atomic number]] 39. It is a silvery-metallic [[transition metal]] chemically similar to the [[lanthanoid]]s and has historically been classified as a [[rare earth element]].<ref name="IUPAC" /> Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanoids in [[rare earth mineral]]s and is never found in nature as a free element. Its only stable [[isotope]], <sup>89</sup>Y, is also its only naturally occurring isotope.

In 1787, [[Carl Axel Arrhenius]]                                                                                          found a new mineral near [[Ytterby]] in Sweden and named it ''[[gadolinite|ytterbite]]'', after the village. [[Johan Gadolin]] discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789,<ref name="Krogt"/> and [[Anders Gustaf Ekeberg]] named the new oxide ''[[yttria]]''. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by [[Friedrich W<U+00F6>hler]].<ref name="LANL"/>

The most important use of yttrium is in making [[phosphor]]s, such as the red ones used in television [[cathode ray tube]] displays and in [[LED]]s.<ref name="Cotton" /> Other uses include the production of [[electrode]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[electronic filters]], [[laser]]s and [[superconductor]]s; various medical applications; and as [[Trace element|traces]] in various materials to enhance their properties. Yttrium has no known biological role, but exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.<ref name="osha"/>

==Characteristics==
===Properties===
Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline [[transition metal]] in [[group 3 element|group 3]]. As expected by [[periodic trend]]s, it is less [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than its predecessor in the group, [[scandium]], more electronegative than its successor in the group, [[lanthanum]], and less electronegative than the next member of [[period 5 element|period 5]], [[zirconium]].<ref name ="Greenwood1997p946"/><ref name="Hammond">[[#Hammond|Hammond]]</ref> Yttrium is the first [[d-block]] element in the fifth period.

The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to [[passivation]] resulting from the formation of a protective oxide ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}) film on its surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]] when yttrium is heated to 750&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] in [[water vapor]].<ref name="ECE817"/> When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or [[swarf|turnings]] of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref name="LANL">[[#LANL|Husted 2003]], "yttrium"</ref> [[Yttrium nitride]] (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1,000&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in [[nitrogen]].<ref name="ECE817"/>

===Similarity to the lanthanoids===
{{more|Rare earth element}}
The similarities of yttrium to the [[lanthanoid]]s are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a [[rare earth element]],<ref name="IUPAC">[[#IUPAC|IUPAC 2005]]</ref> and is always found in nature together with them in [[rare earth mineral]]s.<ref name="Emsley498">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 498</ref>

Chemically, yttrium resembles these elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, [[scandium]],<ref name="ECE810">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 810</ref> and if its physical properties were plotted against [[atomic number]] then it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanoids [[gadolinium]] and [[erbium]].<ref name="ECE815">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 815</ref>

It often also falls in the same range for reaction order,<ref name="ECE817"/> resembling [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] at its chemical reactivity.<ref name="Cotton" /> Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'Yttrium group' of heavy lanthanoid ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them.<ref name="ECE817"/><ref name="Greenwood1997p945">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=945}}</ref>  Even though the lanthanoids are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the [[lanthanoid contraction]].<ref name="Greenwood1997p1234">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1234}}</ref>

One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanoids is that yttrium is almost exclusively [[valency (chemistry)|trivalent]], whereas about half of the lanthanoids can have valences other than three.<ref name="ECE817">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 817</ref>

===Compounds and reactions===
{{seealso|Category:Yttrium compounds}}
As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compounds]], generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its [[valence electron]]s.<ref name="Greenwood1997p948">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=948}}</ref>  A good example is [[yttrium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}), also known as yttria, a six-[[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate]] white solid.<ref name="Greenwood1997p947">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=947}}</ref>

Yttrium forms a water-insoluble [[fluoride]], [[hydroxide]], and [[oxalate]], but its [[bromide]], [[chloride]], [[iodide]], [[nitrate]] and [[sulfate]] are all [[solubility|soluble]] in water.<ref name="ECE817"/> The Y<sup>3+</sup> [[ion]] is colorless in solution because of the absence of d and f [[electron shell]]s.<ref name="ECE817"/>

[[Water]] readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form [[hydrogen]] gas and {{chem|Y|2|O|3}}.<ref name="Emsley498"/> Concentrated [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]s do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.<ref name="ECE817"/>

With [[halogen]]s, yttrium forms [[halide|trihalides]] such as [[yttrium(III) fluoride]] ({{chem|YF|3}}), [[yttrium(III) chloride]] ({{chem|YCl|3}}), and [[yttrium(III) bromide]] ({{chem|YBr|3}}) at temperatures above roughly 200&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref name="osha"/> Similarly, [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[selenium]], [[silicon]] and [[sulfur]] all form [[binary compound]]s with yttrium at elevated temperatures.<ref name="ECE817"/>

[[Organoyttrium chemistry]] is the study of compounds containing carbon<U+2013>yttrium bonds. A few of these are known to have yttrium in the oxidation state 0.<ref name="Cloke1993">[[#Cloke1993|Cloke 1993]]</ref><ref name="Schumann">[[#Schumann|Schumann 2006]]</ref> (The  +2 state has been observed in chloride melts,<ref name="Mikheev1992">[[#Mikheev1992|Mikheev 1992]]</ref> and +1 in oxide clusters in the gas phase.<ref name="Kang2005">[[#Kang2005|Kang 2005]]</ref>) Some [[trimerization]] reactions were observed by using organoyttrium compounds as catalysts.<ref name="Schumann" /> These compounds use {{chem|YCl|3}} as a starting material, which in turn is obtained from {{chem|Y|2|O|3}} and concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[ammonium chloride]].<ref>[[#Turner1920|Turner 1920]], p. 492</ref><ref>[[#Spencer1919|Spencer 1919]], p. 135</ref>

[[Hapticity]] is how a group of contiguous atoms of a [[ligand]] are coordinated to a central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character ''eta'', <U+03B7>. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where [[carborane|carboranyl]] ligands were bound to a d<sup>0</sup>-metal center through a <U+03B7><sup>7</sup>-hapticity.<ref name="Schumann" /> Vaporization of the [[graphite intercalation compound]]s graphite<U+2013>Y or graphite<U+2013>{{chem|Y|2|O|3}} leads to the formation of [[endohedral fullerene]]s such as Y@C<sub>82</sub>.<ref name="Cotton" /> [[Electron spin resonance]] studies indicated the formation of Y<sup>3+</sup> and (C<sub>82</sub>)<sup>3<U+2212></sup> ion pairs.<ref name="Cotton" /> The [[carbide]]s Y<sub>3</sub>C, Y<sub>2</sub>C, and YC<sub>2</sub> can each [[hydrolyze]] to form [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name="ECE817"/>

===Nucleosynthesis and isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of yttrium}}
Yttrium in the [[Solar System]] was created through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], mostly by the [[s-process]] (<U+2248>72%), but also by the [[r-process]] (<U+2248>28%).<ref name="Pack">[[#Pack|Pack 2007]]</ref> The r-process consists of rapid [[neutron capture]] of lighter elements during [[supernova]] explosions. The s-process is a slow [[neutron]] capture of lighter elements inside pulsating [[red giant]] stars.<ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|pp=12<U+2013>13}}</ref>

[[Image:Mira 1997.jpg|thumb|[[Mira]] is an example of the type of red giant star where most of the yttrium in the solar system was created.]]
Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the [[nuclear fission]] of uranium occurring in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In terms of waste management, the most important yttrium isotopes are <sup>91</sup>Y and <sup>90</sup>Y, with half-lives of 58.51&nbsp;days and 64&nbsp;hours, respectively.<ref name="NNDC"/> The first is formed directly from fission, while the latter, despite its short half-life, is in [[secular equilibrium]] with its long-lived parent isotope, [[strontium-90]] (<sup>90</sup>Sr) with a half-life of 29&nbsp;years.<ref name="LANL"/>

All group 3 elements have an odd number of [[proton]]s and therefore have few stable [[isotope]]s.<ref name ="Greenwood1997p946">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=946}}</ref> Yttrium itself has only one [[stable isotope]], <sup>89</sup>Y, which is also its only naturally occurring one. <sup>89</sup>Y is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by [[beta decay|electron emission]] (neutron <U+2192> proton).<ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13"/><ref group=note>Essentially, a [[neutron]] becomes a [[proton]] while an [[electron]] and [[antineutrino]] are emitted.</ref> Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with [[mass number]]s (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] with 50, 82 and 126 neutrons, respectively.<ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13"/><ref group=note>This stability is thought to result from very low [[neutron cross-section]]s {{harv|Greenwood|1997|pp=12<U+2014>13}}.

At least 32 synthetic isotopes of yttrium have been observed, ranging in mass number from 76 to 108.<ref name="NNDC">{{harvnb|NNDC|2008}}</ref>  The least stable of these is <sup>106</sup>Y with a [[half-life]] of >150&nbsp;[[SI prefix|ns]] (<sup>76</sup>Y has a half-life of >200&nbsp;ns) and the most stable is <sup>88</sup>Y with a half-life of 106.626&nbsp;days.<ref name="NNDC"/> Besides the isotopes <sup>91</sup>Y, <sup>87</sup>Y, and <sup>90</sup>Y, with half lives of 58.51&nbsp;days, 79.8&nbsp;hours, and 64&nbsp;hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half lives of less than a day and most of those have half-lives of less than an hour.<ref name="NNDC"/>

Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or below 88 decay primarily by [[positron emission]] (proton <U+2192> neutron) to form [[strontium]] ([[atomic number|Z]] = 38) isotopes.<ref name="NNDC"/> Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron <U+2192> proton) to form [[zirconium]] (Z = 40) isotopes.<ref name="NNDC"/> Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of <U+03B2><U+2212> delayed [[neutron emission]].<ref name="nubase">[[#Audi2003|Audi 2003]]</ref>

Yttrium has at least 20 [[metastable isomer|metastable or excited isomer]]s ranging in mass number from 78 to 102.<ref name="NNDC"/><ref group=note>Metastable isomers have higher-than-normal energy states than the corresponding non-excited nucleus and these states last until a [[gamma ray]] or [[conversion electron]] is emitted from the isomer. They are designated by an 'm' being placed next to the isotope's mass number.</ref> Multiple excitation states have been observed for <sup>80</sup>Y and <sup>97</sup>Y.<ref name="NNDC"/> While most of yttrium's isomers are expected to be less stable than their [[ground state]], <sup>78m</sup>Y, <sup>84m</sup>Y, <sup>85m</sup>Y, <sup>96m</sup>Y, <sup>98m1</sup>Y, <sup>100m</sup>Y, and <sup>102m</sup>Y have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than [[isomeric transition]].<ref name="nubase"/>

==History==
In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist [[Carl Axel Arrhenius]] found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of [[Ytterby]] (now part of the [[Stockholm Archipelago]]).<ref name="Krogt"/> Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element [[tungsten]],<ref name="Emsley496">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 496</ref> he named it ''ytterbite''<ref group=note>''Ytterbite'' was named after the village it was discovered near, plus the -ite ending to indicate it was a mineral.</ref> and sent samples to various chemists for further analysis.<ref name="Krogt">[[#Krogt|Van der Krogt 2005]]</ref>

[[Image:Johan Gadolin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium oxide.]]
[[Johan Gadolin]] at the [[University of <U+00C5>bo]] identified a new oxide or "[[Earth (chemistry)|earth]]" in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794.<ref>[[#Gadolin1794|Gadolin 1794]]</ref><ref group=note>[[#Stwertka1998|Stwertka 1998]], p. 115 says that the identification occurred in 1789 but is silent on when the announcement was made. [[#Krogt|Van der Krogt 2005]] cites the original publication, with the year [[#Gadolin1794|1794, by Gadolin]].</ref> [[Anders Gustaf Ekeberg]] confirmed this in 1797 and named the new oxide ''yttria''.<ref name="Greenwood1997p944">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=944}}</ref> In the decades after [[Antoine Lavoisier]] developed the first modern definition of [[chemical element]]s, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been ''yttrium''.<ref group="note">Earths were given an -a ending and new elements are normally given an -ium ending</ref>

In 1843, [[Carl Gustav Mosander]] found that samples of yttria actually contained three oxides: white [[yttrium oxide]] (yttria), yellow [[terbium(III,IV) oxide|terbium oxide]] (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored [[erbium oxide]] (called 'terbia' at the time).<ref>[[#Mosander1843|Mosander 1843]]</ref> A fourth oxide, [[ytterbium oxide]], was isolated in 1878 by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]].<ref>[[#EB|''Britannica'' 2005]], "ytterbium"</ref> New elements would later be isolated from each of those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry in which they were found (see [[ytterbium]], [[terbium]], and [[erbium]]).<ref name="Stwertka115"/> In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in "Gadolin's yttria".<ref name="Krogt"/> Since yttria was a mineral after all and not an oxide, [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] renamed it [[gadolinite]] in honor of Gadolin.<ref name="Krogt"/>

Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when [[Friedrich W<U+00F6>hler]] heated anhydrous [[yttrium(III) chloride]] with [[potassium]]:<ref>[[#Heiserman1992|Heiserman 1992]], p. 150</ref><ref>[[#Wohler1828|W<U+00F6>hler 1828]]</ref>

Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol '''Yt''' was used for the element, after which '''Y''' came into common use.<ref>[[#CoplenPeiser|Coplen and Peiser 1998]]</ref>

In 1987, [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] was found to achieve [[high-temperature superconductivity]].<ref name="Wu" /> It was only the second material known to exhibit this property,<ref name="Wu">[[#Wu|Wu ''et al.''. 1987]]</ref> and it was the first known material to achieve [[superconductivity]] above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.<ref group="note">[[critical temperature#superconductivity|T<sub>c</sub>]] for YBCO is 93 K and the boiling point of nitrogen is 77 K.</ref>

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Xenot<U+00ED>mio1.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|[[Xenotime]] crystals contain yttrium.]]
===Abundance===
Yttrium is found in most [[rare earth mineral]]s,<ref name="Hammond" /> as well as some [[uranium]] ores, but is never found in nature as a free element.<ref>[[#Lenntech|Lenntech]], "yttrium"</ref> About 31&nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppm]] of the Earth's crust is yttrium,<ref name="Cotton">[[#Cotton|Cotton 2008]]</ref> making it the 28th most abundant element there, and 400 times more common than [[silver]].<ref name="Emsley497"/> Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150&nbsp;ppm (dry weight average of 23&nbsp;ppm) and in sea water at 9&nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppt]].<ref name="Emsley497"/> Lunar rock samples collected during the [[Apollo program]] have a relatively high yttrium content.<ref name="Stwertka115">[[#Stwertka1998|Stwertka 1998]], p. 115</ref>

Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans.<ref>[[#MacDonald|Mac Donald ''et al.''. 1952]]</ref> There is normally as little as 0.5&nbsp;milligrams found within the entire human body; human [[breast milk]] contains 4&nbsp;ppm.<ref name="Emsley495"/> Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20&nbsp;ppm and 100&nbsp;ppm (fresh weight), with [[cabbage]] having the largest amount.<ref name="Emsley495"/> With up to 700&nbsp;ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.<ref name="Emsley495"/>

===Production===
The chemical similarity of yttrium with the lanthanoids leads it to being enriched by the same processes and ends up in ores containing lanthanoids, forming [[rare earth mineral]]s. A slight separation is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) but this separation is never complete. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group even though it has a lower [[atomic mass]].<ref name="Morteani">[[#Morteani|Morteani 1991]]</ref><ref name="Kanazawaa">[[#Kanazawaa|Kanazawaa 2006]]</ref>

[[Image:Yttrium 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A piece of yttrium. Yttrium is difficult to separate from other rare earth elements.]]
There are four main sources for REEs:<ref name="Naumov">[[#Naumov|Naumov 2008]]</ref>
*Carbonate and fluoride containing ores such as the LREE [[bastn<U+00E4>site]] (<nowiki>[</nowiki>(Ce, La, etc.)(CO<sub>3</sub>)F<nowiki>]</nowiki>) contain an average of 0.1%<ref name="LANL"/><ref name="Morteani"/> of yttrium compared to the 99.9% for the 16 other REEs.<ref name="Morteani"/> The main source for bastn<U+00E4>site from the 1960s to the 1990s was the [[Mountain Pass, California|Mountain Pass mine]] in California, making the United States the largest producer of REEs.<ref name="Morteani"/><ref name="Naumov"/>
*[[Monazite]] (<nowiki>[</nowiki>([[cerium|Ce]], [[lanthanum|La]], etc.)[[phosphate|PO<sub>4</sub>]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>), which is mostly phosphate, is a [[placer deposit]] of sand that is created by the transportation and gravitational separation of eroded granite. Monazite as a LREE ore contains 2%<ref name="Morteani"/> (or 3%)<ref name="Stwertka116">[[#Stwertka1998|Stwertka 1998]], p. 116</ref> of yttrium. The largest deposits were found in India and Brazil in the early 19th century, making these two countries the largest producers of yttrium in the first half of that century.<ref name="Morteani"/><ref name="Naumov"/>
*[[Xenotime]], a REE phosphate, is the main HREE ore containing up to 60% of yttrium as [[yttrium phosphate]] (YPO<sub>4</sub>).<ref name="Morteani"/> The largest mine for this mineral is the [[Bayan Obo]] deposit in China, making China the largest exporter for HREE since the closure of the Mountain Pass mine in the 1990s.<ref name="Morteani"/><ref name="Naumov"/>
*Ion absorption clays or Lognan clays are the weathering products of granite and contain only 1% of REEs.<ref name="Morteani"/> The final ore concentrate can contain up to 8% of yttrium. Ion absorption clays are mostly mined in southern China.<ref name="Morteani"/><ref name="Naumov"/><ref name="Zuoping">[[#Zuoping|Zuoping 1996]]</ref>
Yttrium is also found in [[samarskite]] and [[fergusonite]].<ref name="Emsley497">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 497</ref>

It is difficult to separate yttrium from other rare earths. One method to obtain pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in [[sulfuric acid]] and fractionate it by [[ion exchange]] [[chromatography]]. With the addition of [[oxalic acid]], the [[yttrium oxalate]] precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[yttrium fluoride]] is obtained.<ref name="Holleman"/>

Annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached 600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s by 2001, with reserves estimated at 9&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes.<ref name="Emsley497"/> Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing [[Yttrium(III) fluoride|yttrium fluoride]] to a metal sponge with [[calcium]] [[magnesium]] alloy. The temperature of an [[arc furnace]] of above 1,600&nbsp;<U+00B0>C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.<ref name="Emsley497"/><ref name="Holleman">[[#Holleman|Holleman 1985]]</ref>

Small amounts of yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) have been used to reduce the grain sizes of [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], and [[zirconium]].<ref>[[#PIDC|PIDC contributors]]</ref> It is also used to increase the [[strength of materials|strength]] of aluminium and [[magnesium]] alloys.<ref name="LANL"/> The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature [[oxidation]] (see graphite nodule discussion below).<ref name="ECE818"/>

Yttrium can be used to [[Deoxidizer|deoxidize]] [[vanadium]] and other [[non-ferrous metal]]s.<ref name="LANL"/> [[Yttria]] is used to stabilize the [[cubic zirconia|cubic form of zirconia]] for use in jewelry.<ref>[[#Berg2002|Berg 2002]]</ref>

Yttrium has been studied for possible use as a nodulizer in the making of [[nodular cast iron]] which has increased [[ductility]] (the [[graphite]] forms compact nodules instead of flakes to form nodular cast iron).<ref name="LANL"/> Yttrium oxide can also be used in [[ceramic]] and [[glass]] formulas, since it has a high [[melting point]] and imparts [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] resistance and low [[thermal expansion]] characteristics.<ref name="LANL"/> It is therefore used in [[camera lens]]es.<ref name="Emsley497"/>

===Medical===
The radioactive isotope yttrium-90 is used in drugs such as [[Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide]] and [[Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan]] for the treatment of various [[cancer]]s, including [[lymphoma]], [[leukemia]], ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and bone cancers.<ref name="Emsley495">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 495</ref> It works by adhering to [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]], which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense [[beta particle|<U+03B2>-radiation]] from the yttrium-90 (see [[Monoclonal antibody therapy]]).<ref>[[#Adams|Adams ''et al.''. 2004]]</ref>

[[Image:YBCO-modified.jpg|thumb|left|150px|YBCO superconductor]]
Needles made of yttrium-90, which can cut more precisely than scalpels, have been used to sever pain-transmitting [[nerve]]s in the [[spinal cord]],<ref name="Emsley496"/> and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide [[synovectomy]] in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>[[#Fischer2002|Fischer 2002]]</ref>

A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser has been used in an experimental, robot-assisted radical [[prostatectomy]] in canines in an attempt to reduce collateral nerve and tissue damage,<ref>[[#Gianduzzo2008|Gianduzzo 2008]]</ref> whilst the erbium-doped ones are starting to be used in cosmetic skin resurfacing.<ref name="Cotton" />

===Superconductors===
Yttrium was used in the [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] (YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') [[superconductor]] developed at the [[University of Alabama]] and the [[University of Houston]] in 1987.<ref name="Wu" /> This superconductor operated at 93&nbsp;K, notable because this is above [[liquid nitrogen]]'s boiling point (77.1&nbsp;K).<ref name="Wu" /> As the price of liquid nitrogen is lower than that of [[liquid helium]], which has to be used for the metallic superconductors, the operating costs would decrease.

The actual superconducting material is often written as YBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>7&minus;''d''</SUB>, where ''d'' must be less than 0.7 if the material is to be superconducting.  The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes and  chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behaviour.

The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the so-called BCS theory was put forward in 1957.  It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between 2 electrons in a crystal lattice.  However, BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery.  What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials has to be precisely controlled if superconductivity is to occur.<ref>[http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/century/html/ybco_text.htm Imperial College]</ref> 

The created material was a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as [[perovskite]]s that are alternative mixtures of these elements, hoping to eventually develop a practical [[high-temperature superconductor]].<ref name="Stwertka116"/>

==Precautions==
Water soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic.<ref name="Emsley495"/> In experiments on animals, yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of [[yttrium citrate]] caused [[pulmonary edema]] and [[dyspnea]], while inhalation of [[yttrium chloride]] caused liver edema, [[pleural effusion]]s, and pulmonary hyperemia.<ref name="osha">[[#OSHA|OSHA 2007]]</ref>

Exposure to yttrium compounds in humans may cause lung disease.<ref name="osha"/> Workers exposed to airborne [[yttrium europium vanadate]] dust experienced mild eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation<U+2014>though this may have been caused by the [[vanadium]] content rather than the yttrium.<ref name="osha"/> Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name="osha"/> [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] recommends a [[Permissible exposure limit|time-weighted average]] limit of 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> and an [[IDLH]] of 500&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>[[#NIOSH|NIOSH 2005]]</ref> Yttrium dust is flammable.<ref name="osha"/>
