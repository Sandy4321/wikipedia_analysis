'''Luarsab I''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: <U+10DA><U+10E3><U+10D0><U+10E0><U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10D1> I) (born between [[1502]]-[[1509]] <U+2013> died [[1556]] or [[1558]]), of the [[Bagrationi]] dynasty, was a king of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kingdom of [[Kartli]] from [[1527]] to 1556 or from [[1534]] to 1558. Persistent in his resistance against Safavid Persian aggression, he was killed in the [[Battle of Garisi]]. 

== Life ==

Eldest son of [[David X of Kartli|David X]], he succeeded on the abdication of his uncle, [[George IX of Kartli|George IX]], in 1527 (more accepted date) or 1534. 

When young, he distinguished himself as a commander in his father<U+2019>s army, particularly at the Battle of Teleti ([[1522]]), won by a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] invasion army in spite of heavy losses. He established close contacts with [[Bagrat III of Imereti]], [[Kingdom of Imereti|king]] of [[Imereti]] (western Georgia) and married in 1526 his daughter. A year later, he was crowned king of Kartli and launched a series of measures to strengthen the kingdom<U+2019>s defence capacity amid the ongoing war between [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]] and [[Ottoman Turkey]] ([[1514]]-[[1555]]). In alliance with Bagrat of Imereti, Luarsab fought both empires trying to preserve his independence and reestablish close cooperation between various Georgian polities. In [[1435]], Bagrat conquered a pro-Ottoman southern Georgian principality of [[Samtskhe]], granting its province [[Javakheti]] to Kartli. The Kartlian-Imeretian alliance was soon joined by another Georgian monarch, [[Levan I of Kakheti|Levan I]] of [[Kakheti]]. However, the [[1541]] invasion by the Persian shah [[Tahmasp I]] forced Levan out of a Georgian coalition, it left most of Kartli in ruins, and the capital [[Tbilisi]] garrisoned by a Persian force. The year [[1545]] brought another misfortune: a combined army of the Imeretian and Kartlian kings were crushed by the Ottomans at the Battle of Sokhoista and expelled from Samtskhe. From [[1547]] to [[1554]], Kartli suffered three more invasions by Tahmasp of Persia, who overran the country, but failed to force the king into submission. The Treaty of [[Amasya]], 1555, between the Safavids and Ottomans left Georgia divided between these empires, with the east under Persian domination and the west under Turkish control. Luarsab, however, did not recognise the treaty, and continued desperate guerilla war against the Persian occupation forces virtually holding them under siege. In order to subdue the stubborn Georgian monarch, Shah Tahmasp sent Shahverd Sultan Zyad-Oghlu, [[beylerbey|beglarbeg]] of [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]], with a large army. Luarsab and his son, [[Simon I of Kartli|Simon]], met the invaders at the [[Battle of Garisi]]. A heavy fight resulted in a Georgian victory, but Luarsab was mortally wounded. 

He was buried at the [[Svetitskhoveli]] Cathedral at [[Mtskheta]].

== Family and children ==

Luarsab I married on [[March 25]] [[1526]] Tamar (died 1556), daughter of king Bagrat III of Imereti. They had at least three sons:
*[[Simon I of Kartli]], who succeeded Luarsab I
*[[David XI of Kartli]]
*Vakhtang (ca 1546 - 1599), who fought valiantly and fell at the [[Battle of Nakhiduri]] against the [[Ottoman Turks]].
