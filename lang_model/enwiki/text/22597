He was listed as the number 1 television screen writer in the UK by ''Broadcast'' magazine (2008) and among British Broadcastings Top 20 in ''[[The Stage]]'' (2009).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, He currently resides in Hertfordshire, UK.

For many years, he was lead writer and series consultant for [[BBC One]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. Jordan had written for the programme since 1989, and is considered to be an 'elder statesman' of the show,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} for which he has written over 250 episodes {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.

==Career==
Beginning his career as a market trader, Jordan only began writing at the age of thirty-two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/tony-jordan/|title=Tony Jordan|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=2009-08-20|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> He joined Eastenders after sending a spec script to the BBC about market traders, with a covering letter saying he had been born and raised in the East End of London. The BBC turned down the spec script, but gave him a job on ''EastEnders'' because of his apparent life experience. Afraid of what would happen if the producers found out that he was from the north, Jordan kept up the pretence of being a Londoner for five years.<ref>Jordan, Tony (2 December 2008). ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'' [Television production]. London: [[BBC Four]].</ref> He had left school with no qualifications. For his work in ''EastEnders'', he is particularly known for creating the Slater family along with then producer, [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Amongst significant episodes he scripted are those featuring the deaths of [[Arthur Fowler]] and [[Ethel Skinner]]; the "[[Sharongate]]" storyline; and more recently [[Kat Moon|Kat's]] revelation to [[Zoe Slater|Zoe]] that she was her mother, the [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy]]-Kat-[[Alfie Moon|Alfie]] love triangle, and [[Dot Cotton|Dot]]'s monologue. He was the first writer to do ''EastEnders'' when it began airing three times a week, when the siege at [[The Queen Victoria]] took place in 1994. He continued to work on ''EastEnders'' through a period which saw a reversal in its hitherto declining fortunes, with the programme winning the Most Popular Soap category at the [[National Television Awards]] in 2005. He wrote the first two episodes (aired October 24 & 25 2005) for the return of the characters of [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], popular characters he had originally helped to create back in 1989.

While on staff at ''EastEnders'' Jordan undertook a number of freelance projects. In early 2004, he created hit BBC One con artist drama ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''. He also co-created the [[time travel]] / police drama ''[[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', which began in 2006.

His other credits include; ''[[Boon (TV series)|Boon]]'' (ITV), ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' (ITV), ''[[Trainer (TV series)|Trainer]]'' (BBC), ''[[Eldorado (TV series)|Eldorado]]'' (BBC), ''[[Thief Takers]]'' (ITV), ''[[Where the Heart Is (1997 TV series)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (ITV), ''City Central'' (BBC), ''April Fool's Day'' (ITV), ''Can't Buy Me Love'' (ITV), ''Vanishing Man'' (ITV), ''Perfectly Frank'' (BBC) ''[[Sunburn (TV series)|Sunburn]]'' (BBC), ''[[HolbyBlue]]'' (BBC), ''[[Moving Wallpaper]]'' (ITV), ''[[Echo Beach (soap)|Echo Beach]]'' (ITV).

In January 2007, Jordan's ''EastEnders'' departure was announced as it was his plan to concentrate on running his own new production company, Red Planet Pictures, backed by leading independent producer [[Kudos (production company)|Kudos Film & Television]]. ''[[HolbyBlue]]'', a new BBC One police drama, spun off from the channel's successful medical drama ''[[Holby City]]'' debuted in May 2007, quickly being recommissioned for a second run.{{ref|guardian1}}
Red Planet Pictures projects include medical drama "Crash" for BBC Wales and Jordan's critically acclaimed version of the Nativity story, filmed in Morocco and aired in the UK this Christmas on BBC1.

He also created the shows of ''[[Moving Wallpaper]]'' and ''Echo Beach'' for ITV. The shows were linked to each other, the latter being a soap opera and the former being a sitcom about the production of that soap opera. 

In 2007, Jordan was honoured for his work on ''EastEnders'' at the ''[[British Soap Awards]]'' with a "Special Achievement award". On 14 November 2007, it was announced that Jordan would be returning to ''EastEnders'' less than twelve months after quitting to write one final episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a79836/tony-jordan-returns-to-enders-script-team.html|title='Tony Jordan' returns to 'EastEnders'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> Jordan subsequently wrote the script for [[Dot Branning]]'s [[Pretty Baby....|single-handed episode]], broadcast on 31 January 2008 on [[BBC1]].

In 2008, he worked on ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'' and zombie drama ''Renaissance'', starring [[Kelly Brook]] and Alan Dale. As Head of Red Planet Pictures,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/opportunity/red_planet_prize_2011.shtml Red Planet Prize], BBC Writer's Room, 2011. Retrieved 29 December 2011.</ref> he is also creating new formats{{clarify|date=December 2011}} for the UK and US markets.

His latest work as a writer was ''[[The Nativity (2010 TV series)|The Nativity]]'', a new BBC version of the [[nativity of Jesus]] story starring [[Peter Capaldi]], broadcast in December 2010.<ref>http://www.rejesus.co.uk/post/blog/the_nativity_coming_to_the_bbc</ref> Jordan states he had always had a faith but it was during this work that he became convinced that Jesus who was born in this way is the Son of God and that the Nativity story is a 'true story' and a 'thing of beauty'.<ref>[http://www.christianity.org.uk/index.php/an-interview-with-the-writer-of-the-nativity.php Interview] at the 2010 conference of the Church and Media Network.</ref>

Tony is currently working on scripts for ''Legion'', a dark thriller about one man's fight with the Devil, scripts for series eight of con drama ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'', in addition to a series of single plays entitled ''Behind Closed Doors''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
