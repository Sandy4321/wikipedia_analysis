'''''Oryzomys''''' is a [[genus]] of [[semiaquatic]] rodents in the tribe [[Oryzomyini]] living in southern North America and far northern South America. It includes eight species, two of which<U+2014>the [[marsh rice rat]] (''O.&nbsp;palustris'') of the United States and ''[[Oryzomys couesi|O.&nbsp;couesi]]'' of Mexico and Central America<U+2014>are widespread; the six others have more restricted distributions. The [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] history of the species has been eventful, and most were at one time included in the marsh rice rat; additional species may be recognized in the future. The name ''Oryzomys'' was established in 1857 by [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]] for the marsh rice rat and was soon applied to over a hundred species of American rodents. Subsequently, the genus gradually became more narrowly defined until its current contents were established in 2006, when ten new genera were established for species previously placed in ''Oryzomys''.

Species of ''Oryzomys'' are medium-sized rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts white to [[wikt:buff|buff]]. The animals have broad feet without complete [[ungual tufts]] of hair around the claws and, in at least some species, with [[interdigital webbing|webbing between the toes]]. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the [[braincase]] is high. Both the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' have 56&nbsp;[[chromosome]]s, lack a [[gall bladder]], and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characters are unknown in the other species.

The habitat includes various kinds of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. ''Oryzomys'' species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a [[gestation period]] of 21 to 28&nbsp;days, about four young are born. Species of ''Oryzomys'' are infected by numerous [[parasite]]s and carry at least three [[hantavirus]]es, one of which ([[Bayou virus]]) also infects humans. Two, perhaps three, species have gone extinct over the last two centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' are not threatened.

==Taxonomy==
''Oryzomys'' is one of about thirty genera within the tribe [[Oryzomyini]], a diverse group of well over a hundred species, many of which were formerly also included in ''Oryzomys''.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;1, 10; Weksler et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;1, table&nbsp;1</ref> Oryzomyini is one of several tribes within the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] of the family [[Cricetidae]], which includes hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, most of which occur in South and Central America.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

Within Oryzomyini, a 2006 [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Marcelo Weksler which used both [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] and [[DNA sequence]] data found some evidence that ''Oryzomys'' is most closely related to a group including ''[[Holochilus]]'', ''[[Lundomys]]'', and ''[[Pseudoryzomys]]''. Although analyses based on morphological and combined data supported this relationship, sequences of the [[RBP3|''Rbp3'']] gene alone instead placed ''Oryzomys'' among a group that included ''[[Nectomys]]'', ''[[Sigmodontomys]]'', and a few other genera. In all analyses, ''Oryzomys'' appeared within [[Oryzomyini#Clade D|clade D]] of Oryzomyini.<ref>Weksler, 2006, figs.&nbsp;34<U+2013>39</ref> The relationship between ''Oryzomys'' and the ''Holochilus'' group was supported by five [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] (shared derived characters)<U+2014>absence or reduction of both the hypothenar and interdigital [[paw#Common characteristics|pads]]; reduction of [[ungual tuft]]s of hairs surrounding the claws; having the back margin of the [[zygomatic plate]] of the skull at the same level as the front of the first upper [[molar (tooth)|molar]]; and the [[anterocone]] (front cusp) of the first upper molar divided by an [[anteromedian fossette]]. The first three are adaptations to the [[semiaquatic]] lifestyle that ''Oryzomys'' and the members of the ''Holochilus'' group share, and may thus be examples of [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=W131/>

===Circumscription===
The name ''Oryzomys'' was introduced in 1857 by [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]] for the [[marsh rice rat]] (now ''Oryzomys palustris'') of the eastern United States,<ref name=B482>Baird, 1857, p.&nbsp;482</ref> which had been first described twenty years earlier by [[Richard Harlan]].<ref name=MC1144/> The name combines the Greek ''oryza'' "rice" and ''mys'' "mouse" and refers to the feeding habits of the marsh rice rat.<ref name=SS192>Schwartz and Schwartz, 2001, p.&nbsp;192</ref> Baird placed ''Oryzomys'' as a [[subgenus]] of the now-defunct genus ''[[Hesperomys]]'' and included only the marsh rice rat in it, a classification which was followed by [[Elliott Coues]] in 1874 and 1877.<ref>Coues, 1874, pp.&nbsp;183<U+2013>184; 1877, p.&nbsp;113</ref> In 1890, ''Oryzomys'' was raised to generic rank, and in subsequent years numerous additional species were ascribed to it, many of which were soon moved to separate genera.<ref>Tate, 1932, pp.&nbsp;4ff.</ref> In the 1898 ''Catalogus Mammalium'', [[<U+00C9>douard Louis Trouessart]] listed 67&nbsp;species of ''Oryzomys'',<ref>Trouessart, 1898, pp.&nbsp;523<U+2013>527</ref> including some that are now placed in ''[[Calomys]]'', ''[[Necromys]]'', ''[[Thomasomys]]'', and other genera unrelated to ''Oryzomys''.<ref>Tate, 1932, pp.&nbsp;6<U+2013>7; Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp.&nbsp;1105, 1108, 1128, 1130, 1144, 1179, 1180</ref> Some of the new genera proposed were soon subsumed in ''Oryzomys'' again,<ref>Weksler, 2006, table&nbsp;1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1144</ref> and in ''The Families and Genera of Living Rodents'' (1941), [[Sir John Ellerman, 2nd Baronet|John Ellerman]] listed ''[[Microryzomys]]'', ''[[Oligoryzomys]]'', ''[[Melanomys]]'', ''[[Nesoryzomys]]'', and ''[[Oecomys]]'' as [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s of ''Oryzomys''<ref name=E340>Ellerman, 1941, p.&nbsp;340</ref> and included about 127&nbsp;species in it.<ref>Ellerman, 1940, pp.&nbsp;345<U+2013>359</ref> In 1948, [[Philip Hershkovitz]] suggested that other oryzomyines like ''[[Nectomys]]'' and ''[[Megalomys]]'' could as well be included in ''Oryzomys'',<ref>Hershkovitz, 1948, p.&nbsp;54, footnote&nbsp;1</ref> and [[Clayton Ray]] followed this suggestion in 1962.<ref>Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;16<U+2013>26</ref>

Hershkovitz and Ray's classification was never widely followed, and from 1976 on authors started to reinstate some of the other groups lumped in ''Oryzomys'' as separate genera.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;10, table&nbsp;1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1144</ref> The genus was reduced to 43&nbsp;species (out of 110 in Oryzomyini) in the third edition (2005) of ''Mammal Species of the World'',<ref name=MC900>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;900</ref> but it was still not a natural, [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group;<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1144; Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;10</ref> rather, it mostly united those oryzomyines that lacked the conspicuous specializations of other genera.<ref name=W82>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;82</ref> In 2006, Marcelo Weksler's comprehensive phylogenetic analysis produced further evidence that the genus was [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]], as species of ''Oryzomys'' were dispersed all over the oryzomyine tree. He proposed that eleven new genera should be created to accommodate those species that were not closely related to the [[type species]] of ''Oryzomys'', the marsh rice rat;<ref name=W75>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;75</ref> he considered other options that would require fewer new genera, but argued that that would result in less meaningful genus-level groups in Oryzomyini.<ref>Weksler, 2006, fig.&nbsp;42, p.&nbsp;77</ref> Later in the same year, Weksler, Percequillo, and Voss created ten new genera<U+2014>''[[Aegialomys]]'', ''[[Cerradomys]]'', ''[[Eremoryzomys]]'', ''[[Euryoryzomys]]'', ''[[Hylaeamys]]'', ''[[Mindomys]]'', ''[[Nephelomys]]'', ''[[Oreoryzomys]]'', ''[[Sooretamys]]'', and ''[[Transandinomys]]''<U+2014>for species formerly placed in ''Oryzomys'' and placed six more species related to ''[[Handleyomys alfaroi|"Oryzomys" alfaroi]]'' in ''[[Handleyomys]]'' pending the description of more new genera for them.<ref>Weksler et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>2</ref> They left only five species in ''Oryzomys'', which was now finally a natural, monophyletic group. Because of subsequent taxonomic work, the number of species has since increased to at least eight.<ref>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, pp.&nbsp;115<U+2013>116; Weksler et al., 2006, table&nbsp;1</ref>

Some problems remain: [[?Oryzomys pliocaenicus|?''Oryzomys pliocaenicus'']], a [[Miocene]]<!--sic!--> fossil from Kansas, is of uncertain identity but may belong in ''[[Bensonomys]]'',<ref name=W87>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;87</ref> and the identity of ''[[Oryzomys anoblepas]]'', a Brazilian subfossil, is yet to be determined.<ref>Pardi<U+00F1>as et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;242</ref> Fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and [[Pliocene]] of New Mexico have also been ascribed to ''Oryzomys'', but probably incorrectly.<ref name=W87/> A possible ''Oryzomys'' has been recorded from the [[Irvingtonian]] (Pleistocene) of [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>Churcher, 1984, p.&nbsp;149</ref>

The current concept of ''Oryzomys'' derives from the ''palustris-mexicanus'' group recognized within a much larger genus ''Oryzomys'' by Merriam (1901) and the ''palustris'' group proposed by Goldman (1918).<ref name=CAC116/> Merriam recognized 21&nbsp;species within his group, but Goldman consolidated them into eight<U+2014>the marsh rice rat in the United States, ''[[Oryzomys couesi|O.&nbsp;couesi]]'' in far southern Texas, Mexico, and Central America, and six others with small distributions.<ref>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;16</ref> In 1960, [[Raymond Hall]] united ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and the marsh rice rat into a single species, ''Oryzomys palustris'', and thereafter, other localized forms were also included in ''O.&nbsp;palustris''.<ref name=MC1147>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1147</ref> Hershkovitz described another species in the group, ''[[Oryzomys gorgasi|O.&nbsp;gorgasi]]'' from Colombia, in 1970<ref>Hershkovitz, 1970, p.&nbsp;700</ref> and the next year he noted that ''[[Oryzomys dimidiatus|O.&nbsp;dimidiatus]]'', previously classified as a ''Nectomys'', was similar to ''O.&nbsp;palustris''.<ref>Hershkovitz, 1971, pp.&nbsp;789, 791</ref> After 1979, the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' were again regarded as separate as a result of further work in Texas, where their ranges meet.<ref name=MC1147/> While reviewing ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' in 2001, J. S<U+00E1>nchez H. and colleagues redefined and characterized the ''O.&nbsp;palustris'' group and listed ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'', ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'', and the marsh rice rat as its members;<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;209<U+2013>210</ref> [[Guy Musser]] and [[Michael Carleton]] in the 2005 third edition of ''Mammal Species of the World'' additionally listed ''[[Oryzomys nelsoni|O.&nbsp;nelsoni]]'' from [[Mar<U+00ED>a Madre Island]] in western Mexico.<ref name=MC1144/>

In 2006, Weksler and colleagues followed the 2001 definition by S<U+00E1>nchez and others for the restricted genus ''Oryzomys'', but added ''[[Oryzomys antillarum|O.&nbsp;antillarum]]'' from [[Jamaica]] as a species.<ref>Weksler, 2006, table&nbsp;1, footnote&nbsp;e</ref> Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed ''Oryzomys'' from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of ''Oryzomys''. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus ''[[Oryzomys albiventer|O.&nbsp;albiventer]]'' and ''[[Oryzomys peninsulae|O.&nbsp;peninsulae]]''.<ref name=CAC116/> Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the [[subfossil]] ''Oryzomys curasoae'' from [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] as an island population of ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref name=VW73>Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;73</ref> The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']], [[interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein]], and [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] 1 genes to assess relationships within ''Oryzomys''. They recommended that the marsh rice rat be split into two species and that ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' be split into four species on the basis of the observed sequence divergence and other data.<ref name=Hea342-3/>

Merriam divided his ''palustris-mexicanus'' group in two "series" according to the color of the underparts (white or [[wikt:fulvous|fulvous]]).<ref>Merriam, 1901, p.&nbsp;275</ref> Goldman divided his ''palustris'' group in two "sections"<U+2014>a ''couesi'' section with ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and six related species, and a ''palustris'' section with ''O.&nbsp;palustris'' only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger [[sphenopalatine vacuities]] (openings in the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the gap behind the end of the [[palate]]).<ref name=G20>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;20</ref> As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and the marsh rice rat among species of ''Oryzomys'' in the strict sense, he could not test those groups.<ref>Weksler, 2006, table&nbsp;4</ref> Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the ''palustris'' group may be more [[semiaquatic]]ally adapted than the members of the ''couesi'' group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the ''palustris'' group. Members of the ''couesi'' group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller [[sphenopalatine foramen]], a [[foramen]] (opening) in the side of the skull above the molars, and a more highly developed [[anterolabial cingulum]] on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the ''couesi'' group, but absent in the ''palustris'' group. [[Interdigital webbing]] may be more highly developed in the ''palustris'' group.<ref name=CAC117>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009</ref> Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' to the exclusion of ''O.&nbsp;palustris'', but with low confidence.<ref>Voss and Weksler, 2009, fig.&nbsp;1</ref> The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the ''palustris'' and ''couesi'' groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to ''O.&nbsp;couesi'') was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other.<ref>Hanson et al., 2010, figs.&nbsp;2<U+2013>5, table&nbsp;1</ref>

''Oryzomys'' contains medium-sized, [[semi-aquatic]]ally specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts and white to buff on the underparts.<ref>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;19; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;206; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116</ref> The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the [[introduced species]] [[black rat]] and [[brown rat]], but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts.<ref name=W1/> The [[vibrissa]]e (whiskers) are short and the ears are small and well-haired. The tail is usually as long as or longer than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight [[mammae]], as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities ([[squamae]]). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts.<ref>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;19; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;206; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116; S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;209</ref> [[Interdigital webbing]] may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.<ref name=CAC117/>

The [[karyotype]] has been recorded in various populations of the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and is apparently stable  within the genus at 56&nbsp;[[chromosome]]s, with the [[fundamental number]] of chromosomal arms ranging from 56 to 60 (2n&nbsp;=&nbsp;56, FN&nbsp;=&nbsp;56<U+2013>60).<ref name=Hea342-3/> In both species, the [[stomach]] has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines ([[unilocular-hemiglandular]]): it is not split in two chambers by an [[incisura angularis]] and the front part ([[antrum]]) is covered by a [[glandular epithelium]].<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;59</ref> Furthermore, the [[gall bladder]] is absent, a synapomorphy of Oryzomyini.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;58<U+2013>59</ref>
[[File:Oryzomys antillarum Ray.png|thumb|left|alt=See caption.|[[Holotype]] skull of ''[[Oryzomys antillarum]]'', seen from above (A), below (B) and the left (C)<ref>Ray, 1962, plate&nbsp;V</ref>]]
''Oryzomys'' species have a large skull with a short rostrum and high [[braincase]]. The [[interorbital region]], located between the eyes, is narrowest to the front and is flanked by well-developed beads at its margins. The [[zygomatic plate]] is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct [[jugal bone]]. The [[interparietal bone]], part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short;<ref name=G19-CAC116>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;19; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116</ref> its narrowness is a synapomorphy for ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis.<ref name=W131>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;131</ref> The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin at the front of the first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the [[maxilla]]ry bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed [[posterolateral palatal pits]]. There is no [[alisphenoid strut]], an extension of the [[alisphenoid bone]] that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The [[auditory bulla]]e are large. The condition of the [[artery|arteries]] in the head is highly [[derived]].<ref name=G19-CAC116/> In the [[mandible]] (lower jaw), the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]], a [[process (anatomy)|process]] at the back, is well developed<ref name=G19>Goldman, 1918, p.&nbsp;19</ref> and the [[capsular process]], a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.<ref name=G20/>

As usual in oryzomyines, the molars are [[pentalophodont]] (have the [[mesoloph]]s and [[mesolophid]]s, accessory crests, well developed) and [[bunodont]], with the cusps higher than the connecting crests.<ref name=CAC116/> The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats.<ref>Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;1; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, pp.&nbsp;278<U+2013>279</ref> The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar ([[anterocone]] and [[anteroconid]], respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an [[anteromedian flexus]] or [[anteromedian flexid|flexid]]. Behind the anterocone, the [[anteroloph]] (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone.<ref name=CAC116/> On both the second and third lower molars, the [[anterolophid]] (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus.<ref name=W131/> The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.<ref name=CAC116/>

As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' have a complex penis, with the [[baculum]] (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;55<U+2013>56</ref> The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;56<U+2013>57</ref> The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with ''[[Oligoryzomys]]'' among oryzomyines examined.<ref>Hooper and Musser, 1964, p.&nbsp;13; Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;57</ref> On the [[urethral process]], located in the crater at the end of the penis,<ref>Hooper and Musser, 1964, p.&nbsp;7</ref> a fleshy process (the [[subapical lobule]]) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except ''[[Holochilus brasiliensis]]''.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;57</ref> Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.<ref name=W131/>

==Distribution, ecology, and behavior==
[[File:Oryzomys couesi, Tylomys panamensis.jpg|thumb|alt=A brown rat on a rock above and a gray rat eating corn below.|''[[Oryzomys couesi]]'' (above) and ''[[Tylomys panamensis]]'' (below)<ref>Alston, 1882, plate&nbsp;15</ref>]]
The range of ''Oryzomys'' extends from [[New Jersey]] in the eastern United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]].<ref>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116; Voss and Weksler, 2009, p.&nbsp;73</ref> Species of ''Oryzomys'' usually live in wet habitats such as marshes, streams, and [[mangrove]]s,<ref name=CAC116/> but both the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' are also occasionally encountered in drier habitats.<ref>Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207; Kruchek, 2004, p.&nbsp;269</ref> They occur or occurred on many [[continental shelf|continental-shelf]] islands and one [[oceanic island]], [[Jamaica]]; their adeptness at colonizing islands may be caused by their close association with water and frequent occurrence in coastal wetlands.<ref name=CAC114/> The oldest fossils date to the [[Rancholabrean]] of the United States, about 300,000 years ago; although there have been some earlier North American records, those are not in fact referable to ''Oryzomys'' or even Oryzomyini.<ref>Weksler, 2006, pp.&nbsp;87<U+2013>88</ref> Oryzomyines likely evolved in South America east of the Andes; the presence of ''Oryzomys'' in Central America and other trans-Andean regions is thought to be the result of one of several independent invasions of this region by oryzomyines.<ref name=W88>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;88</ref> Alternatively, ''Oryzomys'' may have evolved from the [[Pliocene]] North American ''[[Jacobsomys]]''.<ref>Lindsay, 2008, p.&nbsp;473</ref> ''O.&nbsp;antillarum'' may have reached Jamaica during the [[last glacial period]] while sea levels were low.<ref name=M439/>

Behavior is known mainly from the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', with some scattered data from the other species. ''Oryzomys'' are [[semiaquatic]], spending much time in the water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground;<ref name=R205>Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;205</ref> both the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed.<ref>Esher et al., 1978, p.&nbsp;556; Cook et al., 2001; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p.&nbsp;279; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;279</ref> Both are also [[nocturnal|active during the night]] and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water.<ref>Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p.&nbsp;279; Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;4; Hall and Dalquest, 1963, p.&nbsp;289</ref> Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat.<ref>Bloch and Rose, 2005, p.&nbsp;303; Medell<U+00ED>n and Medell<U+00ED>n, 2006, p.&nbsp;710</ref> In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28&nbsp;days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five.<ref>Jones and Engstrom, 1986, p.&nbsp;12; Medell<U+00ED>n and Medell<U+00ED>n, 2006, p.&nbsp;710; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p.&nbsp;280; Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;2; Linzey and Hammerson, 2008</ref> Young marsh rice rats and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' become reproductively active when about 50&nbsp;days old.<ref>Medell<U+00ED>n and Medell<U+00ED>n, 2006, p.&nbsp;710; Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;2</ref>

The marsh rice rat, ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', and ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' are known to be [[omnivore]]s, eating both plant and animal material. They eat both seeds and green plant parts and consume a variety of animals, including [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and many others.<ref>Medell<U+00ED>n and Medell<U+00ED>n, 2006, p.&nbsp;710; Reid, 2006, p.&nbsp;207; S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;211; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p.&nbsp;280</ref> The [[barn owl]] (''Tyto alba'') is a major predator on the marsh rice rat<ref>Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;2</ref> and remains of ''O.&nbsp;antillarum'', ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', and ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'' have been found in [[owl pellet]] deposits.<ref>Anthony, 1920, p.&nbsp;166; Woodman, 1995, p.&nbsp;1, table&nbsp;1; McFarlane and Debrot, 2001, p.&nbsp;182</ref> Several other animals are known to prey on ''Oryzomys''.<ref>Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p.&nbsp;281; Vega et al., 2004, p.&nbsp;217</ref> A variety of [[parasite]]s are known from ''O.&nbsp;couesi''<ref>Hall and Dalquest, 1963, p.&nbsp;288; Eckerlin, 2005, p.&nbsp;155; Underwood et al., 1986; Barnard et al., 1971, p.&nbsp;1294</ref> and the marsh rice rat<ref>Wolfe, 1982, p.&nbsp;3</ref> and two parasitic [[nematode]]s have been found in ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi''.<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;211</ref>
==Human interactions==
Two species of ''Oryzomys'', ''O.&nbsp;antillarum'' and ''O.&nbsp;nelsoni'', have gone extinct since the 19th century,<ref>Morgan, 1993, p.&nbsp;239; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1152</ref> and a third, ''O.&nbsp;peninsulae'', is unlikely to be still extant.<ref name=CAC114/> Their extinction may have been caused by habitat destruction and by [[introduced species]] such as the [[small Asian mongoose]] and the [[brown rat|brown]] and [[black rat]].<ref>Morgan, 1993, p.&nbsp;239; Ray, 1962, pp.&nbsp;33<U+2013>34; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, pp.&nbsp;114<U+2013>115</ref> These same causes may threaten ''O.&nbsp;gorgasi'', which the [[IUCN Red List]] assesses as "[[Endangered]]".<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;205, 211; Ochoa et al., 2008</ref> ''O.&nbsp;albiventer'' has been affected by human alteration of its habitat, but likely still survives.<ref name=CAC115>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;115</ref> In contrast, the widespread species, the marsh rice rat and ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', are common and of no conservation concern<U+2014>indeed, both have been considered a pest<U+2014>but some populations are threatened.<ref>Linzey and Hammerson, 2008; Linzey et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2004, p.&nbsp;218; Schmidly and Davis, 2004, p.&nbsp;281; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, pp.&nbsp;278<U+2013>280; Hofmann et al., 1990, p.&nbsp;162</ref> Like these two species, ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' is assessed as "[[Least Concern]]" by the Red List.<ref>Linzey and Hammerson, 2008; Linzey et al., 2008; Timm and Reid, 2008</ref>

The marsh rice rat is the [[natural reservoir]] of the [[Bayou virus]], the second most common cause of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] in the United States.<ref>McIntyre et al., 2005, p.&nbsp;1083</ref> Two other hantaviruses, [[Catacamas virus]] and [[Playa de Oro virus]], occur in ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively, but are not known to infect humans.<ref>Milazzo et al., 2006; Chu et al., 2008</ref>
