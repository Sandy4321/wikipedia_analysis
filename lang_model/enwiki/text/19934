'''John Shuttleworth''' is a fictional [[singer-songwriter]] and [[radio personality|radio presenter]], created by English [[comedian|comedy]] [[actor]] and [[musician]], [[Graham Fellows]] in 1986. Shuttleworth is in his late 40s and is from Walkley in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]]. He has a quiet manner and slightly nerdish tendencies. His musical talents are usually expressed through his [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] PSS portable keyboard, and include "Pigeons in Flight" <U+2013> a song which Shuttleworth attempted to have selected for the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Character portrait==
Shuttleworth is a very affecting character. Essentially decent and benevolent, but with a painful lack of self-awareness, the unfortunate gap between his actual musical talent and his steadfast belief in the possibility of his eventual pop super-stardom is the main source of the character's tragi-comedy. His "next-door neighbour and sole agent", Ken Worthington is more of a hindrance than a help to John's life.

The character was inspired by some demo tapes sent in to [[Chappell Music]] where Graham worked as a songwriter in the 1980s, and takes some of his mannerisms from Graham's father and from mouse breeders he knew as a young man in Sheffield (a character prototypical of John Shuttleworth appeared on the single "Men Of Oats And Creosote").

==Supporting characters==
Shuttleworth has fronted several radio and television series, usually supported by other characters, also voiced by Fellows, including agent / manager, Ken Worthington ("TV's Mr. Clarinet Man"), who came last on the TV talent show [[New Faces]] in 1973, as well as John's wife Mary Shuttleworth, their two teenage children Darren and Karen, and Mary's friend Joan Chitty.

==Broadcasting==
The Shuttleworth's various adventures have featured on several radio shows, including ''[[The Shuttleworths]]'', ''Shuttleworth's Showtime'' and ''Radio Shuttleworth'', with Fellows supplying all the voices and performing on his organ. He also made a four-part TV series supposedly filmed by Worthington, ''500 Bus Stops'' (the title being a parodying reference to [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[200 Motels]]''), about a UK national tour thwarted very early on by the demise of his beloved [[Austin Ambassador]] Y Reg but then continued by public transport. The venues visited were invariably mundane and uninspiring, and situations experienced usually demoralising, but were optimistically dealt with as if they were defining moments in his career. There followed a [[television]] special, ''Europigeon'', following the success (or otherwise) of ''Pigeons In Flight''. 
In May 2008 Fellows appeared in the [[BBC]]s ''[[Comedy Map of Britain]]'' in which he discussed the origin of his Shuttleworth character.

In October 2010, John commenced his five-month ''A Man With No More Rolls'' tour, claiming that it was a misprint and should have been called ''A Man With No Morals''
