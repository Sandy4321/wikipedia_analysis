'''Nicole Franklin''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Tessa James]]. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 18 April 2008. Nicole was itroduced by executive producer [[Cameron Welsh]]. Nicole was mentioned various time before appearing on-screen, James was cast in the role and described by Welsh as an "exciting talent". He predicted that the viewers would respond "really well" to her. James said she never forgot how lucky she was to be working in the serial. Nicole was initially portrayed as a shallow "party girl" with "wild ways". Also described as a "high maintenance" female, she has been shown to dress constantly in a stylish manner. Nicole is also become notable for her many relationships. Her first prominent romance was with Geoff Campbell. James, along with [[Lincoln Lewis]] who played Geoff have both stated that the characters are the "complete opposites" of one another, however they credit him as a catalyst in Nicole mellowing her brash attitude. Their storyline allowed the actors to take part in one of the serial's "biggest ever location shoots", when the couple became stranded on a  remote desert island. Their relationship explored themes including premarital sex, proposal of marriage and pregnancy. In one storyline Nicole was involved in a same sex kiss with fellow character [[Freya Duric]], which was branded controversial by various media sources. The plot saw Nicole question her persona, believing Geoff had transformed her into a boring person.

Another relationship Nicole persued was with Aden Jefferies, her long time closest friend. Aden had a strong fanbase from his previous relationship with [[Belle Taylor]]. Actor [[Todd Lasance]] correctly envisioned the audience being divided over their relationship because of this. James branded the romance as Nicole's most "serious and in-depth" pairing she had during her time in the serial. However both actors agreed that ultimately they had a "brother-sister relationship" that developed into something more. Nicole has also been featured in various other romantic storylines, such as a breif fling with [[Liam Murphy]], James said that he was compatible with Nicole because he had "the edge she was after". He also dated [[Trey Palmer]] and they became involved in sex tape storyline, many newspapers reported on the plot because it "echoed" co-star Lewis' real life sex tape scandal. Producer Welsh once stated he believed Nicole was destined to become "full circle" and Nicole began behaving erratic and wild once more, due to her failed romances and the death of her friend Belle. She also had an affair with an older male character, [[Sid Walker]]. James liked the fact Nicole had so many romances because she got to kiss many of her co-stars.

James announced her departure from ''Home and Away'' in March 2011 and Nicole will leave later in the year. One of her final storylines was a pregnancy plot. She fell pregnant to her villianous lover Penn Graham, who had died on-screen earlier. Nicole felt she was too young and unable to offer a child stability, so she agreed to let [[Marilyn Chambers (Home and Away)|Marilyn Chambers]] adopt the baby upon it's birth. James and the writing team took the storyline "very seriously" and conducted research to portray the issue sensitively. After the baby's birth, actress [[Emily Symons]] said the scenes involving her character Marilyn catching Nicole breast feeding George were "volitile" - because they realise Nicole wants her baby. Nicole has recieved critical analysis from various sources, with perception being mixed to positive. ''[[TV Week]]'' were nutruel to aspects of her pregnancy plot but opined James was one of the serials best actress'. The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said that being single was good for the character. She has also been likened to celebrities for her glamorous image, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said she was like a "less moody [[Peaches Geldof]]" and ''[[Inside Soap]]'' opined that she "worshiped at the shrine of [[Paris Hilton]]''.

===Relationship with Geoff Campbell===
Nicole embarks on a relationship with Geoff Campbell ([[Lincoln Lewis]]), not before they are embroiled in a "sordid love trinagle" along with [[Melody Jones (Home and Away)|Melody Jones]] ([[Celeste Dodwell]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Melissa|title=Tight-lipped stars happy to be away at bay|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=age&kw=nicole+franklin&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=NCH081031861D16Q0TOA|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=11 May 2011 |date=31 October 20  08<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ybrHb35c|archivedate=11 May 2011-->}}</ref> In one storyline Nicole and Geoff became stranded on a "deserted island" and nearly die. The episodes were filmed on Box Beach located at [[Shoal Bay, New South Wales]] as part of a two day location shoot.<ref name=shoal/> Nicole nearly drowns in scenes which aired for the serial's "cliff-hanger" in 2008. James and Lewis took scuba diving lessons in preparation for the storyline. Filming the storyline was compromised by logistical challenges. The crew had to move camera equipment between boats and the crew walked around the perimeters of the beach in order to avoid leaving footprints. This was to keep the authenticity of a deserted location. The storyline was also given a "big budget", featured helicopters and a number of promotional adverts were aired on Seven.<ref name=shoal>{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Amy|title=Boxed in at the bay|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=697BA838CA67FCA5DBE3AF281EBDDD89?page=1&sy=age&kw=tessa+james&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=NCH0808227P4J367PNNC|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=22 August 2008}}</ref>

They wash up on a deserted island and are forced to survive without food and clothing. Describing the effect it has on Nicole and Geoff, James stated: "They have no food, shelter or clothing. [...] They find moments to make each other laugh, though, and realise how much they mean to one another."<ref name=isa/> Geoff has strong religous views and does not believe in premarital sex. However, the environment they are in causes him to let his guard down and they sleep together. Lewis told ''[[TV Week]]'' that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other. He added that "the fact they were both pretty much naked didn't help". He conluded the fact they were both kids, trying to keep warm - that then "stuff happens".<ref name=guilt/> Geoff is left "guilt-ridden" because he gave into temptation. He does not regret it, but acknowledges that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage.<ref name=guilt/> Therefore Geoff sees no other option but to propose to Nicole. Lewis stated, "He's not 100% sureabout that either, but he feels that if they're goping to have sex, a wedding is the only solution."<ref name=guilt/> Describing Nicole's reaction he said that she was "dumbfounded" by his offer, as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her. Nicole refuses when she realises his reasons for proposing. According to James, the moment managed to ruin their passion, she also commented that: "Nicole has liked Geoff for ages and was so happy to have got together with him - but now he's spoiled it." James also admitted she was trilled to learn Nicole would turn down his proposal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Marry Me Nicole!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=18 - 24 October 2008|pages=24|accessdate=22 May 2011|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref> James later opined that Nicole was "the one" for Geoff, but did not believe that Geoff was "the one" for Nicole.<ref name=guilt>{{cite journal|title=Geoff and Nicole to wed|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=30 August - 5 September 2008|pages=4|accessdate=22 May 2011|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}</ref>

Nicole and Geoff's relationship becomes strained. Nicole decides to plan a return trip to the island, believing it will solve their problems and bring them closer together. James said that Geoff loves the suprise, but finds Nicole "very sexy and tempting".<ref name=returns/> She added that everything about Nicole forces Geoff to question his religous beliefs  and he feels he "needs to back away". Their trip soon turns disasterous when a man named Derrick Quaid ([[John Atkinson (actor)|John Atkinson]]) steals there food and intimidates the couple. He admits he is a murderer and tries to attack Geoff with a knife. James said he "puts himself in harms way" to save Nicole.<ref name=returns/>

In 2009, James told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that Nicole and Geoff had a strong friendship underneath their romance.<ref name=lovelist/> She also described their compatability stating: "They're complete opposites, which works well for them. It's a bit of a fiery relationship, and they've been through a lot together."<ref name=lovelist/> Whilst Lewis added: "They're also very similiar in some of their strongest traits. Geoff and Nicole are both stubborn and opinionated, and in some ways they're naive. In a weird way they show a side to each other nobody else gets to see."<ref name=lovelist/> James opined Nicole's wild behaviour was often to much for Geoff to cope with. In public, Lewis initially had negative feedback from older viewers because they felt Geoff was better suited to Melody. He revealed they felt like she was a bad influence for Geoff because she often played games. However towards the end of their relationship he felt perception had changed due to viewers having a better understanding of Nicole's persona.<ref name=lovelist>{{cite journal|title=The Inside Soap 2009 love list|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=21 - 27 February 2009|pages=44, 45|accessdate=22 May 2011|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref>

Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it."<ref name=lipserv/> Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was "angry" because she was on Freya's "not hot list". Freya kisses her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just "happy to be center of attention" and happy that people were talking about her again.<ref name=lipserv/> The incident eventually brings her to the realisation that she has become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.<ref name=lipserv>{{cite journal|title=Lip Service|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=28 February - 6 March 2009|pages=26|accessdate=7 May 2011|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref>

In mid 2009, producers decided to take Nicole's storyline into a "u-turn", when she reverted back to her "wild ways".<ref name=ruin/> At the time Nicole had endjured repetitive personal truama including failed relationships, Roman being sent to prison and her best friend Belle was dying of cancer. James explained: "It's all too much for her and she can't handle it, so she reverts to her wild ways."<ref name=ruin/> Geoff notices Nicoles erratic behaviour and attempts to help her. She tries to "lure him into bed" after he comforts her, however he turns her down. James said she no longer had romantic feelings for Geoff, but was actually in a "vulnerable state".<ref name=ruin/> She then starts relying on alcohol more, and parties with fellow "wild child" [[Indigo Walker]] ([[Samara Weaving]]) at a "rowdy" venue. James explained that Nicole sees alcohol as an answer to her problems. The fact that "she's trying to deal with too masny things" saw Nicole transform into a messed up and depressed person.<ref name=ruin/>

Nicole becomes more irresponsible with the more she drinks and was in the company of many men. Geoff arrived and saved her from danger, Lewis said there was a part of Geoff that still loved Nicole. However they did not start anything again, James said she understood why because of their complicated backstory.<ref name=ruin/> However Geoff continues to support Nicole as he realises that "a lot of people she was closest to have deserted her".
