'''Northman''' ({{lang-ang|Nor<U+00FE>man}}; fl. 994) was a late 10th century [[Anglo-Saxons|English]] ealdorman (or earl), with a territorial base in [[Northumbria]] north of the [[river Tees]]. He appears in two different witnesses. These are, namely, the textual tradition of [[Durham]] witnessed by ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'' and the Durham ''[[Durham Liber Vitae|Liber Vitae]]'', and an appearance in a witness list of a [[charter]] of King  [[<U+00C6>thelred II]] dated to 994. 

Neither of these witnesses provide a patronymic nor an "earldom". There is a possibility therefore that the two Northmans are different characters, though they are generally thought to be the same.<ref>Rollason, ''Libellus de exordio'', pp. 154&ndash;5, n.16; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 211</ref> Almost nothing is known about Northman besides being an ealdorman in northern Northumbia, our ignorance extending to the identities of his parents or any children or spouses he may have had. 

==Durham Northman==
The first witness comes from the historical traditions preserved in [[Durham]], related in two connected sources. The former of these is the grant <U+2014> one of three grants written into a blank leaf at the end of the original volume of the Durham ''[[Durham Liber Vitae|Liber Vitae]]'' <U+2014> ascribed to Earl Northman (the other two to Earl Ulfketil and Earl Thored).<ref>South, ''Historia'', pp. 6&ndash;7</ref> Northmann's grant is in folio 33<sup>v</sup>,<ref>Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de exordio'', p. 154, n. 16</ref> and is thought to date to the late 10th or early 11th century.<ref>South (ed.), ''Historia'', p. 7</ref> It records that Northman gave [[Escomb]] (on the [[river Wear]] between [[Witton-le-Wear]] and [[Bishop Auckland]]) to the community of St Cuthbert.<ref>Text: ''Her syle<U+00F0> Nor<U+00F0>man eorl into S'ce Cu<U+00F0>berhte Ediscum <sub>7</sub> <U+00FE> eall <U+00F0><U+00E6>r into hyre<U+00F0> <sub>7</sub> <U+00F0>one feor<U+00F0>an <U+00E6>cer <U+00E6>t Foregenne''; see Stevenson (ed.), ''Liber vit<U+00E6>'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QvoQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Liber+Vitae&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=CD08iWOvet&sig=reJwBzwTrKZmHjUULwf8_3J5PJM&hl=en&ei=mLTFSbeIMJm1jAf-vL2wCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result#PPA57,M1 p. 57]</ref> 

This grant appears to have been used as a source for the ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'' ("History of St Cuthbert") <U+00A7> 31, which probably made use of several such charters when it was written.<ref>South, ''Historia'', pp. 6&ndash;8</ref> The text purports to record a "lease" by Bishop [[Aldhun|Aldhun]], [[List of Bishops of Durham|bishop of St Cuthbert]] (c.990&ndash;c.1018), to three different earls:<blockquote>These are the lands which Bishop Aldhun [990&ndash;1018] and the whole congregation of St Cuthbert presented to these three, Earl Ethred [<U+00C6>thelred], Earl Northman and Earl Uhtred: [[Gainford, County Durham|Gainford]], [[Whorlton, County Durham|Whorlton]], Sledwich, [[Barforth]], [[Startforth]], [[Lartington]], Marwood Green, [[Stainton, County Durham|Stainton]], Streatlam, Cleatlam, [[Langton, County Durham|Langton]], [[Morton Tinmouth]], [[Piercebridge]], Bishop Auckland and [[West Auckland]], Copeland, ''Weardseatle'', [[Binchester]], ''Cuthbertestun'', Thickley, Escombe, Witton-le-Wear, [[Hunwick]], Newton Cap, Helme Park. Whoever seizes from St Cuthbert any part of these, may he perish on the [[Day of Judgment]].<ref>South (ed.), ''Historia'', pp. 66&ndash;9</ref></blockquote> ''Weardseatle'' and ''Cuthbertestun'' are unidentified, though the historian Ted South thought ''Weardseatle'' might be St Andrew Auckland.<ref>Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de exordio'', p. 154, n. 16; South, ''Historia'', p. 69</ref> This list is in fact two blocks of estates, one centred on Gainford around the river Tees and the other around Bishop Auckland on the river Wear.<ref>South (ed.), ''Historia'', p. 113</ref>

==Wilton Northman==
A ''Nor<U+00FE>man dux'', "Ealdorman Northmann", witnessed a charter dating to 994 by King [[<U+00C6>thelred II]] ("the Unready").<ref name=Sawyer>{{citation|title=Sawyer 881|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+881 | publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> The charter is a grant of 10 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s at [[Fovant]], [[Wiltshire]], to the [[Wilton Abbey|church of St Mary]], [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]].<ref name=Sawyer/> He is one of seven ealdormen witnessing the charter, and appears sixth in order, ahead of one ''W<U+00E6>l<U+00F0>eof dux'', probably [[Waltheof of Bamburgh]].<ref>Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXII (1 of 2)</ref> 

If these identifications are correct, and given that <U+00C6>lhelm, ealdorman of southern Northumbria appears in the same charter, it is unclear what arrangement allowed both Waltheof and Northman to be hold the title of ealdorman in northern Northumbria at the same time. Northumbria in this period was only supposed to have had two ealdormen, as declared earlier in the century by King [[Eadred of England]]. One was for Northumbria north of the Tees, and one for the area of south.<ref>Whitelock, "Dealings of the Kings", p. 77; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 211; Arnold (ed.), ''Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia'', vol. ii, p. 382; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 77</ref>

Alex Woolf noted that the previous year, 993, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that [[<U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr Tryggvason]] had invaded Northumbria and sacked Bamburgh, whereupon the southern English raised an army:<blockquote>(s.a. 993) In this year Bamburgh was sacked and much booty was captured there, and after that the army came to the mouth of the Humber and did great damage there, both in Lindsey and in Northumbria. Then a very large English army was collected, and when they should have joined battle, the leaders Fr<U+00E6>na, Godwine and Frythegyst, first started the flight.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 211; report in Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recensions C, D and E, translated in Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', vol. i, p. 235; see text at [http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/c/c-L.html ASC C], [http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/d/d-L.html D] & [http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/e/e-L.html E]</ref></blockquote> Woolf thought that both Northman and Waltheof were in the south for this reason.<ref name=Woolf-211>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 211</ref> The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reported that in the following year, <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr Tryggvason and [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sveinn Forkbeard]] attacked London and southern England.<ref>Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', vol. i, p. 235</ref> 

It is not known when or how Northman died, nor who succeeded him direcly. Nor can a relationship with any other [[Earl of Northumbria|Northumbria earl]] be established, though if there is any accuracy or chronological order to the lease notice in the ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'', he lived until at least the beginning of Aldhun's episcopate, and was followed by [[Uhtred the Bold]] and preceded by Earl <U+00C6>thelred.<ref>South, ''Historia'', pp. 66&ndash;9, 112&ndash;3</ref>
