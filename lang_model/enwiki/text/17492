'''Hamilton Fish''' (August 3, 1808{{ndash}} September 7, 1893) was an [[United States|American]] statesman and politician who served as the [[List of Governors of New York|16th Governor of New York]], [[United States Senator]] and [[United States Secretary of State]]. Fish has been considered one of the best Secretary of States in the United States history; known for his judiciousness and reform efforts during the Grant Administration.<ref name="Editors">American Heritage Editors (December, 1981), ''The Ten Best Secretaries Of State<U+2026>''.</ref>  Fish settled the controversial [[Alabama Claims]] with [[Great Britain]] through his development of the concept of [[international arbitration]].<ref name="Editors"/> Fish kept the United States out of war with [[Spain]] over [[Cuba|Cuban]] independence by coolly handling the volatile [[Virginius Incident]].<ref name="Editors"/>  In 1875, Fish initiated the process for Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's abundant sugar supply.<ref name="Editors"/>  Fish organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between between South American countries and Spain.<ref name="U.S. Department of State">United States Department of State (December 4, 1871), ''Foreign relations of the United States'', pp. 775-777.</ref> Fish worked with James Milton Turner, America's first [[African American]] consul, to settle the [[Grebo people|Liberian-Grebo]] civil war.<ref name="Kremer">Kremer 1991, pp. 82<U+2013>87.</ref> President Grant stated that Hamilton Fish, above all, was the person whom he most trusted for political advice.<ref>Corning (1918), p. 58.</ref>

Fish came from a prominent wealthy New York family and attended [[Columbia College of Columbia University]].  Upon graduation, Fish passed the bar, worked as New York's [[commissioner of deeds]], and ran unsuccessfully for New York State Assembly as a Whig candidate in 1834.  After his marriage,  Fish returned to New York politics in 1843 and successfully was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  Fish ran for New York's Lieutenant Governor in 1846, however, he was defeated by a Democratic [[Anti-Rent War|Anti-Rent Party]] contender.  When the office was vacated in 1847, Fish successfully ran and was elected Lieutenant Governor.  In 1848 Fish ran and was elected Governor of New York having served only one term. In 1851, Fish was elected U.S. Senator for the state of New York and served only one term. Fish gained valuable experience serving on the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. During the 1850's Fish became a Republican after the Whig party dissolved. In terms of the slavery issue, Fish was a moderate; having disapproved of the [[Kansas Nebraska Act]] and the expansion of slavery.

After traveling to [[Europe]], Fish returned to America and supported [[Abraham Lincoln]] as the Republican candidate for President in 1860.  During the [[American Civil War]] Fish raised money for the Union war effort and served on Lincoln's presidential commission that made successful arrangements for Union and [[Confederacy|Confederate]] troop prisoner exchanges.  Fish returned to his law practice, after the Civil War, and was thought to have been retired from political life.  When [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected President in 1868, he appointed Fish as U.S. Secretary of State in 1869. Fish took on the State Department with vigor, reorganized the office, and established civil service reform.  During his 8 year tenure, Fish had to contend with Cuban belligerency, the settlement of the Alabama claims, Canadian border disputes, and the Virginius Incident.  Fish implemented a new concept of international arbitration, where disputes between countries were settled by negotiations, rather then military conflicts.  Fish was involved in a political [[feud]] between Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and President Grant's unsuccessful controversial attempt for the [[annexation]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. Fish launched a naval expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to open trade with Korea in 1871.  Leaving office and politics in 1877, Fish returned to private life and continued to serve on various historical associations.  Fish's male descendants would later serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for three generations.  Fish died of old age in his luxurious New York State home in 1893.

==Early life and career==
Hamilton Fish was born on August 3, 1808 at what is now known as the [[Stuyvesant<U+2013>Fish House]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, to [[Nicholas Fish]] and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a great-great-granddaughter of [[New Amsterdam]]'s [[Peter Stuyvesant]]), and his parents named him after their friend [[Alexander Hamilton]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 12-15.">Corning (1918), pp. 12-15.</ref> Nicholas Fish (1758<U+2013>1833) was a leading [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] politician and notable figure of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Fish graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] in 1827 and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the New York bar]] in 1830, practicing briefly with [[William Beach Lawrence]]. At Columbia Fish became fluent in French, a language that would later help him as U.S. Secretary of State.<ref name="Corning, pp. 17-20.">Corning (1918), pp. 17-20.</ref> He served as [[commissioner of deeds]] for the city and county of New York from 1832 through 1833, and was an unsuccessful [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for [[New York State Assembly]] in 1834.<ref name="Corning, pp. 17-20."/>

==Marriage and family==
On December 15, 1836 Hamilton Fish married Julia Kean (a descendant of a New Yorker who was a New Jersey governor, [[William Livingston]]).<ref name="Corning, pp. 20-22.">Corning (1918), pp. 20-22.</ref>  The couples lengthy marriage life was described as happy and Mrs. Fish was known for her "sagacity and judgement".<ref name="Corning, pp. 20-22."/> The couple would have three sons and five daughters, and multiple notable relatives.<ref name="Corning, pp. 20-22."/>

===U.S. Representative===
For 8 years after his defeat as a Representative in the New York State Assembly, Fish was reluctant to run for office.<ref name="Corning, pp. 23-25.">Corning (1918), pp. 23-25.</ref>  However, [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] party leaders in 1842 convinced him to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 23-25."/>  In November, Fish was elected to the House of Representatives; having defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John McKeon]] and serving in the [[28th Congress]] from [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from New York|New York's 6th District]] between 1843 and 1845.<ref name="Corning, pp. 23-25."/> The Whigs at this time were in the minority in the House, however, Fish gained valued national experience serving on the Committee of Military Affairs.<ref name="Corning, pp. 23-25."/>  After losing his bid for re-election, he returned to private practice as a lawyer.

===Lieutenant Governor===
Fish was the Whig candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] in 1846, but [[New York state election, 1846|was defeated]] by Democrat [[Addison Gardiner]] who had been endorsed by the [[Anti-Rent War|Anti-Rent Party]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 25-29.">Corning (1918), pp. 25-29</ref> Leasing farmers in New York refused to pay rent to large land tract owners and sometimes resorted to violence and intimidation.<ref name="Corning, pp. 25-29."/> Fish had opposed the use of illegal tactics not to pay rent.<ref name="Corning, pp. 25-29."/> Gardiner [[New York special judicial election, 1847|was elected]] in May 1847 a judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] and vacated the office of lieutenant governor.<ref name="Corning, pp. 25-29."/> Fish was then in [[New York state election, 1847|November 1847]] elected to fill the vacancy, and was Lieutenant Governor in 1848.<ref name="Corning, pp. 25-29."/> Lieut. Gov. Fish had a favorable reputation for being  "conciliatory" and for his "firmness" over the New York Senate.<ref>Corning (1918), pp. 30.</ref>

===Governor===
In [[New York state election, 1848|November 1848]], he was elected [[Governor of New York]], defeating [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]] and [[Reuben H. Walworth]], and served from January 1, 1849, to December 31, 1850.<ref name="Corning, pp. 30-34.">Corning (1918), pp. 30-34</ref> At 40 years of age, Fish was one of the youngest governors to be elected in New York history.<ref name="Corning, pp. 30-34."/> Gov. Fish spoke out against the extension of slavery from land acquired from the [[Mexican American War]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 30-34."/> Gov.

Fish [[vetoed]] were never overturned by the New York legislature.<ref name="Corning, pp. 30-34."/>

===U.S. Senator===
[[Image:U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Studio portrait photo of Sen. Hamilton Fish seated position showing head and shoulders with top hat and cane held in right hand. |200px|U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish]]
After Gov. Fish had retired from office he did not openly seek the nomination to be elected U.S. Senator.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48.">Corning (1918), pp. 35-48.</ref> However, Fish's supporters, in January, 1851, nominated him as a candidate for U.S. Senator. Though Fish was a popular governor a deadlock ensued over his nomination.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/><ref>Nevins (1957), p. 36</ref> There had been misgivings by certain state Senators in the New York legislature over Fish's views on slavery.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/>  Before the election Fish had declined to speak specifically on compromise legislation over slavery, but had only stated government should enforce the laws.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> Although Fish did not favor the spread of slavery he was hesitant to support the [[free soil]] movement.<ref>Nevins (1957), p. 37</ref> Finally, when two Democratic Senators who were against Fish's nomination were conspicuously absent, the Senate took action and voted.<ref>Nevins (1957), p. 42</ref> On March 19, 1851, Fish [[United States Senate election in New York, 1851|was elected]] a [[U.S. Senator from New York]], and he took his seat on December 1.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> 

In the [[United States Senate]], he was a member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] until the end of his term on March 4, 1857.<ref name="Nevins, pp. 48, 49">Nevins (1957), p. 48</ref> Fish became friends with President [[Franklin Pierce]]'s Secretary of State [[William L. Marcy]] and Attorney General [[Caleb Cushing]].<ref name="Nevins, pp. 48, 49"/> He was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for the latter part of his term and was part of a moderately anti-slavery faction.<ref>Nevins (1957), p. 53</ref> During the 1850s the Republican Party replaced the Whig Party as the central party against the Democratic Party.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> By 1856, Fish privately considered himself a Whig although he knew that the Whig Party was no longer viable politically. Fish was a quiet Senator, rather than an orator, who liked to keep to himself.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> Fish often was in disagreement with Senator Sumner, who was firmly opposed to slavery and advocated equality for blacks.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/>  His policy was to vote for legislation on the side of "justice, economy, and public virtue." <ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> He strongly opposed the [[repeal]] of the [[Missouri Compromise]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> Fish often voted with the [[Free Soil]] faction and was strongly against the [[Kansas-Nebraska Bill]].<ref>Nevins (1957), pp. 45, 52</ref> In February 1855, merchants represented by [[Moses H. Grinnell]], criticized Fish's bill on immigration and maritime commerce. Fish's bill was designed to protect Irish and German immigrants who were dying on merchant ships during oceanic passage to America.  The merchants believed that Fish's bill was oppressive to commercial interests over human interests.<ref>''New York Times'' (February 19, 1855), ''The Merchants Denouncing Hamilton Fish''.</ref>     

During his tenure, the nation and Congress were in tremendous political upheaval over slavery, that included violence, disorder, and disturbances of the peace.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/> In 1856, pro slavery advocates invaded Kansas and used violent tactics against those who were anti-slavery.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/><ref name="Nevins, p. 57">Nevins (1957), p. 57</ref> In May 1856, Senator Charles Sumner was viciously attacked by [[Preston Brooks]] in the Senate Chamber.<ref name="Nevins, p. 57"/>  At the expiration of his term, he traveled with his family to [[Europe]] and remained there until shortly before the opening of the [[American Civil War]], when he returned to begin actively campaigning for the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/>  While in France, Fish studied foreign policy with diplomats and distinguished Americans; having gained valuable experience that would eventually benefit his tenor as Secretary of State.<ref name="Corning, pp. 35-48."/>

==American Civil War==
[[image:Winfield Scott in National Portrait Gallery IMG 4528.JPG|thumb |alt=Painting of Winfield Scott. |200px |right |[[Winfield Scott]] and Hamilton Fish dined regularly in New York during the onset of the [[American Civil War]].]]
After [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been elected President in 1860, Fish spent time with Brevet Lieutenant General [[Winfield Scott]], commander of the Federal Army.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48.">Corning (1918), pp. 46-48."</ref> Fish's private secretary had aided the efforts of the ''[[Star of the West]]'', an American merchant ship sent by President [[James Buchanan]] to bring relief supplies to Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] at Fort Sumter.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  While Fish was dining with General Scott in New York a telegram was received that announced the Confederates had attacked the ''Star of the West'' in Charleston Bay.  When Fish stated that this meant war, Scott replied "Don't utter that word, my friend. You don't know what a horrid thing war is." <ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  

In 1861 and 1862 Fish joined and participated on the ''Union Defense Committee of the [[State of New York]]'', that from April 22, 1861, to April 30, 1862 co-operated with the New York City government in the raising and equipping troops, and disbursed more than $1 million for the relief of New York volunteers and their families.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  The committee included chairman [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]], [[William M. Evarts]], [[William E. Dodge]], [[A.T. Stewart]], [[John Jacob Astor]] and other New York men.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/> Fish was appointed chairman of the committee after Dix joined the Union Army.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>

In 1862 Fish was appointed by President Lincoln on a commission to serve with Bishop [[Edward Raymond Ames|Edward R. Ames]] to visit the [[Union Army]] prisoners being held in the [[Confederate States of America]] capital in [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  The Confederate government, however, refused to allow the commission to enter the city.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  Instead, Fish and Rev. Ames were able to start a system of prisoner exchange that remained virtually unchanged throughout the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>  After the War ended Fish went back to private practice as a lawyer in New York.<ref name="Corning, pp. 46-48."/>

==U.S. Secretary of State==
{{see|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}
Hamilton Fish was appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and served between March 17, 1869 and March 12, 1877. He was President Grant's longest-serving [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] officer.  Upon assuming office in 1869, Fish was initially underrated by some statesmen including former Secretaries of State [[William H. Seward]] and [[John Bigelow]]. Fish, however, immediately took on the responsibilities of his office with diligence, zeal, and intelligence.<ref>Corning (1918), pp. 52, 53</ref>

===Reformed U.S. State Department 1869===
When Fish assumed office he immediately began a series of reforms in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54">Corning (1918), pp. 53, 54</ref>  After appropriations were given to his office by Congress, Fish cataloged and organized 700 volumes of miscellaneous State Department documents.<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54"/> Fish introduced indexing of State Department files so subordinates could easily find documents.<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54"/> Fish implemented [[Civil Service]] reform by having State Department applicants be required to pass an entry examination before being appointed [[consultant]].<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54"/> This policy was sometimes hampered, since President Grant could appoint any person to office without the person having to take an examination.<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54"/>  However, the policy of testing overall improved the staff at the State Department.<ref name="Corning, pp. 53, 54"/>

===Cuban belligerency and rebellion 1869-1870===
By 1869, Cuban nationals were in open rebellion against their mother country Spain, due to the unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared to be on the verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency.  Fish, who desired settlement over the [[Alabama Claims]], did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since, [[Queen Victoria]] and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861.  Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain.<ref>Corning (1918), p. 85, 86</ref>  In February 1870, Senator [[John Sherman (Ohio)|John Sherman]] authored a Senate resolution that would have recognized Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain.  The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish, worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels.<ref>Coring (1918), pp. 87, 88</ref>  On June 13, 1870 the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by the President and Congress, after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency.  President Grant continued the policy of Cuban belligerent non recognition for the rest of his two administrations.  This policy, however, was tested in 1873 with the [[Virginius Affair]].<ref>Corning (1918), p. 89, 90</ref>

===Dominican Republic annexation treaty 1869-1870===
{{see |Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}
[[image:Charles Sumner Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb |175px |right |alt=Studio black and white portrait photo of Sen. Charles Sumner. |Senator Charles Sumner, Fish's former senatorial colleague, led opposition against the annexation of Santo Domingo.<br/> '''Brady-Handy''':'''''1860-1875''''']]
After President Grant assumed office on March 4, 1869 one of his immediate foreign policy interests was the annexation of the African Island nation of the Dominican Republic into the United States, at that time referred to as Santo Domingo.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 332, 333</ref>  President Grant believed the annexation of Santo Domingo would increase the United States mineral resources and alleviate the plight of racism against African Americans in the South.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 337</ref> Hamilton Fish, though loyal to President Grant, did not desire annexation; the divided island nation run by African leader President [[Buenaventura B<U+00E1>ez]] had been troubled with civil strife.<ref name="McFeely, p. 338, 339">McFeely (1981), p. 338, 339.</ref>  B<U+00E1>ez had imprisoned an American citizen Davis Hatch for speaking out against the B<U+00E1>ez government.<ref>Mcfeely (1981), p. 341</ref>  Fish told Grant that the Senate would not be ready to pass a Santo Domingo annexation treaty.<ref name="McFeely, p. 338, 339"/> In April, 1869 Fish gave Grant<U+2019>s private secretary Orville Babcock <U+201C>special agent<U+201D> status to search the island.<ref name="McFeely, p. 338, 339"/> In September 1869, Babcock made a preliminary treaty that would annex Santo Domingo into the United States and given the opportunity to apply for statehood.<ref name="McFeely, p. 338, 339"/> In October 1869, Fish drew up a formal treaty that included: a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt; [[Saman<U+00E1> Bay]] would be leased to the United States for $150,000 yearly payment; Santo Domingo would eventually be given statehood.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 501, 502</ref> 

In a private conference with President Grant, Fish agreed to support the Santo Domingo annexation if President Grant sent Congress a non-belligerency statement not to get involved with the Cuban rebellion in Spain.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 344</ref>  [[Charles Sumner]], chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], was against supporting the treaty believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be taken care within the continental United States.  Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 340, 341.</ref>  On January 10, 1870 Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the [[United States Senate]].<ref>Smith (2001), p. 504</ref> Fish believed Senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option.<ref>Mcfeely (1981), p. 343</ref><ref name="Smith,  p. 505.">Smith (2001), p. 505.</ref>  The Senate taking their time on deliberating, finally, rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870.  Eighteen Senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty.<ref name="Smith,  p. 505."/> Pres. Grant, angered at Sumner's refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner's friend [[John Lothrop Motley|J. Lothrop Motley]], Grant's ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish's instructions regarding the [[Alabama Claims]].  Grant believed Sumner had in January 1870 stated support for the Santo Domingo treaty.  Sumner was then disposed of his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1871 by Grant's allies in the Senate.<ref name="Corning 1918 59-84">{{cite book |last=Corning|first=Amos Elwood|title=Hamilton Fish|pages=59<U+2013>84|year=1918}}</ref>

Hamilton Fish seated in center. |The American High Commissioners met in Washington D.C. Hamilton Fish served as chairman. '''Brady''' - '''''1871''''']]
During the previous administration under President [[Andrew Johnson]], Secretary of State Seward attempted to resolve the [[Alabama Claims]] with the Johnson-Clarendon convention and treaty.  The Alabama Claims had arisen out of the [[American Civil War]], when Confederate cruiser ships built in British ports had damaged Union shipping. The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, presented to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly defeated by the Senate and the claims remained unresolved.<ref>Smith (2001), pp. 463, 464.</ref> Anti-British Anglo-phobia led by [[Charles Sumner]] was at an all time high when Fish became Secretary of State. Sumner had demanded Britain succeed Canada to the United States as payment for the Alabama Claims. In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|William E. Gladstone]]. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], and the door was open for renewed negotiations with Britain.<ref>Smith (2001), pp. 508, 509</ref>

On January 9, 1871, Fish met with British representative [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] in Washington and an agreement was made, under much [[diplomacy|negotiations]], to establish a Joint Commission to settle the Alabama claims to be held in Washington under the direction of Hamilton Fish.  At stake was the financing of America's debt with British bankers during the Civil War, and peace with Britain was required.<ref>Smith (2001), pp. 510, 511.</ref> On February 14, 1871 both distinguished High Commissioners representing Britain, led by the [[Earl of Ripon]], [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|George Robinson]], and the United States, led by Fish, met in Washington D.C. and negotiations over settlement went remarkably well. Also representing Britain was Canadian Prime Minister [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]. After 37 meetings, on March 8, 1871 the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] was signed at the State Department and became a "landmark of international conciliation".  The Senate ratified the treaty on May 24, 1871.<ref>Smith (2001), 512-514</ref> On August 25, 1872, the settlement for the Alabama claims was made by an international [[arbitration]] committee meeting in Geneva and the United States was awarded $15,500,000 in gold for damaged done by the Confederate warships.  Under the treaty settlement over disputed Atlantic fisheries and the [[San Juan Boundary Dispute|San Juan Boundary]] (concerning the [[Oregon]] boundary line) was made. The treaty was considered an "unprecedented accomplishment", having solved border disputes, reciprocal trade, and navigation issues.  A friendly perpetual relationship between [[Great Britain]] and America was established, with Britain having expressed regret over the Alabama damages.<ref>Smith (2001), 512-515</ref>

===South American d<U+00E9>tente and armistice 1871===
On April 11, 1871 a  peace conference, presided by Hamilton Fish, was held in Washington D.C. between [[Spain]] and the South American republics of [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Bolivia]], that resulted in an armistice between the countries.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/> These countries had been in a "technical" state of war since 1866, and the United States in 1871 served as mediator, directed by Hamilton Fish.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>  Representing Spain was Mauricio Lopez Roberts; Manuel Freyer represented both Peru and Bolivia; Joaquin Godoy represented [[Chile]]; and Antonio Flores represented [[Ecuador]].  President Grant gave Fish full powers to control negotiations at the [[d<U+00E9>tente]] meeting between the five countries.  The signed armistice treaty consisted of seven articles; hostilities were to cease for a minimum of three years and the countries would allow commercial trade with neutral countries.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

In 1871, Korea was known as the "Hermit Kingdom", a country determined to remain isolated from other nations, specifically from commerce and trade from Western nations, including the United States.<ref name="Nahne">Nahne (April 1968), ''"our Little War With The Heathen"''</ref> In 1866, U.S. relations with Korea were troubled when Christian missionaries were beheaded by the Korean ''tacwongun'', regent to King Kojong, and the crew of the ''General Sherman'', a U.S. trading ship, were massacred.<ref name="Nahne"/>  Secretary [[William H. Seward]], under President [[Andrew Johnson]] demanded redress for what was perceived as the outrageous actions of the Korean government.<ref name="Nahne"/> U.S. Naval warships were ordered to the Orient, however, when Seward's term ended in 1869, he was unable to organize a naval expedition.<ref name="Nahne"/>  When Fish took office he organized the Korean naval expedition and broadened the purposes.<ref name="Nahne"/>  In April, 1871 Fish ordered [[Frederick F. Low]], minister to China, to take the Asiatic Fleet and voyage to Seoul.<ref name="Nahne"/> The purpose of the expedition was to seek retribution for the assaulted sailors and to open up a commercial treaty with the King of Korea.<ref name="Nahne"/> Fish had told the fleet not to use force unless the honor of the U.S. Flag was infringed by the Koreans.<ref name="Nahne"/> 

On May 8, 1871 Low and Rear Admiral [[John Rodgers (American Civil War naval officer)|John Rodgers]], commander of the Asiatic Squadron, voyaged to Korea with five warships, eighty-five guns, and 1,230 sailors and marines.<ref name="Nahne"/> On May 16, the naval squadron reached Nagasaki Bay and a week later lowered anchor near the mouth of the Han.  The Koreans sent unofficial representatives to stall for time and hope the American Squadron would leave.<ref name="Nahne"/>  In June, the American fleet while doing nautical survey was fired upon by the Korean Forts on the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] leading to Seoul.  The American fleet fired back damaging the forts.  An apology was demanded, since the honor of the American flag had been violated.<ref name="Nahne"/>  On June 10, a U.S. military expedition was launched, after the Koreans failed to apologize for the attack; the objective to destroy the Korean forts on Kanghoa Island.  The U.S.S. Monocacy pounded the forts with 9&nbsp;inch guns while 546 sailors and 105 marines landed on the island ; captured and destroyed the Korean forts.<ref name="Nahne"/> The "Citadel" fortress, on a steep 115 foot hillside, posed the most difficulty in taking for the American troops, fighting in hand to hand combat with the Korean Tiger Hunters.  All of the Korean forts taken, were destroyed and leveled on June 11. 350 Korean Tiger Hunters were killed; versus only one officer and two American sailors.<ref name="Nahne"/> Lieut. [[Hugh W. McKee]] was the first U. S. Navy officer to die in battle in Korea.<ref name="Nahne"/>

The Asiatic Squadron remained on the Han River for three weeks, however, the Koreans would not open negotiations for a commercial treaty.<ref name="Nahne"/> As the American Squadron left, the Koreans believed that they had won a great victory over the Americans.<ref name="Nahne"/>  The attempt to open Korea up to trade was similar to how Admiral [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1854 had successfully opened up Japan to Western trade.  Korea, however, proved to be more isolated then Japan. Ten years later in 1881, Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt, without using a naval fleet, went to a more conciliatory Korean government and made a commercial treaty. The U.S. was the first Western nation to establish formal trade with Korea.<ref name="Nahne"/>

===Virginius affair 1873===
{{see|Virginius Affair}}
[[image:Arrival of Virginius Surviving Prisoners in New York.jpg|thumb |250px |right |alt=Black and white sketch of people celebrating Virginius prisoner release. |Celebration demonstrations in New York over the release of ''Virginius'' prisoners. Secretary Fish negotiated the release of the ''Virginius'' prisoners from Spanish authorities.<br>'''Morgan'''-'''''January 1874''''']] 
During the 1870s [[Cuba]] was in a state of rebellion against Spain.  In the United States, Americans were divided on whether to militarily aid the rebel Cubans.  Many [[jingoists]] believed the United States needed to fight for the Cuban rebels and pressured the Grant Administration to take action.<ref name="Schwartz">Schwartz (October 1998), ''1873 One Hundred And Twenty-five Years Ago''</ref>  A privately owned ship, the Virginius, was used to run guns, ammunition, and vital supplies to the Cuban rebels. The  captain of the Virginius was Joseph Fry, former officer of the Confederate and Federal Navies. On October 31, 1873 the Virginius was run down in neutral waters by the Spanish warship, the Tornado, off of [[Morant Bay, Jamaica|Morant Bay]], [[Jamaica]].<ref name="Schwartz"/>  After being hit, the Virginius took on water and was forced to surrender to the Spanish authorities. The 103 crew members consisted of Cuban rebel recruits and 52 American and British citizens.<ref name="Schwartz"/>  The Spanish hauled down and trampled the American flag, and brought the prisoners to Santiago. A total of 53 Viginius crew members were executed by the Spanish authorities.<ref name="Schwartz"/>  The Spanish finally stopped the carnage as a British warship  appeared with guns ready to fire on Santiago.  The American Navy, at this time, although  formidable world wide, was in decline after the American Civil War.<ref name="Schwartz"/>

When news reached the United States of the executions, President Grant and Secretary Fish were forced to make an immediate response.<ref name="Schwartz"/>  Many Americans demanded a full scale war with Spain.<ref name="Schwartz"/> Fish found out that the registration was falsified under American ownership, however, the executions of Americans demanded action.<ref name="Schwartz"/>  Fish, coolly handled the situation, called upon Spanish minister, Admiral Jos<U+00E9> Polo de Bernab<U+00E9> in Washington D.C. and held a conference.<ref name="Schwartz"/>  A settlement was made where Spain relinquished the severely damaged Virginius to the U.S. Navy, while survivors were released that included 13 Americans.<ref name="Schwartz"/> The Spanish Captain who ordered the executions was censured, and Spain paid $80,000 reparations to American families whose family members were executed in Santiago.<ref name="Schwartz"/> The national honor of both Spain and the United States was preserved and it  was chiefly due to the restraint and moderation of Fish and Bernab<U+00E9> that a satisfactory settlement of the [[Virginius Affair]] was reached by the [[United States]] and [[Spain]].<ref name="Schwartz"/>

===Hawaiian reciprocal trade treaty 1875===
Fish also negotiated the [[David Kalakaua#Reign as King|reciprocity treaty of 1875]] with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].  Hawaiian sugar was made duty free; while the importation of manufactured goods and clothing was allowed into the island kingdom.<ref>[[#Doenecke|Doenecke]] (1981), p. 177</ref>  By opening Hawaii to free trade the process for eventual statehood into the United States had begun.

===Liberian-Grebo civil war 1876===
The U.S. settled the Liberian-[[Grebo people|Grebo]] civil war in 1876 when Hamilton Fish dispatched the [[USS Alaska (1868)|USS ''Alaska'']], under President Grant's authority, to [[Liberia]]. Liberia was in practice an American colony. U.S. envoy James Milton Turner, the first African American ambassador, requested a warship to protect American property in Liberia.  Turner, bolstered by U.S. naval presence in harbor and support of the USS ''Alaska'' captain, negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia.<ref name="Kremer">Kremer 1991, pp. 82<U+2013>87.</ref>

===Republican convention 1876===
As the 1876 Republican convention approached during the U.S. Presidential Election, President Grant, unknown to Fish, had written a letter to Republican leaders to nominate Fish for the Presidential ticket. The letter was never read at the convention and Fish was never nominated. President Grant believed that Fish was a good compromise choice between the rival factions of [[James G. Blaine]] and [[Roscoe Conkling]]. Cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] drew a caricature of Fish and [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as the Republican Party ticket.  Fish, who was ready to retire to private life, did not desire to run for President and was content at returning to private life.  Fish found out later President Grant had written the letter to the convention.<ref>[[#Corning|Corning]] (1918), p. 104</ref>

==Later life, death==
[[Image:Honorable Hamilton Fish Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Studio black and white portrait of Hamilton Fish in his elder years. |Hamilton Fish in his elder years.]]

After leaving the Grant Cabinet in 1877 and briefly serving under President Hayes, Fish returned to private life, practicing law and managing his real estate in New York City.  Fish was revered in the New York community and enjoyed spending time with his family.  Fish resided in Glen Clyffe, his estate near [[Garrison, New York]], in [[Putnam County, New York]], in the [[Hudson River Valley]]. His health remained good until around 1884, having suffered from [[neuralgia]].  On September 6, 1893 Fish had retired from the evening having played cards with his daughter.  The following morning on September 7, Fish, at the age of 84, suddenly died.  His death was attributed to old age.<ref>[[#Corning|Corning]] (1918), pp. 105, 106.</ref> Fish was buried in Garrison at St. Philip's Church-in-the-Highlands Cemetery.

[[Charles Francis Adams, Jr.|Charles Francis Adams]] describe Fish as "a quiet and easy-going man; but, when aroused, by being, as he thought, 'put upon', he became very formidable. Neither was it possible to placate him."  Fish's 20th Century biographer, A. Elwood Corning, stated that Fish was free from "petty jealousies and prejudices which so often drag the reputation of statesmen down to the level of politicians" and that Fish "used the language and practiced the manners of a gentleman."  As an invaluable member of the Grant Administration, Fish commanded "men's confidence, and respect by his firmness, candor, and justice.<ref>Corning (1918), pp. 106-108</ref>{{clear}}

==Notable descendants==
{{See|Fish family}}
Three of Fish's direct descendants, all named Hamilton, served in the U.S. House of Representatives for the state of [[New York]].  [[Hamilton Fish II]], Fish's son, served one term as U.S. Representative  from 1909 to 1911.<ref>Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, ''Fish, Hamilton, (1849 - 1936)''</ref> Fish II also served as assistant to Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. [[Hamilton Fish III]], Fish's grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1920 to 1945. <ref>Biographical Directory of the United States Congress ,''Fish, Hamilton, (1888 - 1991)''</ref>[[Hamilton Fish IV]], Fish's great-grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1969 to 1995.<ref>Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, ''Fish, Hamilton, Jr., (1926 - 1996)''</ref> Another son [[Stuyvesant Fish]] was an important railroad executive.<ref>Stover, "The management of the Illinois Central Railroad in the 20th century.", PDF file</ref>  Another son, [[Nicholas Fish II]], was a U.S. diplomat, who was appointed second secretary of legation at [[Berlin]] in 1871, became secretary in 1874, and was charg<U+00E9> d'affaires at [[Berne, Switzerland|Berne]] in 1877<U+2013>1881, and minister to [[Belgium]] in 1882<U+2013>1886, after which he engaged in banking in New York City.<ref>Political Graveyard (July 19, 2011), ''Fischetti to Fishelson''</ref> [[Hamilton Fish II (Rough Rider)|Hamilton Fish]], Fish's grandson by Nicholas, was an 1895 graduate of [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], saw service in The [[Spanish-American War]] as one of the storied [[Rough Riders]]. He was the first member of that regiment to be killed in action, at the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]], [[Cuba]].<ref>Benz (June 26, 1998), ''The Bull Pulpit''</ref>
