'''''I'm Breathless: Music from and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy''''' is the second [[soundtrack album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. It was released on May 22, 1990, by [[Sire Records]] to promote and accompany the film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. In the film Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney and her then-boyfriend [[Warren Beatty]] played the [[Dick Tracy|title role]]. After filming was complete, Madonna began work on the film's soundrack, with songwriter [[Stephen Sondheim]], producer [[Patrick Leonard]] and engineer [[Bill Bottrell]]. She also worked with producer [[Shep Pettibone]] on the album's first single, "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]". The album was recorded in three weeks, at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios, in California.

Musically, ''I'm Breathless'' consists predominantly of [[jazz]], [[Swing music|swing]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs. The tracks reflected Madonna's [[showgirl]] personality and was influenced by her relationship with Beatty. The singer wanted to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|Untouchables law enforcement]] and sang the songs accordingly. In some areas she pitched her vocals and belting the notes when necessary. She even smoked cigarettes in order to portray the vocals of her character Breathless. Beatty and singer [[Mandy Patinkin]] was featured as duet partners on three of the songs.

In support of both ''I'm Breathless'' and her previous album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', Madonna embarked on the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] where a section was dedicated to the songs from the album. It was critically acclaimed, winning an award at the 1990 [[Pollstar|Pollstar Concert Industry Awards]]. However, due to its usage of [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] imagery, [[Pope John Paul II]] called for a boycott of the show. After the tour was over, Madonna performed songs from the album at the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[63rd Academy Awards|1991 Academy Awards]]. "Vogue", the first single from ''I'm Breathless'', became one of Madonna's most successful releases, reaching at number one in over 30 countries. It was also critically acclaimed, and was seen an influential song. The video was also successful, helping bring [[Vogue (dance)|vogueing]] into mainstream popularity. The second and final single, "[[Hanky Panky (Madonna song)|Hanky Panky]]", went on to reach the top-ten in United States and the United Kingdom.

The soundtrack received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who applauded the Sondheim numbers, along with Madonna's vocals. However, some deemed the non-film songs to be of little value. "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later]]", one of the Sondheim tracks, went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the 1991 show. ''I'm Breathless'' was commercially successful, peaking at number one on the [[European Top 100 Albums]], as well as the national charts of Australia, Denmark, and Japan<U+2014>in the later it became the country's best-selling foreign album of the year. It also reached number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''I'm Breathless'' has sold more than seven million copies worldwide.

Beatty had realized several positive aspects of hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for ''Dick Tracy'' and the film studio would see this as a promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], author of ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]'', by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gain double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film. After the shooting for ''Dick Tracy'' was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by [[Stephen Sondheim]] for the film<U+2014>"[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later]]", "More" and "What Can You Loose"<U+2014>which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous.<ref name=pp181>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|pp=187<U+2013>88}}</ref> In her favor, she produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. "I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel", she said at the time.<ref name=pp182/>

Madonna was in a relationship with Beatty at that time, and her whole acting, recording and singing stemmed from impressing him with the album, which was important to her.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=191}}</ref> Beatty and singer [[Mandy Patinkin]] also lent their voices for songs from the album.<ref name=nymag/> While ''I'm Breathless'' was being completed, it still needed a [[lead single]]. At the same time, Madonna and producer [[Shep Pettibone]] decided to compose a new song called "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" to be placed on the B-side of "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", the final single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'' (1989), to ensure that the song would fare better on the charts. When Warner executives heard the song, they decided to release it as an A-side, and was eventually included on ''I'm Breathless''.<ref name=pp182>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=189}}</ref>

==Recording and composition==
[[File:Stephen Sondheim - smoking.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote three of the songs on ''I'm Breathless'']]
''I'm Breathless'' is a [[jazz music|jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[pop music|pop]] album where Madonna and Sondheim tried to recreated the music of the period portrayed in ''Dick Tracy''. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', the harmonic and melodic styles were more "complex" than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to, hence she found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the "wilderness" of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected.<ref name="rik1"/> Madonna also recruited producer [[Patrick Leonard]] and engineer [[Bill Bottrell]] to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|Untouchables law enforcement]].<ref name=pp181/> Bob Magnusson, who played bass on the records, recalled that Madonna's relationship with Beatty reflected her mood in the studio. "She was nice to everybody, she introduced herself to the musicians", he added. According to [[Lucy O'Brien]], author of ''[[Madonna: Like an Icon]]'', after Madonna's split from husband [[Sean Penn]] in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship, which influenced the songs and the portrayal of her persona. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians, to give a swing nature.<ref name="lucy1">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=207}}</ref> The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in [[Los Angeles, California]], and concluded by three weeks.<ref name="rik1">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=70}}</ref> The songs on the album reflect Madonna's [[showgirl]] personality where her singing ranged from "rootsy, rocking" in nature to slow, "laid-back and soulful" vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O'Brien compared to "an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique". Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Madonna started smoking cigarettes in order to achieve that. [[Guy Pratt]], who also played bass, said that the singer "was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette off me. Her character smoked, so therefore she did."<ref name="lucy2"/>

I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'.

O'Brien said that the songs on ''I'm Breathless'' had a "coquettish" and "pandering nature", and was the polar opposite to Madonna's previous release, ''Like a Prayer'', which had an introspective composition.<ref name="lucy2">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=208}}</ref> It opens with the sound of an intercom and a shuffle, and [[power ballad]] "He's a Man" starts, a song which Madonna sings as if she was a "hooker stalking the boulevard". Also, Madonna's "haunting" vocals continue after the music has [[fade (audio engineering)|faded]].<ref name="rollingstone"/> Madonna's voice sounds "light" among the arrangement of organs, strings, piano, sax and backing vocals. As she sings the chorus "You're a man with a gun in your hand", her voice deepens and a key change is evident.<ref name="rik2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=71}}</ref> One of the Sondheim songs, "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later]]", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously.<ref name="rik3">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=72}}</ref> "[[Hanky Panky (Madonna song)|Hanky Panky]]", the third song and second single, deals with [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a "[[spanking|good spanking]]". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, "You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me".<ref name=pp182/><ref name="rik3"/> The track starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. The singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at [[Disney]], the producers of ''Dick Tracy''.<ref name="rik3"/>

The following track on the album "I'm Going Bananas" is a [[Carmen Miranda]]-ish song done in a Spanish accent.<ref name=nymag/> A [[Salsa music|salsa]] rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass.<ref name="rik4">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=73}}</ref> In the fifth track, "Crybaby", Madonna mimics the vocals of [[Betty Boop]].<ref name=pp182/> The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about a guy who is "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a [[Chromaticism|chromatic chord]] sequence. The song ends abruptly with a long fade following it.<ref name="rik4"/> The next track "Something to Remember" deals with her failed marriage to Penn and was the source of inspiration for naming her [[Something to Remember|1995 compilation album]]. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.<ref name=pp182/> Instrumentation featured in the track include restrained sounds of piano, strings and percussion. The chord progression has "unexpected" changes but still sounds like a sentimental tune. Lyrically it talks about a love affair which did not come to fruition, but had its good memories. Towards the ending, drums kick in and the [[coda (music)|coda]] starts with piano.<ref name=nymag>{{cite journal|last=Wurtzel|first=Elizabeth|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=May 14, 1990|accessdate=March 3, 2014|title=...On Madonna's Dick Track-inspired album, she sings, 'I just like things a little rough, and you better not disagree'...|issn=0028-7369|ref=harv|publisher=New York Media, LLC}}</ref><ref name="rik4"/>

Mark Coleman from ''Rolling Stone'' described "Back in Business" as a "nagging headache". It contains a "slow-verse-fast-chorus" sequence.<ref name="rollingstone"/> According to Rooksby, "the chorus bursts into life, with Madonna clearly relishing the lyrics about good guys finishing last... the coldness of her delivery is apt for the topic."

Madonna sings a two-part duet with Beatty titled "Now I'm Following You".

At the last chord, the sound of the record getting stuck is heard, and a needle is drawn across the vinyl, leading into the much faster part two.<ref name="rik5"/> It begins with 1980s style drums and bass with bits of the opening song "He's a Man" interspersed. In the middle, Beatty's vocals are slowed and mixed up with Madonna uttering the line, "Dick&nbsp;<U+2013> that's an interesting name".

''I'm Breathless'', alongside Madonna's previous album, ''Like a Prayer'', was promoted in Madonna's third concert tour, the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]], which visited Asia, North America and Europe. Consisting of 57 dates, the concert was divided into five sections, the first inspired by the 1927 [[German expressionism|German expressionist film]] ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'', the second by [[religion|religious themes]], the third by ''Dick Tracy'' and [[cabaret]], the fourth by [[Art Deco]], and the fifth was an encore. The show contained sexual themes and Catholic imagery, such as in Madonna's performance of "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", which was based in church-like surroundings with Madonna wearing a [[crucifix]] and her backup dancers dressed like [[priest]]s and [[nun]]s. The concert was criticized for its sexual content and religious imagery; in Toronto, Canada, Madonna was threatened of being arrested for obscenity,<ref>{{cite news|first=Neil |last=Smith|date=May 24, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3704915.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Show Stealer Madonna on Tour |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}</ref> and [[Pope John Paul II]] later called for a boycott, with one of the three Italian dates being cancelled. Despite this, the tour was a critical success, winning "Most Creative Stage Production" at the 1990 [[Pollstar]] Concert Industry Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/PCIA-Static/awards1990.htm|title=Pollstar Awards Archive&nbsp;<U+2013> 1990|accessdate=July 16, 2012|publisher=[[Pollstar]]}}</ref>

The performance of the ''I'm Breathless'' songs began with "Sooner or Later" sung atop a grand piano, followed by "Hanky Panky", where Madonna stood in front of a microphone and sang it. She was dressed in a striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer. Near the end Madonna joked: "You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?" The final song of the segment was "Now I'm Following You" where Madonna danced and lip-synched with dancer Salim Gauwloos, who was dressed like Dick Tracy.<ref name="tara186">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2007|p=186}}</ref> Regarding the "shameless promotion" of ''Dick Tracy'' in this segment, O'Brien said that "along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the ''Dick Tracy'' section is the least dynamic part of the show".<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=225}}</ref>

After the tour concluded, Madonna performed "Vogue" at the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards]], where she and her dancers were clad in 18th century-inspired fashions, inspired by [[Marie Antoinette]]. Madonna re-created an 18th-century French court, with sexual innuendo in the performance. At one point the singer flipped open her large skirt, allowing one of her dancers to crawl inside and come out through the other side.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=50}}</ref> Her dancer Carlton Wilborn explained that "[such] level of production had never been done on MTV. The costumes, the fans, the drama... MTV just had no idea, we just came out and rocked."
