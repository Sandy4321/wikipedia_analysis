'''Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana''' ([[help:IPA|pronounced]] {{Audio-IPA|Cs-Bedrich Smetana.ogg|[<U+02C8>b<U+025B>dr<U+031D><U+026A>x <U+02C8>sm<U+025B>tana]}}; 2 March 1824 <U+2013> 12 May 1884)
was a [[Czechs|Czech]] composer who pioneered the development of a musical style which became closely identified with his country's aspirations to independent statehood. He is thus widely regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. Internationally he is best known for his opera ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', and for the symphonic cycle ''[[M<U+00E1> vlast]]'' ("My Fatherland") which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native land.

Smetana was naturally gifted as a pianist, and gave his first public performance at the age of six. After his conventional schooling he studied music under [[Josef Proksch]] in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in [[G<U+00F6>teborg]], and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy. 

In the early 1860s a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'' and ''The Bartered Bride'', were  premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and may have hastened the  health breakdown which precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874. 

By the end of 1874 Smetana had become completely deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum, and his subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k|Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]] as a more significant Czech composer. 
==Family background and childhood==

Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana was born on 2 March 1824, in [[Litomy<U+0161>l]], east of [[Prague]] near the old border between [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], then provinces of the [[Habsburg Empire]]. He was the third child, and first son, of Franti<U+0161>ek Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynkov<U+00E1>. Franti<U+0161>ek had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood.<ref name= Clap9>Clapham (1972), pp. 9<U+2013>11</ref><ref>Large, p. 395</ref> At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. Franti<U+0161>ek knew Czech, but for business and social reasons rarely used it, and his children were ignorant of it until much later in their lives.<ref>Large, p. 3</ref>

The Smetana family came from the [[Hradec Kr<U+00E1>lov<U+00E9>]] region of Bohemia. Franti<U+0161>ek had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomy<U+0161>l in 1823 as brewer to [[Waldstein family|Count Waldstein]], whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.<ref name= Clap9/><ref name= Steen694>Steen, p. 694</ref>

The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and was a competent violinist who played in a string quartet.<ref name= Ottlov1>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

At a concert held in Litomy<U+0161>l's Philosphical Academy he played a piano arrangement of [[Daniel-Fran<U+00E7>ois-Esprit Auber|Auber]]'s overture to ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'', to a rapturous reception.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 12</ref><ref>Newmarch, p. 54</ref> In 1831 the family moved to [[Jind<U+0159>ich<U+016F>v Hradec]] in the south of Bohemia <U+2013> the region where, a generation later, [[Gustav Mahler]] grew up.<ref name=  Steen694/><ref name= Large5/> Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludvig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and  began composing simple pieces of which one, a dance (''Kvapi<U+010D>ek'', or "Little Galop"), survives in sketch form.<ref name= Clap13>Clapham (1972), pp. 13-14</ref><ref name= Large5>Large, p. 5</ref>

In 1835 Franti<U+0161>ek retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.<ref name= Clap13/> There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to the gymnasium at [[Jihlava]], where he was homesick and unable to study.  He then transferred to the [[Premonstratensian]] school at [[N<U+011B>meck<U+00FD> Brod]], where he was happier and made good progress.<ref name= Clap13/> Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet [[Karel Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek Borovsk<U+00FD>|Karel Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek]],<ref>Large, pp. 6<U+2013>7. Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek was also known as Karel Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek Borovsk<U+00FD>.</ref> whose departure for Prague in 1838 may have influenced Smetana's own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with Franti<U+0161>ek's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under [[Josef Jungmann]], a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the [[Czech National Revival|movement for Czech national revival]].<ref name= Large7>Large, pp. 7<U+2013>10</ref>

==Apprentice musician==
===First steps===
Smetana arrived in Prague in the autumn of 1839. Finding Jungmann's school uncongenial (he was mocked by his classmates for his country manners),<ref name= Large7/> Smetana soon began missing classes. He attended concerts, visited the opera, listened to military bands and joined an amateur string quartet for whom he composed simple pieces.<ref name= Large7/> After Liszt gave a series of piano recitals in the city, Smetana became convinced that he would find satisfaction only in a musical career.<ref name= Large7/> He confided to his journal that he wanted "to become a Mozart in composition and a Liszt in technique".<ref>Schonberg, p. 77</ref><ref name= Rosa56>Newmarch, p. 56</ref>  However, the Prague idyll ended when Franti<U+0161>ek discovered his son's truancy, and removed him from the city.<ref name= Large7/> Franti<U+0161>ek at this time saw music as a diverting pastime, not as a career choice.<ref>Large, p. 3</ref> Smetana was placed temporarily with  his uncle in [[Nov<U+00E9> M<U+011B>sto na Morav<U+011B>|Nov<U+00E9> M<U+011B>sto]], where he enjoyed a brief romance with his cousin Louisa. He commemorated their passion in ''Louia's Polka'', Smetana's earliest complete composition that has survived.<ref>Large, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>

An older cousin, Josef Smetana, a teacher at the Premonstratensian School in [[Plze<U+0148>]] (Pilsen), then offered to supervise the boy's remaining schooling, and in the summer of 1840 Smetana departed for Plze<U+0148>.<ref name= Ottlov1/> He remained there until he completed his schooling in 1843.  His skills as a pianist were in great demand at the town's many soir<U+00E9>es, and he enjoyed a hectic social life.<ref name= Rosa56/> This included a number of romances, the most important of which was with Kate<U+0159>ina Kol<U+00E1><U+0159>ov<U+00E1>, whom he had known briefly in his early childhood. Smetana was entirely captivated with her, writing in his journal: "When I am not with her I am sitting on hot coals and have no peace".<ref>Large, p. 17</ref> He composed several pieces for her, among which are two ''Quadrilles'', a song duet, and an incomplete piano study for the left hand.<ref name= Large19>Large, p. 19</ref> He also composed his first orchestral piece, a B flat minuet.<ref name= Clap15>Clapham (1972), pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref>

===Student and teacher===
[[Image:Berlioz ill05.jpg|thumb|upright|Hector Berlioz, an early musical infuence on Smetana]]
By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although  Franti<U+0161>ek now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support.<ref name= Rosa56/><ref name= Large19/> In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 57</ref><ref>It is difficult to equate the value of a mid-19th century Austro-Hungarian gulden to 21st century dollars or sterling. A general assessment might be made on the basis of Smetana's annual salary in 1866, when he was appointed conductor of the Czech Provisional Theatre <U+2013> 1,200 gulden. Clapham (1972), p. 34</ref> and no immediate prospects.<ref name= Clap17>Clapham (1972), p. 17</ref>  Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kate<U+0159>ina Kol<U+00E1><U+0159>ov<U+00E1>'s mother to [[Josef Proksch]], head of the Prague Music Institute <U+2013> where Kate<U+0159>ina was now studying.<ref name= Ottlov1/><ref name= Large19/> Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and the Leipzig circle of Liszt.<ref name= Ottlov1/> In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.<ref name= Ottlov1/>

For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, [[Bagatelle (music)|bagatelles]], [[Impromptu|impromptus]] and the G minor Piano Sonata.<ref>Large, pp. 29<U+2013>35</ref> In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French master at a reception arranged by Proksch.<ref name= Clap19>Clapham (1972), p. 19</ref> At the home of Count Thun he met [[Robert Schumann|Robert]] and [[Clara Schumann]], and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work <U+2013> they detected too much of Berlioz in it.<ref name= Ottlov1/>  Meanwhile his friendship with Kate<U+0159>ina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement.  He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.<ref>Large, p. 39</ref>

==Early career==
===Revolutionary===

Smetana's concert tour was poorly supported, so he abandoned the project and returned to Prague, where he made a living from private pupils and  occasional appearances as an accompanist in chamber concerts.<ref name= Clap19/> He also began work on his first major orchestral work, the Overture in D major.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 21</ref>
[[Image:Praha Barricades Charles Bridge panel 1848.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of the barricades on the Charles Bridge,  Prague, 1848. Smetana was briefly a participant in the uprising.]]
For a brief period in 1848 Smetana was a revolutionary.  In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|climate of political change and upheaval]] that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy.<ref name= Large42/> A Citizens' Army ("Svornost") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two [[March (music)|marches]] dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and the ''The Song of Freedom'' to words by [[Jan Koll<U+00E1>r]].<ref name= Steen696>Steen, p. 696</ref>  In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr<U+00E4>tz|the Prince of Windisch-Gr<U+00E4>tz]]. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the [[Charles Bridge]].<ref name= Large42>Large, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek.<ref name= Large42/> During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, [[Karel Sabina]], who would later provide [[libretto|libretti]] for Smetana's first two operas.<ref name= Large42/>

===Piano Institute===
Early in 1848 Smetana wrote to Franz Liszt, whom he had not yet met, asking him to accept the dedication of a new piano work, ''Six Characteristic Pieces'', and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400&nbsp;gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance.<ref>Steen, pp. 695<U+2013>96</ref><ref name= Ottlov2>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 2) </ref> This encouragement was the beginning of a friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 20</ref> Despite Liszt's lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students.<ref>Large, p. 48</ref> After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism in whose eyes Smetana was developing a reputation.  Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he  "could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language."<ref name =Large48>Large, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kate<U+0159>ina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matin<U+00E9>e concerts.<ref name= Large48/> Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married Kate<U+0159>ina, on 27 August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.<ref name= Ottlov2/>

===Budding composer===
In 1850, notwithstanding his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana accepted the post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in [[Prague Castle]].<ref name= Large48/><ref>Steen, p. 696</ref> He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part ''Wedding Scenes'', some of the music of which was later used in ''The Bartered Bride''.<ref name= Large51>Large, pp. 51<U+2013>54</ref> He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name ''Album Leaves'', and a series of [[polka|polkas]].<ref name= Large51/>  During 1853<U+2013>54 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the ''Triumphal Symphony'', composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef]].<ref name= Ottlov2/> The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly on the grounds that the brief musical references to the [[Deutschlandlied#Melody|Austrian national anthem]] were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26 February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.<ref>Large, pp. 57<U+2013>62</ref>

===Private sorrows and professional disenchantment===
[[Image:Smetana1854portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|An oil portrait of Smetana, 1854]]
In the years between 1854 and 1856 Smetana suffered a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of [[tuberculosis]]. A year later his eldest daughter Bed<U+0159>i<U+0161>ka, who at the age of four was showing signs of musical precocity, died of [[scarlet fever]].<ref name= Clap22>Clapham (1972), p. 22</ref> Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3 December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received "harshly" by the critics, although Liszt praised it.<ref name= Ottlov1/><ref>Large, pp. 63<U+2013>65</ref> Smetana's sorrows continued; just after Bed<U+0159>i<U+0161>ka's death a fourth daughter, Kate<U+0159>ina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana's wife Kate<U+0159>ina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.<ref name= Clap22/> 

In July 1856 Smetana received news of the death in exile of his revolutionary friend Karel Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek.<ref name= Large67>Large, pp. 67<U+2013>69</ref> The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Josef's accession in 1848 had faded as Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under [[Baron Alexander von Bach]].<ref name= Large67/>  Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana's status as a concert pianist was generally considered to be below that of contemporaries such as  [[Alexander Dreyschock]].<ref name= Large67/> Critics acknowledged Smetana's "delicate, crystalline touch", closer in style to Chopin than Liszt, but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions.<ref name= Large51/> His main performance success during this period was his playing of Mozart's [[Piano concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|D minor Piano Concerto]] at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart's birth, in January 1856.<ref name= Large67/> His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps infuenced by Dreyschock's accounts of opportunities to be found in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11 October 1856, after writing to his parents that "Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, so I left it", he departed for [[G<U+00F6>teborg]].<ref name= Ottlov3>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 3)</ref>

==Years of travel==
===G<U+00F6>teborg===
Smetana initially went to G<U+00F6>teborg without Kate<U+0159>ina. Writing to Liszt, he said that the people there were  musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity "for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague."<ref name= Ottlov3/> Within a few weeks of his arrival he had given his first recital, opened a music school which was rapidly overwhelmed by applications,<ref name= Large71>Large, pp. 71<U+2013>75</ref> and become conductor of the G<U+00F6>teborg Society for Classical Choral Music.<ref name= Large71/> In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled ''Frithjof'' and ''The Viking's Voyage'', were sketched but abandoned.<ref>Large. p. 78</ref> 
[[Image:G<U+00F6>teborg.jpg|thumb|left|G<U+00F6>teborg, Sweden, Smetana's base between 1856 and 1862]]
In summer 1857 Smetana came home to Prague and found Kate<U+0159>ina in failing health.  In June, Smetana's father Franti<U+0161>ek died.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 25</ref>   That autumn Smetana returned to G<U+00F6>teborg,  with Kate<U+0159>ina and their surviving daughter <U+017D>ofie,  but before doing so he visited Liszt in [[Weimar]]. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's ''[[Faust Symphony]]'' and the symphonic poem ''Die Ideale'', which invigorated and inspired him.<ref>Large, p. 79</ref> Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of G<U+00F6>teborg.<ref name= Ottlov3/>

Back in Sweden, Smetana found among his new pupils  a young housewife, Fr<U+00F6>jda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana transcribed two songs from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] ''Die sch<U+00F6>ne M<U+00FC>llerin'' cycle, and transformed one of his own early piano pieces into a polka entitled ''Vision at the Ball''.<ref>Large, pp. 80<U+2013>82</ref> He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem ''Richard III'', his first major orchestral composition since the ''Triumphal Symphony''. He followed  this with  ''Wallenstein's Camp'', inspired by [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s  [[Wallenstein (play)| ''Wallenstein'' drama trilogy]],<ref>Newmarch, p. 60</ref> and began a third symphonic poem ''Haakon Jarl'', based on the tragic drama by Danish poet Adam Gottlieb Ohlenschlager.<ref name= Clap28/> Smetana also wrote a two large-scale piano works: ''Macbeth and the Witches'', and an <U+00C9>tude in C in the style of Liszt.<ref name= Large84>Large, pp. 84<U+2013>94</ref>

===Bereavement, remarriage and return to Prague===
Kate<U+0159>ina's health gradually worsened and in the spring of 1859 failed completely.  Homeward bound, she died at [[Dresden]] on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died "gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her."<ref>Large, pp. 95<U+2013>97</ref> After placing <U+017D>ofie with Kate<U+0159>ina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera ''[[Der Barbier von Bagdad]]'', by Liszt's pupil [[Peter Cornelius]].<ref>According to [[Gerald Abraham]], Smetana had met Cornelius at Weimar two years previously, while the latter was working on ''Der Barbier''. Reportedly the two composers discussed the need for "a modern type of comic opera as a complement to Wagner." Abraham, p. 29</ref> This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer.<ref>Large, pp. 98<U+2013>99 and p. 160</ref> Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiov<U+00E1>, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to G<U+00F6>teborg for the 1859<U+2013>60 winter.<ref name= Ottlov3/>  The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in [[Stockholm]], attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zde<U+0148>ka, was born in September 1861.<ref name= Clap28>Clapham (1972), pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref>

Meanwhile, the defeat of Franz Josef's army at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach.<ref>Large, p. 114</ref>  This had gradually brought a  more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana  was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture.<ref name= Clap28/><ref name= Schonberg77>Schonberg, p. 77</ref> Before deciding his own future, in September  Smetana set out on a concert tour of Holland and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure.<ref name= Clap28/> Back in Prague, he conducted performances of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' in the <U+017D>of<U+00ED>n Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the "New German" school represented primarily by Liszt;<ref>Clapham (1980) p. 393</ref> Smetana responded that "a prophet is without honour in his own land."<ref name= Clap28/> In March 1862 he  made a last brief visit to G<U+00F6>teborg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague:  "My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself."<ref>Large, p. 120</ref>

==National prominence==
===Seeking recognition===
In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera.<ref>The official title for this theatre was the "Royal Provincial Czech Theatre" ({{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 4)</ref> Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s operas.<ref name= Schonberg77/> He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Ma<U+00FD>r, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a "dangerous modernist", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner.<ref name= Clap32>Clapham (1972), pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref><ref>Large, p. 126</ref> Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600&nbsp;gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture.<ref name= Clap32/>  With no useful model on which to base his work<U+2014>Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed<U+2014>Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist,<ref name= Large140>Large, pp. 140<U+2013>43</ref> and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by [[Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto of Brandenburg]]. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia''.<ref name= Ottlov4/><ref name= Large140/>

At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German,<ref>Grout, p. 532</ref> and he had difficulty expressing himself in his native tongue.<ref name= Ottlov4>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 4)</ref> To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech as his daily norm.  He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; ''The Three Riders'' and ''The Renegade'' were performed at concerts in early 1863.<ref name= Large121>Large, pp. 121<U+2013>25</ref> In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Um<U+011B>leck<U+00E1> Beseda, a society for Czech artists.<ref name= Ottlov4/>  By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper ''N<U+00E1>rodn<U+00ED> listy''.<ref>Newmarch, p. 62</ref> Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Bo<U+017E>ena.<ref> Clapham (1972), p. 33</ref>

On 23 April 1864 Smetana conducted Berlioz's [[choral symphony]] ''[[Rom<U+00E9>o et Juliette (symphony)|Rom<U+00E9>o et Juliette]]'' at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own ''March for the Shakespearean Festival''.<ref name= Clap32/><ref name= Ottlov4/>  That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the [[Prague Conservatory]] failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: "My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me," he wrote to a Swedish friend.<ref>Large, p. 134</ref> His hopes were again dashed by his affiliation with the perceived radical Liszt, the appointing committee choosing the  conservative patriot Josef Krej<U+010D><U+00ED> for the post.<ref>Clapham (1980), p. 394</ref>

Almost three years passed before Smetana was declared the winner of Harrach's opera competition.<ref name= Clap32/> Before then, on 5 January 1866, ''The Brandenburgers'' had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre<U+2014>over strong opposition from Ma<U+00FD>r, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Ma<U+00FD>r's liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer's own direction.<ref name= Clap32/> "I was called on stage nine times," Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise.<ref name= Large145>Large, p. 145</ref> Music historian [[Rosa Newmarch]] believes that, although ''The Brandenburgers'' has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana's operatic art.<ref>Newmarch, p. 64</ref>

===Opera maestro===

In July 1863 Sabina had delivered the libretto for a second opera, a light comedy entitled ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', which Smetana composed during the next three years.  Because of the success of ''The Brandenburgers'', the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30 May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue.<ref name= Ottlov4/> The opera was to go through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation.<ref name= Large167>Large, pp. 167<U+2013>68</ref><ref>Large, p. 399<U+2013>408</ref>  The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, on the eve of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by [[Prussian]] troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs.<ref name= Large165>Large, pp. 165<U+2013>67</ref>  When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.<ref>Newmarch, p. 69</ref>

Back in 1866, as the composer of ''The Brandenburgers'' with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana thought he might be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased.<ref name= Large165/> He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition <U+2013> appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200&nbsp;gulden.<ref name= Clap34/> In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season  presented standard works by [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], Mozart, [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and Glinka, with a revival of his own ''Bartered Bride''.<ref name= Large167/><ref name= Clap34>Clapham (1972), pp. 34<U+2013>36</ref> The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's ''A Life for the Czar'' angered Glinka's champion [[Mily Balakirev]], who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men.<ref name= Clap34/><ref>Large, pp. 209<U+2013>10</ref> On 16 May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre;<ref>Newmarch, p. 69</ref> he had written a ''Festive Overture'' for the occasion. That same evening  Smetana's third opera, ''Dalibor'', was premi<U+00E9>red at Prague's New Town Theatre.<ref name= Ottlov4/> Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.<ref name= Large197>Large, p. 197</ref> This opera soon became the basis of a series of attacks on Smetana, followed by a concerted effort to drive him from his position as Provisional Theatre conductor.<ref name= Clap34/>

===Opposition===
Early in his conductorship Smetana had made a powerful enemy in Franti<U+0161>ek Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana's, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school.<ref>Steen, p. 701</ref><ref>Clapham (1980) p. 394</ref> In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, at the expense of other composers.<ref name= Clap40>Clapham (1972), pp. 38<U+2013>40</ref> 
[[Image:Richard Wagner, Paris, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Richard Wagner]] (circa 1860). Smetana was accused by his enemies of "excessive Wagnerism".]]

Pivoda then took  issue with ''Dalibor'', calling it an example of extreme "Wagnerism" and thus, unsuited as a model for Czech national opera.<ref>Newmarch, p. 71</ref> "Wagnerism" meant the adoption of Wagner's theories of a continuous role for the orchestra and the building of an integrated musical drama, rather than a stringing together of lyrical numbers.<ref name= Ottlov4/><ref name= Newmarch65/> The Provisional Theatre's chairman, Franti<U+0161>ek Rieger, had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of ''The Brandenburgers'',<ref name= Large145/> and the issue eventually divided Prague's musical society. Music critic Otakar Hostinsk<U+00FD> believed that [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s theories should be the basis of the national opera, and argued that ''Dalibor'' was the beginning of the "correct" direction. The opposite camp, led by Pivoda, supported the principles of Italian opera, in which the voice rather than the orchestra was the predominant dramatic device.<ref name= Ottlov4/> 

Even within the theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a campaign to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Ma<U+00FD>r, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86&nbsp;subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation.<ref name= Clap40/> Strong support from  vice-chairman Antonin <U+010C><U+00ED>sek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.<ref name= Ottlov4/><ref name= Clap40/>

Smetana gradually brought more operas by emergent Czech composers to the theatre, but little of his own work.<ref name= Clap40/> By 1872 he had completed his monumental fourth opera, ''[[Libu<U+0161>e]]'', his most ambitious work to date,<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 99</ref> but was withholding its premiere for the future opening of the National Theatre.<ref>Large, p. 220</ref>  The machinations of Pivoda and his supporters  distracted Smetana from composition,<ref name= Clap40/> and he had further vexation when ''The Bartered Bride'' was produced in [[St Petersburg]], in January 1871. Although the audience was enthusiastic,<ref name= Clap40/> press reports were hostile, one describing the work as "no better than that of a gifted fourteen-year-old boy."<ref name= Large171>Large, p. 171</ref> Smetana was deeply offended, and blamed his old adversary, Balakirev, for inciting negative feelings against the opera.<ref name= Large171/>

==Final decade==
[[Image:Smetana-old-age.jpg|thumb|upright|Smetana near the end of his life]]
===Deafness===
In the respite following his reappointment, Smetana concentrated on his fifth opera, ''The Two Widows'', composed between June 1873 and January 1874.<ref name= Clap41>Clapham (1972), pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref> After its first performance at the Provisional Theatre on 27 March 1874, Smetana's supporters presented him with a decorative baton.<ref name= Ottlov4/> But his opponents continued to attack him, comparing his conductorship unfavourably with the Ma<U+00FD>r regime and claiming that under Smetana "Czech opera sickens to death at least once annually."<ref name= Clap41/>  By the summer Smetana was ill; a throat infection was followed  by  a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears. By mid-August, unable to work, he transferred his duties to his deputy, Adolf <U+010C>ech. A press announcement stated that Smetana  had "become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people recently."<ref name= Clap41/>

In September Smetana told the theatre he would resign his appointment unless his health improved.<ref name= Clap43>Clapham (1972), pp. 43<U+2013>45</ref> He had become totally deaf in his right ear, and  in October  lost all hearing in his left ear also. After his subsequent resignation the theatre offered him an annual pension of 1,200&nbsp;gulden for the continued right to perform his operas, an arrangement which Smetana reluctantly accepted.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 44. It appears (Clapham, 1972, pp. 48<U+2013>49) that this pension was withheld from time to time, causing Smetana much financial hardship.</ref>  Money raised in Prague by former students, and by former lover Fr<U+00F6>jda Benecke in G<U+00F6>teborg, amounted to 1,244&nbsp;gulden.<ref>Large, pp. 294<U+2013>95</ref> This allowed Smetana  to seek medical treatment abroad, but to no avail.<ref name= Ottlov4/> In January 1875 Smetana wrote in his journal: "If my disease is incurable, then I should prefer to be liberated from this life."<ref>Large, p. 303</ref> His spirits were further lowered at this time by a deterioration in his relationship with Bettina, mainly over money matters.<ref>Large, pp. 322<U+2013>23</ref> "I cannot live under the same roof as a person who hates and persecutes me",  Smetana informed her.<ref>Large, p. 374, from an undated letter to Bettina</ref> Although divorce was considered, the couple stayed unhappily together.<ref>Large, p. 374</ref>

===Late flowering===

In worsening health, Smetana continued to compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina and their two daughters left Prague for [[Jabkenice]], the home of his eldest daughter <U+017D>ofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed.<ref>Steen, p. 702</ref> Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called ''[[M<U+00E1> vlast]]'' ("My Fatherland"),<ref>Originally, the work was entitled simply ''Vlast'' ("Fatherland"). The pronoun had been added by May 1883. Large, pp. 266<U+2013>67</ref> and had completed the first two, ''Vy<U+0161>ehrad'' and ''Vltava'', which had both been performed in Prague during 1875.<ref name= Clap47>Clapham (1972), p. 47</ref> In Jabkenice Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5 November 1882 under the baton of Adolf <U+010C>ech.<ref name= Ottlov5/> Other major works composed in these  years were the E minor String Quartet, ''From My Life'', a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: [[The Kiss (opera)|''The Kiss'']], [[The Secret (opera)|''The Secret'']] and ''[[The Devil's Wall]]'', all of which received their first performances  between 1876 and 1882.<ref name= Ottlov5>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

[[Image:N<U+00E1>rodn<U+00ED> divadlo prg.jpg|thumb|left|The National Theatre in Prague, opened 1881, destroyed by fire, rebuilt in 1883]]
The long-delayed premiere of Smetana's opera [[Libu<U+0161>e (opera)|''Libu<U+0161>e'']] finally arrived when the National Theatre opened on 11 June 1881. He had not initially been given tickets, but at the last minute was asked into the theatre director's box. The audience received the work enthusiastically, and Smetana was called to the stage repeatedly.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 51</ref><ref>Large, pp. 222<U+2013>23</ref> Shortly after this event the new theatre was  destroyed by fire; despite his infirmities, Smetana helped to raise funds for the rebuilding.<ref name= Ottlov5/><ref>Steen, pp. 702<U+2013>03</ref>  The restored theatre reopened on 18 November 1883, again with ''Libu<U+0161>e''<ref name= Ottlov5/>

These years saw Smetana's growing recognition as the principal exponent of Czech national music.<ref name= Ottlov5/> This status was celebrated by several events during Smetana's final years. On 4 January 1880 a special concert in Prague marked the 50th anniversary of his first public performance; Smetana attended, and played his Piano Trio in G minor from 1855. In May 1882 ''The Bartered Bride'' was given its 100th performance, an unprecedented event in the  history of Czech opera, and so popular that a repeat "100th performance" was staged.<ref name= Ottlov5/> A gala concert and banquet was arranged to honour Smetana's 60th birthday in March 1884, but he was too ill to attend.<ref name= Ottlov5/>

==Illness and death==
[[Image:Smetana Bedrich Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Smetana's gravestone at the Vy<U+0161>ehrad Cemetery, Prague]]
In 1879 Smetana had written to a friend, the Czech poet [[Jan Neruda]], revealing fears of the onset of madness.<ref name= Large370>Large, pp. 370<U+2013>72</ref> By the winter of 1882<U+2013>83 he was experienceing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech.<ref name= Large370/> In 1883 he began writing  a new symphonic suite, ''Prague Carnival'', but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise.<ref name= Clap54>Clapham (1972), pp. 54<U+2013>56</ref> He started  a new opera, ''Viola'', based on the character in Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'',<ref>Newmarch, p. 89</ref> but wrote only fragments as  his mental state gradually deteriorated.<ref name= Clap54/> In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends;<ref name= Clap54/> By the middle of February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent.<ref name= Large394>Large, pp. 390<U+2013>94</ref> On 23 April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kate<U+0159>inky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12 May 1884.<ref name= Ottlov5/> <ref name= Large394/>
[[File:Smetana Embankment, Prague crop.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bedrich Smetana Museum]] on the banks of the Vltava, Prague]]
The hospital registered the cause of death as senile dementia.<ref name= Large394/> However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis.<ref name= Large394/> An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 151</ref> Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel  Vl<U+010D>ek in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged  by Czech physician Dr Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Ramba, who has argued that Vl<U+010D>ek's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slavn<U+00E9> <U+010D>esk<U+00E9> lebky (Famous Czech Skulls)|last=Ramba |first=Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 (2nd edition) |publisher=Gal<U+00E9>n |location=Prague |isbn=978-80-7262-325-9 |page= |pages=151<U+2013>299 |url= }} {{cs icon}} </ref> 

Smetana's funeral took place on 15th May, at the [[Church of Our Lady before T<U+00FD>n|T<U+00FD>n Church]] in [[Old Town (Prague)|Prague's Old Town]]. The subsequent procession to the [[Vy<U+0161>ehrad cemetery|Vy<U+0161>ehrad Cemetery]] was led by members of the Hlahol, bearing torches, and was followed by a large crowd.<ref name= Large394/> The grave later became a place of pilgrimage for musical visitors to Prague.<ref>Newmarch, p. 90</ref> On the funeral evening, at the National Theatre, a scheduled performance at the National Theatre of ''The Bartered Bride'' was allowed to proceed, the stage draped with black cloth as a mark of respect.<ref name= Large394/>

Smetana was survived by Bettina, their daughters Zde<U+0148>ka and Bo<U+017E>ena, and by <U+017D>ofie.  None of them played any significant role in Smetana's musical life. Bettina lived until 1908; <U+017D>ofie, who had married Josef Schwarz in 1874, predeceased her mother, dying in 1902.<ref name =Large395>Large, p. 395</ref> The younger daughters eventually married, living out their lives away from the public eye.<ref name= Large395/> A permanent memorial to Smetana's life and work is the Smetana Museum in Prague, originally founded in 1926 within the Charles University's Institute for Musicology.<ref name= museum>{{cite web|title= St<U+00E1>l<U+00E9> expozice N<U+00E1>rodniho muzea|url= http://www.nm.cz/expozice-detail.php?f_id=72|publisher= N<U+00E1>rodni Muzeum|accessdate= 6 June 2009|dateformat= dmy}} {{cs icon}}</ref> In 1936 the museum moved to the former Waterworks building on the banks of the Vltava, and since 1976 has been part of the Czech Museum of Music.<ref name= museum/>

[[Image:Liszt at the podium crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Franz Liszt, a primary influence on Smetana throughout the latter's composing career]]
The basic materials from which Smetana fashioned his art, according to Newmarch, were nationalism, realism and romanticism.<ref name= Newmarch90>Newmarch, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref> A particular feature of all his later music is its descriptive character <U+2013> all his major compositions outside his operas are written to programmes, and  many are specifically autobiographical.<ref> Newmarch, pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref> Smetana's champions have recognised the major influences on his work as Liszt, Wagner and Berlioz <U+2013> the "progressives" <U+2013> while those same advocates have often played down the significance of "traditionalist" composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]].<ref name= Tyrrell10>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Tyrrell|first= John|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 10)</ref> 

===Piano works===
All but a handful of Smetana's compositions before his departure for G<U+00F6>teborg had been piano works.<ref>See Large, pp. 425<U+2013>30 Appendix G: Works in order of composition</ref> Some of these early pieces have been dismissed by music historian Harold Schonberg as "bombastic virtuoso rhetoric derived from Liszt".<ref>Schonberg, p. 78</ref>  Under Proksch, however, Smetana acquired more polish, as revealed in works such as the G minor Sonata of 1846 and the E flat Polka of the same year. The set of ''Six Characteristic Pieces'' of 1848 was dedicated to Liszt, who described it as "the most outstanding, finely felt and finely finished pieces that have recently come to my note."<ref>Large, p. 41</ref> In this period Smetana planned a cycle of so-called "album leaves", short pieces in every major and minor key, after the manner of Chopin's ''Preludes''.<ref name= Clap58>Clapham (1972), pp. 58<U+2013>64</ref> The project became somewhat disorganised; in the pieces completed, some keys are repeated while others are unrepresented.<ref name= Clap58/><ref name= Ottlov9>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 9)</ref> After Smetana's final return from G<U+00F6>teborg, when he committed himself primarily to  the development of Czech opera, he wrote nothing for the piano for 13&nbsp;years.<ref name= Ottlov9/>

In his last decade Smetana composed three substantial piano cycles. The first, from 1875, was entitled ''Dreams''. It was dedicated to  former pupils of Smetana's, who had raised funds to cover medical expenses, and is also a tribute to the composer's models of the 1840s<U+2014>Schumann, Chopin and Liszt.<ref name= Ottlov9/> Smetana's last major piano works were the two ''Czech Dances'' cycles of 1877 and 1879. The first of these had the purpose, as Smetana explained to his publisher, of "idealising the polka, as Chopin in his day did with the mazurka."<ref name= Ottlov9/> The second cycle is a medley of dances, each given a specific title so that people would know "which dances with real names we Czechs have."<ref name= Ottlov9/>

===Vocal and choral===

Smetana's early songs are settings of German poems for single voice. Apart from his 1848 ''Song of Freedom'', he did not begin to write pieces for a full choir until after his G<U+00F6>teborg sojourn, when he composed numerous works for the Hlahol choral society, mostly for unaccompanied male voices.<ref>Large, pp. 122<U+2013>25</ref>  Smetana's choral music is generally nationalistic in character, ranging in scale from the short ''Ceremonial Chorus'' written after the death of the composer's revolutionary friend Havl<U+00ED><U+010D>ek, to the setting of ''Song of the Sea'', a substantial work with the character of a choral drama.<ref name= Clap87>Clapham (1972), pp. 87<U+2013>89</ref> 

Towards the end of his life Smetana returned to simple song-writing, with five ''Evening Songs'' (1879) to words by the poet [[V<U+00ED>t<U+011B>zslav H<U+00E1>lek]]. His final completed work, ''Our Song'' (1883), is the last of four settings of texts by Josef Srb-Debrnov. Despite the state of Smetana's health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and dance. The piece was lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.<ref>Large, p. 378</ref>

===Chamber===

===Orchestral===
Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848,<ref>Large, p. 46</ref> Smetana  studied  passages from  [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Weber and Berlioz before producing his ''Triumphal Symphony'' of 1853.<ref name= Ottlov7>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

It was well received in G<U+00F6>teborg in 1860,<ref>Large, p. 108</ref> and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the "triumphal" tag, under Adolf <U+010C>ech.<ref name= Ottlov7/>

Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's ''Faust Symphony'' and ''Die Ideale'', caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works  gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music,<ref>Large, p. 79</ref> and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration.<ref>Large, p. 85</ref><ref name= Ottlov7>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlov<U+00E1>|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed.

From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces,<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 138</ref> did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning ''M<U+00E1> vlast'' in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, Franti<U+0161>ek Bartol brackets ''M<U+00E1> vlast'' with the opera ''Libuse'' as "direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle".<ref name= Clap76>Clapham (1972), pp. 76<U+2013>84</ref> ''M<U+00E1> vlast'' is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.<ref>Large, p. 288</ref> To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents "a cross-section of Czech history and legend and impressions of its scenery, and ... conveys vividly to us Smetana's view of the ethos and greatness of the nation."<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 76</ref> Despite its nationalistic associations this work has, according to Newmarch, carried Smetana's name further afield than anything he wrote, with the exception of ''The Bartered Bride'' Overture.<ref>Newmarch, p. 91</ref> Smetana dedicated ''M<U+00E1> vlast'' to the city of Prague; after its first performance in November 1882 it was acclaimed by the Czech musical public as the true representation of Czech national style.<ref name= Ottlov7/> Its ''Vltava'' movement, depicting the river that runs through Prague towards its junction with the [[Elbe]], is Smetana's best-known and most internationally popular orchestral composition.<ref>Clapham, p. 80</ref>

===Opera===
Smetana had virtually  no precursors in Czech opera apart from [[Franti<U+0161>ek <U+0160>kroup]], whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances.<ref name= Tyrrell6/> In his mission to create a new canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular.<ref name= Tyrrell6>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Tyrrell|first= John|title= Smetana, Bedrich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009|dateformat= dmy}} (Section 6)</ref> He drew  on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French,<ref name= Tyrrell6/> but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.<ref>Grout, p. 534</ref>

[[Image: Prodana cover 1919.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A 1919 edition of the score of ''The Bartered Bride'']]
Although a follower of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation,<ref name= Newmarch65> Newmarch, p. 65</ref> Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with "Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!"<ref>Letter to Adolf Cech 4, December 1882, quoted in Clapham (1972), p. 100</ref> The predominantly "national" character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later,<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 104</ref> particularly  the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's  deafness. The first of this final trio, ''The Kiss'', written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment is described by Newmarch as a work of serene  beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score.<ref>Newmatch, pp. 83<U+2013>84</ref> Smetana's librettist for "The Kiss" was the young feminist [[Eli<U+0161>ka Kr<U+00E1>snohorsk<U+00E1>]], who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles.<ref name= Tyrrell6/> Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in the Czech language meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas.<ref name= Tyrrell6/>

Smetana's eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only ''The Bartered Bride'' is performed regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Tyrrell|first= John|title= The Bartered Bride [Prodan<U+00E1> nev<U+011B>sta]|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 10 June 2009|dateformat= dmy}} {{Subscription}}</ref> and London in 1895,<ref name= Newmarch67/> it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that ''The Bartered Bride'', while not a "gem of the first order", is nevertheless "a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind."<ref name= Newmarch67>Newmarch, p. 67</ref> Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says "lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity",<ref name= Newmarch67/> was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera.<ref>Clapham (1972), p. 94</ref>  Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: "''The Bartered Bride'' was merely child's play, written straight off the reel".<ref name= Newmarch67/> In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, ''Dalibor''.<ref>Newmarch, p. 72</ref>

===Reception===
Even in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognise Smetana. As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously,<ref name= Large121/> and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his "prophet without honour" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of ''Richard III'' and ''Wallenstein's Camp'' at <U+017D>of<U+00ED>n Island in January 1862.<ref>Large, p. 119</ref> 

Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'', in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, ''The Bartered Bride'', survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, ''Dalibor'', closer to that of Wagnerian music drama,  was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song.<ref>Large, pp. 204<U+2013>05</ref><ref name= Clapham36/> It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances.<ref name= Clapham36>Clapham (1972), p. 36</ref> Thereafter the machinations which accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. 

In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition.  Of his later operas, ''The Two Widows'' and ''The Secret'' were warmly received,<ref> Clapham (1972) p. 41 and p. 49</ref> while ''The Kiss'' was greeted by an "overwhelming ovation".<ref name= Ottlov5/> The ceremonial opera ''Libuse'' was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music.<ref>Large, p. 348</ref> Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic,<ref> Clapham (1972), p. 53</ref> and the composer was left feeling "dishonoured and dispirited".<ref>Large, p. 370</ref> This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim which followed the first performance of the complete ''M<U+00E1> vlast'' cycle in November: "Everyone rose to his feet and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after each of the six parts ... At the end of ''Blan<U+00ED>k'' [the final part] the audience was beside itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer."<ref>Large, p. 268</ref>

==Character and reputation==
Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance, yet at least in his youth he had  a ''joie-de-vivre'' which women evidently found attractive.<ref> Large, p. 3 and p. 10</ref> He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant.<ref>Large, p. 19</ref> Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the "Wagnerism" in ''Dalibor'' he responded by writing ''Libu<U+0161>e'', even more firmly based on the  scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama.<ref>Large, p. 205</ref> His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life.<ref>Large, pp. 304<U+2013>05</ref> Little of his relationships with his children is recorded, although it is reported that, on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, <U+017D>ofie was "crying as though her heart would break".<ref>Large, p. 391</ref>
[[Image: Prague Vltava 2001.jpg|thumb|The Vltava river, flowing through Prague]]
There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit.<ref name =Tyrrell10/><ref>Clapham (1972), p. 123</ref><ref>Large, preface p. xvii</ref> A modified view is presented by music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether "nationalistic music" can in fact exist: "We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts."<ref name= Steen690>Steen, pp. 690<U+2013>91</ref> He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.<ref name= Steen690/>

According to musicologist [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]], Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism, and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have tended to affect the objectivity with which his work has been assessed, particularly in his native land.<ref name= Tyrrell10/> Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland "monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.<ref name= Tyrrell10/> As a result, Tyrrell claims, a view of Czech music has been propagated which downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors such as Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k, [[Leo<U+0161> Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek|Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]] and other lesser-known figures.<ref name= Tyrrell10/> This is at odds with perceptions in the outside world, where Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k is far more frequently played and much better known. Harold Schonberg observes that "Smetana was the one who founded Czech music, but Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k ... was the one who popularized it."<ref>Schonberg, p. 77</ref>
