'''King Gong of Chu''' ({{zh|c=<U+695A><U+5171><U+738B> or <U+695A><U+9F94><U+738B>|p=Ch<U+016D> G<U+00F2>ng W<U+00E1>ng}}, 600&ndash;560 BC) was from 590 to 560 BC the king of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], a major power during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] of ancient China.  He was born '''Xiong Shen''' ({{zh|c=<U+718A><U+5BE9>}}), and at the age of 10 succeeded his father [[King Zhuang of Chu]], who was the [[Five Hegemons|Hegemon]] of China.  However, in 575 BC King Gong was defeated by Chu's archrival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] in the [[Battle of Yanling]] and Chu's power declined.  He ruled for 31 years and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[King Kang of Chu]].<ref>Major, John S.

==Battle of Yanling==
{{main|Battle of Yanling}}
When King Gong ascended the throne in 590 BC Chu was the strongest power in China.  In 597 BC his father [[King Zhuang of Chu|King Zhuang]] defeated Chu's archrival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] in the [[Battle of Bi]] and was recognized as the [[Five Hegemons|Hegemon]] by other states.  However, King Gong's reign was marked by Chu's decisive defeat by the resurgent Jin in the 575 BC [[Battle of Yanling]].<ref name="shiji"/>

The battle was triggered by a series of minor events.  In 577 BC, the Jin vassal state [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]] attacked the Chu vassal state [[Xu (Henan)|Xu]] (<U+8A31>).  The next year Chu attacked Zheng in revenge, and forced Zheng to switch its loyalty to Chu.  Zheng then attacked [[Song (state)|Song]], another Jin vassal state.  In 575 BC, [[Duke Li of Jin]] raised an army to attack Zheng, while King Gong led the Chu army north to defend his new ally.<ref name="henan">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawh.cn/html/20060421/154533.html |title=Battle of Yanling |language=Chinese |publisher=Henan Museum |date=21 April 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

The two forces met at [[Yanling County, Henan|Yanling]], and Jin defeated Chu by attacking its weaker flanks manned by the poorly trained Zheng and [[Dongyi]] soldiers.  During the battle King Gong was shot in the eye by an arrow.  Despite his wound, at the end of the day King Gong summoned the chief military commander [[Zifan]] to discuss the battle plan for the next day, but caught Zifan drunk.  King Gong decided to retreat and Zifan later committed suicide.<ref name="henan"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://military.people.com.cn/GB/42964/57825/11877051.html |title=Battle of Yanling |language=Chinese |publisher=People.com.cn |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref name="dukecheng">{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id=d2.14&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&doc.lang=bilingual |title=Book VIII.

==Conflicts with Wu==
[[File:Chinese plain 5c. BC-en.svg|450px|right]]
While Chu was preoccupied with its rivalry with Jin, the formerly insignificant state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] began to rise to its east.  In 598 BC, during King Zhuang's reign, Chu minister Wuchen (Duke of Shen) defected to Jin after a personal dispute with general Zifan.  In 584 BC Wuchen went on a mission to Wu on behalf of Jin to establish an alliance between the two states.  He brought along 100 charioteers who taught the Wu army to use chariots, and successfully incited Wu to revolt again Chu.  The Wu king [[Shoumeng]] invaded Chu, annexed the Chu city of Zhoulai, and took over many tribes that had been loyal to Chu.<ref name="dukecheng"/>

In 570 BC Chu general [[Zichong]] attacked Wu, reaching Mount Heng (in present-day [[Dangtu County]]) in Wu territory.  However, Wu counterattacked and took the important Chu city of Jia.  Zichong was blamed for the loss and died from illness.<ref name="dukexiang"/>  For the ensuing seven decades Chu would be consumed by a series of at least ten wars or battles with Wu, culminating in the 506 BC [[Battle of Boju]], when the Wu army would capture and destroy the Chu capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.gov.cn/big5/hist/2009-07/22/content_4005805.htm |title=<U+67CF><U+8209><U+4E4B><U+6230> (Battle of Boju) |publisher=China Ministry of Defense |language=Chinese |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

==Posthumous title==
In 560 BC, when King Gong was dying from illness, he summoned his ministers and requested them to give him the pejorative posthumous title of Ling (<U+9748>) or Li (<U+53B2>), expressing shame for losing the Battle of Yanling and causing disgrace to the nation.  The ministers agreed at his insistence, but after his death they instead gave him the title of King Gong, Gong meaning humbly reverent.<ref name="dukexiang">{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id=d2.15&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&doc.lang=bilingual |title=Book IX. Duke Xiang |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese and English| accessdate=22 February 2012}} Chapter XIII.</ref>  The pejorative title King Ling was later given to King Gong's second son [[King Ling of Chu|Xiong Wei]], who would in 541 BC murder his nephew [[Jia'ao]] and usurp the throne.<ref name="shiji"/>

==Succession==
King Gong had at least five sons, four of whom became king.  When King Gong died in 560 BC, he was succeeded by his eldest son [[King Kang of Chu]], who died in 545 BC after 15 years of reign and was succeeded by his son Xiong Yuan (posthumous title [[Jia'ao]]).  Four years later King Gong's second son Prince Wei murdered Jia'ao and his two sons when he was ill, and usurped the throne.  Prince Wei was later given the pejorative posthumous title [[King Ling of Chu]].<ref name="shiji"/>

In 529 BC when King Ling was on an expedition against the [[State of Xu]], his three younger brothers staged a [[coup d'etat]] and killed his son Crown Prince Lu.  Prince Bi, the third brother, ascended the throne (posthumous title [[Zi'ao]]), and the fourth brother Prince Zixi became the prime minister.  When news of the coup reached King Ling's troops they abandoned him en masse, and in desperation King Ling killed himslef.<ref name="shiji"/>

However, Prince Qiji, the fifth brother, concealed the truth about King Ling's death from Zi'ao and Zixi.  Instead, he pretended to be defeated by King Ling and said the king would soon return to the capital.  Zi'ao and Zixi were so fearful that they both committed suicide; Zi'ao had been king for less than twenty days.  Prince Qiji then ascended the throne and would come to be known as [[King Ping of Chu]].<ref name="shiji"/>
