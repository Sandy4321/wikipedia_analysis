{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''Feminism in Russia''' originated in the 18th century, influenced by the [[Western Europe]]an [[Enlightenment]] and mostly confined to the [[aristocracy]]. Throughout the 19th century, feminism was closely tied to [[revolution]]ary politics and social reform. In the 20th century, Russian feminists, inspired by [[socialist]] doctrine, shifted their focus from [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] works to [[labor organization|organizing]] among [[peasants]] and [[factory workers]]. After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], feminist lobbying gained [[suffrage]] and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience [[discrimination]] in certain career paths, including [[politics]], as well as income inequality. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period. After the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], feminist circles arose among the [[intelligentsia]], though the term continues to carry negative connotations among contemporary Russians. In the 21st century, some Russian feminists have again aligned themselves with revolutionary anti-government movements, such as the anti-[[Putin]] demonstrations of 2012.

== Origins ==

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Natalia Dolgorukova.JPG|thumb|Portrait of Princess [[Natalia Dolgorukova]], first female Russian autobiographer and one of the Decembrist women]]
Russian feminism originated in the 18th century, influenced by the Western European [[Enlightenment]] and the prominent role of women as a symbol for [[democracy]] and [[freedom]] in the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Saurer|Lanzinger|Frysak|2006|p=365}} Notable Russian intellectual figures like [[Alexander Pushkin]] and [[Alexander Herzen]] wrote positively about the increased power and independence of women in their society and supported the growing concern for gender equality. In his influential novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What is to be Done?]]'', the writer [[Nikolai Chernyshevski]] embodied the new feminist ideas in the novel's heroine, Vera Pavlovna, who dreams of a future [[utopian]] society with perfect equality among the sexes.{{sfn|Posadskaya|1994|pp=154<U+2013>156}}

In [[aristocratic]] Russian society, the greater freedoms allowed to women led to the rise of the powerful, socially-connected woman, including such iconic figures as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Maria Naryshkina]], and Countess [[Maria Razumovskaya]]. Women also began to compete with men in the literary sphere, with Russian women authors, poets, and memoirists increasing in popularity.{{sfn|Saurer|Lanzinger|Frysak|2006|p=365}}

=== 19th century ===

The loosening of restrictions on women's education and personal freedom that were enacted by [[Peter the Great]] in the 18th century created a new class of educated women, such as Princess [[Natalia Dolgorukova]], whose 1767 ''Notes'' was the first [[autobiography]] by a woman in Russia.{{sfn|Vowles|1999|pp=14-15}} In the 19th century, Dolgorukova was one of the "Decembrist women," the female relatives of the [[Decembrists]]. The male Decembrists were a group of aristocratic [[revolutionaries]] who in 1825 were convicted of plotting to overthrow [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas I]], and many of whom were sentenced to serve in [[labor camps]] in [[Siberia]]. Though the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Decembrist men shared the same [[Liberalism|liberal]] democratic political views as their male relatives, they were not charged with [[treason]] because they were women; however, 11 of them, including Princess Dolgorukova and Princess [[Mariya Volkonskaya]], still chose to accompany their husbands, brothers, and sons to the labor camps. Though they were portrayed as heroes in popular culture, the Decembrist women insisted that they were simply doing their duty to their family. While in Siberia, some of them cared not only for their own relatives, but also for the other prisoners. They also set up important institutions like libraries and clinics, as well as arranging lectures and concerts.{{sfn|Pushkareva|Levin|1997|pp=201<U+2013>203}}

In the historical writing of the time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was contrasted with the intrigues and [[hedonism]] of female aristocrats of the 18th century, like [[Catherine the Great]], whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women.{{sfn|Vowles|1999|p=15}} Although they did not explicitly espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an example by later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary political agendas.{{sfn|Bisha|2002|pp=300<U+2013>301}}

In the late 19th century, other aristocratic women began to turn away from refined society life and focused on feminist reform. In the late 19th century, [[Anna Filosofova|Anna Pavlovna Filosofova]], a woman from an aristocratic Moscow family married to a high-ranking [[bureaucrat]], devoted her energy to various societies and projects to benefit the poor and underprivileged in Russian society, including women. Together with Maria Trubnikova and Nadezhda Stasova, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund [[higher education]] courses for women. She was also a founding member of the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908.{{sfn|Noonan|Nechemias|2001|pp=22<U+2013>23}}

At the end of the century, some of the most widely-read Russian literary figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, [[Leo Tolstoy]] argued against the traditional institution of [[marriage]], comparing it to forced [[prostitution]] and [[slavery]], a theme that he also touched on in his novel [[Anna Karenina]].{{sfn|Mandelker|1993|p=6}} In his plays and short stories, [[Anton Chekhov]] portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2000|p=218}}

== The Revolution and Soviet era ==

=== Pre-Revolution ===

[[File:<U+041C><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+043D><U+0433> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+041D><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043C> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+043F><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0435> (1917).jpg|thumb|300px|Feminist demonstration on [[Nevsky Prospect]] after the [[February Revolution]]; the sign reads, "A woman's place is in the [[constituent assembly]]"]]
At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the focus of Russian feminism shifted from the aristocracy to the [[peasants]] and [[working class]]. Imbued with [[socialist]] ideology, young women began to organize all-women [[unions]] among female factory workers, who tended to be ignored or marginalized by male socialists.{{sfn|Glickman|1984|p=243}}

Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was the most important feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including [[suffrage]], equal inheritance, and an end to [[passport]] restrictions. The [[1917 Revolution]], catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization, and in the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.{{sfn|Noonan|Nechemias|2001|pp=38<U+2013>40}}

=== Feminism in Soviet society ===

[[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Bolsheviks]] to power in the [[October Revolution]], recognized the importance of women's equality in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) they established. "To effect [woman's] emancipation and make her the equal of man," he wrote in 1919, two years after the Revolution, following the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories that underlay [[Communism in the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]], "it is necessary to be socialized and for women to participate in common productive labor. Then woman will be the equal of man."{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=166}}
[[File:Poster23.jpg|left|thumb|Soviet propaganda poster celebrating women's liberation|alt=A painted poster showing two women in separate images. The one on the left is putting a ballot in a box; on the right is a woman standing at a lectern. There is Cyrillic wording in a small box at the center straddling the two, and along the bottom]]
Russian women saw mixed gains in their rights under Communism. [[Women's suffrage]] was granted, though in practice voting meant little in Soviet society due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s monopoly on power. Many independent feminist organizations and journals were similarly shut down.{{sfn|Ruthchild|2010|p=235}} However, [[Abortion in Russia#1920<U+2013>1936|abortion]] was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so (although it was banned again between 1936 and 1955). Generous [[maternity leave]] was legally required, and a national network of [[child care|child-care]] centers was established. The country's [[1936 Soviet Constitution|first constitution]] recognized the equal rights of women.{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=169}}

Though the prevailing Soviet ideology stressed gender equality in labor and education, and many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, they did not participate in core political roles and institutions.{{sfn|Chapman|1993|p=5}} Above the middle levels, political and economic leaders were overwhelmingly male. While propaganda claimed, accurately, that more women sat in the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] than in most democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]] and (in its last year of existence) [[Galina Semyonova]], were ever members of the party's [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], in practice the country's real leadership.{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=178}}

By the 1970s, while [[women's liberation]] was a mainstream term in American public discourse, no comparable movement existed in the Soviet Union, despite even greater economic and labor inequality among the sexes in the [[USSR]] than in the United States. "If any large segment of the population has been exploited by the system," [[Hedrick Smith]], former Russian correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote at that time, "it is women," who did what one of them described to him as "the dog's work," necessary but unpleasant and poorly-paid tasks like cleaning and maintenance. "How can one fail to feel shame and compassion at the sight of our women carrying heavy barrows of stones for paving the street?" asked dissident writer [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] in an [[open letter]] to the country's leadership shortly before he was expelled from it in 1974.{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=169}}

Many women Smith talked to complained that their emancipation had in fact been exploitation, since economic circumstances effectively compelled them to work while they retained their domestic responsibilities at home, and they were often tired. One recounted a popular joke:
{{quote|Under capitalism, women are not liberated because they have no opportunity to work. They have to stay at home, go shopping, do the cooking, keep house and take care of the children. But under socialism, women are liberated. They have the opportunity to work all day and then go home, go shopping, do the cooking, keep house and take care of the children.}}
In contrast to Western women, Soviet women regularly told Smith that their idea of liberation was to work ''less'' and have more opportunity to stay at home.{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=182}}

[[Sexism|Sexist]] attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men in the leadership often did not take women or their ideas seriously, and excluded them from many discussions. [[Domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]] continued to exist. Yet, sociological studies at the time found that Soviet women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.{{sfn|Atkinson|Dallin|Lapidus|1977|p=366}}

== Feminism in post-Soviet Russia ==
[[File:Kitchen and fashion_-_that's NOT freedom.jpg|thumb|"Kitchen and fashion&nbsp;<U+2013> that's NOT freedom": Feminist [[graffiti]] in [[St. Petersburg]], 2006]]

In the 1980s and 1990s, during [[Glasnost]] and after the fall of the Soviet Union, feminist circles began to emerge among intelligentsia women in major cultural centers like [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]].{{sfn|Noonan|Nechemias|2001|p=251}} Some contemporary Russian feminists are hesitant to use the term "feminist" to describe themselves, because they believe it has had negative connotations throughout Russian history, and especially after the Revolution, when it was equated with the "proletariat" woman who only cares for her career, not her family.{{sfn|Salmenniemi|2008|pp=112<U+2013>113}} Women have started entering local governments, if only at low-level positions. In 2003, 43 percent of local administrators in [[St. Petersburg]] were women.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|9 March 2003}} The feminist punk rock band [[Pussy Riot]] have performed publicity stunts in order to empower women in Russia and have faced opposition from the [[Orthodox Christian Church]] and the [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] administration.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|2 February 2012}}{{sfn|''Forbes''|14 June 2012}}
