'''Cake Maternity''' is a [[maternity]] clothing brand, which specialises in nursing bras and other maternity products. Their products are designed to provide femininity like in mainstream [[lingerie]] and other clothing items, with the function required in [[maternity]] related products.

Cake Maternity was awarded the best UK Maternity brand in 2011 at the [[UK Lingerie Awards]] in [[Mayfair, London]].

==History==
Tracey Montford founded the company in 2008, following a pregnancy of her own. She felt that [[maternity]] bras that were available at the time were often poorly designed and had poor features.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Debbie|title=We meet up with Tracey Montford from Cake Lingerie|url=http://babyworld.co.uk/2014/10/we-meet-up-with-tracey-montford-from-cake-lingerie/|publisher=Baby World|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref> After researching the market, Montford created a range of maternity bras, before expanding into other maternity fields.<ref name=morningshow>{{cite web|title=Cake Maternity on The Morning Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWx_qOve5MQ|publisher=[[The Morning Show (TV program)]]|date=2012}}</ref>

In 2012, the company founder was interviewed on the [[The Morning Show (TV_program)|The Morning Show]] on the [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]]. Company founder Montford said during the interview that she focused on three areas when she started the brand. She wanted comfortable and attractive clothing that was also practical.<ref name=morningshow />

Cake Lingerie in 2014 won the Best Maternity Lingerie Brand at the Junior Design Awards, which was hosted by Junior Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Catherine|title=Cake Lingerie: Best Maternity Lingerie Brand, Junior Design Awards 2014 Winner|url=http://www.juniormagazine.co.uk/fashion-awards/cake-lingerie-best-maternity-lingerie-brand-junior-design-awards-2014-winner/18830.html|publisher=Junior Magazine|date=7 November 2014}}</ref>

The [[Brassiere_measurement|B to D Cup]] is designed in a plunge style and the [[Brassiere_measurement|D to G cup]] bra is designed in a balcony style.<ref name=morningshow /> The products demonstrated on the show were [[maternity|nursing bra]]s with drop down cups and extra sling extra support. It was also stated that all bras come with a number of hooks and eyes, allowing the bra to be adapted during a pregnancy as the woman's stomach grows.<ref name=morningshow />
