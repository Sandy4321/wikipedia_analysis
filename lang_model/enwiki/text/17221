'''Covelli Loyce "Coco" Crisp''' <ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=crispco01 Coco Crisp Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (born November 1, 1979 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[center fielder]] for the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Crisp is a [[switch-hitter]] and throws [[right-handed]]. He previously played for the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Boston Red Sox]]. 

==Early life==
Crisp attended [[Los Angeles Pierce College]] following his graduation from [[Inglewood High School]] in Los Angeles, California. He briefly attended high school with [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Paul Pierce]]. Before attending Inglewood High School, he attended St. Bernard High School in [[Playa Del Rey, California]] for three years.

==Baseball career==
===Minor league career===
In his minor league career, he played for the [[New Haven Ravens]], then the Double-A affiliate of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] before being traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization. There he played for the Indians' Triple-A affiliate [[Buffalo Bisons]]. Crisp had 81 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], one [[home run]], and 24 [[Run batted in|RBI]] before being called up by the Indians.

===Major League Career===
====Cleveland Indians====
Crisp was originally drafted by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1999 Major League Baseball Draft]]. On August 7, 2002, while playing at Double-A New Haven, Crisp was traded to Cleveland to complete an earlier trade for [[pitcher]] [[Chuck Finley]]. 

Crisp became the starting center fielder with the Indians in mid-2002, replacing the injured [[Matt Lawton]]. For the next few seasons, Crisp established a reputation as an excellent fielder and speedy baserunner. Despite his success, Crisp had to fight for his roster spot each spring. In 2005, Crisp moved to [[left field]] following the emergence of another young outfielder, [[Grady Sizemore]]. In his final two seasons with the Indians, Crisp showcased his offensive talent by batting .297 and .300 with 31 total home runs and 35 [[stolen base|steals]].

====Boston Red Sox====

After [[Johnny Damon]] signed with the [[New York Yankees]], the Red Sox sought Crisp to fill Damon's vacated role both in center field and as a lead-off hitter. In January 2006, the Red Sox sent prospect [[third baseman]] [[Andy Marte]], pitcher [[Guillermo Mota]], [[catcher]] [[Kelly Shoppach]], a player to be named later (Minor Leaguer [[Randy Newsom]]), and cash considerations to the Indians for Crisp and pitcher [[David Riske]]. Crisp, already a fan favorite in Cleveland, saw his national fame jump dramatically upon entering big-market Boston before playing a single game in a Red Sox uniform.

After a promising start to his Red Sox career, which included signing a 3-year contract extension worth $15.5 million, Crisp broke his left index finger attempting to steal third base and spent the next 42 games on the [[disabled list]]. After returning to the Red Sox outfield on May 28, [[Kevin Youkilis]] had taken over the leadoff spot, and Crisp usually batted 7th or 8th in the [[Batting order (baseball)|line-up]] for the rest of the year. In 105 games, he had a .264 batting average with 8 home runs and 36 RBI. Besides his injury, Crisp's 2006 season may be best remembered for a fantastic defensive catch against the [[New York Mets]] on June 29.

=====2007 season=====
Crisp began the 2007 season struggling offensively. On April 20, 2007, Crisp fell over a short wall at [[Fenway Park]] while trying to catch a home run by [[Alex Rodriguez]].  Although he was unable to make the catch, missing by inches, he hit a game tying [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] off [[Mariano Rivera]] in the bottom of the eighth. The Red Sox went on to win 7-6. During this season, he made numerous impressive catches in the outfield. It has even been claimed by one major league club that Crisp is easily the best defensive center fielder in all of Major League Baseball.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/redsox/content/sp_bb_sox27_06-27-07_7065NV4.3ba22c6.html projo.com]Coco's fielding mighty Crisp, Sean McAdam, 6/27/2007</ref> Although he struggled at the plate throughout much of the season, between June 13 and July 5, Crisp raised his batting average from .221 to .265, and after a 3 for 4 game on July 22, he raised his average to a season high .277. On June 18, entering the game with only two home runs in the season, Crisp belted two homers in the first multi-HR game of his career in a 9-4 loss to the [[Atlanta Braves]].

On August 5, Crisp was almost run over by the [[Seattle Mariners]]' mascot, the [[Mariner Moose]]. The Moose, driving a lap around [[Safeco Field|Safeco Field's]] warning track on an [[All-Terrain Vehicle|ATV]], nearly collided with Crisp as he was leaving the [[dugout]] for his position in the middle of the fifth inning; Crisp had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. Red Sox pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]] was incensed by the mascot's actions and voiced his displeasure to both the mascot and Seattle's head groundskeeper. Immediately following the incident, the Red Sox received an apology from Mariners GM [[Bill Bavasi]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/08/06/their_only_close_call_was_a_moose_on_the_loose/ boston.com]Their only close call was a moose on the loose, [[Dan Shaughnessy]], 8/6/2007</ref>

On October 21, in Game 7 of the [[American League Championship Series]], Crisp made the catch that sent Boston to their second [[World Series]] in four seasons. He sprinted over to the triangle in center field and collided with the wall after making the catch.

Although he was the team's starting center fielder throughout the 2007 season, he was benched mid-series during the ALCS for rookie [[Jacoby Ellsbury]]. He remained benched for the [[2007 World Series]], only appearing late in games for defensive substitutions.

=====2008 season=====
[[Image:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Bench-clearing brawl]] on June 5, 2008]]
On June 4, Crisp was the center of controversy in a game against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. While Crisp was trying to steal [[second base]] in the bottom of the sixth inning, Rays shortstop [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] placed his knee in front of the bag in attempt to prevent Crisp from stealing the base. Crisp stole the base, but was not happy with this. On base again in the bottom of the eighth inning, he attempted another steal, this time taking out second baseman [[Akinori Iwamura]] on a hard slide. He slid as if he was trying to break up a double play. During a pitching change in that inning, Rays manager [[Joe Maddon]] and Crisp argued, with Crisp in the dugout and Maddon on the pitching mound. After the game, Crisp said that he thought it was Bartlett in the play in the eighth inning, not Iwamura. Crisp described Bartlett's knee in front of the bag as a "shady" play. The very next game, in Crisp's first at bat in the bottom of the second, leading off the inning with the Sox up 3-1, Rays starter [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]] hit him on the thigh on the second pitch. Crisp [[Charging the mound|charged the mound]] and first dodged a punch from Shields, and then threw a punch at Shields, setting off a [[bench-clearing brawl]]. Crisp, [[Jonny Gomes]], and Shields were ejected from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/06/06/red_sox_outfight_rays/|title=Red Sox outfight Rays: Brawl precedes Ellsbury injury|author=[[Amalie Benjamin]]|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2008-06-06|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> Major League Baseball suspended Crisp for seven games due to his actions in the brawl. Upon appeal, the suspension was reduced to five games which he had served on June 28, 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2008/06/crisp_suspensio.html | title=Crisp suspension reduced | date=2008-06-27 | accessdate=2008-06-27|author=[[Gordon Edes]]|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]}}</ref> In Game 5 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Coco Crisp had a game tying hit in the Bottom of the 8th inning to cap Boston's 7-run comeback. Boston would go on to win the game 8-7 with a walk off single in the ninth inning by J.D. Drew.  Crisp described the Rays as "the best team in baseball"<ref>http://www.app.com/article/20081020/SPORTS/810200327/1002/sports</ref>, and in Game 7 the Rays regained their lead and took the championship. 
===Kansas City Royals===
On November 19, 2008, Crisp was traded to the [[Kansas City Royals]] for relief pitcher [[Ram<U+00F3>n Ram<U+00ED>rez (relief pitcher)|Ram<U+00F3>n Ram<U+00ED>rez]].<ref>[http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081119&content_id=3684505&vkey=pr_kc&fext=.jsp&c_id=kc Royals acquire Coco Crisp from Red Sox for Ramon Ramirez]</ref>
