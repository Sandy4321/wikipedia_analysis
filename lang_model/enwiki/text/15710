The '''1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape''' occurred on [[31 October]] [[1973]], when three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) members escaped from [[Mountjoy Prison]] in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]] after a hijacked helicopter landed in the prison's exercise yard. The escape made headlines around the world and was an embarrassment to the Irish [[coalition government]] led by [[Fine Gael|Fine Gael's]] [[Liam Cosgrave]], which was criticised by opposition party [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]]. A [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] involving twenty thousand members of the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and [[Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na]] was launched for the escapees, one of whom, [[Seamus Twomey]], was not recaptured until December 1977. The [[Wolfe Tones]] wrote a song celebrating the escape called "[[The Helicopter Song]]", which  topped the [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish popular music charts]] despite being banned by the government. 

==Background==
Following the outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in 1969, the IRA had conducted an [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969<U+2013>1997|armed campaign]] that sought to create a [[United Ireland]] by ending [[Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's]] status as part of the [[United Kingdom]]. As a result of increasing levels of violence in Northern Ireland, [[internment]] without trial was introduced in August 1971, and in the Republic of Ireland the coalition government led by Fine Gael's Liam Cosgrave was attempting to curb IRA activity.<ref name="h118">{{cite book | last = Hayes | first = Paddy | authorlink = | title = Break-out!

Famous Prison Escapes'', p. 114.</ref> He was found guilty and received a five-year sentence.<ref name="h114"/> By October 1973 the IRA's command structure was seriously curbed, with Twomey and other senior republicans JB O'Hagan and Kevin Mallon all being held in Mountjoy Prison.<ref name="h118"/>

==Planning of the escape==
The IRA immediately began making plans to break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison.<ref name="h120">''Break-out! Famous Prison Escapes'', pp. 120<U+2013>121.</ref> The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were to be used to blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard.<ref name="h120"/> From there, they would scale a [[rope ladder]] thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a [[getaway car]] waiting to complete the escape.<ref name="h120"/> The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans.<ref name="h120"/> The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break [[Gerry Adams]] out of [[Long Kesh|Long Kesh Internment Camp]] had been ruled out due to faster and more sophisticated [[British Army]] helicopters being stationed at a nearby base.<ref name="h122">''Break-out! Famous Prison Escapes'', pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref> The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter.<ref name="h122"/> A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at [[Dublin Airport]], with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in [[County Laois]].<ref name="h122"/> After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] for [[31 October]].<ref name="h122"/>

==The escape==
Leonard arrived at Irish Helicopters on [[31 October]] and was introduced to the pilot of the helicopter, Captain Thompson Boyes.<ref name="h124">''Break-out! Famous Prison Escapes'', p. 124<U+2013>125.</ref> Boyes was instructed to fly to a field in [[Stradbally]], in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment.<ref name="h124"/> After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees.<ref name="time">{{cite web | title = The Canny Copter Caper | author = Louisa Wright | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944665,00.html | publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' | date = [[12 November]] [[1973]] | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}</ref> Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions.<ref name="h126">''Break-out!

In the prison's exercise yard, the prisoners were watching a football match.<ref name="h126"/> Shortly after 3:35 pm the helicopter swung in to land in the prison yard, with Kevin Mallon directing the pilot using [[flag semaphore|semaphore]].<ref name="h128">''Break-out!

==Reaction==
The escape made headlines around the world and was an embarrassment for Cosgrave's government, which was criticised for "incompetence in security matters" by opposition party Fianna F<U+00E1>il.<ref name="time"/><ref name="h132">''Break-out!

<blockquote>It is poetic justice that a helicopter is now at the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.<ref>{{cite web | title = Committee on Finance. - Mountjoy Jail Escape: Statement by Taoiseach | author = | url = http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0268/D.0268.197311010007.html | publisher = [[Oireachtas]] | date = [[1 November]] [[1973]] | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>''From Fetters to Freedom'', pp. 61<U+2013>62.</ref></blockquote>

The IRA released a statement on the escape, which read, "Three republican prisoners were rescued by a special unit from Mountjoy Prison on Wednesday.

Shortly after the escape Twomey gave an exclusive interview to German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', where he claimed people throughout Europe were describing it as "the escape of the century".<ref name="m63">''From Fetters to Freedom'', p. 63.</ref> [[Irish rebel music|Irish rebel]] band the [[Wolfe Tones]] wrote a song celebrating the escape called "[[The Helicopter Song]]", which was immediately banned by the government yet still topped the Irish popular music charts after selling twelve thousand copies in a single week.<ref name="h132"/>

The escape resulted in all IRA prisoners being held at Mountjoy Prison and [[Curragh Camp]] being transferred to the maximum security [[Portlaoise Prison]].<ref name="h132"/> In order to prevent any further escapes the perimeter of the prison was guarded by members of the [[Irish Army]], and wires were erected over the prison yard to prevent any future helicopter escape.<ref name="h132"/> Cosgrave stated there would be "no hiding place" for the escapees, and a manhunt involving twenty thousand members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na ensued.<ref name="time"/><ref name="h132"/> Mallon was recaptured at a [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] dance in a hotel near [[Portlaoise]] on [[10 December]] [[1973]], and imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison.<ref name="h134">''Break-out!
