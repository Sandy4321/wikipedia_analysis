:''This article is about the Brewers' third baseman. For the Royals' pitcher, see [[Ryan Braun (baseball pitcher)]]''.

'''Ryan Joseph Braun''', nicknamed '''The Hebrew Hammer''' (born [[November 17]], [[1983]], in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California|Mission Hills, California]]), is an [[United States|American]] [[right-handed]] [[third baseman]] who broke into baseball's [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]] with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in [[2007]].<ref>[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070524&content_id=1984533&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil McCalvy, Adam, "Brewers promote top prospect Braun," [[Milwaukee Brewers]], 5/24/07, accessed 7/7/07]</ref>  

He won the [[National League Rookie of the Year]] Award in 2007, during which he led the [[National League]] in slugging percentage.  He also won the [[The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award|Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year]], the [[Baseball America Rookie of the Year]], the [[Baseball Prospectus]] Internet Baseball NL Rookie of the Year, and the [[Players Choice Award|Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie]] Awards.  Over the prior decade, the only other NL hitter to win all 5 awards was [[Albert Pujols]], in 2001.

==Heritage and early life==

===Jewish heritage===
Braun's father, Joe, is [[Israel]]i-born,<ref>[http://www.jewishchronicle.org/current/20070615/localnews.htm Nelles, Mitch, "<U+FEFF>Moving to the Big Leagues, Braun becomes next Jewish baseball hope," The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, accessed 9/13/07]</ref> and immigrated to the United States at the age of seven.<ref name=JStandard>[http://www.jstandard.com/articles/3113/1/Rookie-could-make-history--but-will-he-cut-Yom-Kippur? Abramowitz, Martin, "Rookie could make history <U+2014> but will he cut Yom Kippur?", New Jersey ''[[Jewish Standard]]'', 8/31/07, accessed 9/13/07]</ref>

Braun is [[Jew]]ish.  "It's something that draws a lot of interest and something I take pride in," Braun said.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=623892 Hunt, Michael, "Precocious Braun is in good company," [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]], 6/23/07, accessed 9/13/07]</ref>  His nickname is "The Hebrew Hammer,"<ref>[http://www.projectprospect.com/graduation-day-june-26-through/ Loupos, Chris, "Graduation Day: June 26 through July 7," Project Prospect, 7/7/07, accessed 9/13/07]

</ref> and Braun said he's cool with that.<ref>[http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?contentid=22969&mode=a&contentname=Greenberg_To_Green_To%2E%2E%2EBraun%3F&recnum=1&sectionid=14 Cohen, Irwin, "Greenberg To Green To...Braun?"], ''[[The Jewish Press]]'', 8/8/07, accessed 9/13/07</ref>  It references his Jewish heritage, former Brewer [[Hank Aaron]] (whose nickname was "Hammerin' Hank"), and the movie ''[[The Hebrew Hammer]]'', starring [[Adam Goldberg]].  In the past it was also a nickname of [[Al Rosen]]<ref>[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1275&pid=12230 Berger, Ralph, "Al Rosen," [[SABR]], accessed 9/13/07]</ref> and [[Hank Greenberg]].<ref>[http://www.dailycal.org/printable.php?id=21367 Gorcey, Ryan, "Off Base ...with Ryan Gorcey," [[The Daily Californian]], 9/13/06, accessed 9/13/07]
</ref>

He is one of the highest-drafted [[List of Jews in sports|Jewish ballplayers]] in the history of professional baseball.  The [[New York Yankees]] made [[Ron Blomberg]] the [[List of MLB first overall draft choices|number one pick]] in the 1967 draft.  Braun was considered the best Jewish minor league baseball prospect in 2006,<ref>[http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060510&content_id=69468&vkey=news_milb&fext=.jsp Mayo, Jonathan, "Minor League's top Jewish prospects; Ryan Braun representing his faith at the top of the list," MILB.com, 5/10/06, accessed 12/24/07]</ref> and became major league baseball's first Jewish Rookie of the Year the following season.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/105291.html "Jewish rookie makes baseball history," [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 11/13/07, accessed 11/14/07]</ref>  In 2007, Braun hit more home runs (34) than all but 3 of the top 10 career Jewish home run hitters had hit in their best seasons.  Only [[Hank Greenberg]] (58), [[Shawn Green]] (49), and [[Al Rosen]] (43) hit more in a single year.

"Braun" was, coincidentally, the family name of [[Sandy Koufax]], until his mother remarried and he took his stepfather's name.  "There's no (family) connection that I know of," Braun said, "but it's kind of cool."<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=623892 Hunt, Michael, "Precocious Braun is in good company," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 6/23/07, accessed 9/13/07]</ref>  In another coincidence, Braun lived for a time with his maternal grandfather in a house that previously belonged to Jewish [[Hall of Fame]] outfielder [[Hank Greenberg]].<ref name=JStandard/>  Braun's grandfather has lived in the house for over 40 years.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AtieJCL2Bbuyr_2ZayN.Vk8RvLYF?slug=gettoknowbrewersbryanbra&prov=tsn&type=lgns, Crossman, Matt, "Get to know Brewers 3B Ryan Braun], [[The Sporting News]], 8/8/07, accessed 9/10/07</ref>

===High school===

Braun was a 4-year [[letterman]] on the [[Granada Hills High School]] baseball team, and 3-year team captain and MVP.  He played [[shortstop]], and also pitched until his junior year.  As a sophomore in 2000 he recorded the highest batting average of his prep career (.456), while  posting a .654 on base percentage.  During his junior year he hit .421, with a .668 OBP.  Braun capped off his high school career by batting .451 as a senior, with an OBP of .675, and breaking the school record for career home runs (with 25).<ref>[http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/sports/brewers/202345 Mulhern, Tom, "Brewers:  Braun's start a smashing success," [[Wisconsin State Journal]], 7/21/07, accessed 12/20/07]</ref> 

He was a two-time all-area selection by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and a three-time choice by the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''.  Braun was rated the 6th-best shortstop prospect in the country by ''Team One Baseball'' as a senior,<ref>[http://media.www.thehurricaneonline.com/media/storage/paper479/news/2004/02/06/Sports/Braun.Hopes.To.Live.Up.To.Lofty.Expectations-599571.shtml Kalis, Eric, "Braun hopes to live up to lofty expectations," ''The Hurricane'', 2/6/04, accessed 6/6/07]</ref> and rated among the top 100 overall prospects by ''[[Baseball America]]''.  He graduated in 2002, but went undrafted as he told teams that he intended to go to college.<ref name=MiamiProfile>[http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/braun_ryan00.html "Ryan Braun profile," [[Miami Hurricanes]], accessed 2/20/07]</ref><ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AtieJCL2Bbuyr_2ZayN.Vk8RvLYF?slug=gettoknowbrewersbryanbra&prov=tsn&type=lgns, Crossman, Matt, "Get to know Brewers 3B Ryan Braun," The Sporting News, 8/8/07, accessed 9/10/07]</ref>

===College===

Offered scholarships to [[Stanford University]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC-Berkeley]], he instead attended the [[University of Miami]].  He chose Miami for its academics, its athletics, and its social scene, noting:  "I think the girls were the deal closer on the recruiting trip."<ref name=GetToKnow>[http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=252655 Crossman, Matt, "Get to know Brewers 3B Ryan Braun", The Sporting News, 8/8/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>  There, Braun was named "National Freshman of the Year,"  as well as a 1st-team "Freshman [[All-American]]," by ''Baseball America'' in 2003.  He was also named 1st-team All-American by ''Collegiate Baseball''.<ref name=MiamiProfile/> He clinched the awards by batting .364 with 74 RBIs and 17 home runs.  As a sophomore shortstop/[[DH]], Braun hit .335 and slugged .606, stealing 21 bases.

During his junior year, his final and most successful at Miami, Braun batted .396 with 18 home runs, a .726 slugging percentage, 76 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases.  He was 9th in slugging, and 10th in RBIs, in [[NCAA]] [[Division I]], and was named to ''Baseball America's'' 2005 College All-American Team as the DH.  He moved from shortstop to third base during the year.  His performance earned Braun a spot as one of the finalists for the [[Golden Spikes Award]], the most prestigious individual award in college baseball.<ref name=MiamiProfile/>

==Minor leagues (2005-07)==
The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] drafted Braun in the 1st round (5th overall) in the [[2005]] [[Major League Baseball Draft|Amateur Baseball draft]] as a third baseman, and Braun signed for $2.45 million.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050808/ai_n16878624 Schelzig, Erik, "Brewers' draft pick getting into swing of things," [[Chicago Sun-Times]], 8/8/05, accessed 12/20/07].</ref>  Assigned to the [[Helena Brewers]] in the Advanced Rookie [[Pioneer League]] in 2005, Braun batted .341/.383/.585 in 10 games.  He was then promoted to the [[West Virginia Power]] in the Single-A [[South Atlantic League]], where he hit .355/.396/.645, and was rated the 5th-best prospect in the league.<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/minors/05league20s/sal.html Manuel, John, "2005 Top 20 Prospects: South Atlantic League," [[Baseball America]], 9/27/05, accessed 12/21/07].</ref> 

Braun began [[2006]] playing for the A-Advanced [[Brevard County Manatees]], where he earned a spot in the [[Florida State League]] [[All-Star]] game, and played in the [[All-Star Futures Game]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  He was rated the top third base prospect in the FSL, and ''Baseball America'' rated Braun the best batting prospect in the league.  On [[June 21]]st, Braun was promoted to the Class AA [[Huntsville Stars]] (Alabama) of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]].  In July he was voted the Brewers' Organizational Player of the Month, and at the end of the season he was voted the 6th-best prospect in the Southern League.<ref>[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/pressbox/downloads/y2007/mil/player_dev.pdf "'07 Milwaukee Brewers Player Development," Milwaukee Brewers, accessed 12/22/07]</ref>  Collectively between Class A and Class AA, Braun finished with a .289 average, 22 home runs, 77 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases.  He received the 2006 ''Robin Yount Performance Award'' as the Milwaukee Brewers Minor League [[player of the year]].<ref>[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060919&content_id=1671428&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil McCalvy, Adam, "Notes:  Braun, Gallardo class of Minors," Milwaukee Brewers, 9/19/06]</ref>  

In 2006 in the [[Arizona Fall League]] he hit .326/.396/.641 in 92 at-bats for the [[Scottsdale Scorpions]], and was rated as one of the top three prospects in the league.<ref name=GBP/>  He led the AFL with 16 extra-base hits, tied for tops with 9 doubles, ranked 2nd in slugging percentage and HR/AB ratio (1/15), tied for 2nd in home runs (6), tied for 3rd in RBIs (25), and was voted to the AFL All-Prospects Team.<ref>[http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/documents/2006/11/20/145540/1/All-Prospects_Team.pdf "2006 Arizona Fall League All-Prospects Team," AFL press release, 11/20/06, accessed 12/21/07]</ref>

''Baseball America'' rated Braun the Brewers' # 2 prospect for [[2007]].<ref>[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/pressbox/downloads/y2007/mil/player_dev.pdf "'07 Milwaukee Brewers Player Development," Milwaukee Brewers, accessed 12/22/07]</ref>   He began the year with the [[Nashville Sounds]] of the [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]] [[Pacific Coast League]].  Before being called up to the majors in late May, in 113 at bats he led the PCL with a .726 slugging percentage while batting .354 (6th), with 10 home runs (T-2nd) and a .426 on base percentage (5th).  At the same time, [[Craig Counsell]] and [[Tony Graffanino]] were batting a combined .214 while playing third base for the major league club.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-05-24-2664920685_x.htm "Brewers call up third baseman Ryan Braun," ''[[USA Today]],'' 5/24/07, accessed 7/8/07]</ref>

==Major leagues==
===Milwaukee Brewers (2007)===
====Spring training====
The Brewers brought Braun to [[spring training]] in 2007.<ref name=GBP>[http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070125/GPG0206/70125182/1225/GPGsports "Brewers GM: 'We feel we are a much better ballclub this year']," [[Green Bay Press-Gazette]], 1/25/07]</ref>  Their regular third baseman [[Corey Koskie]], suffering from [[post-concussion syndrome]], missed all of spring training -- he later ended up missing the entire season.<ref>[http://www.rotowire.com/roto_to_gnews.htm?ID=208088&sport=mlb "Corey Koskie:  Not Ready for Spring Training," Rotowire, accessed 2/20/07]</ref>  While the Brewers intended to platoon veterans Counsell and Graffanino to start the season, they also gave Braun an extensive look.  In his first spring training game, Braun went 4-5 with a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], a 3-run home run, a double, a single, and a stolen base, along with 7 RBIs; a triple shy of hitting for the cycle.  In his second game he went 2-5 (including a 3rd home run) with a walk.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2007_03_02_milmlb_sfnmlb_1 Boxscore, MLB.com, 3/2/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>  In 11 games he batted .353 with a .912 slugging percentage, tying for 10th in the majors in home runs (5), and 2nd in RBIs (15), despite having missed 7 games.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/league_leaders.jsp?c_id=mlb&baseballScope=NL&statType=1&sortByStat=HR&timeSubFrame3=&timeSubFrame=23&Submit=Submit&timeFrame=1 "League Leaders," MLB.com, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>  He also committed 4 throwing errors. He was sent to minor league camp on March 20th, with Brewers' manager [[Ned Yost]] commenting:  <U+201C>He's really done a nice job offensively, but he still needs to polish some of his defense. He knows what he needs to do. He's really, really close.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.beloitdailynews.com/articles/2007/03/20/sports/sports11.txt "Brewers reassign Braun to Triple A," [[Beloit Daily News]], 3/20/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>

====Regular season====

On May 24th, Braun was called up to the Brewers.<ref>[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070524&content_id=1984533&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil McCalvy, Adam, "Brewers promote top prospect Braun; Third baseman slugged 10 homers at Triple-A Nashville," Milwaukee Brewers, 5/24/07, accessed 9/10/07]</ref>  He hit his first major league home run two nights later, off Padres' starter [[Justin Germano]].<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3237673 "Braun Flirts With Cycle to Lead Brewers; Ryan Braun Homers, Doubles and Singles to Help Lead Brewers to 8-5 Victory Over Marlins," [[ABC News]], 6/2/07, accessed 12/21/07]</ref> 

His rookie hazing took place on his first full road trip after being called up.  "I had to carry bags.  I had to sing on the bus."  With headphones to his iPod plugged into one ear, he sang "[[On Bended Knee]]" and "[[Water Runs Dry]]" by [[Boyz II Men]].  "I was into it, but I don't think my voice was too great.  I feel like I'm going to have to dress up soon."<ref name=GetToKnow/>  That did in fact happen later; in September he was inducted into the annual rite of Brewers' rookies being required to put on silly costumes, and wore a hot dog costume for a team flight to Atlanta.<ref>[http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/sports/index.php?ntid=246893&ntpid=3 Feuerherd, Vic, "Brewers: Loss to Astros extra painful," Wisconsin State Journal, 9/20/07, accessed 9/24/07]</ref> 

Braun was voted the [[Rookie of the Month|National League Rookie of the Month]] for June, after leading all N.L. rookies with 21 RBIs.  He hit 6 home runs, tying him for 1st among N.L. rookies, while recording a .716 slugging percentage and a .435 [[on base percentage]].<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070702&content_id=2062377&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb "Braun, Bannister selected as Rookies of the Month for June," mlb.com, 7/2/07, accessed 9/14/07]</ref>  In July he was voted the National League Rookie of the Month for the second straight month, as well as the NL [[Player of the Month]] (marking the first time a player won both awards in the same month).  He hit a league-leading 11 home runs, with 25 RBIs, while batting .345.).<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070802&content_id=2125384&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Ang, Kelvin, "Braun top NL Player, Rookie for July; Brewers phenom the first to win both awards in same month," mlb.com, 8/2/07, accessed 9/14/07]</ref>

In mid-August, Yost moved Braun from 3rd in the lineup to cleanup, switching him with [[Prince Fielder]].  The move was expected to allow Braun to run more, inasmuch as when he hit in front of Fielder it did not make sense for him to steal many bases, because the opposing team would then counter by walking Fielder.  The switch also allowed Yost to move left-handed [[Geoff Jenkins]] up in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]], behind the right-handed Braun.<ref>[http://www.madison.com/tct/sports/205602 Semrau, Dennis, "Brewers notes: Sheets progresses, appears on target for Sept. 1 return," [[The Capital Times]], 8/15/07, accessed 9/14/07]</ref>   At the end of August, however, Yost reversed the switch.<ref>[http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/sports/index.php?ntid=208867&ntpid=2 Feuerherd, Vic, "Brewers: Parra hurt, rotation up in air," Wisconsin State Journal, 8/31/07, accessed 9/14/07]</ref> 

On September 9th, the Brewers became the third team in major league history to open a game with three straight home runs, as [[Rickie Weeks]], [[J. J. Hardy]], and Braun connected off [[Cincinnati Reds]]' starting pitcher [[Phil Dumatrait]] in consecutive at bats.  "That was pretty cool," Braun said.  "I was never part of something like that before."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3579696 "Brewers Puts Together Homer Barrage," ABC News, accessed 9/18/07]</ref> 

In September, as the Brewers sought in vain to capture the pennant, he was 3rd in the NL in runs (27) and RBIs (29), and tied for 5th in home runs (9), while batting .308 with a .644 slugging percentage.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting?sort=RBIs&split=45&league=nl&season=2007&seasonType=2&type=reg&ageMin=17&ageMax=51&minpa=0&hand=a&pos=all "MLB Player Batting Stats: 2007," ESPN, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>

'''Season Stats.'''  In 2007, during which he played in 113 games and had 492 plate appearances, Braun led the National League with a .634 slugging percentage.  He set a new all-time major league rookie slugging percentage record, breaking the record set by [[Mark McGwire]], who slugged .618 for Oakland in 1987.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071112&content_id=2298624&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb McCalvy, Adam, "Braun named NL Rookie of the Year," MLB.com, 11/12/07, accessed 12/20/07]</ref> 

He was also was 5th in the league in [[at bats per home run]] (13.3; behind [[Ryan Howard]], [[Prince Fielder]], [[Barry Bonds]], and [[Adam Dunn]]) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (1.004; behind Bonds, [[Chipper Jones]], Fielder, and [[Matt Holliday]]), tied for 5th in home runs (34; behind Fielder, Howard, Dunn, and Holliday), and 8th in batting average (.324) among hitters with at least 490 plate appearances.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting?sort=slugAvg&split=0&league=nl&season=2007&seasonType=2&type=reg&ageMin=17&ageMax=51&minpa=475&hand=a&pos=all "MLB Player Batting Stats: 2007," ESPN, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>

He also led the Brewers in batting average and slugging percentage, and was 2nd behind Fielder in home runs, runs (91), and RBIs (97), tied for 2nd in triples (6), and 3rd in obp (.370) and steals (15) -- despite not having played in the first 48 games of the season.[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/Statistics/Team/playerstats?sortField=homeRuns&team=mil&stub=/mlb/Statistics/HTML/Table]  Braun obliterated the club rookie records of 28 home runs and 81 RBIs, set by Fielder in 2006.<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/features/265033.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Record-Setting Bat Propels Braun," Baseball America, 10/17/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>  A projection of his statistics over 162 games put him at 49 homers and 139 RBIs.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?p=2659498 Fagan, Ryan, "NL rookie debate:  A vote for Ryan Braun," The Sporting News, 11/9/07, accessed 11/11/07]</ref>

'''Against Lefties.'''  Braun also had success against left-handed pitchers.  Against them, he had the best batting average (.450), obp (.516), and slugging percentage (.964; over 200 points ahead of the second-best SP) of all major league hitters with at least 125 plate appearances against lefties, and was tied for 2nd in the major leagues in home runs (15).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting?sort=slugAvg&split=31&league=mlb&season=2007&seasonType=2&type=reg&ageMin=17&ageMax=51&minpa=125&hand=a&pos=all "MLB Player Batting Stats: 2007," ESPN, accessed 10/18/07]</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?id=3113991 Cockcroft, Tristan H., "Cockcroft: Stats you might not know," ESPN, 11/16/07, accessed 11/17/07]</ref>  "I like those guys," Braun joked.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070725&content_id=2109201&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb McCalvy, Adam, "Notes: Milwaukee making moves," MLB.com, 7/25/07, accessed 9/19/07]</ref>   Braun credits his father.

'''NL Batting Title Race.'''  Braun had the 8th-highest batting average in the National League in 2007, among players with 490 or more plate appearances.  He finished with 492 plate appearances, 10 short of the number needed to [[Batting average|qualify]] for the NL [[batting title]].  Though he didn't have a high enough batting average to take advantage of it, an [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|exception to the qualification rule]] kicks in and a player is awarded the title if he falls short of 502 plate appearances, but would still have the highest batting average if enough hitless at-bats were added to his total to enable him to reach the 502 mark.

'''NL Rookie of the Year'''.  Braun won the 2007 [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|National League Rookie of the Year Award]] in a vote by 32 members of the [[Baseball Writers Association of America|Baseball Writers' Association of America]], two from each National League city.

{{Quote box

 | source = --Assistant General Manager [[Gord Ash]]}}
Braun has the ability to hit for average and significant power.  His swing is compact and short, and he is a [[pull hitter]] with tremendous bat speed and strong wrists.  He stays back on offspeed pitches, and uses the entire field.  He drives the ball no matter where it is in the strike zone.<ref name=PP/>  Brewers hitting coach Jim Skaalen observed: "He's got tremendously quick hands and really hits through the ball.  He stays on the ball as well as anyone we've got."<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/features/265033.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Record-Setting Bat Propels Braun," Baseball America, 10/17/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>

===Speed===
In addition, his speed garnered him comparisons to [[New York Yankees]] third baseman [[Alex Rodriguez]].<ref>[http://www.kffl.com/article.php/72831/456?printarticle=1 Garcia, Richard, "Third Basemen Outlook," KFFL.com, 6/22/07, accessed 11/23/07]</ref>  Braun has been timed at 4.2 seconds to first base from the right side of the plate.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/fantasy/03/29/braun.pence Grey, Jason, "Meet two top National League hitting prospects", Sports Illustrated, 6/30/07, accessed 7/9/07]</ref>  During Scout Day at the [[University of Miami]] in 2004, Braun ran the 60-yard dash in 6.2 seconds.  In spring training in 2007, he was second only to [[Corey Hart (baseball player)|Corey Hart]] in the Brewers' 60-yard dash.<ref>[http://www.beloitdailynews.com/articles/2007/03/07/sports/sports08a.txt "Brewers' prospect Braun focusing on defense," Beloit Daily News, 3/17/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>

===Defense===
A shortstop most of his life and in college, Braun has been inconsistent on defense since switching to third base in 2006.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AtieJCL2Bbuyr_2ZayN.Vk8RvLYF?slug=gettoknowbrewersbryanbra&prov=tsn&type=lgns Crossman, Matt, "Get to know Brewers 3B Ryan Braun," The Sporting News, 8/8/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>  However, he has at the same time been noted for his athleticism on defense, his occasional [[web gem]]s,<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/features/265033.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Record-Setting Bat Propels Braun," Baseball America, 10/17/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref> and particularly for his powerful throwing arm,<ref name=PP>[http://www.projectprospect.com/profile-ryan-braun-06/ Profile: Ryan Braun," Project Prospect, 12/27/06, accessed 12/14/07]</ref> which was rated the best infield arm in the Brewers' minor league system by ''Baseball America'' in early 2007.<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/features/263202.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Top 10 Prospects:  Milwaukee Brewers," Baseball America, 2/2/07, accessed 9/11/07]</ref>   Braun was charged with 34 errors in 2006, the majority on throws.  "It's a matter of proper footwork," according to Ash at the beginning of 2007.  "Most of his problems come because he relies on his arm, which is very strong."<ref name=WSJ>[http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/sports/index.php?ntid=115153&ntpid=3 "Brewers: Waiting for word on third," ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'', 1/17/07]</ref>

He's gotten a lot better on the routine plays, has gotten a lot better with his throws.  He's a very good athlete.  He's working very hard at it. He's going to get better, no doubt about it. He hasn't played a lot of third base.  We tend to forget that."<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/features/265033.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Record-Setting Bat Propels Braun," Baseball America, 10/17/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>|source= <U+2014> Brewers coach [[Dale Sveum]], a former big league third baseman.}}While Yost removed Braun from a number of games in September 2007 for defense, he praised Braun for his improvements.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070923&content_id=2225543&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb McCalvy, Adam, "Notes:  Braun on the defensive; Yost has consistently lifted slugger in late-inning situations," MLB.com, 9/23/07, accessed 9/24/07]</ref>  "The great thing about it is it doesn't involve throwing at all now," said Yost, referring to Braun's biggest issue in the spring.  "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase his range. [He needs to] soften his hands a little bit. [His] hand-eye coordination to the ball needs to be a little better.  That comes with repetition, repetition, repetition."  Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors in 248 total chances; only the fourth third baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding percentage under .900),<ref>[http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2007/08/ryan_braun_grea.php Lederer, Rich, "Ryan Braun: Greatest First-Year Slugger Ever?," Baseball Analysts, 8/20/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref> range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697).  His target at first base was Prince Fielder, who finished 2007 last of all eligible major league first basemen in range factor (8.49), and first in errors (14).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding?groupId=9&season=2007&seasonType=2&split=79&sortColumn=errors "MLB Player Fielding Stats: 2007," ESPN, accessed 10/18/07]</ref> Similarly, his target at second base, [[Rickie Weeks]], had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL second basemen (.976), and the lowest zone rating among all major league second basemen, .737.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding?groupId=8&sortColumn=fieldingPct&sortOrder=true&split=80&qualified=null&season=2007&seasonType=2 "MLB Player Fielding Stats: 2007," ESPN, accessed 11/3/07]</ref> 

Furthermore, it has been suggested that it is possible that Braun will learn to play the position adequately, given that [[David Wright (baseball)|David Wright]] (who tied for the major league lead in errors by a third baseman in 2005 (his second in the league)<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding?groupId=8&season=2005&seasonType=2&split=81&sortColumn=errors "MLB Player Fielding Stats: 2005," ESPN, accessed 11/23/07]</ref> in 2007 became a "passable defender" (and won the NL Gold Glove at third base).<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=687220 Hunt, Michael, "Braun wouldn't veto third amendment," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11/16/07, accessed 11/17/07]</ref> 

Braun, for his part, noted after the 2007 season: "It's only my second full (professional) year of playing third base.  I don't expect to be perfect, but I certainly expect to be better than I have been.  I have to continue to work hard, and hopefully I'll improve."<ref>[http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/majors/features/265033.html Haudricourt, Tom, "Record-Setting Bat Propels Braun," Baseball America, 10/17/07, accessed 10/18/07]</ref>
