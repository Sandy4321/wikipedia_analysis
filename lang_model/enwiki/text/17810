'''USS ''Massachusetts'' (Battleship No. 2)''' was an {{Sclass|Indiana|battleship}} and the second [[United States Navy]] ship comparable to foreign battleships of the time.<ref name=RS67>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', p. 67.</ref> Authorized in 1890 and commissioned six years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship class also pioneered the use of an [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Armament|intermediate battery]]. She was intended and used for [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defense]], since her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.

''Massachusetts'' served in the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] (1898) as part of the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] and took part in the blockades of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]]. She missed the decisive [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] after steaming to [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] the night before to resupply coal. After the war she served with the [[North Atlantic Squadron]], performing training maneuvers and gunnery practice. During this period she suffered an explosion in an 8-inch [[gun turret]], killing nine, and [[ship grounding|ran aground]] twice, requiring several months of repair both times.  She was decommissioned in 1906 for modernization.

Although considered obsolete in 1910, the battleship was recommissioned and used for annual cruises for [[midshipmen]] during the summers and otherwise laid up in the [[reserve fleet]] until her decommissioning in 1914. In 1917 she was recommissioned to serve as a training ship for gun crews during [[World War I]]. She was decommissioned for the final time in March 1919 under the name ''Coast Battleship Number 2'' so that her name could be reused for {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-54|0}}. In 1921 she was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Pensacola, Florida]] and used as a target for experimental artillery.{{awkward|surely sure she was used as a gunnery target before she was scuttled?}} The ship was never scrapped and in 1956 it was declared the property of the state of Florida. Since 1993 the wreck has been a [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve]] and is included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.

==Design and construction==
{{Main|Indiana class battleship}}

''Massachusetts'' was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship. The original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships. The [[United States Congress]] saw the plan as an attempt to end the U.S. [[United States non-interventionism|policy of isolationism]] and did not approve it, but a year later approved funding for three coast defense battleships, which would become ''Massachusetts'' and her sister ships [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] and [[USS Oregon (BB-3)|''Oregon'']].<ref name=F2425>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', pp. 24<U+2013>25.</ref> The ships were limited to coastal defense due to their moderate endurance, relatively small [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], or distance from the deck to the water, which limited sea-going capability.<ref name="G121">Gardiner, ''Steam, Steel & Shellfire: The Steam Warship 1815<U+2013>1905'', p. 121.</ref> They were however heavily armed and armored; ''Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships'' describes their design as "attempting too much on a very limited displacement."<ref name=C140>Chesneau, ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860<U+2013>1905'', p. 140.</ref>

Construction of the ships was authorized on 30 June 1890 and the contract for ''Massachusetts''<U+2014>not including guns and armor<U+2014>was awarded to [[William Cramp & Sons]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], who offered to build it for $ 3,020,000.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The new American navy; Secretary Tracy reports in favor of progress |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 December 1890 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E1DC1E3BE533A25752C0A9649D94619ED7CF |accessdate=24 June 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> The total cost of the ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000.<ref name=RS51>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', p. 69.</ref>   The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates and guns caused a delay.<ref name=MBT/> Her [[keel]] was laid down on 25 June 1891<ref name=RS51/> and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Hilary A. Herbert]] and commander [[George Dewey]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=New battle ship launched; the Massachusetts floated in the broad Delaware |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |date=10 June 1893 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401E4DF163EEF33A25752C1A9609C94629ED7CF |accessdate=4 June 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> Her preliminary [[sea trial]] did not take place until March 1896 because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries.

==Service history==
===Early career===
''Massachusetts'' was commissioned on 10 June 1896 with [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Frederick Rodgers]] in command. She had her [[shakedown cruise]] between August and November 1896, followed by an overhaul at the [[New York Navy Yard]]. In February 1897 she made a short voyage to [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The battleship departed New York again in May for [[Boston]], where a celebration in her honor was held. For the next ten months the warship participated in training maneuvers with the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] off the coast of [[Florida]] and visited several major ports on the American [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]]. On 27 March 1898, she was ordered to [[Hampton Roads]] to join the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Winfield Scott Schley]] for the blockade of [[Cuba]].<ref name=DANFS2>{{cite DANFS |title=Massachusetts |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m6/massachusetts-iv.htm |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref>

===Spanish<U+2013>American War===
After the outbreak of the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] the Flying Squadron steamed to [[Key West]]. There Schley met with [[Rear Admiral]] [[William T. Sampson|Sampson]], who had just returned from the bombardment of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. They discussed the possible locations of the Spanish squadron under [[Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Cervera]], and Schley was sent to the harbor of [[Cienfuegos, Cuba]] to look for Cervera.<ref>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 93<U+2013>94.</ref> Schley arrived off Cienfuegos on 22 May and took several days to establish that Cervera's ships were not in the harbor.  The squadron then proceeded to [[Santiago de Cuba]], the only other port on the southern coast of Cuba large enough for the Spanish ships,<ref>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 116, 120.</ref> arriving after several delays on 29 May.<ref>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 141<U+2013>162.</ref> On arrival, the {{Ship|Spanish cruiser|Cristobal Colon|}} was visible from outside the harbor entrance, confirming that the Spanish fleet was in the harbor.<ref>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 164<U+2013>167.</ref>
Schley blockaded the harbor and informed Sampson, who arrived with his own squadron on 1 June<ref name=DANFS1>{{cite DANFS |title=Indiana |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/indiana-i.htm |accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref> and assumed overall command.<ref name=GS203>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', p. 203.</ref>

During the next month ''Massachusetts'' took part in the blockade of Santiago, occasionally bombarding the harbor forts.<ref name=DANFS2/> On the night of 2<U+2013>3 July she and the two [[cruiser]]s [[USS New Orleans (CL-22)|''New Orleans'']] and [[USS Newark (C-1)|''Newark'']] left the blockade to load coal in [[Guantanamo Bay]].<ref name=GS299300>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 299<U+2013>300.</ref> This caused her to miss the [[battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on 3 July, in which the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade and was completely destroyed.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sampson's story of the battle; official report of the destruction of Cervera's squadron. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 July 1898 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E6D71738E433A25754C2A9619C94699ED7CF |accessdate=18 May 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> The next day the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and ''Texas'' fired at the disarmed [[Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes|Spanish cruiser ''Reina Mercedes'']], which was being scuttled by the Spanish in an attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.<ref name=GS471>Graham & Schley, ''Schley and Santiago'', pp. 471<U+2013>472.</ref> ''Massachusetts'' was then sent to Puerto Rico to support the American occupation until she steamed home to New York on 1 August, arriving on 20 August.<ref name=DANFS2/>

===Post Spanish<U+2013>American War===

After a quick overhaul in [[drydock]], ''Massachusetts'' was attempting to leave [[New York Harbor]] on 10 December 1898 when she struck [[Diamond Reef]], flooding five of her forward compartments. She was forced to return to the navy yard, where she was placed in drydock again for repairs which took around three months.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Massachusetts hurt; battleships strikes a sunken obstruction off Governers Island |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |date=11 December 1898 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900EFD71438E433A25752C1A9649D94699ED7CF |accessdate=20 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Massachusetts leaves dock |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |date=1 April 1899 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9804EFD8153DE633A25751C0A9629C94689ED7CF |accessdate=20 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> For a year ''Massachusetts'' served with the North Atlantic Squadron, visiting various cites on the Atlantic coast.<ref name=DANFS2/> In May 1900, she and ''Indiana'' were placed in reserve as the navy had an acute officer shortage and needed to put the new [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge''-class]] and [[Illinois class battleship|''Illinois''-class battleships]] into commission.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Navy short of officers; there are not enough to keep warships in commission. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 April 1900 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9907E4D91339E733A25756C1A9629C946197D6CF |accessdate=18 May 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> The battleships were reactivated the following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Hurry order to the navy; department wants to find Out what can Be done in an emergency. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 June 1900 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980CE4D81F3CE433A25755C0A9609C946197D6CF |accessdate=21 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> and ''Massachusetts'' returned to service with the North Atlantic Squadron.<ref name=DANFS2/>

In March 1901 the battleship grounded again, this time in the harbor of [[Pensacola, Florida]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=Why the Massachusetts grounded |newspaper=The New York Times |date=25 March 1901 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E0D71330E132A25755C2A9659C946097D6CF |accessdate=18 May 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> but the ship was able to continue her trip.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Movements of naval vessels |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 March 1901 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F03E6D71330E132A25757C2A9659C946097D6CF |accessdate=21 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members.

Another accident happened in August of that year, when ''Massachusetts'' grounded on a rock in [[Frenchman Bay]], Maine.

On 2 May 1910 ''Massachusetts'' was placed in reduced commission so she could be used for the annual [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] [[midshipmen]] summer cruise.<ref name=DANFS2/> Despite her modernizations the battleship was now regarded as "obsolete and worthless, even for the second line of defense" by Secretary of the Navy [[George von Lengerke Meyer]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Meyer wants navy ever ready for war |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 December 1911 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D02E4DB1231E233A25751C0A9649D946096D6CF |accessdate=22 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> She saw little use other than summer cruises and was transferred to the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]] when it was formed in 1912.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Admiral Knights's command |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 February 1912 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D07E3DA173CE633A25757C0A9649C946396D6CF |accessdate=22 July 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> After a quick trip to New York for a [[Presidential Fleet Review]] in October 1912, the warship returned to Philadelphia and stayed there until she was decommissioned on 23 May 1914.<ref name=DANFS2/>

===World War I and beyond===
[[File:USS Massachusetts (BB-2) sinking 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=A sinking stripped battleship seen from a birds eyes view|''Massachusetts'' being scuttled off the coast of [[Pensacola]]]]
After the United States entered [[World War I]] ''Massachusetts'' was recommissioned for the final time on 9 June 1917. She was used by [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] gun crews for gunnery training in [[Block Island Sound]] until 27 May 1918. The battleship was then redeployed to serve as a heavy gun target practice ship near [[Chesapeake Bay]] until the end of World War I.
''Massachusetts'' returned to Philadelphia on 16 February 1919.  She was decommissioned for the final time on 31 March 1919, after being re-designated ''Coast Battleship Number 2'' two days earlier so her name could be reused for {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-54|3}}.<ref name=DANFS2/>

She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 22 November 1920 and loaned to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], then used as a target ship for experimental artillery.  She was scuttled in shallow water off [[Pensacola, Florida]] in January 1921 and bombarded by the [[coastal batteries]] of [[Fort Pickens]] and by [[railway artillery]]. She was was returned on 20 February 1925 to the navy, which offered her for scrap, but no acceptable bids were received.<ref name=DANFS2/> Another attempt to scrap her was made in 1956, but the state prevented this. Eventually the ship was declared the property of the [[State of Florida]] by the [[Supreme Court of Florida]]. On 10 June 1993<U+2014>the centennial anniversary of her launching<U+2014>the site became the fourth [[Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve]]. In 2001 the wreck was also added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it still serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumsinthesea.com/_docs/Massachusetts_history_transcript.pdf |title=USS ''Massachusetts'' learn about the history audio transcript |publisher=Florida's "Museums in the Sea" |format=PDF |accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref>
