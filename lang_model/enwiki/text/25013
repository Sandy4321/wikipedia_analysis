The '''Action of 4 May 1917''' was a naval and air engagement of the [[World War I|First World War]] in the [[North Sea]]. The action took place between the German [[Zeppelin]] [[List of Zeppelins#Zeppelins constructed during World War I|LZ 92]] (tactical name: ''L.43''), several German submarines and a naval force led by the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. The action was inconclusive with no casualties on either side, concluding when the Zeppelin had dropped all of its bombs and the cruisers had expended all of their anti-aircraft ammunition.

==Action==
''Sydney'' was serving in British waters when on 4 May 1917, while part of a patrol from [[Rosyth]], Scotland, the ship took part in a battle with a German Zeppelin, ''L.43'',{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=128}} commanded by Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Hermann Kraushaar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeppelin-museum.dk/main.php?page=base&sub=crew&id=kraushaar&lang=en |title=Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Hermann Kraushaar |work=Zeppelin and Garrison Museum Tonder |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> In concert with another cruiser, [[HMS Dublin (1912)|''Dublin'']], and four destroyers &ndash; [[HMS Obdurate (1916)|''Obdurate'']], [[HMS Nepean|''Nepean'']], [[HMS Pelican (1916)|''Pelican'']] and [[HMS Pylades (1916)|''Pylades'']]<ref name=GWPDA>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/sydvszep.htm |title=HMAS Sydney versus a Zeppelin |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=GWPDA}}</ref> &ndash;  ''Sydney'', under the command of Commander [[John Saumarez Dumaresq|John Dumaresq]] who was the second-in-command of the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, had been undertaking patrol operations between the Firth of Forth and River Humber when lookouts spotted a vessel on the surface to the east of the British flotilla and ''Obdurate'' was detailed to investigate at around 10:00&nbsp;am. About twenty-five minutes later, the Zeppelin was located by ''Dublin'' about {{convert|27|km|mi}} to the east, and ''Sydney'' and ''Dublin'' turned towards the contact, and fired at maximum range.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=128}}

Meanwhile, ''Obdurate'' continued to investigate the surface contact and subsequently located two German submarines. Coming under attack from one of these submarines, the destroyer dropped depth charges before turning away to attack the Zeppelin. As the destroyer closed on it, though, the Zeppelin turned away to the south-east. Within the space of the next half an hour, ''Dublin'' was unsuccessful attacked by the German submarines at least twice with torpedoes, leading Dumaresq to conclude that the Germans were attempting to spring a trap on the British vessels. He subsequently ordered ''Obdurate'' to complete its investigation of the suspect vessel, which was subsequently determined to be a Dutch fishing vessel.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=128}}  

Dumaresq then attempted to draw the aircraft into following the British force by ordering his ships to turn away back onto their original course. As the airship approached again, ''Dublin'' and ''Sydney'' turned about to attack. In response, the Zeppelin's commander began a high-level bombing run on ''Dublin'', but fast manoeuvres from the cruisers frustrated these efforts and the Zeppelin's attention turned instead to ''Obdurate'', dropping three bombs which achieved near misses. This was followed by a further attack on ''Sydney'', with between ten and twelve bombs being dropped unsuccessfully. ''Sydney'' returned fire with her [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]]. A further Zeppelin moved towards the battle at around 1:00&nbsp;pm, having been contacted by L.43 for assistance, but it loitered to the north-east and did not close in to attack. The engagement ended when both sides exhausted their ammunition around 2:30&nbsp;pm. The Zeppelin was forced to remain high to stay out of range of the flak, this meant that the bombs were dropped from too great of height to strike the Allied patrol. There was no damage or casualties.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=128}}

The action was later commemorated in the early 1930s in an oil painting by Australian war artist [[Charles David Jones Bryant|Charles Bryant]].{{sfn|Odgers|1994|p=135}} It was the first time that a Royal Australian Navy vessel had been attacked by an enemy aircraft,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/ART12418/ |title=HMAS Sydney's fight with a Zeppelin in the North Sea |publisher=Australian War Memorial |work=Art |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> and was one of the actions that resulted in ''Sydney'' being awarded the "North Sea 1916&ndash;18" [[battle honour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-sydney-i |title=HMAS Sydney (I) |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>
