:''This school is not to be confused with [[DePaul University]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], which has a similar pronunciation.''
'''DePauw University''' in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], is a private, national [[liberal arts college]] with an enrollment of approximately 2,400 students. The school has a [[Methodist]] heritage and was originally known as '''Indiana Asbury College'''. DePauw is a member of both the [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]] and the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]]. Since 1996, DePauw has been a partner with the [[Posse Foundation]][http://www.possefoundation.org], which provides full tuition scholarships to student leaders awarded by the Posse Program. 

==Academics==
===National rankings===
''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''  ranks DePauw 48th out of the national liberal arts colleges; the University has been in the top tier for seven consecutive years.  The [[National Survey of Student Engagement]] finds that students at DePauw University enjoy significantly more academic challenges, interactions with faculty, collaborations with others and enriching educational experiences than students at peer institutions and the national average at all colleges and universities. DePauw has consistently ranked as the number one college for Greek life in the nation and of having one of America's top college radio stations, according to the annual books on "America's Best Colleges" published by [[Princeton Review]].

===Academic calendar===
DePauw University's  schedule is divided into a unique 4-1-4 calendar.  Besides the 15-week Autumn and Spring Semesters, there is also a 4-week Winter Term.  Students take only one course during the Winter Term, which is either used as a period for students to explore a subject of interest on campus or participate in off-campus domestic or international [[internship]] programs, service trips, or international trips and field studies.  DePauw is consistently among the top colleges in the nation for students studying abroad.

===Faculty===
DePauw University prides itself on having a student-faculty ratio of 10:1 and not having a single class with more than 50 students.  The average class size is 13.  All courses are taught by professors; there are no teaching assistants.

Prominent faculty members include: Barbara Bean, professor of English and author of "Dream House;" Dave Berque, professor of computer science, whose work led to the development of pen-based technology now used in classrooms worldwide; [[Sunil Sahu]], professor of Political Science and author of ''Technology Transfer, Dependence, and Self-Reliant Development in the Third World: The Pharmaceutical and Machine Tool Industries in India''; Ken Bode, visiting professor of journalism and former ''[[CNN]]'' senior political analyst; Tom Chiarella, professor of English and contributing editor for ''[[Esquire]]'' magazine; John Dittmer, professor emeritus of history and noted civil rights expert; Arthur Evans, professor of modern languages, who has been called America's "Most Prominent Jules Verne Scholar" by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine; Jeffrey T. Kenney, associate professor and chair of religious studies and author of "Muslim Rebels: Kharijites and the Politics of Extremism in Egypt;" Jinyu Liu, assistant professor of classical studies and recipient of a 2006 David Stevenson Fellowship; Jeffrey McCall, professor of communication, who is regularly quoted in newspaper and television stories on media matters; Eric Kline Silverman, Edward Myers Dolan Professor of Anthropology and author of "From Abraham to America: A History of Jewish Circumcision;" Lili Wright, associate professor of English and author of "Learning to Float;" and Valarie Ziegler, professor of religious studies and author of "Diva Julia: The Public Romance and Private Agony of Julia Ward Howe."

===Programs of distinction===
DePauw students can apply for entry to five "programs of distinction": The Honor Scholar program is an interdisciplinary journey for talented students who want the highest level of intellectual rigor;
Management Fellows are top students interested in business and economics; Media Fellows benefit from DePauw's media tradition, which may be the strongest of any liberal arts college in the country; Science Research Fellows use state-of-the-art equipment, work one-on-one with faculty members, participate in internships, make presentations at scientific meetings, publish in scientific journals and, in essence, have graduate-level science opportunities as undergraduates; Students participating in the Information Technology Associates Program (ITAP) enjoy an unparalleled opportunity to link their liberal arts education with technology know-how through on-campus apprenticeships and on- and off-campus internships.

===Technology===
DePauw University is among the "Top 50 Most Unwired College Campuses,"[http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=16430] a survey of all institutions of higher learning, big and small, sponsored by Intel Corporation. DePauw is ranked #30 &mdash; the highest of any liberal arts college in America &mdash; in the report, which appears in the October 17, 2005 edition of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.

DePauw was also ranked the third most connected school in the [[United States]] in a 2004 [[Princeton Review]] analysis. "Criteria for the rankings included: number of school-owned computers available, breadth of the computer science curriculum, the sophistication of campus technology, availability of school-owned digital cameras and equipment for student use, wireless Internet access on campus, and support for handheld computing."

Indiana Asbury College was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, IN and was named after [[Francis Asbury]], the first [[United States|American]] [[bishop]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000, a large sum at the time, in order to entice the Methodists to found the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time.  It was originally established as an all men's school, but later admitted women starting in 1867.  During 1884 Indiana Asbury College changed its name to DePauw University in honor of [[Washington C. DePauw]], who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the School of Music during 1884. DePauw University's School of Music remains one of the oldest schools of music in the [[USA]].  Before his death in 1887, Mr. DePauw donated over $600,000 to the Indiana Asbury, which was an enormous and very generous sum at the time. Sigma Delta Chi, known today as The Society of Professional Journalists, was founded at the university in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including [[Eugene C. Pulliam]].

==Campus life==
There are more than 100 organizations on the DePauw campus that students can be involved in, with groups highlighting diversity, special interests, recreational intercollegiate sporting clubs, music and arts, and politics.  DePauw students also participate in on-campus intramurals, university and student sponsored musical and theatrical productions, and create local chapters of national organizations such as [[Circle K]].

The student radio station ([[WGRE]]), which was ranked in 2006 as the #3 college radio station in the United States in ''[[Princeton Review]]'''s book, "America's Best Colleges," campus television ([[D3TV]]), and campus newspaper (''[[The DePauw]]''), provide opportunities for all students &mdash; regardless of their major &mdash; to learn journalism, production and presentation and, if they choose, actually manage media outlets. 
 
Students also spend time at the Lilly Physical Education and Recreation Center, which houses workout facilities, a natatorium, racquetball courts, and a gym.  

Approximately 70% of DePauw students engage in community service and other volunteer activities.  Putnam County [[Relay For Life]] -- which is organized by students and brings together the college and community -- raised more than $215,000 for the [[American Cancer Society]] in May 2006 and is consistently ranked among the top college-run Relays in the United States.

The "[[Advocate]] College Guide for LGBT Students" ranks the University among America<U+2019>s best 100 campuses for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.

DePauw was ranked as one of the "The 50 Best Colleges" for young women by [[CosmoGirl]] magazine in October 2006.  This ranking was based upon such factors as small class size, quality of professor instruction, and the strength of alumni networks.

The Open Doors 2006 report ranks as among America's top ten small colleges for the percentage of students who study abroad.

==Campus==
DePauw University consists of 36 major buildings spread out over a spacious 655 acre (2.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) campus that includes a 520 acre (2.06&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) nature park, and is located approximately 45 miles to the west of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].  There are 11 residence halls, 4 theme houses, and 31 University-owned houses and apartments spread throughout the campus.  The oldest building on campus, [[East College]], was built in 1877 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  DePauw is also home to [[McKim Observatory]].

==Greek life==
DePauw University was ranked #1 in "major [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] scene" by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' in its 2007 guide. In 2005, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked DePauw as third in the nation for highest percentage of sorority members (70 percent) and #4 for highest percentage of fraternity members (74 percent). 

The Greek community consists of fourteen national social fraternities (eleven of which have houses on campus) and ten sororities (seven of which have houses on campus).  DePauw has an extensive and substantial Greek history, with both [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] and [[Alpha Chi Omega]] being founded at the school. Furthermore, the Delta Chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]] is the longest continuously-running Greek organization in North America while the Lambda Chapter is the longest continuing chapter of [[Phi Gamma Delta]].

Formal IFC and Panhel recruitment for men and women is held early second semester. Membership intake for [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] organizations (historically black greek-lettered organizations) usually can occur in the fall and/or the spring.  First-year students are not permitted onto fraternity property for a period of time at the beginning of each school year.  First-year female students are not permitted onto sorority property until recruitment begins. 

Greek-letter organizations that formerly maintained chapters on DePauw's campus include the fraternities [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] and [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and the sororities [[Delta Delta Delta]], also known as [[Tri Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] and [[Alpha Gamma Delta]].

==Athletics==
The DePauw Tigers compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division III [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCAC). Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in football against its rival [[Wabash College]] in what has become the [[Monon Bell]] Classic.  The traveling trophy, the 300-pound train bell from the [[Monon Railroad]], made its debut in the rivalry in 1932.  The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation's oldest college football rivalries. 

In 1933, the DePauw Tigers accomplished a feat that has only been equaled once in modern history. The football team finished the season 7-0-0. This team, coached by Ray "Gaumey" Neal, outscored their opponents 136-0, making them unbeaten, untied, and un-scored-upon. Coach Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, finishing the season 5-0-1 and outscoring opponents 206-6. The only points surrendered that season were in a 39-6 victory over Indiana State and the only non-win was a 0-0 tie against Oberlin.

DePauw has been a member of the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] since 1997 and has won numerous conference championships, most notably in women's basketball where the school is a Division III power.  DePauw's program has also won the conference's overall "President's Trophy" twice in that time, the only school besides [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity]] to do so.

Over the years, DePauw has sent several players to the [[National Football League|NFL]], including Dave Finzer '82, a punter for the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]], and Greg Werner '89, a tight end for the [[New York Jets]].

=== Fight Song ===
''Here's to DePauw (March on Down the Field)'' (Modern Lyrics)

Here's to DePauw, friends, here's to our school.
 
Here's to the place where good feelings rule;

We will sing praises to our old school.

Old DPU, here's to you!


Refrain:

Then we will march, march on down the field,

shouting for old DePauw.

Break thru the en'mies' line,

their strength to defy!


We'll give a long shout for DePauw's team.

"GO, TIGERS!  VICTORY!"

Fight, fight unto the end for old DePauw!


'''Refrain''', then cheer:

T-I-G-E-R-S, T-I-G-E-R-S Tigers!

T-I-G-E-R-S, T-I-G-E-R-S Tigers!

==Traditions==

===Ubben Lecture series===
Endowed by a gift from Timothy H. and Sharon (Williams) Ubben, both 1958 graduates of DePauw, the speakers' series "brings the world to Greencastle."  Presented free of charge and open to all, Ubben Lecturers have included [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Paul Bremer]], [[Mike Krzyzewski]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Willy Brandt]], Gen. [[Colin Powell]], [[Eric Schlosser]], [[John Major]], [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Ross Perot]], [[Shimon Peres]], Sister [[Helen Prejean]], [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Peyton Manning]], Gen. [[Wesley Clark]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], [[Ben and Jerry]], [[Bob Woodward]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[Paul Volcker]], [[David McCullough]], [[Barbara Bush]],[[Paul Rusesabagina]], the real-life hero of ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', biologist [[E.O. Wilson]], and author [[Mitch Albom]].

===Monon Bell Classic===
Voted "Indiana's Best College Sports Rivalry" by viewers of [[ESPN]] in 2005, DePauw University and [[Wabash College]] play each November -- in the last regular season game of the year for both teams -- for the right to keep or reclaim the [[Monon Bell]].  The two teams first met in 1890.  In 1932, the Monon Railroad donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year.  The series is as close as an historic rivalry can be: Wabash leads the all-time series 53-51-9; since the Monon Bell was introduced, DePauw has a 35-34-6 edge.  The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[ESPN2]], and [[HDNet]].  Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 45 locations around the United States for telecast parties.

===Rector Scholarships===
Since 1919, the Rector Scholar Program has recognized DePauw students of exceptional scholarship and character. To be named a Rector Scholar is to join a prestigious tradition more than 4,000 graduates strong. Rector Scholarships are offered to the top academic applicants offered admission to DePauw. A limited number of full tuition Presidential Rector Scholarships are available.

===East College===
A historic structure located at the center of campus, East College is known to many as the architectural symbol of DePauw's tradition of excellence and learning. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 20, 1871. The building hosted commencement exercises in June 1874, and in September 1875 all college classes were moved to the building, according to the book, ''DePauw Through the Years''. But work on East College continued until 1882, when the building's basement was completed. East College was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

===Society of Professional Journalists===
On May 6, 1909, Sigma Delta Chi was founded by a group of DePauw University student journalists.  The organization officially changed its name to the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] in 1988. Today it is the nation's most broad-based journalism organization, encouraging the free practice of journalism and stimulating high standards of ethical behavior. SPJ promotes the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry; works to inspire and educate the next generation of journalists; and protects [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantees of freedom of speech and press. 

DePauw's strong tradition of graduating leaders in the field of journalism continues.  Alumni include: "business journalist of the century" [[Bernard Kilgore]] and his ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' colleague [[Kenneth C. Hogate]]; [[Eugene C. Pulliam]] and [[Eugene S. Pulliam]] of the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' and Central Newspapers chain; [[Donald Maxwell]], former editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''; [[WCVB-TV]]/Boston news anchor [[Heather Unruh]]; [[Robert Giles]], curator of the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at Harvard University and former editor of the ''[[Detroit News]]''; [[John McWethy]], [[ABC News]] national security correspondent; [[James B. Stewart]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning former front page editor of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', best-selling author, and currently editor-at-large of ''[[SmartMoney]]'' magazine; [[Aaron Lucchetti]], staff reporter for the ''Wall Street Journal''; [[Meg Kissinger]], a reporter for the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''; and [[Bret Baier]], White House correspondent for [[FOX News]].

===Music===
The DePauw University School of Music, founded in 1884, is one of the oldest in America.  It presents regular recitals by students and faculty and concerts by visiting artists, most of which are free and open to the public.

DePauw students also organize concerts for the campus community.  Performers in recent years have included [[Dave Matthews]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Guster]].

===Marvin's===
[[Marvin's]] is a small restaurant serving mainly American food such as hamburgers and fries. While not part of DePauw's campus dining options, Marvin's is one of the few restaurants in Greencastle that delivers later than 9:00 PM. The establishment is mostly staffed by DePauw students, and thus has a high turn-over rate. The garlic cheeseburger (commonly referred to by its acronym, GCB) is among the most popular menu items.  The popularity of Marvin's extended outside the Greencastle community after an obscure reference was made to the bistro on the television show ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.

===Boulder Run===
The Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, [[streaking]] from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbian [[Boulder]], located in the center of the campus on East College lawn.  Students today perform the Boulder Run for a variety of reasons, though it was originally performed on the day or night of the first snowfall on campus. Phi Kappa Psi, the Greek house nearest the boulder, is believed to have started the tradition. Recently, students have participated in so-called "Boulder Strolls" -- which involve strategically placed scarves and mittens -- during the cold winter months.  As well, many of the out of shape students or those living far away from campus participate in "Boulder Saunters" which involves a casual walk to the boulder and back.  The men of [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity have become known for these "Boulder Saunters" because of their distance from campus.  The DePauw police are usually tolerant of the tradition, but students have been ticketed when caught.  This tradition was mentioned in ''[[Playboy magazine]]'s'' September 1972 issue.

===Little 5 bike race===
Held in late April every year, DePauw's Little 5 bike race has been a campus tradition since the first race in 1956. The first race was sponsored by Union Board as a fund raiser for the American Cancer Fund. Fourteen teams of male riders from various living units competed. The race has changed some since 1956. Today, there are men's and women's races, and the race has been moved from the streets around East College to the track at Blackstock Stadium.

===Campus golf===
It is not unusual to see students playing a game of [[Campus Golf]] when the weather is nice.  Similar to the more common [[frisbee golf]], players attempt to hit targets ranging from trees to buildings.  However, the game of campus golf requires a golf club and a tennis ball.  Students sometimes get into the spirit of campus golf, donning mis-matching plaid outfits.  Many living units have established "courses" which are played by residents.
