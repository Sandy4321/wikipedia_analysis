'''Nikephoros II Phokas''' or '''Nicephorus II Phocas''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039D><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0392><U+0384> <U+03A6><U+03C9><U+03BA><U+03AC><U+03C2>, ''Nik<U+0113>phoros II Ph<U+014D>kas''), (c. [[912]]&ndash;[[969]]), was a [[Byzantine Emperor]] (963-969) whose brilliant military exploits contributed to the resurgence of Byzantine Empire in the tenth century. 

==Early exploits==
Nikephoros Phokas belonged to a [[Cappadocia]]n family which had produced several distinguished generals, including Nikephoros' father ([[Bardas Phokas the elder|Bardas Phokas]]), uncle (Leo Phokas), and grandfather (Nikephoros Phokas the Elder), who had all served as commanders of the field army (''domestikos t<U+014D>n skhol<U+014D>n''). He was born about 912.

Nikephoros joined the army at an early age.  He was appointed the military governor of the Anatolikon Theme in 945 under Emperor [[Constantine VII]].  When his father, Bardas was wounded in battle in 953, Nikephoros was promoted to supreme commander on the eastern frontier. In the war with the [[Abbasids]] he began with a severe defeat in 954, from which he recovered in the following years by victories in [[Syria]], starting in 957.  From the accession of Emperor [[Romanos II]] in 959, Nikephoros and his younger brother Leo were placed in charge of the eastern and western field armies, respectively. In 960, at the recommendation of the influential minister [[Joseph Bringas]], Nikephoros was entrusted in leading an expedition to [[Crete]], and, storming [[Heraklion|Candia]] after a 9-months' siege, he wrested the whole island from the Muslims in 961. He was denied the usual honor of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], only permitted a mere ovation in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]. (Norwich, p. 961) he returned to the east with a large and well-equipped army. In the campaigns of 962-963 by brilliant strategy he conquered the cities of [[Cilicia]] and advanced into [[Syria]] where he captured [[Aleppo]] in collusion with his nephew [[John I Tzimiskes|John Tzimiskes]], but made no permanent conquests. It was on these campaigns he earned the sobriquet "The Pale Death of the Saracens". During the capture of Aleppo, the Byzantine army took possession of 390,000 [[silver]] [[dinars]], 2,000 [[camels]], and 1,400 [[mules]].

Early in his life Nicephoros had married Stephano.  She had died before he rose to fame, and after her death he took an oath of chastity.  This would create problems latter on.

== Accession to the throne ==
On [[March 15]], [[963]], Emperor Romanos II unexpectedly died at the age of twenty-six. The cause of his death is uncertain. Both contemporary sources and later historians seem to either believe that the young Emperor had exhausted his health with the excesses of his sexual life and his heavy drinking, or suspect Empress [[Theophano (Byzantine Empress)|Theophano]] (c. 941&ndash;after 976), his wife, of poisoning him. Theophano had already at the time gained a reputation as an intelligent and ambitious woman. She would later gain a reputation for ruthlessness in achieving her goals. Romanos had, before his death, already crowned as co-emperors his two sons [[Basil II]] and [[Constantine VIII]]. At the time, however, Basil was five years old and Constantine only three years old, and they were not able to assume the duties that came with their title. Theophano was named regent. 

But Theophano was not allowed to rule alone. Joseph Bringas, the [[eunuch]] palace official who had become Romanos' chief councillor, maintained his position. According to contemporary sources he intended to keep authority in his own hands, rather than those of the young Empress. He also tried to reduce the power of Nikephoros Phokas. The victorious general had been accepted as the actual commander of the army and maintained his strong connections to the aristocracy. Joseph was afraid that Nikephoros could claim the throne with the support of both the army and the aristocracy. Joseph's intrigues during the following months turned both Theophano and Nikephoros against him. Unknown to Joseph, Nikephoros was urged to seize the throne by his nephew [[John Tzimiskes]] and entered into negotiations with Theophano. 

With the help of Theophano and the patriarch, Nikephoros Phokas received supreme command of the eastern forces and, after being proclaimed emperor by them on [[July 2]], [[963]], he marched upon the capital, where meanwhile his partisans had overthrown his enemy Bringas. Thanks to his popularity with the army, Nikephoros II Phokas was crowned emperor by the side of Romanus's young sons on [[August 16]], [[963]], and in spite of the patriarch's opposition married their mother, the regent Theophano.

==Later campaigns==
During his reign Nikephoros II Phokas continued to wage numerous wars. From 964&ndash;966 he  conquered Cilicia and again overran [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria, while the patrician [[Nicetas, patricius|Niketas]] recovered [[Cyprus]]. In 968 he reduced most of the fortresses in Syria, and after the fall of Antioch and Aleppo in 969, which were recaptured by his lieutenants, he secured his conquests by a peace treaty. On his northern frontier he began a war against [[Bulgaria]] in 967, to which the Byzantines had been paying tribute.  Nikephoros revoked the tribute and instigated (with 15,000 pounds of gold) Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] to attack Bulgaria, which he did so effectively, that Nikephoros ended up renewing the alliance with Bulgaria and turning against his own [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan]] ally.

Nikephoros II was less successful in his western wars. After renouncing his payments of tribute to the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]s, he sent an expedition to [[Sicily]] under Niketas (964&ndash;965), but was forced by defeats on land and sea to evacuate that island completely. In 967 he made peace with the Fatimids of [[Kairawan]] and turned to defend himself against their common enemy, [[Otto I]], who had proclaimed himself Western emperor and attacked the Byzantine possessions in [[Italy]]; but after some initial successes his generals were defeated and driven back to the southern coast. The tension between East and West that resulted from Nikephoros' policies can be glimpsed from Bishop [[Liutprand of Cremona]]'s very unflattering description of him and his court in his ''Relatio de legatione Constantinopolitana''.

==Diplomacy==
Liutprand's description of Nikephoros was clouded by the fact that he was ill-treated while on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople.  Nikephoros, a man of war, was not good at diplomacy.  To add insult to injury Pope [[John XIII]] sent a letter to Nikephoras while Liutprand was in Constantinople calling [[Otto I]] emperor of Rome and even more insultingly referring to Nikephoros merely as emperor of the Greeks.  Liutprand failed in his goal of getting an imperial princess for the wife of Otto's young son, the future emperor [[Otto II]].

==Civil administration==
Owing to the care which he lavished upon the proper maintenance of the army, Nikephoros II was compelled to exercise rigid economy in other departments. He retrenched the court largesses and curtailed the immunities of the clergy, and although himself of an [[ascetic]] disposition forbade the foundation of new [[monastery|monasteries]]. By his heavy imposts and the debasement of the [[Byzantine currency|coinage]] he forfeited his popularity with the people and gave rise to riots. Last of all, he was forsaken by his wife, and, in consequence of a conspiracy which she headed with his nephew and her lover [[John I Tzimiskes|John Tzimiskes]], was [[assassination|assassinated]] in his sleeping apartment.  Following his death, the Phokades family broke into insurrection under Nikephoros' nephew [[Bardas Phocas|Bardas Phokas]], but their revolt was promptly subdued. Nikephoros was the author of an extant treatise on military tactics, most famously the ''Praecepta Militaria'' which contains valuable information concerning the art of war in his time, and the less-known ''De velitatione'', which concerned guerilla-like tactics for defence against a superior enemy invasion force. Nikephoros was also a very devout man, and helped his friend, the [[Athanasius the Athonite|monk Athanasios]], found the monastery of [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]].

==Contemporary Descriptions==
In [[Liutprand of Cremona|Bishop Liutprand's]] description of Nikephoros, he contemptuously recalls a man of short stature and the colouring of a "Ethiopian". He was indeed short, stout and "distinctly swarthy" but there are differences concerning the emperor's hair. Bishop Liutprand describes it as being short, whereas [[Leo the Deacon|Leo The Deacon]] says it was black with "tight curls" and "unusually long". Historians believe Leo's description is more accurate.

==Family==
By his first marriage to an unnamed Maleina, Nikephoros II Phokas had a son:
* Bardas Phokas, who died before 969.
By his second marriage to Empress Theophano, Nikephoros II had no children.

==Assassination==
With unrest mounting around him, his second wife [[Theophano]] took as her lover the soldier John Tzimiskes.  Theophano and Tzimiskes would meet in secret and plot Nikephoros' death. Eventually the plot grew to include others. On a blustery night, the conspirators went into the palace dressed as women. Nikephoros was warned that assassins were in the palace, but he paid it no mind. Later, when he was asleep, Tzimiskes and the others sneaked into his bed chamber, alarmed at first to find the bed empty (Nikephoros frequently slept on the floor). Aroused by the noise, Nikephoros rose just when one of the assassins swung his sword in an attempt to decapitate him. It struck him in the face. He was then dragged to the foot of the bed, where Tzimiskes sat. Tzimiskes then shouted accusations to him while ripping off handfuls of his beard. Then, the others had their turn, one knocked his teeth out. His head was cut off and paraded on a spike, while his body was thrown out the window. He was buried at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], while John Tzimiskes became Emperor John I. An inscription carved on the side of his tomb reads: "You conquered all but a woman".

==Descendants==
It is claimed that at some period (perhaps after the assassination of Nikephoros II, or with the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin invasion of Constantinople]]), the [[Phokas]] family moved to the island of [[Paxi]]. Today the name is quite common on the island, yet no one has any dynastic claims.
Furthermore, some historians claim that a family's branch moved to the area of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], building castles and organizing the community. Today the Kavalierakis (Phokas) family is considered to be the descendants of this historic family, which had many heroes during the ages. In Lebanon, the family of Phocas became Nakfour. The Nakfour family originally settled in Hasbaya, a town in south Lebanon, and later on in Deirmimas, also a town in south Lebanon. <ref>Phocas Family : http://members.tripod.com/phocas_family/reputation.htm</ref>

==Modern honors==
On [[November 19]] [[2004]], the [[Hellenic Navy]] named its tenth [[Kortenaer class frigate]] in his honour as [[F-466 Nikiforos Fokas]] (formerly HMNLS Bloys Van Treslong F 824). Also, in the [[Rethymno Prefecture]] in [[Crete]], a municipality ([[Nikiforos Fokas]]) is named after him, as are many streets throughout Greece.
