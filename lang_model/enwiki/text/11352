'''Thierry Daniel Henry''', (born [[17 August]] [[1977]], {{IPA2|tj<U+025B><U+0280>i <U+0251><U+0303><U+0280>i}}) is a [[France|French]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player.

Henry grew up in the tough neighbourhood of [[Les Ulis]], [[Essonne]], where as a youngster he played for an array of local sides and showed great promise as a goal scorer. [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] spotted him in 1990, and signed him up instantly.<ref name="tea" /> Given his professional club d<U+00E9>but in 1994, he stayed at Monaco until 1998, where good form earned him an international call up.

After a slow start in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], Henry has since emerged as Arsenal's top goalscorer in almost every season since he joined the club. He has helped Arsenal win two league titles and three [[F.A. Cup|FA Cup]]s, becoming Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with over 200 goals. With France, he has won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[Euro 2000]]. In recognition of his abilities, Henry has, among others, been nominated twice for the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]],<ref name="wpy">[http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala/0,2418,104452,00.html?articleid=104452 Thierry Henry, the Highbury express train] - fifa.com, [[November 29]], [[2004]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> and has twice received the Barclays Premiership player of the season award.<ref>[http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enNewsLatest&id=466982&type=com.fapl.website.news.NewsItem&categoryCode=NewsSpecialFeatures&breadcrumb=sfsub_breadcrumb Barclaycard Premiership Awards for 03-04], premierleague.com, accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enNewsLatest&id=926315&type=com.fapl.website.news.NewsItem&categoryCode=NewsSpecialFeatures&breadcrumb=sfsub_breadcrumb Barclaycard Premiership Awards for 05-06], premierleague.com, accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He is today regarded by many as one of the best footballers in the world.<ref name="socpro"> </ref><ref name="lacey">Lacey, David, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,4284,1032224,00.html "The best player in the world is wearing Arsenal's colours"], football.guardian.co.uk, [[30 August]] [[2003]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="wc06review">Ingle, Sean, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1817262,00.html "First half good, second half not bad either"], football.guardian.co.uk, [[11 July]] [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="wenger">''China Daily''.[http://english.people.com.cn/200511/07/eng20051107_219446.html Wenger: Henry is the world's greatest], people.com.cn, [[7 November]] [[2005]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Biography==
===Early career===
Henry is of [[Lesser Antilles|Antillean]] heritage; his father, Antoine, is from [[Guadeloupe]], and his mother Maryse is from [[Martinique]]. He grew up in the heavily urbanised Les Ulis, a tough environment for the youngster.<ref name="tea" /> Despite this, the town provided good facilities for footballers. In 1983, the six-year-old Henry showed great potential, something which prompted Claude Chezelle to recruit the youngster at the local club CO Les Ulis. Five years later, Henry played his first game for the club. Henry's father put a lot of pressure on him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. Henry went on to join US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year, his father fell out with the club. He then moved to Viry-Ch<U+00E2>tillon for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza followed Henry to Viry-Ch<U+00E2>tillon, something which would lead to Henry naming Panza as his mentor in the future.

In 1990, AS Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch the 13-year-old play. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6-0. Catalano asked Henry to join Monaco, without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite academy [[Clairefontaine]], but the director there was reluctant to accept Henry due to his poor school results. Despite this, Henry was allowed to complete the course, leading to him joining [[Ars<U+00E9>ne Wenger]]'s AS Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with AS Monaco, and was given his professional d<U+00E9>but in 1995. Wenger put Henry on the left [[Midfielder#Winger|wing]] because he believed that Henry's pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against [[defender (football)#fullback|full-backs]] than [[defender (football)#centre back|centre-backs]]. In his four seasons with Monaco, Henry scored 21 goals in 125 appearances, and helped the club win the [[Ligue 1]] title in 1996-97.<ref name="yah">[http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/fo/profiles/2717.html Thierry HENRY Profile], uk.sports.yahoo.com, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

In June 1997, Henry's good form was rewarded with a call-up to the [[France national under-21 football team|U-20 French national team]], where he played in the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship]] alongside future team-mates [[William Gallas]] and [[David Tr<U+00E9>z<U+00E9>guet]].<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/PrevSquad/0,4355,FRA-U20M-1997-191276-19,00.html FIFA U-20 World Cup Malaysia 1997], fifa.com, accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Within four months, France head coach [[Aim<U+00E9> Jacquet]] called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international d<U+00E9>but on [[October 11]], [[1997]] in a 2-1 win against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACommunityShield/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/08 A striking comparison], thefa.com, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals.<ref name="uni">[http://www.unicef.org/football/index_intro_33822.html 2006 FIFA World Cup - Thierry Henry, top scorer and role model], unicef.org, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He was scheduled to appear in the final <U+2014> where France beat [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3-0 <U+2014> as a substitute, but the [[Misconduct (football)|sending off]] of [[Marcel Desailly]] forced a defensive change instead. On [[Bastille Day]] 1998, he was awarded France's highest decoration, the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]].<ref name="uni" /> 

Henry's good form for Monaco continued during the 1998-99 season, as he helped the club reach the [[UEFA Champions League]] semi-final.<ref name="monacosemifinal">[http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=250617 Soccerbase stats for AS Monaco Semi Final game], soccerbase.com, accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry then left Monaco and moved to [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie A]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] one year before his friend and team-mate David Tr<U+00E9>z<U+00E9>guet in January 1999 for <U+00A3>10.5 million. He played on the wing,<ref name="henryadapt">Clarke, Richard, [http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&article=428852&lid=NewsHeadline&Title=Henry+-+Why+I+know+I+must+adapt+to+our+new+formation "Henry - Why I must adapt to our new formation"], arsenal.com, [[14 November]], [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> but was unable to cope with the Italian defensive discipline of the Serie A. Henry scored just three goals in 16 appearances.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/stars/bios/henry-thierry.html Thierry Henry - France], cbc.ca/sports, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

===Senior career===
Unsettled in [[Italy]], Henry transferred from [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in August 1999 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for <U+00A3>10.5 million, reuniting with his former manager Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger.<ref name="socpro" /> Brought in as a replacement for [[Nicolas Anelka]], he was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move which would pay rich dividends in years to come. Initially, doubts were raised concerning Henry's adapting to the English game when he failed to score in his first ten games,<ref name="tea" /> but he quickly discovered his scoring ability, and ended his first season at Arsenal with a goal tally of 26.<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=13501 Games played by Thierry Henry in 1999-2000], soccerbase.com, accessed [[25 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

The following summer, Henry was a member of France's [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] championship squad, again scoring three goals and finishing as the country's top scorer, including the equalizer against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the semi-final.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/history/season=2000/round=1460/match=65183/index.html France 2-1 Portugal], uefa.com, [[28 June]] [[2000]], accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> France later won the game in [[extra time]] following a converted [[penalty kick]] by team captain [[Zinedine Zidane]]. France went on to defeat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in extra-time in the final, and Henry earned his second major international medal.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/history/season=2000/round=1461/match=65299/index.html France 2-1 Italy], uefa.com, [[2 July]] [[2000]], accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough season as he became the club's top goalscorer.<ref name="socpro" /> In the [[2001-02 in English football|2001-02 season]], Henry netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a [[the double|double]] and his first silverware with the club.<ref name="socpro" /> However, the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the reigning champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in any contest.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/2002.html Korea/Japan 2002], fifaworldcup.com, accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> After France lost their first match in group play, Henry was red carded for a sliding, studs-up challenge in their next match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. France played to a 0-0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final match due to suspension; France lost 2-0 to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. Despite international disappointment, the [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03]] proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 42 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 [[assist (football)|assist]]s, remarkable returns for a striker.<ref name="socpro" /> In so doing, he led Arsenal to another F.A. Cup triumph.

Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's successful [[2003-04 in English football|2003-04 season]]. Together with the likes of [[Dennis Bergkamp]] and [[Robert Pir<U+00E8>s]], Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league campaign unbeaten as Henry collected his second Premiership medal.<ref>Hughes, Ian, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3713537.stm "Arsenal the Invincibles"], news.bbc.co.uk, [[15 May]] [[2004]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> During the summer that followed, Henry returned to form for his country at the [[Confederations Cup 2003|2003 Confederations Cup]]. France, playing without team stalwarts Zidane and [[Patrick Vieira]], won in large part to Henry's outstanding play for which he was named [[Man of the Match]] by [[FIFA]]'s Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.<ref name="conf">[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/index/0,2442,70602,00.html?comp=CC&year=2003&articleid=70602 France retain crown in tournament hit by tragedy], fifa.com, [[4 July]] [[2003]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> In the final, he scored the [[golden goal]] in extra time to lift the host country over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] 1-0.<ref name="conf" /> Henry was awarded both the adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goalscorer with 12 goals.<ref name="conf" />

[[Image:Thierry Henry.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Henry was made club skipper following the departure of fellow Frenchman [[Patrick Vieira]] to [[Juventus]] in 2005.]]
Back in England, Arsenal again failed to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to [[Chelsea F.C.]] in the [[2004-05 in English football|2004-05 season]]. However, the club did win the F.A. Cup, and Henry managed 31 goals in 42 appearances.<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=13501 Games played by Thierry Henry in 2004/2005], soccerbase.com, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> That summer, Henry also played in all of France's [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] matches. France beat [[England national football team|England]] in the group stages but lost to the eventual winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 1-0 in the quarter-finals.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830575.stm France 0-1 Greece], news.bbc.co.uk, [[25 June]] [[2004]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

The departure of compatriot Vieira in the summer of 2005 meant that Henry assumed club captaincy. Along with being chief goal scorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team.<ref name="young">[http://football.guardian.co.uk/championsleague200506/story/0,,1715186,00.html Wenger hopes Henry will stay and usher in new era], Sid Lowe, Guardian Unlimited, [[22 February]], [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> The [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06 season]] proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry but disappointment in the team silverware department.

Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the league title again but some hope was preserved when Arsenal, who hitherto never enjoyed much success in Europe, reached the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. The Gunners eventually lost 1-2 to [[Barcelona F.C.]], and combined with Arsenal's inability to win the Premiership for two consecutive seasons and the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad, there was much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his loyalty and love for the club and subsequently accepted a four-year contract.<ref name="kk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4996270.stm Henry to stay a Gunner until 2010], news.bbc.co.uk, [[19 May]] [[2006]], accessed [[21 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He reaffirmed this months later by saying "If an opportunity like Barcelona comes again, with all my respect for such a club, I will refuse" and that he will stay at Arsenal for life.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=167408 Henry Happy To End Career At Arsenal], goal.com, [[13 November]] [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Arsenal vice-chairman [[David Dein]] later claimed the club had turned down two bids of <U+00A3>50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract.<ref name="zz">''Xinhua News''.

Amidst the summer speculation, Henry was one of the automatic starters in the France squad at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He was played in the unfavoured lone striker role, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, Henry became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including France's goal against returning champion and tournament favourite [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/stats/detail.html?section=ia&sort=GF Statistics], fifaworldcup.yahoo.com, accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5-3) in the final.<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060714/1/8sck.html "France so near yet so far"], fifaworldcup.yahoo.com, [[12 July]] [[2006]], accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry was one of 10 nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament,<ref>[http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/gball/index_archive.html 2006 FIFA World Cup addidas Golden Ball Award], fifaworldcup.yahoo.com, accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane.

Henry's [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07]] season was largely marred by injury, something which was unprecedented in his entire tenure with the Gunners.<ref name="inj">[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=419445&cc=4716 Wenger: Henry staying with Gunners], soccernet.espn.go.com, [[6 April]] [[2007]], accessed [[7 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Although he managed 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, including the winner against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 21 January, Henry's domestic and international season was cut short on [[7 March]] [[2007]].

After the match Wenger announced that Henry had suffered new injuries to his groin and stomach muscles.

==Awards==
Henry has received many plaudits and awards. He was runner-up for the [[2003 FIFA World Player of the Year|2003]] and [[2004 FIFA World Player of the Year|2004]] [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award;<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/galaaward.html?static=15 FIFA World Player Gala], fifa.com, accessed [[23 march]] [[2007]].</ref> in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] titles.<ref>[http://www.givemefootball.com/rolls_of_honour/playersplayerroll.html PFA Players' Player of the Year Roll of Honour], givemefootball.com, accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Furthermore, Henry is the only player ever to have won the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] three times (2003, 2004, 2006),<ref name="kk"> </ref> and has emerged as the French Player of the Year on four occasions, which is an all-time record.

In terms of goalscoring awards, Henry was the [[European Golden Boot]] winner in 2004 and 2005 (albeit sharing it with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]]'s [[Diego Forlan]] in 2005), and is the first ever player to retain the award.<ref>[http://www.pg.com/news/gillette_champions.jhtml Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Thierry Henry Are Introduced As the Faces of the New Gillette Champions Program], pg.com/news, [[4 February]] [[2007]], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry has also been the top goalscorer in the Premiership for four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006).<ref name="yah"> </ref> In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002<U+2013>2006).<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200604/s1623218.htm Thierry Henry: The wizard of Highbury], abc.net.au, [[25 April]] [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry is currently third in the list of all-time English Premiership goal scorers, behind [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Andy Cole]].

[[Image:Van Persie free kick.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry lining up with team-mates (in red, from left) [[Robin Van Persie|Van Persie]], [[Cesc Fabregas|Fabregas]] and [[Kolo Toure|Toure]] before a [[free kick]] is taken. Henry is the first-choice free kick taker for Arsenal.]]
Alhough Henry played up front during his youth,<ref name="tea" /> he spent his time at Juventus playing on the wing. Upon joining Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position.<ref name="henryadapt" />

One of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones.<ref name="finishing">{{cite book | last = Mike Woitalla | first = Claudio Reyna, | title = More Than Goals: The Journey from Backyard Games to World Cup Competition | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = April 2004 | pages = 122 | isbn = 0736051716 }}</ref> This combined with his pace<ref name="hansencolumn" /><ref name="tea" /> means that he can get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. When up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position,<ref name="guidetocoaching">Jacob Daniel, ''The Complete Guide to Coaching Soccer Systems and Tactics'', pg 190, (Reedswain Inc., [[1 March]], [[2004]]).</ref><ref name="wing">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/france/newsid_1905000/1905088.stm Papin: attack at the double], bbc.co.uk, [[12 April]], [[2002]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> something which enables him to contribute heavily in [[assist (football)|assists]]: between 2002-03 and 2004-05, Henry managed almost 50 assists in total; his unselfish play and creativity helped in contributing the large amount of assists. <ref name="recordbreaker" /> Henry is also the first-choice [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]] and [[free kick]] taker for Arsenal, having scored many goals from those positions. Lastly, he is noted for his willingness to defend deep.

During the 2004-05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to [[Formation (football)#4-5-1|4-5-1 formation]].<ref name="fourfiveone">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061030/ai_n16811135 Henry defends Arsenal's pursuit of beautiful game], Chris Hatherall, The London Independent, [[30 October]], [[2006]], accessed [[7 April]], [[2007]]</ref> This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit in to the Arsenal team, as he played many games as a lone striker.<ref name="henryadapt" />

==Off the pitch==
Henry is married to [[English people|English]] [[model (person)|model]] [[Nicole Merry]]. The couple wed in [[July 2003]].<ref name="tea" /> On [[May 27]], [[2005]], he celebrated the birth of his first child, a daughter named Tea Henry. He dedicated his first goal since Tea's birth to her by holding his fingers in a 'T' shape and kissing them after [http://www.arsenal.com/images/pics/report/newcastle14082005_2.jpg scoring against Newcastle United].<ref name="fq">[http://www.fqmagazine.co.uk/Thierry_Henry_article.aspx FAMOUS FATHERS: THIERRY HENRY], fqmagazine.co.uk, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He lives with his family in [[Hampstead]], [[North London]].<ref name="tea" />

Henry has been subject to several incidences of racism in the past. Most notably, during a training session with the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] in 2004,<ref name="aragones">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4055395.stm "Aragones fined for Henry remarks"] - news.bbc.co.uk, [[March 1]], [[2005]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="aragones2">{{cite book | last = Witzig | first = Richard | title = The Global Art of Soccer | publisher = CusiBoy Publishing | date = May 2006 | pages = 44 | isbn = 0977668800 }}</ref> a Spanish TV crew caught [[Luis Aragon<U+00E9>s|Aragon<U+00E9>s]] motivating Henry's then Arsenal teammate [[Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Reyes]] and referring to Henry as "black shit".<ref name="fq"> </ref> The incident caused an uproar in the British media with calls for Aragon<U+00E9>s to be sacked. When Spain played England in a [[friendly match]] at the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u Stadium|Bernab<U+00E9>u]] later that year, the crowd was hostile. Whenever black English players touched the ball, large sections of the Spanish crowd began to make "monkey" chants.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4018421.stm "Fifa probes Spanish racist chants"], news.bbc.co.uk, [[18 November]] [[2004]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>Kelso, Paul and Tremlett, Giles, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,2763,1354973,00.html "Spanish apologise for soccer racism"], guardian.co.uk, [[19 November]] [[2004]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> The [[Real Federaci<U+00F3>n Espa<U+00F1>ola de F<U+00FA>tbol|Spanish football federation]] eventually fined the coach <U+20AC>3,000.<ref name="aragones"> </ref> Henry and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] started the [[Stand Up Speak Up]] campaign against football racism as a result of the incident.<ref name="standup">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4246553.stm "Caborn welcomes anti-racism stand"], news.bbc.co.uk, [[9 February]] [[2005]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

Henry is also a member of the [[UNICEF]]-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers, appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 World Cups; in these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.<ref name="uni"> </ref>

In 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth most commercially marketable footballer in the world,<ref name="commercialvaluelist">[http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_16465.shtml Ronaldinho's brand worth more than Beckham's], Reuters, [[30 May]], [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]], [[2007]].</ref> as well as being the eighth richest Premiership player, with <U+00A3>21 million.<ref name="richlist">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=420790&in_page_id=1779 The Rich List top ten...], the Daily Mail, [[06 December]], [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]], [[2007]].</ref> In terms of past endorsements, Henry featured in the [[Renault]] [[Clio]] adverts during where he made popular the word ''va-va-voom'' meaning life or passion. The word was subsequently added to the Oxford Concise English [[Dictionary]].<ref name="vavavoom">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/uk/newsid_3876000/3876685.stm Va-va-voom is in the dictionary], news.bbc.co.uk, [[July 8]] [[2004]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He was also a part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Joga Bonito]] campaign, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Play beautifully".<ref name="nikecampaign">Stevenson, Seth, [http://www.slate.com/id/2139940/ Keep Soccer Beautiful!], slate.com, [[April 17]] [[2006]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> His deal with Nike ended after the 2006 World Cup, when he signed a deal with [[Reebok]] to appear in their "I Am What I Am" campaign.<ref name="reebok">Bond, David, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=D&xml=/sport/2006/04/12/sfnar312.xml "Henry drops bombshell by moving to Reebok"], telegraph.co.uk, [[12 April]] [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref>
