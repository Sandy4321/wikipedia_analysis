''' John North Birch''' was born [[Nuneaton]], Warwickshire, England in 1867 and trained as an engineer. He constructed his own push bikes and on moving to [[New Zealand]], automobiles.

==Early life an career==
Birch was one of eleven children and eldest son of a [[Foleshill]] ribbon manufacturer. He completed an engineering apprenticeship with a Coventry engineering firm who produced steam engines. In about about 1884 he joined cycle manufacturers [[John Kemp Starley|Starley Brothers]] of Coventry. The following year he moved to [[Sheffield]] and worked in a railway carriage factory. From there he worked in a steel foundry before returning to his home in Nuneaton in 1888. Birch married Hannah Taylor of [[Exhall]], near Coventry in 1892. They had three daughters.<ref>http://www.nuneatonlocalhistorygroup.org.uk/index.php/local-history/town-centre/11-the-motorcycle-manufacturers-of-nuneaton</ref>

==George Eliot motor cycles==
Before Birch migrated to New Zealand in 1905, he built a push bike in about 1888 which he named the Foleshill. The Foleshill had an oil retaining hub. An invention of his which is universally used in cycle production. The Foleshill cycle was very popular and included among its purchasers were Dennis brothers of Guildford. Moving his business to Princes Street, Nuneaton  in 1898, Birch renamed his bike the [[George Eliot]] after the author of the same name. Here he employed some twenty people including his brothers Harold and Fred. 

About 1900 Birch built his first motorcycle, which he also named the George Eliot. The bike had three innovations: the engine was positioned where the pedals are on a normal bicycle, the engine was built into the frame, and it had a low tension magneto superseding the battery type ignition. In 1903 the bike was awarded a first class diploma for reliability 1903. In July 1904 Birch and F.W.Marston rode one from John-o-Groats to Lands End.

Birch sold the right to construct these bikes to [[Bradbury Motor Cycles]] in 1903. Bradbury also produced these bikes under the Peerless brand. His brother also continued to manufacture them until 1925 under the name George Eliot.<ref>The British Motorcycle Directory - Over 1,100 Marques from 1888, Roy Bacon and Ken Hallworth, The Crowood Press, 2004, ISBN 1 86126 674 X</ref> In 1905 Birch left his family in England, intending to return within 5 years. He never did.

==Marlborough Engineering Limited==
In 1908 he worked with Miles Cheesman at Birch and Co, [[Blenheim, New Zealand]]. He started his own firm Marlborough Engineering Limited in 1912. There he developed and constructed a motor car, which he named Marlborough after the province, between 1912 and 1919.<ref>http://exhibits1.museums.org.nz/collection7VCC/exhibit1/e10001a.htm</ref><ref>http://exhibits1.museums.org.nz/collection7VCC/exhibit1/vexmain1.htm</ref> It was a touring car, had a four-cylinder engine with a four-inch bore and seven-inch stroke, five main bearings, and full force feed lubrication. Valves were two and a half inches across the face, cam lift was half an inch. The Marlborough was thought to be capable of over a 100 miles an hour on a good straight road with a good set of tyres. In the same period he also built several marine and stationary engines, plus the huge marine engine which ended up in a Mr McManaway's launch the ''Marlborough''. James Fuller of Seddon bought the first Marlborough car, which lasted up to the 1940s when it was broken up for scrap. Only the motor remained and this is now held in a Blenheim museum.

==Carlton==
After making his first car Birch moved in 1922 to Gisborne where working for Collett Motors as a Foreman, he built three more. These were renamed Carlton and built after 1922. Both the second and third cars were extensively damaged by fire, but the second car was redesigned and sold as a three-ton truck and the third car was used as spares by the owner of the truck. In the 1950s the truck, was recovered from a swamp and rebuilt as a car by the Gisborne Vintage Car Club. Birch's forth and final car, the baby Carlton, was completed about 1928. The great depression ended his Carlton Car Company and he built no more cars after that.

Birch died at Gisborne on 19 February 1945.
