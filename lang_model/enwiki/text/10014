The '''Eastern Catholic Churches''' are autonomous (in Latin, ''sui iuris'') [[particular Church]]es in [[full communion|full]] [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Bishop of Rome]] <U+2014> the [[Pope]]. They preserve the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions of the various [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian Churches]] with which they are associated, and between which doctrinal differences exist, in particular between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Eastern Catholics recognize that their faith is not at variance with that of other Eastern Catholics and of [[Latin Rite|Latin]] Catholics, whom they see as equal members of the same Catholic Church. In particular, they recognize the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|central role]] of the Bishop of Rome within the [[College of Bishops]]. They hold distinct forms (different both from the Latin forms and from those of other Eastern Catholic Churches) of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical worship]], sacramental<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'', 12-18]</ref> and canonical discipline, terminology, traditional prayers and practices of piety. They preserve the special emphases and illuminations that [[Eastern Christianity]] has developed over the centuries, some of which [[Pope John Paul II]] illustrated in his apostolic letter ''Orientale Lumen'' of [[2 May]] [[1995]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_02051995_orientale-lumen_en.html ''Orientale lumen'',  5-8]</ref> 

Most Eastern Catholic Churches have counterparts in other Eastern Churches, whether [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], from whom they are separated by a number of theological concerns, or the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Churches, from whom they are separated primarily by differences in understanding of the role of the Bishop of Rome within the College of Bishops.

Eastern Catholics are in full communion with the Roman Pontiff, and in this sense are members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]],<ref>Examples of the use of "Roman Catholic Church" by Popes, even when not addressing members of non-Catholic Churches, are the encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis'',] and the talk by [[Pope John Paul II]] at the general audience of [[26 June]] [[1985]] ([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_19850626_it.html actual text in Italian, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_19850626_sp.html Spanish translation]) in which he treated "Roman Catholic Church " as synonymous with "Catholic Church". The term "Roman Catholic Church" is repeatedly used to refer to the whole Church in communion with the see of Rome, including Eastern Catholics, in official documents concerning dialogue between the Church as a whole (not just the Western part) and groups outside her fold. Examples of such documents can be found at the links on the Vatican website under the heading [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/index.htm Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]. The [[Holy See]] never uses "Roman Catholic Church" to refer only to the Western or Latin Church. In the [[First Vatican Council]]'s [http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/V1.HTM#4 Dogmatic Constitution ''de fide catholica''], the phrase ''the Holy, Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church'' (in Latin, ''Sancta catholica apostolica Romana ecclesia'') also refers to something other than the Latin-Rite or Western Church.</ref> but they are not "Roman Catholics" in the narrower senses of that term, since they are not members of the local particular Church of Rome nor of the [[Latin Rite|Western or Latin Church]], which uses the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy and the other [[Latin liturgical rites]].<ref>Some Eastern Catholics deny that they are "Roman Catholics": "We're Byzantine rite, which is Catholic, but not Roman Catholic" (http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070104/News04/701040473 Ukrainian church pastor honored]). Others "are proud to call themselves Roman Catholics" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09683c.htm ''Maronites''] in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]).</ref> 

The Eastern Catholic Churches were located historically in [[Eastern Europe]], the Asian [[Middle East]], [[Northern Africa]] and [[India]], but are now, because of migration, found also in Western [[Europe]], the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] to the extent of forming full-scale ecclesiastical structures such as [[Eparchy#Church hierarchy|eparchies]], alongside the Latin dioceses. One country, [[Eritrea]], has only an [[Ethiopic Catholic Church|Eastern Catholic]] hierarchy, with no Latin structure.

The terms ''Byzantine Catholics'' and ''Greek Catholic'' are used of those who belong to Churches that use the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine liturgical rite]]. The terms ''Oriental Catholic'' and ''Eastern Catholic'' include these, but are broader, since they also cover Catholics who follow the Alexandrian, Antiochian, Armenian and Chaldean liturgical traditions.

==Juridical status==
The term ''Eastern Catholic Churches'' refers to 22 of the 23 autonomous particular Churches in communion with the Bishop of Rome. These Churches follow different Eastern Christian liturgical traditions: [[Alexandrian Rite|Alexandrian]], [[Antiochene Rite|Antiochian]], [[Armenian Rite|Armenian]], [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] and [[East Syrian Rite|Chaldean]] <ref>The New York Times Guide To Essential Knowledge: A Desk Reference for the Curious Mind - Page 499</ref>. Canonically, each Eastern Catholic Church is ''[[sui iuris]]'' or autonomous with respect to other Catholic Churches, whether Eastern or Latin, though all accept the spiritual and juridical authority of the Pope. Thus a Maronite Catholic is normally subject only to a Maronite bishop, not, for example to a Ukrainian or Latin Catholic bishop. However, if in a country the members of some particular Church are so few that no hierarchy of their own has been established there, their spiritual care is entrusted to a bishop of another ritual Church. This holds also for Latin Catholics: in [[Eritrea]], they are placed in the care of bishops of the [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopic Catholic Church]]. Theologically, all the particular Churches can be viewed as "sister Churches".<ref>"Note on the Expression 'sister Churches'", Section 11. Available online at: http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000630_chiese-sorelle_en.html</ref> According to the [[Second Vatican Council]] these Eastern Churches, along with the larger [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]] share "equal dignity, so that none of them is superior to the others as regards rite and they enjoy the same rights and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the Gospel to the whole world (cf. Mark 16:15) under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html Decree on the Eastern Catholic Churches], Section 3</ref>

The Eastern Catholic Churches are in [[full communion|full]] [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of faith and of acceptance of authority of the See of Rome, but retain their distinctive [[liturgy|liturgical rites]], laws and customs, traditional devotions and have their own theological emphases. Terminology may vary: for instance, ''diocese'' and ''eparchy'', ''vicar general'' and ''[[protosyncellus]]'', ''[[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]'' and ''[[chrismation]]'' are respectively Western and Eastern terms for the same realities. The sacraments ("mysteries") of baptism and chrismation are generally administered, according to the ancient tradition of the Church, one immediately after the other. Infants who are baptized and chrismated are also given the [[Eucharist]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church] Section 1233</ref>

==Terminology==

===The term "rite"===
The ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'' defines the terms  ''autonomous Church'' and ''rite'': "A group of Christian faithful linked in accordance with the law by a hierarchy and expressly or tacitly recognized by the supreme authority of the Church as autonomous is in this Code called an autonomous Church" (canon 27);<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PR.HTM Canon 27 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches''] In the original [[Latin language|Latin]] the word for autonomous is "sui iuris": ''Coetus christifidelium hierarchia ad normam iuris iunctus, quem ut sui iuris expresse vel tacite agnoscit suprema Ecclesiae auctoritas, vocatur in hoc Codice Ecclesia sui iuris''</ref> and "1. A rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each autonomous [sui iuris] Church. 2. The rites treated in this code, unless otherwise stated, are those which arise from the Alexandrian, Antiochene, Armenian, Chaldean and Constantinopolitan traditions" (canon 28)<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PS.HTM Canon 28 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'']</ref> In the past, the Eastern Catholic Churches have sometimes been referred to as ''"Eastern Rites."'' The Second Vatican Council spoke of them as "particular Churches or rites."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html  Second Vatican Council<U+2019>s Decree on the Catholic Eastern Churches ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'', section 2]</ref> The older Latin Code of Canon Law, when speaking of the Eastern Churches, uses the terms "ritual Church"or "ritual Church sui iuris" (canons 111 and 112), and also speaks of "a subject of an Eastern rite"(canon 1015 <U+00A7>2), "Ordinaries of another rite" (canon 450 <U+00A7>1), "the faithful of a specific rite" (canon 476), etc. The use of the term "rite" to refer to the Eastern Churches, and the Western, has now become rare, however. A publication of the National Catholic Council of Catholic Bishops explains: "We have been accustomed to speaking of the Latin (Roman or Western) Rite or the Eastern Rites to designate these different Churches. However, the Church's contemporary legislation as contained in the ''Code of Canon Law'' and the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'' makes it clear that we ought to speak, not of rites, but of Churches. Canon 112 of the Code of Canon Law uses the phrase 'autonomous ritual Churches' to designate the various Churches." <ref>''Eastern Catholics in the United States of America'' available from the NCCB at: http://www.usccbpublishing.org/productdetails.cfm?sku=5-287&disccode=sum0625</ref> Another publication explains: "The Eastern Churches are still mistakenly called 'Eastern-rite' Churches, a reference to their various liturgical histories. They are most properly called Eastern Churches, or Eastern Catholic Churches."<ref> [http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac0106.asp ''Catholic Update: What All Catholics Should Know About Eastern Catholic Churches'']</ref>

Care must indeed be taken to distinguish differing meanings of the word ''"rite."'' Apart from its reference to the patrimony of a particular Church, the word has been and sometimes, even if rarely, is still used of the particular Church itself. Thus, the term ''Latin rite'' can refer either to the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]] or to one or more of the [[Latin liturgical rites]], which include the majority [[Roman Rite]], but also the [[Ambrosian Rite]], the [[Mozarabic Rite]], and others.

===The term "Uniate"===<!-- This section is linked from [[Europe]] -->
The term ''Uniat'' or ''Uniate'' is applied to Eastern Catholics primarily by Eastern Orthodox, who sometimes give it [[pejorative]] overtones.<ref>See [http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=199&SID=3 "The Word 'Uniate'"] from www.oca.org</ref> The term was also historically used, though less frequently, by Latin and Eastern Catholics, especially prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]]. <ref> The term was used by the [[Holy See]] (e.g., in the ''[[Ex Quo]]'' of [[Pope Benedict XIV]]). Available online at: http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0247m.htm.  The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1909) consistently used the term "Uniat" to refer to Eastern Catholics, stating: "The ''Uniat Church'' is therefore really synonymous with ''Eastern Churches united to Rome'', and ''Uniats'' is synonymous with ''Eastern Christians united with Rome''. Available online at: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06752a.htm</ref>  Official Catholic documents no longer use the term, due to its perceived negative overtones.<ref>"It should be mentioned that in the past the Eastern Catholic churches were often referred to as 'Uniate' churches. Since the term is now considered derogatory, it is no longer used." [http://www.cnewa.org/ecc-bodypg.aspx?eccpageID=54 "The Catholic Eastern Churches"] from the website of CNEWA: A Papal Agency for Humanitarian and Pastoral Support</ref> According to Eastern Orthodox Professor John Erickson of St Vladimir's Theological Seminary, "The term 'uniate' itself, once used with pride in the Roman communion, had long since come to be considered as pejorative. 'Eastern Rite Catholic' also was no longer in vogue because it might suggest that the Catholics in question differed from Latins only in the externals of worship. The Second Vatican Council affirmed rather that Eastern Catholics constituted churches, whose vocation was to provide a bridge to the separated churches of the East<U+2026>"<ref><U+201D>Orthodoxy and Parallel Monologues<U+201D> in the March 2002 issue of [http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0203/public.html/ ''First Things'']</ref>

==Eastern and Western (Latin) Catholics==
[[Image:Ukrainian Catholic domes.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The domes of a Ukrainian Catholic parish in Simpson, Pennsylvania]]
Most Eastern Catholic Churches arose when a group within an ancient Christian Church that was in disagreement with the see of Rome chose to enter into [[full communion]] with that see. However, the [[Maronite Church]] claims never to have been separated from Rome, and has no counterpart Orthodox Church out of [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the Pope. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to it as a "Uniate" Church. The [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church]] has also never been out of communion with Rome, but, unlike the Maronite Church, it uses the same [[Byzantine Rite|liturgical rite]] as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. The [[Syro-Malabar Church]], based in [[Kerala]], [[India]], also claims never to have been knowingly out of communion with Rome. Other Christians of Kerala, who were originally of the same East-Syrian tradition, passed instead to the West-Syrian tradition and now form part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].

The canon law that the Eastern Catholic Churches have in common has been codified in the 1990 ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches''. Within the [[Roman Curia]], the [[dicastery]] that works with the Eastern Catholic Churches is the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]], which, by law, includes as members all Eastern Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops.

All Catholics are subject to the [[bishop]] of the eparchy or diocese (the local particular Church) to which they belong. They are also subject directly to the Pope, as is stated in canon 43 of the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'' and canon 331 of the ''[[Code of Canon Law]]''. Most, but not all, Eastern Catholics are also directly subject to a [[patriarch]], [[major archbishop]], or [[metropolitan archbishop|metropolitan]] who has authority for all the bishops and the other faithful of his Rite or autonomous [[particular Church]] (canons 56 and 151 of the ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'').

== Eastern Patriarchs and Major Archbishoprics == 

The Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops derive their titles from the sees of [[Alexandria]] (Copts), [[Antioch]] (Syrians, Melkites, Maronites), [[Babylonia]] (Chaldaeans), [[Cilicia]] (Armenians), [[Kiev|Kyiv]]-[[Halych|Haly<U+010D>]] (Ukrainians), [[Ernakulam]]-[[Angamaly]] (Syro-Malabars), [[Trivandrum]] ([[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Syro-Malankaras]]), and [[F<U+0103>g<U+0103>ra<U+015F>]]-[[Alba Iulia]] ([[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanians]]).

== Historical background ==
[[Image:Eastern Catholic cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Eastern Catholic cemetery in northeastern Pennsylvania, where many Eastern Catholics settled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries]]
Communion between Christian Churches has been broken over matters of faith, when each side accused the other of [[heresy]] or departure from the true faith ([[orthodoxy]]). Communion has been broken also because of disputes that do not involve matters of faith, as when there is disagreement about questions of authority or the legitimacy of the election of a particular bishop. In these latter cases, each side accuses the other of [[Schism (religion)|schism]], but not of heresy.

Major breaches of communion:

#The Churches that accepted the teaching of the 431 [[Council of Ephesus]], which condemned the views of [[Nestorius]], classified those who rejected the Council's teaching as heretics. Those who accepted it lived mostly in the Roman Empire and classified themselves as orthodox; they considered the others, who lived mainly under Persian rule, as [[Nestorian]] heretics. These had a period of great expansion in Asia. Monuments of their presence still exist in China. Now they are relatively few in numbers and are divided into three Churches, of which the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldaean Church]], which is in communion with Rome, is the most numerous, while the others have recently split between the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Ancient Church of the East]].
#Those who accepted the 451 [[Council of Chalcedon]] similarly classified those who rejected it as [[Monophysite]] heretics. The Churches that refused to accept the Council considered instead that it was they who were orthodox. The six present-day Churches that continue their tradition reject the description ''Monophysite'', preferring instead ''[[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]]''. They are often called, in English, ''[[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es'', to distinguish them from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. This distinction, by which the words ''oriental'' and ''eastern'', words that in themselves have exactly the same meaning, are used as labels for two different realities, is impossible in most other languages and is not universally accepted even in English. These churches are also referred to as ''pre-Chalcedonian'' or, now more rarely, as ''non-Chalcedonian'' or ''anti-Chalcedonian''. In languages other than English, other means are used to distinguish the two families of Churches. Some reserve the term "Orthodox" for those that are here called "Eastern Orthodox" Churches, but members of what are then called "Oriental/Eastern Orthodox" Churches consider this unfair.
#The [[East-West Schism]] came about in a context of cultural differences between the Greek-speaking East and the Latin-speaking West and of rivalry between the Churches in [[Rome]], which claimed a primacy not merely of honour but also of authority, and in [[Constantinople]], which claimed parity with that in Rome.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/balsamon-cpl.html Theodore Balsamon on the Powers of the Patriarch of Constantinople]</ref> The rivalry and lack of comprehension gave rise to controversies, some of which appear already in the acts of the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692. At the [[Council of Florence]] (1431-1445), these controversies about Western theological elaborations and usages were identified as, chiefly, the insertion of the [[Filioque clause]] in the [[Nicene Creed]], the use of unleavened bread for the [[Eucharist]], [[purgatory]], and the authority of the Pope.<ref>"In the third sitting of the Council, Julian, after mutual congratulations, showed that the principal points of dispute between the Greeks and Latins were in the doctrine (a) on the procession of the Holy Ghost, (b) on azymes in the Eucharist, (c) on purgatory, and (d) on the Papal supremacy" [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/death/stmark_purg.aspx The Orthodox Response to the Latin Doctrine of Purgatory] from the 1400s.</ref>. The schism is conventionally dated to 1054, when the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] and the Papal Legate [[Humbert of Mourmoutiers]] issued mutual [[excommunication]]s that have since been revoked. In spite of that event, both Churches continued for many years to maintain friendly relations and seemed to be unaware of any formal or final rupture.<ref>[http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/milton1_19.html Milton V. Anastos, ''Constantinople and Rome'']</ref> However, estrangement continued to grow. In 1190 [[Theodore Balsamon]], Patriarch of Antioch, declared that "no [[Latin Rite|Latin]] should be given communion unless he first declares that he will abstain from the doctrines and customs that separate him from us";<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom]</ref> and the sack of [[Constantinople]] in 1204 by the participants in the so-called [[Fourth Crusade]] was seen as the West's ultimate outrage. By then, each side considered that the other no longer belonged to the Church that was orthodox and catholic. But with the passage of centuries, it became customary to refer to the Eastern side as the Orthodox Church and the Western as the Catholic Church, without either side thereby renouncing its claim to be the truly orthodox or the truly catholic Church. The Churches that sided with Constantinople are known collectively as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es.

In each Church whose communion with the Church of Rome was broken by these three divisions, there arose, at various times, a group that considered it important to restore that communion. The see of Rome accepted them as they were: there was no question of requiring them to adopt the customs of the Latin Church.

At a meeting in Balamand, Lebanon in June 1993, the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church declared that these initiatives that "led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with their Mother Churches of the East ... took place not without the interference of extra-ecclesial interests" (section 8 of the [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/balamand_txt.aspx document]); and that what has been called "[[uniatism]]" "can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking" (section 12).

At the same time, the Commission stated:
* 3) Concerning the Eastern Catholic Churches, it is clear that they, as part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful.
* 16) The Oriental Catholic Churches who have desired to re-establish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the rights and obligations which are connected with this communion.

As remarked earlier, the identity of the Maronite Church and of the Syro-Malabar Church is due to no such division within an Eastern Church.

Eastern Catholic Churches make up 2% of the membership of the Catholic Church, and less than 10% of all Eastern Christians.

'''Note''': [[Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics]] are not recognized as a [[particular Church]] (cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PR.HTM canon 27] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches).

As is obvious from the above list, an individual autonomous particular Church may have distinct jurisdictions (local particular Churches) in several countries.

The Ruthenian Catholic Church is organized in an exceptional way because of a constituent metropolia, the [[Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh]], which is referred to also, but not officially, as the Byzantine Catholic Church in America. Canon law treats it as if it held the rank of an autonomous ("sui iuris") metropolitan particular Church  because of the circumstances surrounding its 1969 erection as an ecclesiastical province.<br>

At that time, conditions in the [[Rusyn]] homeland, known as Carpatho-Rus, admitted no other solution because the Byzantine Catholic Church had been forcibly suppressed by the Soviet authorities. When Communist rule ended, the Eparchy of Mukacheve (founded in 1771) re-emerged.<br> 

It has some 320,000 adherents, greater than the number in the Pittsburgh metropolia. In addition, an apostolic exarchate established in 1996 for Catholics of Byzantine rite in the Czech Republic is classed as another part of the Ruthenian Catholic Church. 

On an [http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/catholic_rites_and_churches.htm EWTN website] the Apostolic Exarchate for Byzantine-rite Catholics in the Czech Republic is mentioned in a list of Eastern Churches, of which all the rest are autonomous particular Churches. This appears to be a mistake, since recognition within the Catholic Church of the autonomous status of a particular Church can only be granted by the Holy See (cf. canon 27 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches), which instead classifies this Church as one of the constituent local particular Churches of the autonomous (''sui iuris'') Ruthenian Catholic Church.

===Byzantine-rite Catholics of Georgian nationality or descent===
{{Main|Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics}}

Some have treated Byzantine-rite Catholics within the Georgian Catholic Church as a separate particular Church with a reunion date of either 1861 or 1917. Stating that, in the 1930s, they had an Exarch, two interrelated websites,[3] [4] which misname him as Fr. Shio Batmanishviii, thus implicitly claim that Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics had by then been formed into an apostolic exarchate.

The book, The Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Union Empire from Lenin through Stalin, by Father Christopher Zugger (Syracuse University Press 2001) states: "By 1936, the Byzantine Catholic Church of Georgia had two communities, served by a bishop and four priests, with 8,000 believers", and identifies the bishop as Shio Batmalashvili (pages 224 and following).

These sources thus claim that a Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholic Church existed, even if only as a local particular Church. However, since the establishment of a new hierarchical jurisdiction must be published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, and no mention of the erection of such a jurisdiction for Byzantine Georgian Catholics exists in that official gazette of the Holy See, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Until 1994, the annual publication Catholic Almanac used to go further, listing "Georgian" among the Byzantine Rites or autonomous particular Churches. Until corrected in 1995, it appears to have been making a mistake similar to that which the equally unofficial EWTN site is now making about the Czech Byzantine-rite Catholics.

Since the Annuario Pontificio of the 1930s does not mention Shio Batmalashvili, he may have been one of the priests secretly ordained bishops of titular sees for the service of the Church in the Soviet Union by French Jesuit Bishop Michel d'Herbigny, who was head of the Pontifical Commission "Pro Russia" from 1925 to 1934. Rather than exarch of a Georgian Byzantine exarchy, he will then have been apostolic administrator of the whole of the Latin diocese of Tiraspol, to which Georgian Catholics even of Byzantine rite belonged (cf. Oriente Cattolico (1974), page 194).

In the circumstances then prevailing, the Holy See would have been incapable of and would not even have thought of setting up new dioceses or exarchates within the Soviet Union, especially not of Byzantine rite, since Byzantine-rite Catholics were being forced to become officially members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  

There was also a short-lived Byzantine Catholic movement among the ethnic Estonians in the Orthodox Church in Estonia during the inter-war period of the twentieth century, consisting of two to three parishes.  This group was liquidated by the Soviet regime and is now extinct.

==Biritual faculties==
While "clerics and members of institutes of consecrated life are bound to observe their own rite faithfully,"<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P14.HTM canon 40] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches</ref> priests are occasionally given permission to celebrate the liturgy of a rite other than the priest's own rite, by what is known as a grant of "biritual faculties". The reason for this permission is usually the service of Catholics who have no priest of their own rite. Thus priests of the [[Syro-Malabar Church]] working as missionaries in areas of India in which there were no structures of their own Church, were authorized, while remaining priests of the Syro-Malabar Church, to use the Roman Rite in those areas, and Latin-Rite priests are, after due preparation, given permission to use an Eastern rite for the service of members of an Eastern Catholic Church living in a country in which there are no priests of their own particular Church.

The Pope, to whose pastoral guidance the individual Churches both Eastern and Western are all equally entrusted,<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'', 3]</ref> can celebrate the liturgy according to any rite. However, because he is Bishop of Rome, he normally uses the [[Roman Rite]].

For a just cause (especially in order to foster Christian love and manifest the unity between the different particular Churches) and with the permission of the local bishop, priests of different autonomous ritual Churches may concelebrate, using strictly, without admixture, the rite of the principal celebrant; it is preferable that each wears the vestments of his own rite.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PJH.HTM#4 canon 701] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. This imperfect English translation of the Code omits the word "optabiliter" of the original text.</ref> For this no indult of biritualism is required.

Biritual faculties may concern not only clergy but also religious, enabling them to become members of an institute of an autonomous Church other than their own.<ref>canons [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PCJ.HTM 451] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PED.HTM 517 <U+00A7>2] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches</ref>

The laity are obliged to foster an understanding and appreciation of their own rite, and are held to observe it everywhere unless something is excepted by the law.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P14.HTM canon 40 <U+00A7>3] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. The defective translation in the source gives "is excused" instead of "is excepted" as a translation of "excipitur".</ref> This does not forbid occasional or even, for a just cause, habitual participation in the liturgy of a different autonomous Church, Western or Eastern. The obligation of assisting at the Eucharist or, for members of some Eastern Churches, at Vespers, is satisfied wherever the liturgy is celebrated in a Catholic rite.<ref>http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4L.HTM Can. 1248 <U+00A7>1] of the Code of Canon Law; canons [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_POH.HTM 881] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_POJ.HTM 883] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches</ref>

== Clerical celibacy ==
Eastern and Western Christian churches have different traditions concerning [[clerical celibacy]]. These differences and the resulting controversies have played a role in the relationship between the two groups in some Western countries.

Most Eastern Churches distinguish between "monastic" and "non-monastic" clergy. Monastics do not necessarily live as monks or in monasteries, but have spent at least part of their period of training in such a context. Their monastic vows include a vow of celibate chastity.

Bishops are normally selected from the monastic clergy, and in most Eastern Churches a large percentage of priests and deacons also are celibate, while a portion of the clergy (typically, parish priests) may be married. If a future priest or deacon is to be married, his marriage must take place before ordination to the diaconate. While in some countries the marriage continues usually to be arranged by the families, cultural changes sometimes make it difficult for such seminarians to find women prepared to be the wife of a priest, necessitating a hiatus in the seminarians' studies.

In countries where Eastern traditions prevail among Christians, a married clergy caused little controversy; but it aroused opposition in other countries to which Eastern Catholics immigrated. In response to requests from the Latin bishops of those countries, the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] set out rules in a letter of [[2 May]] [[1890]] to the Archbishop of Paris,<ref>''Acta Sanctae Sedis'', vol. 1891/92, p.390</ref> which the Congregation applied on [[1 May]] [[1897]] to the [[United States]],<ref>''Collectanea'' No. 1966</ref> stating that only celibates or widowed priests coming without their children should be permitted in the United States. This rule was restated with special reference to Catholics of [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Rite]] by the [[1 March]] [[1929]] decree ''Cum data fuerit'', which was renewed for a further ten years in 1939. Dissatisfaction by many Ruthenian Catholics in the United States gave rise to the [[American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese]].

Some Eastern Catholic Churches have decided to adopt mandatory clerical celibacy, as in the Latin Church. They include the [[Syriac Catholic Church]], the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and the [[Ethiopic Catholic Church]].
