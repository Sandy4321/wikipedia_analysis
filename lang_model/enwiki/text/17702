The Texas Tech Red Raiders came into the game ranked number 10 in the nation, with high hopes of not only beating Texas but possibly even winning out the season and playing for a national championship themselves.

Prior to the game, some commentators had postulated that the 2005 USC team was one of the best college football teams of all time, if not the best. ESPN analysts were virtually unanimous in their declaration of the 2005 USC Trojans as the best offense in the history of college football, despite the fact that they did not lead the nation in points scored (Texas did).<ref name="mocking"/> ESPN analysts [[Mark May]] and [[Kirk Herbstreit]] declared, before the 2005 Rose Bowl had even been played, that the 2005 USC Trojans were the 2nd best college football team of the past 50 years (May placed them behind only [[1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers]]; Herbstreit behind only [[2001 Miami Hurricanes football team|2001 Miami Hurricanes]]). This led to Texas fans at the Rose Bowl mockingly chanting "Best...Team...Ever" during the post-game celebration.<ref name="mocking">{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2006/01/05/chanting_like_champs.html | title=Chanting like champs | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | date=[[January 5]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref>

Texas was given a pre-season #2 ranking (behind defending National Champions [[University of Southern California]]) in the [[Associated Press Poll]] and ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Coaches Poll]] pre-season listings.<ref name-"Preseason consensus">{{cite web | url = http://preseason.stassen.com/consensus/2005.html#national | title = 2005 Preseason Consensus | publisher=Stassen.com | accessdate = 2006-07-24 }}</ref> The two teams maintained those rankings throughout the entire 2005 - 2006 regular season. Texas also was ranked second in each week of the BCS rankings, except for one week where Texas took the top spot with USC number falling to number&nbsp;2. The BCS rankings during 2005 were based on a formula which factored in the votes of two human polls (the USA Today coach's poll and the Harris Interactive poll), combined with a variety of computer rankings. The computer rankings favored Texas as the number&nbsp;1 team throughout the entire season, due partly to Texas's wins over ranked programs such as [[Ohio State University]] and [[Texas Tech University]].

On [[October 24]] [[2006]], Texas passed USC in the [[Bowl Championship Series]] rankings due to a strong showing in the computer rankings, which favored the Longhorns because of the overall strength of their opponents as well as the [[October 22]] [[2006]] win over previously unbeaten Texas Tech. The first place ranking was the first for UT in the BCS era, and the first top ranking in any major football poll since [[October 8]] [[1984]], when they were atop both the Associated Press and Coaches polls.<ref>Veyhl, Jake [http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2005/10/25/TopStories/Longhorns.No.1.For.First.Time.In.Bcs.Rankings-1032632.shtml Longhorns Number 1 for First Time in BCS Rankings] October 25, 2005 ''[[The Daily Texan]]''</ref> The 0.0007% margin separating Texas from USC was the slimmest margin between the top two teams since the inception of BCS rankings.<ref>Harmonson, Todd [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051025/news_1s25bcs.html Texas ascends to No. 1 in BCS ahead of USC] October 25, 2005 ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''</ref>

The stay at the top was short-lived. With the [[October 31]], [[2005]], BCS rankings, Texas remained first in the computer rankings, with Virginia Tech actually pulling even with USC for number&nbsp;2 in the computer rankings. However, USC remained atop both human polls and was able to reclaim the top overall ranking. Texas and USC ended up winning out their seasons and faced each other in the National Championship, which Texas won&nbsp;41-38. This was only the 35th&nbsp;meeting of the 2&nbsp;top-ranked teams in the history of college football, including both regular season and bowl games.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/college/4165951.html | title=Poll shift means 1 will play 2 - Ohio State, UT get ready to clash in Austin | author=Duarte, Joseph | date=[[6 September]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref>

The 2005 season marks only the 8th time in 50&nbsp;years that exactly 2&nbsp;teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated. This has been a major criticism of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Therefore, unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, a judgment call is needed to determine which two teams will be selected to play in the championship.  If more than two undefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out.  If two or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that many other one-loss teams will be left out.

In the five National Championship games since 2000, the team ranked&nbsp;#1 prior to the game has won 3&nbsp;times, while the #2&nbsp;team (including Texas in 2005) has won twice. In the eight years since the inception of the BCS, no school has won the BCS championship twice.<ref name="BCS-archive">{{cite web | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/news.cfm?headline=56 | title=Bowl Championship Series Week-by-Week Standings | work=Bowl Championship Series.com | accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref>

Seconds after Texas beat Southern California 41-38, the university lit the UT tower orange, the traditional signal of victory on the campus.

The championship season lifted the reputation of Mack Brown, but also of his offensive coordinator, [[Greg Davis]].  Davis has been consistently criticized for over-conservative play-calling.

In the upper right-hand side, the years "1963, 1969, 1970, 2005" appear, with the "2005" given special emphasis.

For the [[fiscal year]] which ended in August 2005 just as the 2005 football season was starting, Texas was the nation's richest and most profitable football program, with revenue of $53.2 million, and a profit of $38.7 million.<ref name="BC$"/>  Following the national championship, for the 2005-2006 fiscal year, Texas also led the nation in royalties from merchandise sales, setting a new national record at $8.2 million.
