'''Zersenay Tadese'''{{ref label|Note1|nb|nb}} (born 8 February 1982) is an [[Eritrea]]n [[Long-distance track event|long-distance track]], and [[road running]] athlete. His bronze medal in the [[10,000 metres]] at the [[2004 Athens Olympics]] made him the first ever [[Eritrea at the Olympics|Eritrean Olympic medallist]], and his 20&nbsp;km title at the [[2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships]] also made him the country's first athlete to win at a [[world championship]] event.<ref name=Surfaces/><ref name=FirstWC/> He does not use a sprint finish to win races: his strategy relies upon a combination of [[running economy|efficient running]] and fast pace setting.

He has found most of his success over the [[half marathon]] distance, with three consecutive victories in the [[IAAF World Half Marathon Championships|World Half Marathon Championships]] from 2007 to 2009. He has also excelled in [[cross country running]], winning a gold, one silver, and two bronze medals in the long distance race over the last five [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].

In 2009 he became only the second man (after [[Paul Tergat]]) to win three World Championship medals over three different surfaces in the same year: winning [[2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|World Cross Country]] bronze, [[10,000 metres]] [[2009 World Championships in Athletics|World Championship]] silver on the track, and gold in road running at the [[2009 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships|World Half Marathon Championships]]. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, [[Kidane Tadese]], is also a professional distance runner.

==Early life==
Zersenay Tadese was born in [[Adi Bana]], Eritrea, and had a peaceful, rural upbringing with his six siblings, largely avoiding the troubles of the [[Eritrean War of Independence]].<ref name=Focus>Sampaolo, Diego & Manners, John (2009-10-05).
