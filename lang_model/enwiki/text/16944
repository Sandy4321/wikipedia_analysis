==History==

The festival was founded in 1990 for a 1991 premier by Theodore Kuchar who continued as the Artistic Director for the next 16 years until 2006.  The Festival began conservatively focusing on the more contemporary music of the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic periods]], over the first five years Kuchar started delicately inserting works of [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k|Bartok]], Bloch, [[Bohuslav Martin<U+016F>|Martinu]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], expanding the musical depth for enthusiasts while maintaining the popular appeal.<ref name="The Oz - new directions">{{}}</ref>

The Festival has tried to avoid a perception that it is only there for cultivated southerners, for example in 2005 for the first time the AFCM had a presence at a [[North Queensland Cowboys|Cowboys]] football match and in 2006 increased publicity focusing locally<ref name="The Oz - new directions">{{}}</ref>
