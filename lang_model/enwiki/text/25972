"'''Champion'''" is a song by Trinidadian-American recording artist, [[Nicki Minaj]], taken from her second studio album, ''[[Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded]]'' (2012). The song features additional vocals from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Nas]], and [[Young Jeezy]]. "Champion" was written by Minaj, Aubrey Graham, Jay Jenkins, and Nasir Jones, while the production and additional writing was handled by ''[[Pink Friday]]'' (2010) collaborators [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]] and [[Nikhil Seetharam (composer/producer)|Nikhil S]]. Musically, "Champion" is a [[downtempo]] [[hardcore hip hop]] [[ballad]] that also incorporates elements of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[New Age music|New Age]], and [[space music]]. The lyrics speak of each artist's rise to fame, as well as the trials and tribulations that it carries; it references the death of Minaj's cousin, Nicholas Telemaque, who was murdered near his [[Brooklyn]] home on July 3, 2011.

"Champion" garnered praise from music critics, with the majority declaring it a stand out track. The song is notable for the return of Minaj's original low-key sound, as well as her tame "gimmick-free" delivery as opposed to her eccentric "Roman" songs. Critics generally praised the song for its serious tone and introspective nature. Minaj performed the song live for the first time on ''[[106 & Park]]'' on April 3, 2012, along with "[[Beez in the Trap]]", and "[[Roman Reloaded (song)|Roman Reloaded]]".

"Champion" was written by Minaj, along with [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]], [[Nikhil Seetharam (composer/producer)|Nikhil S.]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Young Jeezy]], and [[Nas]]. The song's production was handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album ''[[Pink Friday]]'' (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists to appear on the song, including fellow [[New York City|New York]] rapper [[Nas]]. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft."<ref name="vibe">{{cite web |url= http://www.vibe.com/post/nicki-minaj-talks-trayvon-martin-roman-reloaded-working-nas-love-foxy-remy-ma-132214| title=Nicki Minaj Talks Trayvon Martin, 'Roman Reloaded,' Working With Nas, Love for Foxy & Remy Ma|first=Vibe|last= |work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |publisher=[[InterMedia Partners]] |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}</ref> Minaj told ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him...
