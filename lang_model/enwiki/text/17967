== Career in Law ==

Born in 1925 in [[Transylvania]], Olga Murray came to the U.S. as a six year old. She graduated with honors from [[Columbia University]] and received her law degree from [[George Washington University]] in 1954.<ref>[http://www.eldr.com/article/culture/saving-children-price-piglet ELDR Magazine], February 20, 2008.

Retrieved on April 20, 2009</ref> Although there were very few women lawyers at that time and most law firms would only hire a female lawyer as a secretary, Murray was offered the first job for which she applied - as a staff attorney to the Chief Justice of California, [[Phil Gibson]]. When he retired, Murray joined the law staff of the new Justice [[Stanley Mosk]].<ref>[http://www.callawyer.com/story.cfm?pubdt=NaN&eid=899356&evid=1 California Lawyer Magazine], February 2009.

== Involvement with Nepal ==

Olga Murray first visited [[Nepal]] in 1984. After seeing the terribly impoverished condition of the children in the villages, she resolved that she would return to help them. On another trip in Nepal in 1987, Murray broke her ankle. Upon returning to [[Kathmandu]], she was treated by a young doctor who had just opened a small hospital for poor, very disabled children, where all care was free and of a high standard. Through this connection, she began giving scholarships to disabled children who had no way of getting to school in their villages, and needed to come to Kathmandu for boarding school.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/07/MNB715HVU8.DTL San Francisco Chronicle], February 8, 2009. Retrieved on April 20, 2009</ref> As the number of scholarships grew, she decided to start a foundation that would help these kids in an organized way. 

== The Nepalese Youth Opportunity Foundation ==

In 1990, she founded the [[Nepalese Youth Opportunity Foundation]] (NYOF), a nonprofit organization registered in the United States, to provide the most impoverished children of Nepal with education, housing, medical care, and human rights. NYOF leverages the money from developed countries to maximize the aid for these children. In addition to scholarships for children who live in Kathmandu and rural Nepal, from grammar school to medical school, NYOF implements a range of other programs to help Nepali children. For example, NYOF<U+2019>s Indentured Daughters Program rescues girls from being sold as bonded servants and pays for them to attend school.<ref>[http://www.encore.org/news/children-and-youth/pulitzer-center-helps-te# Encore.org], March 4, 2009. Retrieved on April 20, 2009</ref> The Nutritional Rehabilitation Homes restore severely malnourished children to full health while educating their mothers in child care and nutrition. NYOF also operates two children<U+2019>s homes in Kathmandu named J House and K House.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2009-02/2009-01-12-voa50.cfm?CFID=170053315&CFTOKEN=99567414&jsessionid=8430b4e388298fa766323c42134b606e1341 VOA News], February 2, 2009.
