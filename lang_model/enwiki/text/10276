'''Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia''' was an interim administrative system established in those areas of the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]] (KFSSR) of the [[Soviet Union]] which were occupied by the [[Finnish army]] during the [[Continuation War]]. The military administration was set up on July 15, 1941 and it ended during the summer of 1944. The goal of the administration was to prepare the region for eventual annexation into Finland. 

The administration did not encompass the territories ceded to the Soviet Union in the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] and subsequently recaptured by the Finns during the [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|summer offensive]] of 1941. 

==Background==
{{See|Greater Finland|Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)}}
Finnish interest in Russian Karelia goes back to the 19th century.<ref name="hannikainen8788">{{cite book |title=Implementing humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts: the case of Finland|last1=Hannikainen|first1=Lauri|last2=Hanski|first2=Raija|last3=Rosas|first3=Allan|year=1992 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9780792316114 |pages=87<U+2013>88}}</ref>  Eastern Karelia was seen as the [[Karelianism|cradle of Finnish culture]] and the ancient land of the heroic sagas of the [[Kalevala]].<ref name="hannikainen8788"/> Along with the rise of Finnish [[Russophobia]], the "[[Karelia question]]" became politicized.<ref name="hannikainen8788"/> During and after the [[Finnish civil war]] several [[Heimosodat|voluntary expeditions]] were launched with the intended goal of liberating the Karelian "kindred people", without success.<ref name="hannikainen8788"/>

The Finnish expansionist aims are present in Finnish Commander-in-Chief [[C. G. E. Mannerheim]]'s [[Order of the Day]] given on [[Sword Scabbard Declaration|July 10, 1941]], which was based on an earlier declaration given by him during the Finnish civil war.<ref>"[http://heninen.net/miekka/p-1918_e.htm "I will not sheath my sword before law and order reigns in the land, before all fortresses are in our hands, before the last soldier of Lenin is driven not only from Finland, but from White Sea Karelia as well."]</ref> 

==Organization==
The military administration was established on the order of the Commander-in-Chief, and was mainly under the control of the Army, not the [[Jukka Rangell's cabinet|Finnish government]].<ref>[http://www.mannerheim.fi/06_vsota/e_itakar.htm Mannerheim - Eastern Karelia]</ref><ref name="hannikainen8788"/>  It was originally divided into three districts ("piiri"), which were further divided into sub-regions ("alue"). The military administration used exclusively Finnish-Karelian place-names (Russian name in parenthesis).

* Viena (Belomorye) district
:*Kiestinki (Kestenga)
:*Uhtua ([[Ukhta]])

The Maaselk<U+00E4> district was terminated in late 1942, and its sub-regions were divided among the remaining two districts.

===Headquarters===
The military administration was originally stationed in [[Mikkeli]], Finland, where the general staff of the Finnish army was located.  On October 15th, it was transferred to [[Joensuu]], Finland, and finally on November 15, 1943 to [[<U+00C4><U+00E4>nislinna]] (Petrozavodsk), KFSSR.<ref name="rautio-itakarjalan1">Rautio (2002), p. 175</ref>

===Military Commanders===
The first commander of the military administration was [[Vuorineuvos|mining counselor]] and CEO of [[Enso-Gutzeit]], [[Lt Col]] V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6> Kotilainen. Kotilainen was followed by [[Col]] J. V. Arajuuri from June 15, 1942 to August 19, 1943, and finally by Col Olli Paloheimo who held the position to the end of the war.<ref> [http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/talousvaikuttajat/?iid=777 Olli Paloheimo - The National Biography of Finland]</ref> 

On the staff of the military commander worked professor of [[administrative law]] Veli Merikoski, whose task was to ensure that the military administration functioned in accordance with international law.<ref name="hannikainen88">Hannikainen et al. (1992), p. 88</ref>  After the end of the Continuation War, Merikoski wrote a booklet on the military administration, describing it in an overtly positive light.<ref name="hannikainen88"/> This was done to help the Finnish cause in the coming peace negotiations.<ref name="hannikainen88"/>

===Academic Karelia Society===
{{See|Academic Karelia Society}}
Members of the [[Academic Karelia Society]] (AKS), a Finno-Ugric activist organization, held a dominating role in the military administration.<ref name="trifonova65">Trifonova (2005), p. 65</ref> During the Continuation War the "liberation" of Eastern Karelia had become the main focus point of AKS activities, and its members were highly influential in choosing the policies of the military administration in accordance with the organization's "Greater Finland" ideology.<ref name="trifonova65">Trifonova (2005), p. 65</ref> In the summer of 1941, over half of the initial higher leadership of the military administration were AKS members.<ref name="trifonova65">Trifonova (2005), p. 65</ref>

==Policies==
The long-term goal of the military administration was to make it possible for Eastern Karelia to be permanently integrated to the Finnish state after the ultimate German victory over the Soviet Union.<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen104"/> This was to be done by inspiring the native population's confidence on the Finnish occupiers.<ref name="hannikainen88"/>

===Fennicization===
As most place-names in Eastern Karelia had a historical Finnish or Karelian alternatives which were still in use in the KFSSR, extensive renaming was not necessary.<ref name ="rautiainen73"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 73</ref> The notable exception is ''Petroskoi'' (Petrozavodsk), which was deemed as sounding too "Russian", and was renamed ''<U+00C4><U+00E4>nislinna'', a literal Finnish translation of the name ''Onegaborg'' used in the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of [[Abraham Ortelius]].<ref>[http://www.orteliusmaps.com/topnames/ort160.html Cartographica Neerlandica Topographical names for Ortelius Map No. 160]</ref><ref name ="rautiainen73"/> Although Finnish troops never reached ''Kemi'' ([[Kem]]) on the shores of the [[White sea]], this town was also to be renamed, as a [[Kemi|town with an identical name]] already stood in [[Finnish Lapland]].<ref name="trifonova70">Trifonova (2005), p. 70</ref> The new name was tentatively suggested to be ''Vienanlinna'' ("Castle of [[Viena]]"), a continuation of several Finnish cities and towns ending in suffix ''-linna'' (e.g. [[H<U+00E4>meenlinna]], [[Savonlinna]]).<ref name="trifonova70"/>

Streets were to be named after prominent Finns and patriots (such as Mannerheim, [[Elias L<U+00F6>nnrot]], [[Elias Simojoki]] and [[Paavo Talvela]]), and also after names featured in the Kalevala and the [[Kanteletar]].<ref name="trifonova7071">Trifonova (2005), pp. 70-71</ref>  The Karelian population was also discouraged to give newly-born children [[Slavic names]].<ref name="trifonova7071"/> 

===Ethnic policies===
The remaining population of Eastern Karelia was estimated to be under 85 000 in 1941, and consisted mainly of women, children and the elderly, while the pre-war population was c. 300 000.<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105">Vehvil<U+00E4>inen (2002), p. 105</ref> The Finnish authorities further estimated that of the remaining 85 000, circa half could be classified as "national"; that is, [[Karelians]], [[Finns]], [[Estonians]], [[Ingrians]], [[Vepsians]] and other smaller Finnic minorities considered "kindred peoples" (''heimo'').<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105"/><ref name="trifonova66">Trifonova (2005), p. 66</ref> The majority of the population was defined as "non-national", with most being [[Russians|Russian]] or [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]].<ref name="trifonova66"/> The Finns encountered considerable challenges in dividing the population into these two groups, as [[linguistics|linguistic]] and ethnic boundaries were not very apparent.<ref name="trifonova66"/> Ultimately, the division was based on ethnic principles (sometimes expressing somewhat [[pseudo-scientific]] [[anthropological]] theories), and thus monolingual [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking Karelians and children from multinational families were usually classified as "national".<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105"/><ref name="trifonova66"/> The long-term goal of this pursued policy was to expel the "non-national" part of the population to German-occupied Russia after the war had reached a victorious conclusion.<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105"/> 

===Education and propaganda===
Finnish [[propaganda]] directed for the Karelian population focused on pan-Finnicism, presented the occupiers as liberators, and also tried to encourage antagonism between the Karelians and Russians.<ref name="trifonova67">Trifonova (2005), p. 67</ref> Main propaganda tools of the military administration were the newspaper ''Vapaa Karjala'' ("Free Karelia") and [[Aunus Radio]].<ref name="trifonova68">Trifonova (2005), p. 68</ref>

Obligatory school attendance applied to 7-15 year-old children classified as "national" in ethnicity.<ref name="hannikainen90">Hannikainen et al. (1992), p. 90</ref>  The language of instruction was Finnish and the teaching had a heavy focus on Finnish nationalistic and religious themes.<ref name="hannikainen90"/><ref name="trifonova70"/>If the children were monolingual Russian or [[Veps language|Veps]] speakers, with the latter language differing considerably from Finnish, Karelian-speaking children were used as translators.<ref name="trifonova70"/> By the end of 1942, 110 elementary schools were opened, with an attendance of over 10 000 children.<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105"/>

One of the aims of the military administration was the revival of religious observation, which had been completely repressed under Soviet rule.<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105">Vehvil<U+00E4>inen (2002), p. 106</ref> The central idea of this policy was to bolster [[anti-communist]] feelings among the "nationals".<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen105"/>

===Planned population transfers===
Suffering from severe underpopulation, especially after the planned expulsion of the "non-national" ethnic groups, the Finns theorized several possible ways to repopulate the region. Most suggestions revolved around the re-settlement of certain Finnic minorities of Russia.<ref name ="rautiainen131"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 131</ref> The Karelians of [[Tver Oblast|Tver]], who had escaped Swedish and Lutheran rule from the [[County of Kexholm]] and [[Swedish Ingria|Ingria]] after the [[Ingrian War]] and the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] of 1617 were especially considered<ref name ="rautiainen131"/>, as the [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union|Soviet Census of 1926]] had counted them as numbering over 140 000, making the Karelian population of Tver more numerous than the Karelians in the KFSSR itself. The transfer was not, however, possible before Finnish and German fronts reached each other on the [[River Svir]], which never happened during the war.

The other main group intended to be settled in Eastern Karelia were the Ingrian Finns of the [[Leningrad Oblast]]<ref name ="rautiainen131"/> , who according to the 1926 census numbered c. 115 000.<ref name="pohl22">{{cite book |title=Ethnic cleansing in the USSR, 1937-1949|last1=Pohl|first1=J. Otto |year=1999 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780313309212 |page=22}}</ref> However, during [[Great Purges|Stalin's purges]] tens of thousands of Ingrians had perished or were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|transferred]] to other parts of the Soviet Union<ref name="pohl23"> Pohl (1999), pp. 22-24</ref>, and in 1941 the Ingrians of Leningrad probably numbered only c. 80 000-90 000. In the autumn of 1941, Western and Central Ingria were occupied by the advancing German forces and placed under German military administration. Because Ingria was to be reserved for German colonization according to the [[Generalplan Ost]] (''Ingermanland''), the German and Finnish authorities agreed on a treaty which stated that Ingria was to be totally emptied of Finns and other Finnic minorities, mainly [[Votes]] and  [[Izhorians]]. This treaty was implemented during March 1943 to the summer of 1944, when over 64 000 people were transferred from Ingria to Finland.<ref name="hannikainen97">Hannikainen et al. (1992), p. 97</ref>  The Ingrians remaining areas still under the control of the Red Army (c. 20 000 - 30 000) were deported to Siberia during the winter of 1942-1943. After the [[Moscow Armistice]], some 55 000 Ingrians were repatriated to the Soviet Union, but were not allowed to return to theirs homes in the Leningrad Oblast before the 1950s.<ref name="hannikainen98">Hannikainen et al. (1992), p. 98</ref>  Around 7000 to 8000 Ingrians moved from Finland to Sweden to escape the Soviet authorities.<ref name="hannikainen98"/>

Other discussed sources for East Karelian settlers included the Finnish immigrants of [[Finnish American|America]] and [[Finnish Canadian|Canada]], the Finnic [[Soviet prisoners of war (Nazi Germany)|Soviet prisoners of war]] under German capture, Eastern Karelian refugees currently living in Finland, and Finnish war veterans.<ref name ="rautiainen131"/>  Land redistribution was to favor those without farms or land, disabled veterans who were still capable of working, former [[NCOs]], border [[Finnish J<U+00E4>gers|j<U+00E4>gers]] and soldiers distinguished in battle.<ref name ="rautiainen131"/> 

=== Internment and labor camps ===
At the beginning of the Finnish occupation of Karelia, over 20,000 of the local ethnic Russians (almost half of them) were placed in [[internment]] and [[labor camp]]s. In the end of 1941 the number rised up to 24,000. During time prisoners were gradually released and they were transfered to empty villages. However, their movement were controlled as they had a red clearance, while "national" people had a green clearance. Furthermore, ethnic Russians did have a permission to travel to Finland.<ref name="rautio-itakarjalan2">Rautio (2002), p. 179</ref>

Living in Finnish camps was harsh as 4,000-7,000 of civil prisoners died, mostly from hunger during the spring and summer of 1942 due to failed harvest of 1941.<ref name=ravn>"The occupiers set in Karelia the network of concentration, transfer and labor camps where over 20 thousand of locals were placed. Thousands of them died"<br>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051102050211/www.ravnenie-na-pobedu.ru/regions/10/history1.html|title="<U+0420><U+0430><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+041F><U+043E><U+0431><U+0435><U+0434><U+0443>" (Eyes toward Victory), the Republic of Karelia|accessdate=August 10, 2006|author=|last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors=|date=|year=|month=| work=|publisher=the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, National Delphi Council of Russia|pages=|language=Russian |archiveurl=|archivedate=}}</ref><ref name= "Laine">Laine, Antti: ''Suur-Suomen kahdet kasvot'', 1982, ISBN 951-1-06947-0, Otava</ref> Also segregation in education and medical care between Karelians and Russians created resentment among the Russian population. These actions made many local ethnic Russian people support the [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] attacks.<ref name="Laine"/>

==Planned future expansion==
In a conversation held on November 27, 1941 with the Finnish Foreign Minister [[Rolf Witting|Witting]], [[Hitler]] proposed that the new Finnish border should run from the [[Kola peninsula]] to the Svir, and in the case Leningrad was razed to the ground as originally planned, to the [[River Neva]].<ref name="vehvil<U+00E4>inen104"/> In Finland this theoretical border was sometimes referred to as ''Kolmen kannaksen raja'' ("the Border of Three Isthmuses", referring to the [[Karelian Isthmus]], Olonets Isthmus and the White Sea Isthmus). 
The exact border of the White Sea Isthmus was left undefined during the war, but [[Alfred Rosenberg]], head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]], held that Finland should annex the whole KFSSR.<ref name ="rautiainen9"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 9</ref> The most eastward Finnish suggestion discussed before the war drew the line from Nimenga in the [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] to the [[Pudozhsky District]] on [[Lake Onega]].<ref name ="rautiainen9"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 13</ref>

Kola peninsula was to be ''de jure'' a part of Finland, but the nickel deposits of the region were to be exploited jointly with Germany.<ref name ="rautiainen128"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 128</ref> Jalmari Jaakkola estimated in ''Die Ostfrage Finnlands'' that some 200 000 Russian had to be expelled from the region, leaving the peninsula with a population of c. 20 000 Finns, [[Samis]] and Karelians.<ref name ="rautiainen129"> Rautiainen (2007), p. 129</ref>
