'''Leslie Hubert''' ('''Les''') '''Holden''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (6 March 1895&nbsp;<U+2013> 18&nbsp;September 1932) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&nbsp;I and later a commercial aviator. A [[South Australia]]n, he joined the [[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] in May 1915, serving in Egypt and France. In December 1916, he volunteered for the [[Australian Flying Corps]] and qualified as a pilot. As a member of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], he gained the sobriquets "Lucky Les" and "the homing pigeon" after a series of incidents that saw him limping back to base in bullet-riddled aircraft. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]], and went on to achieve five aerial victories flying [[Airco DH.5]]s and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s.

Promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]], Holden finished the war as an instructor with [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;6 (Training) Squadron]] in England, where his work earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]]. After leaving the Australian Flying Corps in 1919, he became a manager at the family firm of [[Holden|Holden's Motor Body Builders]] and joined the part-time [[Royal Australian Air Force|Citizen Air Force]], before setting up as a commercial pilot and establishing his own air service. In 1929, he located [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]] in the north-west Australian desert after the pair was reported missing on a flight to England in the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]''. Holden began transport operations in New Guinea in 1931. He was killed the following year in a passenger plane crash in Australia.

==Family and early life==
Leslie Hubert Holden was born on 6&nbsp;March 1895 in [[Adelaide|East Adelaide]], South Australia, to travelling businessman Hubert William Holden and his wife Annie Maria.<ref name=ADB>{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090338b.htm |last=Bridge|first=Carl|title=Holden, Leslie Hubert (1895<U+2013>1932)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=Newton>Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> Les was the nephew of Henry Holden, who later founded the Adelaide-based firm [[Holden|Holden's Motor Body Builders]] with his son [[Edward Holden|Edward]]. Hubert Holden landed a partnership with [[Nestl<U+00E9>]] in 1905, and the family moved to [[Turramurra, New South Wales|Turramurra]], New South Wales. Les completed his education at [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]], and joined Nestl<U+00E9> in 1911 as a salesman.<ref name=ADB/> By the time [[Military history of Australia during World War I|Australia entered World War&nbsp;I]] in August 1914, he was an assistant manager.<ref name=Newton/>

Holden enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 26&nbsp;May 1915, and was posted to the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]]. He departed for Egypt aboard the transport A29 ''Suevic'' on 13&nbsp;June.<ref name=AIF>{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=140588 |title=Leslie Hubert Holden|work= The AIF Project|publisher=[[University of New South Wales]]|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> Serving as a driver first in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] and then on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him to volunteer for the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a [[lieutenant]] and posted to [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]].<ref name=ADB/> Commanded by Major [[Oswald Watt]], No.&nbsp;2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the [[Mesopotamian Half Flight]].

Because its [[Airco DH.5]]s were handicapped as [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] by engine problems and low speed, No.&nbsp;2 Squadron was employed mainly in [[Close air support|ground support]] duties.<ref name=Stephens/>  During the fog-shrouded opening day of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] on 20&nbsp;November, Holden bombed and machine-gunned a German communications trench from altitudes as low as {{convert|20|or|30|ft|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Newton/><ref name=Cutlack184-185,191>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069816--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 184<U+2013>185, 191]</ref> He returned to a forward airfield near [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]] with his plane "a&nbsp;flying wreck", in the words of the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914<U+2013>1918|official history of Australia in the war]].

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Whilst on a special mission he dropped a bomb direct on a support trench full of the enemy, causing them to scatter, and another bomb upon a strong point which was holding up our advance. He also bombed a large group of enemy infantry,

Still hankering after a full-time career in flying, Holden enlisted the help of friends to purchase a [[De Havilland Giant Moth|de Havilland DH.61 Giant Moth]] in 1928. He named it ''Canberra'', and used it to start a charter operation out of [[Sydney Airport|Mascot Aerodrome]] in Sydney.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=Newton/> Holden became a national celebrity in April 1929 when he successfully undertook an aerial search of the north-western Australian wilderness to locate [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]], after the pair had gone missing on a flight from Sydney to England in the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]''. Two other searchers, Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, were lost in their aircraft, the ''Kookaburra''. The media of the day turned on Smith and Ulm, accusing them of a publicity stunt, and the Sydney Citizens' Relief Committee, which had commissioned Holden to undertake the rescue operation, withheld payment of his expenses.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 297<U+2013>303</ref> He nevertheless continued flying commercially, and is credited with making<U+2014>in September 1931<U+2014>possibly the first flight from Sydney to New Guinea, where he started an air freight service.<ref name=ADB/> Returning to Sydney the following year, he established Holden's Air Transport Services.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=Newton/> He also acquired two more aircraft for his New Guinea operations, a [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]] and a Moth, to supplement the ''Canberra''.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Idriess, ''Gold-Dust and Ashes'', p. 169</ref>
