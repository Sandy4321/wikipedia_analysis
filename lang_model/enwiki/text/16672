The '''history of saffron''' in human cultivation and use reaches back more than 3,000 years<ref name="Deo_1">{{Harvnb|Deo|2003|p=1}}.</ref> and spans many cultures, continents, and civilizations. [[Saffron]], a [[spice]] derived from the dried [[carpel|stigmas]] of the saffron crocus (''Crocus sativus''), has remained among the world's costliest substances throughout history. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, saffron has been used as a [[seasoning]], [[Perfume|fragrance]], [[dye]], and [[medicine]]. Saffron is native to [[Southwest Asia]],<ref name="Grigg_287">{{Harvnb|Grigg|1974|p=287}}.</ref><ref name="Hill_272">{{Harvnb|Hill|2001|p=272}}.</ref> but was first cultivated in [[Greece]].<ref name="McGee_422">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=422}}.</ref>

The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus is ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. Human cultivators [[plant breeding|bred]] ''C. cartwrightianus'' specimens by selecting for plants with abnormally long stigmas. Thus, sometime in late [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]], a mutant form of ''C. cartwrightianus'', ''C. sativus'', emerged.<ref name="Goyns_1">{{Harvnb|Goyns|1999|p=1}}.</ref> Saffron was first documented in a 7th-century BC [[Assyria]]n botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]]. Since then, documentation of saffron's use over a span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some ninety illnesses has been uncovered.<ref name="Honan">{{Harvnb|Honan|2004}}.</ref> Saffron slowly spread throughout much of [[Eurasia]], later reaching parts of [[North Africa]], [[North America]], and [[Oceania]].

During a brief period of idyllic love Smilax is flattered by his amorous advances, but soon is bored by Crocus' attentions. After he continues to pursue her against her wishes, she resorts to bewitching him, transforming Crocus into a saffron crocus flower, with its radiant orange stigmas remaining as a faint symbol of his undying passion for Smilax.<ref name="Willard_2">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=2}}.</ref> The tragedy and the spice would be recalled later by [[Ovid]]:<ref name="Willard_1">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=1}}.</ref>

For the people of the ancient Mediterranean, the saffron gathered in the Cilician coastal town of [[Soli, Cilicia|Soli]] was the most valued, particularly for use in [[perfume]]s and ointments.<ref name="Willard_41">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=41}}.</ref> However, such figures as [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] rated rival [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n saffron from the [[Fertile Crescent]] as best for use in treatments against gastrointestinal and renal ailments.<ref name="Willard_41">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=41}}.</ref>  Greek saffron production from the [[Corycian Cave]] of [[Mount Parnassus]] also became noteworthy.

In late [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] used a quarter-cup of saffron in her warm baths because of its colouring and cosmetic properties. She also used it before encounters with men, believing that saffron would give lovemaking more pleasure.<ref name="Willard_55">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=55}}.</ref> Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments.<ref name="Willard_34">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=34}}.</ref> For instance, when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging, an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with ''aager''-tree remnants, ox fat, [[coriander]], and [[myrrh]]. This ointment or [[poultice]]  was applied to the body. The physicians expected it to "[expel] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog's blood when it is cooked."<ref name="Willard_34-35">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=34<U+2013>35}}.</ref> [[Urinary system|Urinary tract]] conditions were also treated with an oil-based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans; this was used topically on men. Women ingested a more complex preparation.<ref name="Willard_35">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=35}}.</ref>

In Greco-Roman times saffron was widely traded across the Mediterranean by the [[Phoenicia]]ns. Their customers ranged from perfumers in [[Rosetta]], Egypt to physicians in [[Gaza]] to townsfolk in [[Rhodes]], who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre.<ref name="Willard_58">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=58}}.</ref> For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional [[courtesan]]s and retainers known as the ''[[hetaera]]e''. In addition, large dye works operating in [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] used saffron baths as a substitute. There, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.<ref name="Willard_59">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=59}}.</ref>

The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Romans]] also prized saffron for its use as a perfume and deodoriser. They scattered it about public spaces such as royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres. When Emperor [[Nero]] entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets, and wealthy Romans made daily use of saffron baths. They also used saffron as [[mascara]], stirred saffron threads into their [[wine]]s, strewn it in halls and streets as a [[potpourri]], and offered it to their [[Roman mythology|deities]]. Roman colonists took saffron with them when they settled in southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 [[Crisis of the Third Century|barbarian invasion of Italy]]. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century [[Moors]] or with the [[Avignon Papacy]] in the 14th century.<ref name="Willard_63">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=63}}.</ref>

In [[Persian Empire|ancient Persia]], saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') was cultivated at Derbena and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds.<ref name="Willard_2">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=2}}.</ref> Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshipers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of [[melancholia|melancholy]]. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an [[aphrodisiac]]. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine.<ref name="Willard_41">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=41}}.</ref> In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with [[sandalwood]] to use as a body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun.<ref name="Willard_17-18">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=17<U+2013>18}}.</ref> Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by [[Alexander the Great]] and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water. He believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.<ref name="Willard_54-55">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=54<U+2013>55}}.</ref> Saffron cultivation also reached what is now [[Turkey]], with harvesting concentrated around the northern town of [[Safranbolu]]; the area still known for its annual saffron harvest festivals.

==Indian and Chinese==
Various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron's first arrival in [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]]. The first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to [[India]] via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire.<ref name="Dalby_2003_256">{{Harvnb|Dalby|2003|p=256}}.</ref> Another variant of this theory states that, after ancient Persia conquered [[Kashmir]], Persian saffron crocus [[w:corm|corms]] were transplanted to Kashmiri soil. The first harvest then occurred sometime prior to 500 BC.<ref name="McGee_422">{{Harvnb|McGee|2004|p=422}}.</ref> Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron was used in the treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye.<ref name="Willard_41">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=41}}.</ref>
[[Image:Gomateswara.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 17.8 [[Metre|m]] [[monolith]] of [[Jainism|Jain]] prophet [[Bhagavan]] [[Gomateshwara]] [[Bahubali]], which was carved between 978&ndash;993 AD and is located in [[Shravanabelagola]], [[India]], is anointed with saffron every 12 years by thousands of devotees as part of the [[Mahamastakabhisheka]] festival.]]

On the other hand, traditional Kashmiri legend states that saffron first arrived sometime during the 11th and 12th centuries AD, when two foreign and itinerant [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[asceticism|ascetics]], Khwaja Masood Wali and Hazrat Sheikh Shariffudin, wandered into Kashmir. The foreigners, having fallen sick, beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain. When the chieftain obliged, the two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks. To this day, grateful prayers are offered to the two saints during the saffron harvesting season in late autumn. The saints, indeed, have a golden-domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in the saffron-trading village of [[Pampore]], India. However, the Kashmiri poet and scholar Mohammed Yusuf Teng disputes this. He states that Kashmiris had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia. Indeed, such ancient indigenous cultivation is alluded to in Kashmiri [[Tantra|Tantric Hindu]] epics of that time.<ref name="Lak_1998b">{{Harvnb|Lak|1998b}}.</ref>

Ancient Chinese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] accounts from the ''Mula-[[sarvastivadin]]''<ref name="Fotedar_128">{{Harvnb|Fotedar|1998<U+2013>1999|p=128}}.</ref> monastic order (or ''[[vinaya]]'') present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an ''[[arhat]]'' Indian Buddhist [[missionary]] by the name of Madhy<U+00E2>ntika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. When he got there, he reportedly sowed Kashmir's first saffron crop.<ref name="Dalby_2002_95">{{Harvnb|Dalby|2002|p=95}}.</ref> From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye. Such was the love of the resulting fabric that, immediately after the [[Buddha|Buddha Siddhartha Guatama]]'s death, his attendant monks decreed saffron as the official colour for Buddhist robes and mantles.<ref name="Tarvand_2005">{{Harvnb|Tarvand|2005}}.</ref>

Some historians believe that saffron first came to [[China]] with [[Mongols|Mongol]] invaders by way of Persia. Saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the vast [[Bencao Gangmu]] ("''Great Herbal''") pharmacopoeia (pp. 1552<U+2013>78), a tome dating from around 1600 BC (and attributed to [[Shang Dynasty|Emperor Shen-Ung]]) which documents thousands of phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders.<ref name="Tarvand_2005">{{Harvnb|Tarvand|2005}}.</ref> Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that "[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha." Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: "The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine."<ref name="Dalby_2002_95">{{Harvnb|Dalby|2002|p=95}}.</ref>
[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Medieval European [[illuminated manuscript]]s, such as this 13th-century depiction of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]]'s assassination, often used saffron dyes to provide hues of [[yellow]] and [[orange (color)|orange]].]]

In modern times, saffron cultivation has spread to [[Afghanistan]] because of the efforts of the [[European Union]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Together, they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash-strapped Afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to illicit and lucrative [[opium]] production.<ref name="Pearce_2005">{{Harvnb|Pearce|2005}}.</ref> They stress Afghanistan's sunny and semi-arid climate as ideal for saffron crocus growth.

==Post-Classical European==
Saffron cultivation in Europe declined steeply following the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]]. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle [[Al-Andalus|most of Spain]] as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around [[Poitiers]] after they lost the [[Battle of Tours]] to [[Charles Martel]] in AD 732.<ref name="Willard_70">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=70}}.</ref> Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of [[Andalucia]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[La Mancha]], and [[Crown of Aragon|Valencia]].<ref name="Willard_70">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=70}}.</ref>

When the [[Black Death]] ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1350, demand for saffron and its cultivation skyrocketed. It was coveted by plague victims for its medicinal properties, but many of the European farmers capable of growing it died off. Large quantities of saffron imports thus came from non-European lands.<ref name="Willard_99">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=99}}.</ref> Yet the finest saffron threads from Muslim lands were unavailable to Europeans because of hostilities beginning with the [[Crusades]]. Thus imports from places such as [[Rhodes]] supplied central and northern Europe. Saffron was one of the contested points of hostility that flared between the declining nobleman classes and increasingly wealthy merchants. For example, the fourteen-week-long "Saffron War" was ignited when an 800-pound (360 kg) shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by noblemen.<ref name="Willard_99">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=99}}.</ref> The saffron load, which had been destined for the town of [[Basel]], would at today's market prices be valued at more than [[United States dollar|US$]]500,000.<ref name="Willard_100">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=100}}.</ref> That shipment was eventually returned, but the saffron trade in the 13th century remained the subject of mass theft and piracy. Indeed, pirates plying Mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]- and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoan]]-marketed saffron bound for Europe. The ordinary people of Basel, wary of such future piracy, thus planted their own corms. After several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests, Basel grew extremely prosperous compared to other European towns. Basel attempted to protect its status by outlawing the transportation of corms outside the town's borders; guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms. Nevertheless, after ten years the saffron crop failed, and Basel abandoned cultivation.<ref name="Willard_101">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=101}}.</ref>
[[Image:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Persian saffron threads from [[Iran]].]]

The centre of central European saffron trade then moved to [[Nuremberg]], while the merchants of Venice continued their dominance of the Mediterranean sea trade. There, saffron varieties from [[Austria]], [[Crete]], [[France]], [[Greece]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Sicily]], and [[Spain]] were sold. Also sold were many adulterated samples, including those soaked in honey, mixed with [[marigold]] petals, or kept in damp cellars in order to increase the saffron threads' weight. This prompted Nuremberg authorities to pass the so-called ''Safranschou'' code, which sought to regulate saffron trading.<ref name="Willard_102-103">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=102<U+2013>103}}.</ref> Saffron adulterators were thereafter fined, imprisoned, and executed via [[execution by burning|immolation]].<ref name="Willard_103-104">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=103<U+2013>104}}.</ref> Soon after, [[England]] emerged as a major European saffron producer. Saffron, according to one theory,<ref name="Willard_110">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=110}}.</ref> spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England. [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and south [[Cambridgeshire]] were especially heavily planted with corms. Rowland Parker provides an account of its cultivation in the village of [[Foxton, Cambridgeshire|Foxton]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, "usually by people holding a small amount of land"; an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth <U+00A3>6, making it "a very profitable crop, provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available; unpaid labor was one of the basic features of farming then and for another two centuries."<ref name="Parker_138">{{Harvnb|Parker|1976|p=138}}</ref>

However, long-term saffron cultivation only survived in the light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of the [[Essex]] countryside. Indeed, the Essex town of [[Saffron Walden]] got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre. Its name was originally Cheppinge Walden and the name was changed to show the importance of the crop to the local area; and today the town's [[coat of arms|arms]] feature crocus blooms ([http://www.saffronwalden.gov.uk/regalia.php]). Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising [[puritan]]ical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical advocates favoured more austere, simple, and un-spiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive crop, which became an increasing disadvantage. Lastly, an influx of additional spices from Eastern lands due to the growing [[spice trade]] meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had more seasonings to choose from.<ref name="Willard_117">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=117}}.</ref>

This trend was later documented by the Reverend William Herbert, who was the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Manchester]]. He collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of the saffron crocus.<ref name="Willard_132">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=132}}.</ref> He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation over the 17th century and the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This was due to the introduction in Europe of such easily grown crops as [[maize]] and [[potato]]es, which steadily took over lands formerly dedicated to saffron corms.<ref name="Willard_133">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=133}}.</ref> In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such exotic and new arrivals as [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[vanilla]]. Indeed, only in the south of France, Italy, and Spain, where saffron had been deeply incorporated into the local cultures, did significant cultivation remain.<ref name="Willard_133">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=133}}.</ref>

==North American==
[[Image:Crocus sativus sahuran.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A saffron crocus flower]]

Saffron made its way to the [[Americas]] when thousands of [[Alsace|Alsatian]], [[Germany|German]], and Swiss [[Anabaptist]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkards]], and others fled religious persecution in Europe.<ref name="Willard_134-136">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=134<U+2013>136}}.</ref> They settled mainly in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[Susquehanna River]] valley.<ref name="Willard_136">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=136}}.</ref> These settlers, who became known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to America in a trunk owned by German adherents of a Protestant sect known as the [[Schwenkfelder Church]]. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany.<ref name="Willard_143">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=143}}.</ref> Soon, Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the [[Caribbean]], while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia [[commodities exchange]] was set equal to that of [[gold]].<ref name="Willard_138">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=138}}.</ref>

However, the [[War of 1812]] destroyed many of the merchant vessels that transported American saffron abroad. Pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory, and trade with the Caribbean markets never recovered.<ref name="Willard_138-139">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=138<U+2013>139}}.</ref> Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Dutch growers developed many uses for saffron in their own home cooking, including [[cake]]s, [[noodle]]s, and [[chicken (food)|chicken]] or [[trout]] dishes.<ref name="Willard_142-146">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|pp=142<U+2013>146}}.</ref> Saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Willard_143">{{Harvnb|Willard|2001|p=143}}.</ref>
