'''Pixar Animation Studios''' is an American [[CGI animation]] film studio based in [[Emeryville, California]], United States. Pixar became a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2006. The studio has earned twenty-four [[Academy Award]]s, seven [[Golden Globes]], and three [[Grammys]], among many other awards and acknowledgments. Its films have made over $6.3 billion worldwide. It is best known for its [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated [[List of Pixar films|feature film]]s which are created with [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]], its own implementation of the industry-standard [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]] image-[[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] [[Application programming interface|API]] used to generate high-quality images.

Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the Computer Division of [[Lucasfilm]] before it was acquired by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] in 1986. [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought Pixar in 2006.

Pixar has produced eleven feature films, beginning with ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. It was followed by ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' in 1998, ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' in 1999, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' in 2001, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' in 2003, ''[[The Incredibles]]'' in 2004, ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' in 2007, ''[[WALL-E]]'' in 2008, ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (to date, the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]] of all-time, grossing over $1 billion worldwide), in 2010. All the [[List of Pixar films|eleven films]] that Pixar has produced have been largely successful, both critically and commercially. The $602 million average gross of their films is by far the highest of any studio in the industry.<ref>When added to foreign grosses http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm</ref>

All the films produced by Pixar are among the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fifty highest grossing animated films of all time]]. ''Finding Nemo'', ''The Incredibles'', ''Up'' and ''Toy Story 3'' make it to the top 50 [[list of highest-grossing films]] of all time, with ''Toy Story 3'' at #5, ''Finding Nemo'' at #21, ''Up'' at #39, and ''The Incredibles'' at #50.

All eight Pixar films released since the inauguration of the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] in 2001 have been nominated for that award, commencing with ''Monsters, Inc.''. Five of the eight have won the award: ''Finding Nemo'', ''The Incredibles'', ''Ratatouille'', ''WALL-E'', and ''Up''. ''Up'' and ''Toy Story 3'' are among the only three animated films to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

On September 6, 2009, executives [[John Lasseter]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Andrew Stanton]] and [[Lee Unkrich]] were presented with the [[Golden Lion]] for Lifetime Achievement by the Biennale [[Venice Film Festival]]. The award was presented by Lucasfilm founder [[George Lucas]].

Pixar's upcoming films include: ''[[Cars 2]]'', ([[sequel]] to the 2006 film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''), which is scheduled for release on June 24, 2011, ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', which is scheduled for release on June 15, 2012 and ''[[Monsters, Inc. 2]]'', (sequel to the 2001 film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'') which is scheduled for release on November 2, 2012.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Pixaranimationstudios.jpg|thumb|Pixar's studio lot in Emeryville.]]
Pixar was founded as the Graphics Group, one third of the Computer Division of [[Lucasfilm]] that was launched in 1979 with the hiring of [[Edwin Catmull|Dr. Ed Catmull]] from the [[New York Institute of Technology]] (NYIT),<ref name="pixar story">{{cite web  | author = Hormby, Thomas| publisher =Low End Mac  | title =The Pixar Story: Fallon Forbes, Dick Shoup, Alex Schure, George Lucas and Disney  | date =2007-01-22|url =http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/pixar-story-lucas-disney.html  | accessdate =2007-03-01  }}</ref> where he was in charge of the [[Computer Graphics Lab]] (CGL).  At NYIT, the researchers had pioneered many of the CG techniques that are now taken for granted and worked on an experimental film called ''[[The Works (film)|The Works]]''. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]], called Motion Doctor, which allowed traditional [[Traditional animation|cel animators]] to use computer animation with minimal training.<ref name="pixar story" />

The team began working on film sequences produced by Lucasfilm or worked collectively with [[Industrial Light & Magic]] on special effects.<ref name="pixar story"/> After years of research, and key milestones in films such as the Genesis Effect in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' and the Stained Glass Knight in ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'',<ref name="pixar story"/> the group, which numbered about 45 individuals back then,<ref>[http://yoz.com/wired/1.08/features/toy_story.html The Toy Story Story]</ref> was purchased in 1986 by [[Steve Jobs]] shortly after he left [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=The_End_Of_An_Era.txt|title=The End Of An Era|first=Andy|last=Hertzfeld|authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|publisher=Folklore.org}}</ref> Jobs paid $5 million to George Lucas and put $5 million as capital into the company.<ref name="pixar">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-11|url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/history/index.html|title=Pixar History |publisher=Pixar }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/01/29/BUG8RGTL2L1.DTL&type=business | title=The dynamic duo behind Pixar's big success / Lasseter and Catmull driving force behind studios' blockbusters | first=Ellen | last=Lee | date=January 29, 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref><ref>[http://www.takeourword.com/TOW203/page2.html Take Our Word For It, page two, Words to the Wise<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A factor contributing to Lucas' sale was an increase in cash flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from ''[[Star Wars]]'' licenses following the release of ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' and the disastrous box-office performance of ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''.<ref name="pixar story" /> The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull, President, and Dr. [[Alvy Ray Smith]], Executive Vice President and Director. Jobs served as Chairman and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of Pixar.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/53184/Misunderstood-Masterpieces:-Howard-the-Duck.htm|title=Advertisement Misunderstood Masterpieces: Howard the Duck  |publisher=411mania }}</ref>
[[File:PixarNov09.jpg|thumb|A large model of the animated lamp from ''Luxo Jr'' at Pixar's studio in Emeryville.]]
Initially, Pixar was a high-end [[computer hardware]] company whose core product was the [[Pixar Image Computer]], a system primarily sold to government agencies and the medical community. One of the buyers of Pixar Image Computers was Disney Studios, which was using the device as part of their secretive [[CAPS (Computer Animation Production System)|CAPS]] project, using the machine and custom software to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2-D animation process to a more automated and thus efficient method. The Image Computer never sold well.<ref name="ohio" /> In a bid to drive sales of the system, Pixar employee [[John Lasseter]]<U+2014>who had long been creating short demonstration animations, such as ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'', to show off the device's capabilities<U+2014>premiered his creations at [[SIGGRAPH]], the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.<ref name="ohio">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/pixar.html|title=Pixar Animation Studios  |publisher=[[Ohio State University]] }}</ref>

As poor sales of Pixar's computers threatened to put the company out of business, Lasseter's animation department began producing computer-animated commercials for outside companies. Early successes included campaigns for [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]], [[Listerine]], and [[Life Savers|LifeSavers]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.usask.ca/alumni/alumnisite/publications/green_white/issues/winter2007/cover_story.php|title=Toy Stories and Other Tales |publisher=[[University of Saskatchewan]] }}</ref> In April 1990 Jobs sold Pixar's hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximate 100 employees. The same year Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pixar-Animation-Studios-Company-History.html Pixar Animation Studios -- Company History]</ref>
During this period, Pixar continued its relationship with [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner. In 1991, after a tough start of the year when about 30 employees in the company's computer department had to go (including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad),<ref>[http://hem.passagen.se/des/hocg/hocg_1990.htm History of Computer Graphics: 1990-99]</ref> which reduced the total number of employees to just 42,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/hard-times-for-innovator-in-graphics.html Hard Times For Innovator In Graphics]</ref> Pixar made a $26 million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was ''[[Toy Story]]''. At that point, the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and CAPS, and Lasseter<U+2019>s animation department, who made television commercials and a few shorts for [[Sesame Street]], was all that was left of Pixar.<ref>[http://www.allaboutstevejobs.com/bio/long/06.html all about Steve Jobs - Long Bio (6/11)]</ref>

Despite the total income of these products, the company was still losing money, and Jobs often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994, Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies, among them Microsoft. Only after confirming that Disney would distribute ''[[Toy Story]]'' for the 1995 holiday season did he decide to give it another chance.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=1995-09-18|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/09/18/206099/index.htm|title=Steve Jobs' Amazing Movie Adventure Disney Is Betting On computerdom's Ex-boy Wonder To Deliver This Year's Animated Christmas Blockbuster.

===Disney===
Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7277295_ITM|title=Sequels to `Toy Story,' `Tail,' `Dragonheart' go straight to video. |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] | first=John | last=Hartl | date=July 31, 2000}}</ref> Pixar's first five feature films have collectively grossed more than $2.5 billion, equivalent to the highest per-film average gross in the industry. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled [[Film marketing|marketing]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]]. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html|title=Disney trying to patch things up with Pixar |publisher=Movies Online }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/29/news/companies/pixar_disney/|title=Pixar dumps Disney  |publisher=CNN | date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then Disney Chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]] made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/01/62104|title=Pixar Says 'So Long' to Disney |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>  Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying ''Cars'' was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm|title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars|author= Grover, Ronald|publisher=Business Week |date=2004-12-09|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. (In contrast to the earlier Disney/Pixar deal ''Ratatouille'' was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee.) The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/26/pixar_perfectionists_cook_up_ratatouille/|title=Pixar Perfectionists Cook Up 'Ratatouille' As Latest Animated Concoction |publisher=Star Pulse }}</ref>

===Acquisition by Disney===
Disney announced on January 24, 2006 that it had agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an [[Stock swap|all-stock deal]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/ | date=January 24, 2006 | work=CNN | title=Disney buys Pixar | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}</ref> Following Pixar [[shareholder]] approval, the acquisition was completed May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority shareholder of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors.<ref name="agrees">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4 Billion Deal  |publisher=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | date=January 25, 2006}}</ref> Jobs' new Disney holdings exceed holdings belonging to ex-CEO [[Michael Eisner]], the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus [[Roy E. Disney]], who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares.

As part of the deal, Pixar co-founder [[John Lasseter]], by then Executive [[Vice President]], became [[Creative director|Chief Creative Officer]] (reporting to President and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Robert Iger]] and consulting with Disney Director Roy Disney) of both Pixar and the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], which designs and builds the company's [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name="agrees" /> Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Bob Iger and [[Dick Cook]], chairman of [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studio Entertainment]]. Steve Jobs' position as Pixar's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was also removed, and instead he took a place on the Disney [[board of directors]].<ref name="buys pixar">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/|title=Disney buys Pixar |publisher=CNN | date=January 24, 2006 | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}</ref>
[[File:John Lasseter-Up-66th Mostra.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|John Lasseter appears with characters from ''Up'' at the 2009 Venice Film Festival.]]
Lasseter and Catmull's oversight of both the Disney and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate [[entity]], a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000119312506012082/dex21.htm

Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would  remain in its current [[Emeryville, California]] location with the "Pixar" sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be "Disney<U+2022>Pixar" (beginning with ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'').<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-22|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&p_theme=oktb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10F4A5FB9BD5E290&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Sale unlikely to change Pixar culture   |publisher=Inside Bay Area | first1=Matthew | last1=Bunk | date=January 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Expansion===
On April 20, 2010, Pixar Animation Studios opened a new studio in the downtown area of Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], Canada, named the Glenn McQueen Pixar Animation Center, after Canadian-born Pixar animator [[Glenn McQueen]] who died in 2002 (''[[Finding Nemo]]'' was dedicated to him).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2010-04-20|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Pixar+Canada+sets+home+base+Vancouver+looks+expand/2927398/story.html|title=Pixar Canada sets up home base in Vancouver, looks to expand|publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The roughly 2,000 square meters studio, is primarily producing shorts and TV-specials based on characters from Pixar's feature films.

===Traditions===
While some of Pixar's first animators were former [[Traditional animation|cel animators]], including John Lasseter, they also came from [[stop motion]] animation or [[computer animation]] or had recently graduated from college.<ref name="pixar story"/> A large number of animators that make up the animation department at Pixar were hired around the time Pixar released ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.  Although ''[[Toy Story]]'' was a successful film, it was Pixar's only feature film at the time. The majority of the animation industry was, and is still located in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], while Pixar is located {{convert|350|mi}} north in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Also, traditional [[Animation|2-D animation]] was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.

Not many Los Angeles-based animators were willing to move their families so far north, give up traditional animation, and try computer animation. Partly because of this, animators hired at Pixar around this time either came directly from college, or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software [[Marionette (software)|(Marionette)]] is designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum of training before becoming productive.<ref name="pixar story"/>

In an interview with [[PBS]] talk show host [[Tavis Smiley]],<ref name="Tavis">{{cite web |author =Smiley, Tavis |title =Tavis Smiley |date =2007-01-24 |publisher=[[PBS]] |url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200701/20070124_transcript.html#2 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> John Lasseter said that Pixar films follow the same theme of self improvement as the company itself has:  with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family. At the core, Lasseter said, "it's gotta be about the growth of the main character, and how he changes."<ref name="Tavis"/>

Pixar has been criticized for its lack of female protagonists.<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Sciretta|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/does-pixar-have-a-problem-creating-good-female-characters/|title=Does Pixar Have a Problem Crating Good Female Characters?|publisher=Slashfilm|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Natalie|last=Wilson|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/10/26/pixar%E2%80%99s-one-man-band/|title=Pixar's One-Man Band|publisher=Ms. Magazine Blog|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', Pixar's thirteenth theatrical release, will be the studio's first movie with a female lead (voiced by [[Reese Witherspoon]]).

===Sequels===
''[[Toy Story 2]]'' was commissioned by Disney as a [[direct-to-video]], 60-minute film. When Disney executives saw how impressive the work-in-progress imagery for the sequel was, they decided it should be reworked as a theatrical release. The resulting change in status of ''Toy Story 2'' was one of the major causes of the [[Toy Story 2#Production|disagreement]] between the two companies that nearly led to a split. ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' was the second theatrical sequel when it was released on June 18, 2010. ''[[Cars 2]]'', the studio's third theatrical sequel, is scheduled for release on June 24, 2011.

Pixar is not against sequels, but believe that they should only be made if they can come up with a story as good as the original. Following the release of ''Toy Story 2'', Pixar and Disney had a [[gentlemen's agreement]] that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their right to do so. In 2004, after Pixar announced their unsuccessful attempt to make a new deal, Disney announced that they would go ahead with sequels to Pixar's films with or without Pixar, although they stated they would prefer Pixar to agree to work on them. ''Toy Story 3'' was put into pre-production at the new CGI division of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], [[Circle 7 Animation]].

When Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the merger, he stated that all sequels were immediately to be put on hold, with Disney going so far as to actually state that ''Toy Story 3'' had been cancelled. However, in May 2006, it was announced that ''Toy Story 3'' was back in pre-production, now under Pixar's control.

Lasseter further fueled speculation on future sequels when he stated, "If we have a great story, we'll do a sequel".<ref>{{cite web |author=Douglas, Edwards|title=Pixar Mastermind John Lasseter|date=2006-06-03|publisher=comingsoon.net|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14741|accessdate =2007-03-01}}</ref>  ''Cars 2'', Pixar's first sequel not based on ''Toy Story'', was officially announced on April 8, 2008. ''Monsters, Inc. 2'' was announced on April 22, 2010, for release on November 2, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8639142.stm|title=Disney announce Monsters Inc sequel|date=23 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>

===Expansion to television===
''Toy Story'' was the first Pixar film to be extended into television, with the [[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins|''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' film]] and [[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command|TV series]]. ''Cars'' was expanded to television via ''[[Cars Toons]]'', a series of shorts (three to five minutes) running between regular [[Disney Channel]] shows and featuring [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] (the tow truck voiced by comedian [[Larry the Cable Guy]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Cars Toons Coming In October To Disney Channel|publisher=AnimationWorldNetwork|date= 2008-09-26|url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=24887|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref>

===Animation and live-action===
All Pixar films to date have computer-animated features (''[[WALL-E]]'' has so far been the only Pixar film to not be completely animated, featuring a small live-action element).  ''[[1906 (film)|1906]]'', the live action film by [[Brad Bird]] about the [[1906 earthquake|1906 San Francisco earthquake]] is currently in development. Bird has stated that he was "interested in moving into the live action realm with some projects" while "staying at Pixar [because] it's a very comfortable environment for me to work in."

===Unfinished projects===
[[File:Newtlogo.jpg|thumb|Pixar's cancelled film project logo, ''Newt''.]]
''Newt'' was a film project announced by Pixar in 2008 that was supposed to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2012.<ref name="DP2008">{{cite news|title=The Walt Disney Studios Rolls Out Slate of 10 New Animated Motion Pictures Through 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Company, via PRNewswire|date=2008-04-08|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-08-2008/0004789174|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref> The film was to focus on the last two blue-footed newts in existence; they are destined to mate to save their species from extinction, but circumstances make the situation more complicated. Writer and director [[Gary Rydstrom]] explained, "Newt is smart but he's never had to think for himself and is pampered. Brooke on the other hand is streetwise and not to be messed with. It<U+2019>s fair to say it<U+2019>s about as bad as first dates can get!"<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Cars 2 & A Ton More 'Toons | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = 2008-04-09 | url = http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22336 | accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref>

When ''Newt'' was first announced in April 2008, the film was planned to be released in June 2012, to be followed by the fantasy film ''The Bear and the Bow''.<ref name="DP2008"/> Two years later, Disney/Pixar announced that, instead, ''The Bear and the Bow'' would be released first, under the new name ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', with a sequel to the 2001 Pixar feature ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' following later that year.<ref name="Slash">{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/04/22/pixar-to-release-monsters-inc-sequel-and-brave-in-2012/|title=Pixar to Release Monsters Inc Sequel and Brave in 2012|author=Peter Sciretta|work=/Film.com|date=2010-04-22|accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> At the April 2010 announcement, Disney/Pixar did not provide an updated release date for ''Newt''.

Disney/Pixar animation head John Lasseter "declined to comment," but a separate source from within the studio stated that "We have taken ''Newt'' off of our development schedule to allow our creative teams to focus on these upcoming projects", those projects being ''Cars 2'', ''Brave'', and ''Monsters, Inc. 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/13/newt-canceled/ | title=Disney/Pixar source says 'Newt' off development schedule | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | author=Kate Ward | accessdate=2010-06-04 | date=2010-05-13}}</ref> Pixar's [[Facebook]] page confirmed the cancellation in September 2010 by showing the production artwork.<ref name="cancelled">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/05/12/pixars-newt-officially-canceled/ |title=Pixar<U+2019>s Newt Officially Canceled |author=Peter Sciretta |date=May 12, 2010 |work= |publisher=/Film |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}</ref>
