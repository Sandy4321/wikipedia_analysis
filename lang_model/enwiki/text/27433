'''Ruthie Collins''' (born 1989) is an [[American people|American]] musician, [[singer-songwriter]], banjo player, and guitarist.

==Biography==
She was born in [[New York]], currently lives in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], and sings like an authentic Bluegrasser.

She was raised on a beautiful 13 acre grape farm that has been in her family for 200 years.

She was the baby of four girls; started singing, playing piano and violin under her mom's guidance at age 3. She added guitar to the list later on.

When she was 18, she left her tiny town and headed to [[Boston]]. She attended Berklee College of Music for 3 1/2 years, just one semester shy of graduating. She moved to Nashville in 2006 to be a songwriter.

Since moving there, she has fallen in love with that city. She spent a few years in a duo called [[Wild Honey (duo)|Wild Honey]] with her friend Victoria Gibson. They were on the first season (2008) of CMT's [[Can You Duet]] and made it all the way to sixth place.

She has been lucky to work with some of the most amazing writers in town, Nathan Chapman, (Taylor Swift) Steve Bogard, ("Carried Away" George Straight, "Praying for Daylight" Rascal Flatts), Jeff Cohen ("Holy Water" Big and Rich) and some other writers.

This blonde, blue-eyed singer loves vintage and the countryside: "I am a really old-fashioned person living in 2014," Collins says. "I drive a 1984 Jeep Wagoneer with wood paneling, but there's a backup camera and an iPod dock. I am obsessed with rustic farmhouse decor. I have a garden. All these things are very country, we just don't always think about young women in that way..."<ref>Ruthie Collins Official Website "[http://ruthiecollinsmusic.com]" ''Ruthie Collins''.

On Tuesday, December 16, 2014, Sidewalk/Curb Records released Ruthie's 
debut self-titled six song EP for digital download.<ref>PRNewswire "[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/singersongwriter-ruthie-collins-launches-debut-ep-ramblin-man-earns-place-on-siriusxm-hot-45-chart-300010976.html]" ''PR Newswire''. Retrieved on 2015-01-27.</ref>

It includes a cover of [[Hank Williams]]' 1953 chart-topper hit "Ramblin' Man", as well as five tunes she has composed: "Heartstrong", "Get Drunk and Cry", "Ready To Roll", "Trainwreckin'", and "Vintage".

She is inspired by artists like [[Tom Petty]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Patty Griffin]] and [[The Beatles]].
