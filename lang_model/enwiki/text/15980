'''Architects''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[metalcore]] band from [[Brighton]], [[England]], formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Sam Carter, [[drummer]] Dan Searle and his twin brother,<ref name="Allmusic-bio"/> [[guitarist]] and [[keyboardist]] Tom Searle and Alex Dean on [[bass guitar]]. The band went through several name changes before they decided upon Architects. Their first name was ''Inharmonic'', which was swiftly changed to ''Counting the Days''. After a couple of years this was in turn changed to Architects. They have released five studio albums and one split ep with Dead Swans.

They released their debut album [[Nightmares (Architects album)|Nightmares]] in 2006 on In At The Deep End records. After their original vocalist, Matt Johnson, left Carter joined and made his first appearance on Architects second album [[Ruin (album)|Ruin]] released in 2007 through United By Fate records. In 2009 the band released [[Hollow Crown]] through their current record label [[Century Media]]. They then released their fourth album [[The Here And Now]] in 2011, which showed the band step in a more melodic "clean-cut post-hardcore" direction.<ref name="exclaim.ca-DB-Harms"/> Upon its release the album received critical acclaim but was extensively panned by their fanbase.<ref name="exclaim.ca-DB-Zorgdrager">{{cite web|url = http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/architects-daybreaker | title = Architects - Daybreaker <U+2022> Metal Reviews <U+2022> exclaim.ca | author = Bradley Zorgdrager | work = | publisher = [[Exclaim.ca]] | date = | accessdate = 7 July 2012 | quote = }}</ref> The next year Architects returned to their original style with their fifth album [[Daybreaker (Architects album)|Daybreaker]], with more [[Music and politics|politicised]] lyrics<ref name="Bigcheese-DB review">{{cite web|url = http://www.bigcheesemagazine.com/albums/article/architects-daybreaker | title = Architects - Daybreaker &#124; Album Reviews &#124; Big Cheese Magazine | author = Paul Hagen | publisher = [[Big Cheese (magazine)|Big Cheese]] | date = 28 May 2012 | accessdate = 7 July 2012 | quote = }}</ref> as opposed to the violent and comedic lyrics that can be heard throughout their older work.<ref name="Allmusic-bio"/>

==Biography==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2012}}

===Formation and Nightmares (2004-2006)===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Architects was founded in 2004. Before Architects, all members of the band had their own musical projects. In 2006 the band's original bassist, Tim Lucas, decided to leave the band to pursue his academic career. He was replaced by Alex Dean. The band had travelled around the UK on many tours supporting a number of different bands in support of their debut album ''Nightmares''. Because of the age of the band members in the early years they had to book weeks of holiday off at college in order to do tours round the country.<ref name="Metalhammer-hype band"/>

===Changing of lead vocalist and signing to Century Media (2007<U+2013>2009)===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
In January 2007, after a lengthy tour around the country as an opening act to [[SikTh]] and Dead Man In Reno, Architects original vocalist Matt Johnson left the band. Dan Searle said that after Johnson left the band they all saw Sam Carter performing with other local bands and decided it was an "easy choice".<ref name="Lords of metal-sept2008"/> When Carter joined as the bands new lead vocalist he made his on-stage d<U+00E9>but by performing the song "The Darkest Tomb".{{Citation needed| date = July 2012}} After this amicable departure, Matt Johnson went on to form the band [[Whitemare]] with ex-members of [[Johnny Truant]] and Centurion, and also briefly Architects guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook on bass. They released their second album ''[[Ruin (album)|Ruin]]'' on 26 June 2007.

In early 2008 released a [[Split EP]] with UK band ''Dead Swans''. The split EP featured two songs from each artist Architects' contributed: ''We're All Alone'' and ''Broken Clocks''. While ''Dead Swans'' contributed: ''In the Half Light'' and ''Swallow''. The song We're All Alone was later worked into ''Hollow Crown''. The split EP was well recieved by British publications with review scores of 7/10 from [[Metal Hammer]],<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482571 | title = Metal Hammer review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Marianne Harris | work = [[Metal Hammer]] | publisher = [[Future plc]] | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> 8/10 from [[Rock Sound]],<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482581 | title = Rock Sound review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Dan Morgan | work = [[Rock Sound]] | publisher = [[Freeway Press]] | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> A 7.5 was given by [[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]] for Architects' side of the ep<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/32482608 | title = Terrorizer review of Dead Swans split Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = | work = [[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]] | publisher = [[Dark Arts Ltd]] | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> and four "K"s out of 5 from [[Kerrang!]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.myspace.com/architectsuk/photos/26410020 | title = Kerrang review of Dead Swans Split E.P Photos from ARCHITECTS (ARCHITECTS) on Myspace | author = Katie Parsons | work = [[Kerrang!]] | publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]] | date = March 2008 | accessdate = 7 August 2012 | quote = }}</ref> The release was followed by a double headed tour of the UK.

In May 2008 Architects announced that they had been signed to [[Century Media Records]] for a three album deal.

The band recorded the album in July 2008 after the announcement of joining Century Media's rooster.<ref name="Blabbermouth-century signing"/> Dan Searle in interview was asked why the band gave it the title and he stated "depending on who you ask in the band!

On 19 January 2011 Architects' fourth album [[The Here and Now]] was released. ''The Here and Now'' was recorded across 2010 from May till June at ''The Omen Room Studios'' in [[California]]. The album was seen as going in a more commercial direction from the rest of the bands work.<ref name="Punktastic-THAN Review">{{cite web|url = http://punktastic.com/reviews/architects-the-here-and-now/ | title = Architects <U+2013> The Here And Now &#124; Punktastic | publisher = [[Punktastic]] | date = 5 January 2011 | accessdate = 15 July 2012 | quote = }}</ref> The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US [[Top Heatseekers]] album charts and number 57 on the [[UK Album Charts]].<ref name="Blabbermouth-Daybreaker"/> Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in a interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: "I completely understand that we are <U+201C>known<U+201D> for being a technical band but it<U+2019>s just not what we want to write anymore, I think if you look at the way we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming.

In February 2011, Architects announced the departure of bassist Alex Dean, due to family commitments. On 3 July 2011 it was announced that Dean had rejoined the band. When Dean commented on the short 5 month split from the band he said "I<U+2019>m very happy to be able to say that I<U+2019>m back, being able to stay at home for the past few months have given my family and I the opportunity to adjust to what happened last year and I know it<U+2019>s done us all a lot of good."<ref name="Alex Dean departs and rejoins"/> During this period where Dean was not apart of the band [[Casey Lagos]] filled in as a bass guitarist on some of the tours.<ref name="UTGR-Casey Lagos"/>

In April 2011 [[Bring Me the Horizon]] as part of their ongoing support for their third album on their international [[There Is a Hell...

It started with a European tour, starting in the [[United Kingdom]] with [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] as the opening support for the UK and [[dubstep]] group [[Tek-one]] opening for the remainder of continental Europe. On 28 April Matt Nicholls broke his arm whilst playing football with members of Bring Me the Horizon, Parkway Drive and Architects, and instead of cancelling the tour Architects' drummer Dan Searle filled in as the drummer, this meant that Bring Me the Horizon's setlist was halved in length.<ref name="mattbreaks arm">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/bring-me-the-horizon-drummer-breaks-arm/|title=Bring Me The Horizon Drummer Breaks Arm|publisher=[[Metal Hammer]]|author=James Gill|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> This European Tour Lasted till late August.
