'''Alphabet Energy''' is a [[startup]] company founded in 2009 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[thermoelectrics]] expert [[Matthew L. Scullin]] and [[Peidong Yang]]. The company utilizes [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] applications to create [[thermoelectric generator]]s that are more cost effective than previously manufactured devices. The company is now based in [[Hayward, California]]. The company started with a license to use a silicon nanowire developed at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].<ref>[http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2014/07/22/alphabet-energy-wants-to-be-the-intel-of-waste-heat-recovery/]</ref><ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528841/thermoelectric-material-to-hit-market-later-this-year/]</ref><ref>[http://cases.haas.berkeley.edu/promo/2012_2_alphabet_5717.pdf]</ref>

Alphabet holds more than 50 patents related to the capture of [[waste heat]] for purposes of electricity generation. The company is working with [[tetrahedrite]], a common mineral with thermoelectric properties. The company launched its first pilot project in June 2014, with [[Encana Corporation]], with an installation on a remote oil pipeline station.

The book ''[[The Lean Startup]]'' describes Alphabet Energy's approach to product development as an example of the successful practice of the book's principles.

Alphabet has raised $30 million in venture capital funding to date from Claremont Creek, [[TPG Capital]] and the California Clean Energy Fund. The company<U+2019>s name, based on the word alpha, comes from its use as term for a [[thermoelectric effect|Seebeck coefficient]], as well as Scullin's home town of [[Alphabet City, Manhattan]].
