'''Jack Banham Coggins''' (July 10, 1911 &ndash; January 30, 2006) was an illustrator, author, and artist, who is best known in the United States for his [[oil paintings]] of predominantly [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] subjects and for his books on [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. 

Coggins wrote and illustrated many books, covering a wide range of subjects, and provided numerous illustrations for advertisements, magazine articles, and magazine covers. During World War II, he served as an artist and correspondent for ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|YANK]]'' magazine in the United Kingdom and Europe, capturing war time scenes from the front lines.

Coggins produced in excess of 1000 paintings during his long career, and taught master art classes for 45 years. He retired in May 2001 at nearly 90 years of age and died at his home in Pennsylvania in January 2006.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Coggins was born in in his father's military barracks in [[London]], [[England]] on July 10, 1911, the only child of Ethel May (n<U+00E9>e Dobby) and Sidney George Coggins. Sidney Coggins was the Riding Master of the [[1st Regiment of Life Guards|First Regiment]] of [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]], the elite cavalry of the British Army.<ref name ="berks">{{cite journal

===Education===
While his father served with the Life Guards Regiment in France during [[World War I]], Coggins and his mother lived with family in [[Folkestone|Folkestone, Kent]]. He attended the [[Imperial Service College]], a public school preferred by army families. After moving to [[New York]], Coggins enrolled at Roslyn High School in [[Roslyn Heights, New York|Roslyn Heights]] where he found difficulty in adjusting to the difference between military school in England and New York city public school.<ref name = "berks"/>

Coggins enjoyed "fiddling around with drawing" and his family had not discouraged him; after graduation from Roslyn in 1928 at age 17, he enrolled in the New York City [[Grand Central School of Art]] and studied under such eminent painters as [[Edmund Greacen]], George Pearse Ennis, and Wayman Adams. In the early years, he painted constantly but not professionally; to support himself he painted advertising signs.<ref name = "outre"/> With a concentrated grounding in fine art techniques, Coggins graduated to the [[Art Students League of New York]], where he studied from 1933 to 1934 under noted artist [[Frank DuMond]].

===Marriage and later life===

Coggins's interest in sailing and maritime subjects began in London when h would sail model yachts on the famous [[Round Pond]] in Kensington Gardens. This interest developed into a life-long passion during his teens when he sailed small craft on [[Hempstead Harbor]], near his new home on Long Island.<ref name = "berks"/> Coggins's interest in military subjects was due to his father's military service and his early education in a military school. During the early years of World War II, Coggins took a sampling of his war illustrations to Worthen Paxton, the art director of ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE Magazine]]'', who commissioned Coggins to produce a drawing of an imaginary coastal invasion of England.<ref>{{cite journal

Because of the quality of his maritime illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] to provide artwork for a planned children's book about the U.S. Navy. The author was to be [[Fletcher Pratt]], a well known military historian, and the publisher sent Coggins to meet him. Their common interest in maritime history created a lasting friendship and a fruitful association between the two men. 

Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's ''Naval Game'', based on a [[Wargaming|wargame]] developed by [[Fred T. Jane]] involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built on a scale of one inch to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula.<ref name = "outre"/> The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was ''Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy'', a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.<ref name = "outre"/>

Coggins was called up for Army service, and enlisted on April 8, 1943.<ref name = "archive">Military Personnel Records, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives, St. Louis, Missouri.</ref> He was pulled from basic training at Fort Eustis, Virginia before he could complete it to work as an illustrator for ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|YANK]]'' magazine; a U.S. Army weekly magazine "by the men<U+2026>for the men, in the service". He was originally introduced to the Commanding Officer and Editor of ''YANK'', [[Franklin S. Forsberg|Colonel Franklin Forsberg]], by Fletcher Pratt.<ref name = "outre"/> On May 20, 1943, Coggins commenced work at the head office of ''YANK'' in New York, where he worked until his departure for Britain on October 14 of the same year.<ref name = "archive"/> Jack Coggins became a naturalized citizen of the United States on August 19, 1943.<ref>Naturalization Records, Southern District Court, New York</ref> 

Coggins served as an artist for British ''YANK'' in London until August 8, 1945 and was discharged from the U.S. Army on November 3, 1945.<ref name = "archive"/> While in Britain, Coggins spent time on a [[Royal Navy]] convoy in the [[North Sea]], witnessed the bombing of [[Saint-L<U+00F4>]], and flew over [[Berlin]] in a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bomber]].

After returning to New York from his war service, Coggins found that many of the outlets for his pre-war work had dried up. A friend, who had resigned from [[Hunter College]], suggested that Coggins apply for the position. His application was successful and he taught watercolor painting at Hunter College from 1948 to 1953. In New York, as a result of his friendship with Fletcher Pratt, Coggins was introduced to the [[Hydra Club]] where he met [[Judith Merril]] and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. Coggins was also invited to join Pratt's [[Trap Door Spiders]] club where he became closely associated with [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Isaac Asimov]]. The contact with such visionaries, in addition to his exposure to the German [[V-2 Rocket|V2]] rockets in Europe, served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel, rockets, and science fiction.<ref name = "outre"/>

During the 1950s Coggins illustrated covers for [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] [[science fiction magazine]]s, most notably ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories|Thrilling Wonder Stories]]''. During the late 1940s and early 1950s Coggins's marine art was featured on covers of [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting Magazine]]<ref>

In 1951 and 1952, Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books: ''Rockets, Jets, Guided Missiles & Space Ships'', and ''By Space Ship to the Moon''. The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel which swept the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s,<ref name = "outre"/> and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages.<ref>
