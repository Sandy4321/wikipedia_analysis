Aerosols are characterized by a [[particle size distribution]] function (PSD). Most natural aerosols have a [[lognormal distribution]].

Aerosol formation and growth consists of 3 processes:

# Nucleation
# Coagulation/Agglomeration
# Surface Growth

Aerosol dynamics is characterized by a single differential equation called as the Aerosol General Dynamic Equation (GDE).

<math>\frac{\partial{N_k}}{\partial{t}}+\nabla.n_kv=\nabla.D\nabla_k+ \left[\frac{\partial{n_k}}{\partial{t}}\right]_{growth}+ \left[\frac{\partial{n_k}}{\partial{t}}\right]_{coagulation} -\nabla.cn_k</math>

where J is the nucleation rate, <math>\beta</math> is the coagulation kernel and G is the growth rate.

The common methods to solve the GDE are:

# Moment method
# Modal/Sectional Method
# Quadrature Method of Moments.

== Nucleation ==

Nucleation is the process of forming particles from a purely gaseous precursor phase.

There are two types of nucleation processes, 
# '''homogenous nucleation''' 
# '''heterogeneous nucleation'''. 

Nucleation occurs for different reasons. Important among them, is the supersaturation of a vapor. When a hot vapor in a gas is cooled down, its supersaturation ratio increases, and it becomes supersaturated. Therefore, it "precipitates out" into particles. This process is called nucleation.

== Coagulation ==

When particles are present in an aerosol they collide with each other. During that they may undergo coalescence or aggregation. This process leads to a change in the aerosol size distribution 
function.

== Surface Growth ==

Surface growth is the process by which an aerosol particle grows with the accretion of monomers or individual molecules to an already existent particle.
