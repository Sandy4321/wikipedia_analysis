In mineralogy, a '''symplectite''' (or '''symplektite''') is a very fine intergrowth of two or more distinct [[mineral]] phases. Symplectites are largely considered to result from the breakdown of unstable minerals. 

If, during cooling or [[metamorphism]], a rock undergoes a rapid temperature or pressure drop, some minerals may be rendered unstable and will consequently decay and [[Crystallization|crystallise]] as more stable constituents. Symplectites are usually considered to be the result of such a process.

Symplectites may be due to a [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] between adjacent phases or to [[exsolution]] of a rapidly cooling [[solid solution]]. Exsolution symplectite may be used as temperature proxies.<ref name=Passchier>Passchier, Cees W. and Rudolph A. J. Trouw, ''Microtectonics,'' Springer, 2nd ed. 205 p. 231 ISBN 978-3-540-64003-5</ref> They may be lamellar or globular. Lamellar symplectites are common in [[eclogite]] formed during retrograde metamorphism. ''Kelyphitic structures'' are symplectites formed around [[olivine]] containing [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[spinel]] or [[garnet]].<ref name=Passchier/> [[Myrmekite]] is a globular or bulbous symplectite of [[quartz]] in [[plagioclase]] resulting from the dissolution of potassium feldspar in high grade metamorphic or igneous rocks.<ref name=Passchier/>
