'''The Monster Ball Tour''' was the second worldwide [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]]. Staged in support of her album ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011. Described as "the first-ever pop electro opera" by Gaga, the tour was announced in October 2009 after an intended joint concert tour with hip-hop artist [[Kanye West]] was suddenly canceled. The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of ''The Fame Monster'', in November 2009.

A revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances, due to Gaga's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time. The stage of the original show looked like a frame, comparable to that of a hollowed-out television set. Since ''The Fame Monster'' dealt with the [[paranoia]]s Gaga had faced, the main theme of the original shows became human evolution, while elements of the canceled tour with West still included in some parts. From 2010 and onwards, the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city, where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to "the Monster Ball". Both versions of the show were divided into five segments, with the last being the encore. Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits, singing songs related to the concept of the segment, and was followed by a video interlude.

Contemporary critics commend Gaga's singing abilities and sense of style and fashion. They were also impressed by the theatricality of the show, comparing it to the tours of artists like [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Monster Ball was a commercial success, with sold-out shows and demand for tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed a total of US $227.4&nbsp;million, from 200&nbsp;reported shows, drawing an estimated audience of 2.5&nbsp;million. The Monster Ball Tour became the highest-grossing tour by a debut headlining artist, and one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest grossing tours of all time]]. At the 2010 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter being an acknowledgment of her partnership with sponsor [[Virgin Mobile]]. 

[[HBO]] filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, the special, titled ''[[Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden]]'', aired in May and was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on November 21, 2011. The special received mixed review from critics, who found similarities with Madonna's 1990 documentary, ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''.

Initially, [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] artist [[Kanye West]] and Lady Gaga had plans to launch a joint tour in October 2009, known as "[[Fame Kills: Starring Lady Gaga and Kanye West]]".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fame-kills-starring-kanye-west-and-lady-gaga-tour-first-dates-20090911|title="Fame Kills Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga" Tour: First Dates |last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2009-09-11|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref> Following the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], West made a public statement that he would take temporary leave from his recording career due to the media and public reaction towards [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|his outburst during Taylor Swift's acceptance speech]], for winning the VMA for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]].

After assuring the public that she would be embarking on her own tour, Gaga officially announced The Monster Ball Tour on October 15, 2009.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gaga explained that she wanted to put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans.<ref name="rollingstone3"/> She asserted that the tour was a "pop-electro opera" because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an [[opera]]. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage."<ref name="rollingstone3"/> The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured in such a way that the box fit any stage. "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show," she added.<ref name="rollingstone3"/>

The theme of the show was evolution and since the songs on ''The Fame Monster'' represented her paranoias, while developing the tour she spoke about [[original sin]] and demons inside human beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/453125/lady-gagas-monster-ball-tour-the-concept.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's Monster Ball Tour: The Concept|date=2009-11-04|work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> Gaga said, "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another."<ref name="rollingstone3"/> This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was "another level from where we were with the [[The Fame Ball Tour|Fame Ball]]. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.<ref name="rollingstone3"/> 

For the performance of "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew "Matty Dada" Williams. She had a different vision for it in the beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of [[Rapunzel]], the fairy-tale character. He felt that "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [to Gaga] it's not going to look like Rapunzel.'"<ref name="franktalk">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-lady-gaga13-2009dec13,0,632518,full.story|title=Frank talk with Lady Gaga|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=2009-12-13|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2009-12-15}}</ref>

In December 2009, Gaga revealed that she planned to cancel the concept of the original Monster Ball shows, and start afresh.<ref name="revamp">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1628689/lady-gaga-reveals-details-revamped-monster-ball-tour-2010.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Reveals Details Of Revamped Monster Ball Tour For 2010|last=Montogomery|first=James|date=2009-12-23|work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref> She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote ''The Fame Monster''. Hence she was able to put together "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time".<ref name="revamp"/> The revamp of the tour were planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four times the size of the one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back," clarified Gaga.<ref name="revamp"/> The main inspirations behind the show were film musicals like ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), science-fiction film ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), and the television mini-series ''[[Angels in America (TV miniseries)|Angels in America]]'' (2003).<ref name=MTVreview/>

During an interview with London's [[95.8 Capital FM]] radio station, Gaga further elaborated on the changes in the show. She said that the show was constructed like a piece of [[musical theater]]. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old [[musical compositions|musical pieces]], some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself.<ref name="revamp2">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632101/20100217/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Dishes On Revamped Monster Ball Tour |last=Dinh|first=James|date=2010-02-18|accessdate=2010-02-18|work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks}}</ref> A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, "We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', which is what I was playing on the stage. She's a hybrid from all these other instruments."<ref name="revamp2"/> During an interview on [[WKSE|KISS-FM]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]], on his show ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'', Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball, but it had become more of a musical and less of a concert. It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.<ref name="revamp2"/>

A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance.<ref name="franktalk"/> The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death.

They also noted similarities to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1991 documentary ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/lady-gaga-presents-the-monster-ball-tour-at-madison-square-garden/252|title=Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden|last=Schrodt|first=Paul|date=2011-05-01|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref> The special has been nominated for five honors at the upcoming [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]: Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special; Outstanding Directing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special; Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special; Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special (Single or Multi-Camera); and Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/lady-gaga-presents-monster-ball-tour-madison-square-garden|title=Lady GaGa Presents The Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden|publisher=[[Emmy Award]]s.
