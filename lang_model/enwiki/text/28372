'''CSS ''Charleston''''' was an [[casemate ironclad]] [[ram (ship)|ram]] built for the [[Confederate Navy]] (CSN) at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Funded by the [[State of South Carolina]] as well as donations by patriotic women's associations in the city, she was turned over to the Confederate Navy and defended the city until advancing [[Union Army|Union]] troops that threatened Charleston caused her to be destroyed in early 1865 lest she be captured. Her wreck was [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] after the war and the remains have been obliterated by subsequent [[dredging]].

==Construction and description==
[[James M. Eason]] was awarded a contract by the State of South Carolina to build a larger ironclad at Charleston in November 1862 after he finished the casemate ram {{ship|CSS|Chicora}}. Funds were also contributed by the city's "Ladies' Gun-boat Association",<ref>Scharf, pp. 671<U+2013>72</ref> which led to ''Charleston''{{'}}s nickname of the "Ladies' Gunboat". He began construction the next month and completed the ship in September 1863.<ref name=s9/>

''Charleston'' was {{convert|189|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|34|ft|m}}. Her [[Glossary of nautical terms#D|depth of hold]] was {{convert|14|ft|m|1}}<ref name=s9/> and she had a [[draft (hull)|draft]] {{Convert|12|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. The ship had a [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|600|LT|t}}. ''Charleston''{{'}}s propulsion system is unknown,<ref>Gaines, p. 143</ref> but her engine had a diameter of {{convert|36|in}} and her propeller was {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter.<ref name=s71/> At any rate, she was credited with a speed of {{convert|6|kn|lk=in}}. The ship was armed with two 9-inch (229&nbsp;mm) [[smoothbore]] guns<ref name=s9>Silverstone, p. 153</ref> at the ends of the ship,<ref name=l8>Luraghi, p. 278</ref> probably [[Dahlgren gun]]s,<ref>Olmstead, Turk & Tucker, pp. 243<U+2013>44</ref> and four [[Muzzle-loading rifle|muzzle-loading]] [[Brooke rifle]]s on the broadside<ref name=l8/> that fired {{convert|90|-|110|lb|adj=on}} projectiles,<ref name=s71>Scharf, p. 671</ref> which would make them {{convert|7|in|adj=on|0}} guns<ref>Olmstead, Turk & Tucker, p. 126</ref> although their exact type is unknown.<ref>Still, pp. 82<U+2013>83</ref> ''Charleston'' was also fitted with a [[wrought iron|wrought-iron]] [[naval ram|ram]]. The ship's armor was {{convert|4|in|0}} thick. All together, her ram and armor weighed {{convert|600|LT|t|0}}.<ref name=s71/> Her crew numbered 150 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=s9/>

==Service==
Once completed, ''Charleston'' served as the [[flagship]] of the CSN's [[Charleston Squadron]] together with the rams [[CSS Palmetto State|''Palmetto State'']] and ''Chicora''. Her only [[captain (nautical)|captain]] was [[Commander]] [[Isaac N. Brown]]. The ship was set on fire and blown up with {{convert|10|LT|t|0}} of [[gunpowder]] in the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] on the night of 17/18 February 1865 to prevent her capture by the Union Army once the city was evacuated by the Confederates.<ref>Luraghi, pp. 289, 336<U+2013>37, Gaines, p. 143</ref> The wreck was salvaged to a depth of {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} below low water by Benjamin Maillefort in 1872<U+2013>73 and the site has been thoroughly dredged to deepen the channel, destroying any remains.<ref>Gaines, p. 144</ref> Its last known location was at {{coord|32|47|29|N|79|55|21|W|type:event|display=inline,title}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Siege of Charleston|url=http://www.numa.net/expeditions/siege-of-charleston/|publisher=[[National Underwater and Marine Agency]]|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>
