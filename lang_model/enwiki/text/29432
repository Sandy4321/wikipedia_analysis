Rowling]]'s bestselling series ("Hell no, what am I, 8 years old?")<ref name="The Moscow Times">http://context.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/02/20/113.html</ref>, and saying about modern American literature in general "It isn't quite worthy of consideration. It has almost nothing to say about life."<ref name="Russian Journal (English version)"/>, he joined a team some of the best translators employed by the Russian publisher after complaints of poor translating.<ref name="The Moscow Times (PDA)">http://pda.moscowtimes.ru/article.php?aid=178371</ref> Ironically, he has probably become better-known for his Harry Potter translations than for his whole translating career, which spans several decades.<ref name="The Moscow Times"/>
