'''Jack Marsh''' (circa 1874 &ndash; [[May 25]], [[1916]]) was an  [[Australia]]n [[first-class cricket]]er of [[Australian aborigine|Australian aboriginal descent]] who represented [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in six matches from 1900&ndash;01 to 1902&ndash;03. A right-arm [[pace bowling|fast bowler]] of extreme pace, Marsh was a cricketer blessed with high athletic qualities and was regarded as one of the outstanding talents of his era. However, his career was curtailed by continual controversy of the legality of his bowling action; he was no-balled for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]]. As a result of the question marks over his action, Marsh never established himself at first-class level and had no opportunity to be selected to represent [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. Marsh's position in cricket history and his lack of opportunities has often been attributed to racial discrimination.

Born into the [[Bundjalung]] people at [[Yugilbar]] on the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in northern New South Wales, Marsh first made an impression as a professional runner, traveling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action came into scrutiny from the start, being called in 1897 for throwing, but it was not until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] members and [[Test cricket]]ers [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Monty Noble]], but was also called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in [[splint (medicine)|splints]], which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in local competition, Marsh was then selected to make his debut in the [[Sheffield Shield]], where he made an immediate impression and led the first-class averages for the season after three matches. He had been called in his second match by [[Bob Crockett]], but things came to a head in his fourth match when he was no-balled seventeen times by Crockett, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was mixed as to whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories is that Marsh was made a scapegoat in a campaign against throwing and was a convenient target because of his race.

Marsh only played in two more matches, and in a later season, the touring [[English cricket team]] objected to his selection in an opposition team. There were calls for Marsh to be selected for Australia, but Noble, the New South Wales selector refused to select him, citing the controversy over his action. In later years, Marsh turned to alcohol and was jailed after committing an assault. He was killed in a brawl outside a [[Australian pubs|pub]]; two people were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted.

== Early years ==

Born a member of the [[Bundjalung]] people at [[Yugilbar]] on the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in northern New South Wales, Marsh's surname is believed to have possibly derived from that of [[Francis Henry Marsh]], whose property ''Camira'', was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range.<ref name="adb">{{cite web|first=Bernard |last=Whimpress |title= Marsh, Jack (c. 1874 - 1916) |publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |accessdate=2007-12-19|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10322b.htm|year=2005}}</ref> Marsh first made an impression in the sporting arena as a professional runner, following his brother Larry to the Sydney athletics tracks in 1893. A sprinter and hurdler, Marsh had a number of wins in notable races. Aside from his victories in [[New South Wales]], he also traveled interstate to [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria]] to compete.<Ref name="az">Cashman, pp. 189&ndash;189.</ref> As with a number of indigenous runners, Marsh was exploited by his trainer and was suspended for "[[match fixing|running stiff]]" in Sydney in 1895.<ref name="adb"/>

==Club cricket ==

Marsh began playing cricket in the competition based around [[Moore Park]], near the centre of Sydney. He began competing for [[South Sydney Cricket Club|South Sydney]].<ref name="az"/> Marsh's cricket career was surrounded by controversy from the outset. In November 1897, he was no-balled for throwing by William Curran in a match for South Sydney against Paddington.<Ref name="w44">Whimpress, p. 44.</ref> Marsh then played for Sydney Cricket Club after it merged with South Sydney.<Ref name="az"/> Marsh's second no-ball incident at the level came when when he played for a Colts XV against the New South Wales state team in a trial match in November 1900 before the start of the 1900&ndash;01 [[Sheffield Shield]] season. Curran called him on the first day of the match. Marsh had an eventful day, when he bowled Test batsmen [[Victor Trumper]], [[Frank Iredale]] and future Test player [[Bert Hopkins]].<ref name="w44"/> Trumper was widely regarded as the finest batsman of his age, which was regarded as the "golden age" of cricket, and he was seen as one of the most stylish batsmen of all time.<Ref>Cashman, p. 305.</ref><Ref>{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Victor Trumper|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7980.html|accessdate=2007-12-28|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref><Ref>{{cite web|title=Trumper, Victor Thomas (1877 - 1915) | publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |accessdate=2007-12-28|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120303b.htm}}</ref> Marsh also collected the prize scalps of Test batsmen and future Australian captains [[Monty Noble]] and [[Syd Gregory]].<Ref name="w44"/>

Marsh was so incensed by the calls of throwing that at the end of the day's play, he announced, through a proclamation by Alf Dent, the Sydney club secretary, that he would wear splints when he was bowling the following day. Marsh took this course of action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl at high speed without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and Dent had acquired the requisite splints and bandages from the [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St. Vincent's Hospital]] that was in close proximity, in order to bind Marsh's bowling arm.<Ref name="w44"/> Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action.<Ref name="w45">Whimpress, p. 45.</ref>

Marsh and his club were seeking a speedy resolution to the problem because [[Sheffield Shield]] matches were due to begin in a matter of weeks. They also perceived that there was a danger that other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran's lead and call Marsh, effectively outlawing him, resulting in the loss of the club's leading strike bowler. By wearing the splints, Marsh showed his belief that Curran intended to call him on the second day. This however did not occur, since Curran withdrew from his position by lunch on the second day, believing that he had been humiliated. Curran's withdrawal was widely criticised in the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action.<Ref name="w45"/>

== First-class debut ==

Marsh made his debut at first-class level when he was selected for the New South Wales team to play [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]] in December 1900. This was a little over a month after he was no-balled by Curran. Such a selection indicated the the state selectors were prepared to overrule the judgment of Curran. Marsh was the most successful of the New South Wales bowlers in a high scoring match, taking 5/181. [[Clem Hill]] scored 365 not out, which remains to this day the highest individual score compiled at Adelaide Oval in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match. South Australia's total of 575 was at the time the highest score against New South Wales in the history of the competition.<ref name="w45"/>

Marsh's action was again under the spotlight when he played his second  Shield match in the following week against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]]. While the New South Wales umpire officiating the match, [[Richard Callaway]] was satisfied with the delivery of Marsh, his Victorian counterpart [[Bob Crockett]] was concerned with the twist of Marsh's wrist. Marsh was no-balled by Crockett three times in the match, but Crockett was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively.<Ref name="w46">Whimpress, p. 46.</ref>

The early signs of a conspiracy against Marsh was raised by a journalist from the ''[[Melbourne Age]]'' by the name of ''Old Boy''. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to the official the day before he was called, possibly predisposing Crockett to take action. If ''Old Boy'' could be relied on, then observers suspected Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not elaborate on which ball he found fault in, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in [[England]]. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, [[Jim Phillips]] had already set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler [[Ernie Jones]]. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Aboriginal heritage and his supple wrist action.<Ref name="w46"/>

Marsh's third Sheffield Shield match was a return game against South Australia in January 1901; New South Wales reversed the result of the corresponding match three weeks earlier. New South Wales piled on a mammoth total of 918 before sailing to an innings victory by bowling the visitors out for 157 and 156. Marsh took 5/34 and 5/59 and dismissed the talismanic Hill twice. He bowled six of his opponents and was not questioned by either action.<ref name="w46"/> At this point, Marsh led the first-class averages in bowling, with 21 wickets at 17.38 in just three matches.<Ref name="az"/>

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action came to head for the return match against Victoria in Sydney. The fixture had been originally slated for the [[Australia Day]] weekend but it was postponed by a week when [[Queen Victoria]] died. By the time the match was under way, the public interest in it had started to wane. Some three decades later, J. C. Davis reflected on the match, noting that it stirred many memories, "some fragrant and some rather unpleasant." The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was the continual no-balling of Marsh by Crockett on the grounds of throwing.<Ref name="w47">Whimpress, p. 47.</ref>

New South Wales batted first and were bowled out on the first afternoon for 170. When the Victorians began their response, Marsh was called for throwing three times in his first over, provoking rowdy responses from the spectators. He was no-balled a further two times in his second over and five of the first nine runs accumulated by the visitors came from extras. Despite this, Victoria made a poor start, losing five wickets by the time it had notched 50 runs. Of these, Marsh bowled future Test captain [[Warwick Armstrong]] and [[Peter McAlister]]. Marsh was called a total of 17 times in the innings, the most in a single instance in Australia.<Ref name="w47"/> The calls produced angry reactions from the spectators on the hill of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], who jeered "Crock! Crock! Crock!" as they regarded the umpire, not the bowler's arm, as being crooked. Marsh went on to take 2/68.<Ref name="w47"/>  At one point Marsh lost his cool at being called and deliberately threw three consecutive balls. Despite the repeated calls, the captain [[Syd Gregory]] kept Marsh bowling from the end adjudicated by Crockett, who was suspected of being biased towards his own state, rather than allowing Marsh to be examined by Crockett's partner.<Ref name="w47"/>

== Reaction to Crockett ==

Crockett's calls received a varied response among the media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalists David felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised "uncertainty" while the ''Australasian's'' cricket writer [[Tom Horan]], who went by the pen name ''Felix'', was from Victoria and felt that Marsh was a soft target for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character.<Ref name="w47"/> The previous calling of Marsh by Curran in the local Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base.<Ref name="w48">Whimpress, p. 48.</ref> Crockett was regarded as a tough-minded umpire, much like [[Jim Phillips]] who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. He was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for taking an action that other umpires had evaded. However, when Marsh was switched to bowl from the other end in the second innings of the match, he was passed as fair by the other umpire Sammy Jones. This coincided with his worst ever first class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket.<Ref name="w48"/>

Certain hypotheses were presented for Crockett's actions. At the time Crockett was 37 years old and was ready to emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was the 29th match at first-class level that he had officiated and was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt himself to be ready to be appointed to stand in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then Crockett was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high profile Test player like Noble or [[Jack Saunders]]. The cynics held that it would be easier to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh, an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38 was an ideal target.<Ref name="az"/><ref name="w48"/>

At the time, the alteration to the no-ball law laid down by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1899 had not yet been implemented in Australia first-class cricket and was not implemented until 1901&ndash;02. This change allowed the umpire to call a no-ball from either end, whereas the law previously gave the umpire at the bowler's end the exclusive right to do so. The delayed implementation of the law diluted the power of the umpire, since the bowler could be switched to the other end and been immune from the being called by the first umpire. As a result, Gregory's unwillingness to switch Marsh to the opposite end raised eyebrows among cricket observers.<Ref name="w49">Whimpress, p. 49.</ref> There was pressure from England for the Australian administrators to crack down on dubious bowling actions since English captain [[Archie MacLaren]] had asserted that "If Australia expects an English team next September they will have to play according to the new reading of the law at home."<Ref name="w50">Whimpress, p. 50.</ref> It was speculated that since Crockett was a lifelong employee of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], which was the organiser and the sponsor of the English tours to Australia, he would come under pressure to no-ball bowlers in an attempt to curry favour with the English cricket authorities.<Ref name="w50"/>

== Incidents against England ==

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action reared its head once against during the 1901&ndash;02 season when MacLaren led his English tourists to Australian shores. The English played in a match at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] where Marsh was selected, but MacLaren refused to play against him. Noble, who selected the New South Wales teams, used the complaints about Noble to ignore growing calls to have him selected for the state and Australia. Without state backing, the remainder of Australia's selectors were happy to rely on Noble's veto at state level to ignore Marsh.<Ref name="w50"/><Ref name="az"/>

[[Image:Sydney Barnes.jpg|right|thumb|Marsh's ability was compared to that of Sydney Barnes ''(pictured)''.]]
Two years later against [[Plum Warner]]'s [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] team, there were further calls for Marsh to be selected for the Test team as Australia fell 1&ndash;2 behind in the series. Marsh had taken 5/55 against the Englishmen bowling a mixture of fast bowling and [[off spin]]. No formal complaint about Marsh's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows.<Ref name="w50"/><ref name="w51">Whimpress, p. 51.</ref> The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh's bowling was unfair, with Warner describing him as a <U+201C>shier", a 19th century term for a thrower. Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action. Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no-ball Marsh out of the match inf the Australian Test selectors picked him. As a result, Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first-class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets at and average of 21.47.<Ref name="w51"/> In later years, Marsh also experimented with the [[googly]]. The Australian Test batsman and captain [[Warren Bardsley]] rated Marsh alongside [[Fred Spofforth]] and England's [[Sydney Barnes]].<ref name="az"/> The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20; he took 189 wickets at an average of just 16.43.<Ref>Armstrong, pp. 40&ndash;41.</ref> Bardsley said that the only reason that Marsh was "kept . . . out of big cricket was his color".<Ref name="adb"/> 

Known for his sportsmanship, Marsh had minimal batting skill, with a batting average of 5.00 and he was regarded as an average fielder.<Ref name="w45"/> He played out his days in the Sydney competition and topped the bowling aggregates from 1901 to 1904.<Ref name="az"/> [[Les Poidevin]] described Marsh as "a well set-up, perfectly built . . . man, with an ebony-black, smooth, clear shining skin and twinkling black eyes" who "is quite good looking".<ref name="adb"/> Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;ins (170&nbsp;cm) tall. Photographs of Marsh often show him dressed fashionably in a suit and he sported a moustache.<ref name="adb"/>

== Later years ==

Marsh's cricket career ended in 1905. He returned to his athletic career and in 1906 he ran against [[Arthur Postle]] at a meeting organised by [[John Wren]] in Melbourne. Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, traveling around Australia in a sideshow. His activities thereafter are unclear, but it is likely that he became an itinerant worker.<Ref name="adb"/> After retiring, Marsh drank heavily and he was jailed for assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol problems.<ref name="adb"/> Marsh died after an assault as the result of an argument outside the pool room of the Royal Hotel in [[Orange, New South Wales]]. Two people were charged with manslaughter, but they were acquitted.<Ref name="az"/>
