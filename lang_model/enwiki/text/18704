'''Walter Clement Pipp''' (February 17, 1893 <U+2013> January 11, 1965) was an American [[professional baseball]] player. A [[first baseman]], Pipp played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[New York Yankees]], and [[Cincinnati Reds]] between 1913 and 1928.

After appearing in 12 games for the Tigers in 1913 and playing in the minor leagues in 1914, the Yankees purchased Pipp before the 1915 season and made him their starting first baseman. He and [[Home Run Baker]] led an improved Yankee lineup that led the league in [[home run]]s.  He led the American League in home runs in 1916 and 1917. With [[Babe Ruth]], [[Bob Meusel]], [[Joe Dugan]], and [[Waite Hoyt]], the Yankees won three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and won the [[1923 World Series]]. In 1925, he lost his starting role to [[Lou Gehrig]], after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati.

Pipp is considered to be one of the best [[power hitter]]s of the [[dead ball era]].<ref name=sabr/> Pipp is now best remembered as the man who lost his starting role to [[Lou Gehrig]] at the beginning of Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games. According to a popular legend, Pipp asked to sit due to a headache.

==Early life==
Walter Clement Pipp was born on February 17, 1893, in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Pauline ([[nee]] Stroeber) and William H. Pipp. He was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and different sources describe him as being of [[Irish people|Irish]] or [[Germans|German]] ancestry. He was raised in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].<ref name=sabr/><ref name=si/> As a child, Pipp says he was hit in the head with a [[hockey puck]], which resulted in headaches throughout his life.<ref name=heraldtribune/>

Pipp enrolled at [[The Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he studied architecture. Pipp graduated in 1913.<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1793&pid=11286|title=The Baseball Biography Project: Wally Pipp|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=July 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Baseball career==
===Early career===
In 1912, Pipp made his debut in [[professional baseball]] with the [[Kalamazoo Celery Champs]] of the Class D [[Southern Michigan League]]. In 68 games played, he had a .270 [[batting average]]. The [[Detroit Tigers]] of the [[American League]] purchased his contract late in the 1912 season. Pipp attempted to hold out from the Tigers, demanding a portion of the purchase price, and threatened to return to college.<ref name=sabr/>

After graduating from college, Pipp ended his holdout without receiving a share of the purchase price.<ref name=si/> Pipp made his major league debut with the Tigers on June 29, 1913.<ref name=sabr/> After playing 12 games for Detroit, batting .161, the Tigers reassigned Pipp to the [[Providence Grays (minor league)|Providence Grays]] of the Class AA [[International League]]. He committed seven [[error (baseball)|errors]] in 14 games for Providence, and was demoted to the to the [[Scranton Miners (minor league)|Scranton Miners]] of the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[New York State League (1885<U+2013>1917)|New York State League]], where he only batted .220.<ref name=si/>

In 1914, Pipp played for the [[Rochester Hustlers]] of the International League. Pipp had a .314 batting average and 27 [[triple (baseball)|triples]]. He led all batters in the league with 15 [[home run]]s, a .526 [[slugging percentage]], and 290 [[total bases]].<ref name=si/><ref name=sabr/>

===New York Yankees===
In January 1915, [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] agreed to purchase the [[New York Yankees]] of the American League. As part of the agreement, the other team owners in the American League agreed to help the Yankees restock their system with [[prospect (sports)|prospects]]. One of the deals Ruppert and Huston negotiated was their purchase of Pipp. After the purchase was completed, all owners, with the exception of [[Frank Navin]], the owner of the Tigers, broke their word.<ref name=si/> On February 4, 1915, the Tigers sold Pipp and [[outfielder]] [[Hugh High]] to the Yankees, receiving $5,000 for each player (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1915}}}} in current dollar terms).<ref name=sabr/>

The Yankees had struggled prior to Ruppert and Huston's purchase, having only one [[winning record]] in their past eight seasons. They made Pipp their starting first baseman in time for [[Opening Day]] of the [[1915 New York Yankees season|1915 season]]. The Yankees added [[Home Run Baker]] in 1916, and they formed the center of the Yankees' [[batting order]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&dat=19170626&id=wbMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GeQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2700,7018708|title=Wally Pipp of Yanks Has Pippin of Wallop|first=H.

Pipp hit nine home runs in 1917, again leading the league.<ref name=si/>

In [[1918 New York Yankees season|1918]], Pipp hit only two home runs, but batted .304. He missed playing time under the nation's "work or fight" rule during [[World War I]]; he worked as a [[naval aviation]] [[cadet]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He batted .275 with seven home runs in 1919, as [[Babe Ruth]] surpassed him as the best power hitter in the American League.<ref name=sabr/> The Yankees moved to strengthen their team after the 1919 season, adding Ruth and fellow [[outfielder]] [[Bob Meusel]] and [[third baseman]] [[Joe Dugan]]. Between 1920 and 1924, Pipp had a .301 average, with season averages of 29 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 94 [[runs scored]], and 97 [[runs batted in]] (RBI) per season. Led by their strong lineup and additions to the [[pitching staff]], such as [[Waite Hoyt]], the Yankees finished in second place in 1920. Pipp became the [[cleanup hitter]], behind Ruth in the batting order. Pipp hit .296 in 1921, and the Yankees won the American League pennant.<ref name=si/> However, they lost the [[1921 World Series]] to the [[Subway Series|crosstown rival]] [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] of the [[National League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1921_WS.shtml |title=1921 World Series <U+2013> New York Giants over New York Yankees (5<U+2013>3) |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

On July 26, 1922, Pipp bobbled a ball during the fifth inning of a game against the [[St. Louis Browns]]. When the Yankees returned to the [[dugout]], Ruth criticized Pipp's fielding. Pipp attacked Ruth, and the two were separated by teammates. Though Ruth insisted they'd "settle this after the game," Ruth and Pipp led the Yankees to a victory with their hitting, and when Pipp approached Ruth after the game, ready to fight, Ruth opted against it. Pipp said this resulted in reduced tension among the Yankees, which he attributed to their improved play from that point forward.<ref name=si/> Pipp batted .329 in 1922 and the Yankees again won the American League pennant.<ref name=si/> In a rematch, the Giants again defeated the Yankees in the [[1922 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1922_WS.shtml |title=1922 World Series <U+2013> New York Giants over New York Yankees (4<U+2013>0) |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, Pipp [[scout (sports)|scouted]] and asked [[Miller Huggins]], the Yankees' [[manager (baseball)|manager]], to sign [[Lou Gehrig]] from [[Columbia University]], whom Pipp personally helped develop as a young first baseman.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Newman|work=[[MLB.com]] |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030619&content_id=382597&vkey=lou_gehrig&fext=.jsp&c_id=null |title=Before Gehrig, there was Pipp |publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]] |date=June 19, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Pipp had a strong 1923 season, but he injured his right ankle while stepping off of a train in Boston late in the year.

====1925: Removal from the Yankees' starting lineup====
[[File:Gehrig cropped.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Lou Gehrig]] replaced Pipp in the Yankees' lineup on June 2, 1925.]]
The Yankees began the 1925 season struggling, and Huggins began to replace players in his lineup in response. Huggins benched starting [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]] on May 6, replacing him with [[Pee Wee Wanninger]]. At the time, Scott had the longest streak of consecutive games played, with 1,307. The Yankees continued to struggle. The Yankees entered play on June 2 on a five game [[losing streak]]. Their 15<U+2013>26 [[win-loss record]] had them in seventh place out of the eight teams in the American League, half a game better than the last place team, and {{frac|13|1|2}} games out of first place in the standings. They had lost five in a row. Before their game against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], Huggins replaced Pipp in the Yankees' lineup with Gehrig, and benched [[second baseman]] [[Aaron Ward]] and [[catcher]] [[Wally Schang]] as well. Pipp was batting .244 with only three home runs and 23 RBIs, and had a .181 batting average over the past three weeks. This was the first game of Gehrig's then-record 2,130 consecutive games played, which lasted for 14 seasons.<ref name=si/>

According to the most popular version of the story, Pipp showed up at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] that day with a severe headache, and asked the team's [[sports trainer|trainer]] for two [[aspirin]]. [[Miller Huggins]], the Yankees' [[manager (baseball)|manager]], noticed this, and said "Wally, take the day off. We'll try that kid Gehrig at first today and get you back in there tomorrow." Gehrig played well and became the Yankees' new starting first baseman. This story first appeared in a 1939 ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' on Gehrig's career, in which Pipp was interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, "I took the two most expensive aspirin in history."<ref name=si>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066131/1/index.htm |title=A Pipp of a Legend: The Man Who Was Benched in Favor of Iron-Horse Lou|first=Bruce|last=Anderson|date=June 29, 1987|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref><ref name=heraldtribune/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19570321&id=xgQkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tyUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3922,252176|title=One Minute Interviews: Mantle's big Asset ...

According to ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'', the [[1942 in film|1942 film]] about Gehrig's life, Pipp asked out of the game because he was experiencing [[Diplopia|double vision]] from being hit in the head two days prior.<ref name=si/> By 1953, Pipp reported to ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by [[Charlie Caldwell]] during [[batting practice]]. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.<ref name=si/>

The ''[[New York Sun]]'' reported that the benching was due to Pipp's struggles against [[handedness|left-handed]] pitchers, as [[southpaw]] [[George Mogridge]] was the scheduled starting pitcher for the Senators on June 2. Other sources suggest Yankee manager [[Miller Huggins]] may have actually benched Pipp and other veterans in order to "shake up" the slumping lineup.<ref name=si/> According to another story, supported by Gehrig's wife, Pipp was not at the game on June 2 because he was [[gambling]] on [[horse racing]] at a [[race track]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19900707&id=jc4zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6OsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6020,1344580|title=Just a Pipp off the old block|first=Jim|last=Murray|newspaper=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|page=1C|date=July 7, 1990|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> His son Tom denied this rumor, stating that his father never bet on horses.<ref name="the real story"/>  When interviewed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Pipp's own children disagreed on the reason for their father's benching, believing it was either due to Pipp being beaned, or struggling.<ref name=si/> One of his sons believes that Pipp told Huggins to play Gehrig in his place, as he knew that Gehrig had a future with the Yankees, while he likely did not.<ref name="the real story"/>

===Later career===
Ruth had returned to the Yankees' lineup on June 1, the day before Pipp, Ward, and Schang were benched. Despite Ruth's return and the strong play of Gehrig, who batted .295 with 20 home runs and 68 RBIs,<ref name=si/><ref name=nj/> the Yankees finished in seventh place. Pipp was hospitalized for a week after being hit in the head by Caldwell on July 2, and he played sparingly during the remainder of the season.<ref name=si/> He ended the year with a .230 average, three home runs, and 24 RBIs.<ref name=nj/>

[[File:Wally Pipp and Charlie Mullen.jpg|thumb|300px|Pipp ''(left)'' and [[Charlie Mullen]] ''(right)'']]
Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made personnel changes during the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, but could not agree on the terms with any team.<ref name=si/> They put Pipp on [[waivers (baseball)|waivers]], and he was acquired by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of the [[National League]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&dat=19260117&id=RYEhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d4sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1664,1613602|title=Wally Pipp Leaves Ruppert Service: Yanks First Sack Player and Star of New York Goes to Cincinnati|first=Henry L.|last=Farrell|agency=United Press International|newspaper=[[Palm Beach Daily News]]|page=2-1|date=January 17, 1926|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price.<ref name=sabr/> The Reds, who had not had a strong starting first baseman since [[Jake Daubert]] died in 1924, had attempted to acquire [[Bill Terry]] from the Giants, but refused to part with [[Edd Roush]] in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead.<ref>{{cite  news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&dat=19260201&id=S4EhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d4sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1559,3419531|title=Reds Look Like Promising Lot With Recent Acquisition of Wally Pipp|date=February 1, 1926|page=2-1|newspaper=Palm Beach Daily News|first=Henry L.|last=Farrell|agency=United Press International|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion of the purchase price, but was rebuffed.<ref name=si/>

He played 372 games for the Reds over the next three seasons. In 1926, Pipp batted .291. His 99 RBIs and 15 triples were both fourth-best in the National League. He batted .260 with 41 RBIs in 1927, and .283 in 1928.<ref name=sabr/>

With first baseman [[George Kelly (baseball)|George Kelly]] also on their roster, the Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season. Pipp signed with the [[Newark Bears (IL)|Newark Bears]] of the International League for the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19290304&id=OWVQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AA8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1370,871283|title=Wally Pipp to Play at Newark|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=15|date=March 4, 1929|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> He earned $40,000 that year, more than he made during his major league career.

Pipp played 1,872 games.<ref name=heraldtribune/> He had three seasons with a .300+ batting average, and two seasons with 100 or more RBI. Pipp had a .281 career batting average. He led both the American and National leagues in [[fielding percentage]]. His 226 [[Sacrifice bunt|sacrifices]] as a Yankee remain a team record.
