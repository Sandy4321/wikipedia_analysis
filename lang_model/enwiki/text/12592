'''Anarky''' ('''Lonnie Machin''') is a [[comic book]] character published by [[DC Comics]]. Co-created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #608 ([[November 1989]]) as an adversary of [[Batman]].  Originally intended to only be used in the debut story in which he appeared, Anarky was created to be a violent, but highly intelligent youth, who rationalized murder in the name of a higher cause.  At the request of [[Dennis O'Neil]], this early interpretation was altered before publication, and Anarky was instead portrayed as violent, but non-lethal &ndash; a characterization that has remained consistent ever since.<ref name="fouroneone">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |last=Cooling |first=William |date=[[2007-04-21]] |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>  Following positive reception by readers, Grant briefly considered, in secret, transforming Anarky into a new [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], to replace the then recently deceased [[Jason Todd]].  However, this was soon abandoned when he was informed that [[Tim Drake]] had already been created to do so.<ref name="Robin-Anarky">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}  The idea of Anarky-as-Robin was briefly raised at the end of the original two-parter in which he was introduced. When Batman briefs [[Commissioner Gordon]] over Anarky's capture he admits to admiring his ingenuity and desire to change the world for the better. Gordon expresses concern that Batman may be thinking of having him as a new Robin, but Batman denies this. {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = [[December 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  

Stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes.  Named after the philosophy of [[anarchism]], his creation was partially inspired by [[Alan Moore]]'s character "[[V (comics)|V]]" from ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070427174515/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |archivedate=2007-04-27}}</ref>  With Grant's transition to the philosophy of [[Frank R.

The character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late '90s, beginning when Norm Breyfogle convinced Alan Grant to produce a [[limited series]] based on the character.  The 1997 [[spin-off]] series, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', was received with positive reviews and sales, and later declared by Grant to be among his "career highlights".<ref name="why">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/112722984423376.htm |title=The Panel: Why Work In Comics? |accessdate=2007-12-15 |coauthors= James Redington |date=2005-09-20 |format=html |work=Silverbulletcomics.com}}</ref>  ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'', a [[trade paperback]] collection of stories featuring Anarky, soon followed.

The 1999 ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' series, in which even Alan Grant has expressed his distaste,<ref name="fouroneone"/><ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/> was quickly canceled after eight issues, but not before sparking a minor controversy by suggesting Anarky was the biological son of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>  Since the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, and Alan Grant's departure from DC Comics, Anarky has been largely absent from DC publications, despite professional and fan interest in his return.<ref name="Breyfogle">{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/breyfogle.html |title=Norm Breyfogle @ Adelaide Comics and Books |accessdate=2007-01-24 |last=Best |first=Daniel |year= 2003 |format=html |work=Adelaide Comics and Books |publisher=ACAB Publishing}}</ref><ref name="WonderCon">{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/NYCC/DC/DCU/report.htm |title=NYCC: DCU - Better Than Ever Panel |accessdate=2007-01-25|year= |month= |work=newsarama.com |publisher=Newsarama.com, LLC|quote=Referring to all the requests for Anarky appearing in 52 that were made two weeks ago at WonderCon, Didio said that since that San Francisco show, the writers have come up with a way to include the character in the story.}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Originally inspired by his personal political leanings, [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] entertained the idea of interjecting [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosophy into Batman comic books.  In an attempt to emulate the success of [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a rebellious youth in [[Judge Dredd]], he conceptualized a character as a twelve-year-old anarchist vigilante.<ref name="AG intro">{{cite book |title=Batman:Anarky |last=Grant |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Grant (writer) |year=1999 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=New York |isbn=1-56389-437-8 |pages=pp. 3&ndash;4 |chapter=Intro by Alan Grant }}</ref>  His only instructions to his partner, illustrator [[Norm Breyfogle]], were that Anarky be designed as a cross between [[V (comics)|V]] and the black spy from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]''.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |date= 2005-01-12 |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>  Grant also briefly considered incorporating [[Krazy Kat]] as a third design suggestion, but decided against the idea.<ref name="AG intro"/>   In response to deadline pressures, and not recognizing the character's potential, Breyfogle "made no preliminary sketches, simply draping him in long red sheets".  The character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude "head extender" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance.  While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, "priestly" hat, and his golden [[Staff (stick)|staff]].<ref name="Anarky Trade Paperback Intro">{{cite web |url=http://www.normbreyfogle.com/media/articles.asp?page=anktpb |title=Anarky Trade Paperback Intro |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Breyfogle |first=Norm |authorlink=Norm Breyfogle |format=html |work=Normbreyfogle.com}}</ref>
[[Image:Detective Comics -608 (November 1989).jpg|thumb|left|Anarky's debut, in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #608.  Art by [[Norm Breyfogle]].]]
The first Anarky story, "''Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor''", appeared in ''Detective Comics #608'', in November 1989.  In Grant's earliest script for the character, Anarky was designed to be far more vicious, and to have killed his first victim.  However, [[Dennis O'Neil]], then editor of Detective Comics, requested that Grant "tone down" the script, as he felt Anarky becoming a murderer at such a young age was morally reprehensible.  Grant consented to the request and the script was rewritten.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>   In a 2004 interview, Grant explained the motivation behind this early decision. "I wanted to play it that way because it created incredible tension in Anarky himself. Other heroes might kill--Batman used to, in the early days--but for a teenager to rationally decide to take lives...well, it hadn't been handled in comics before.  But Denny was boss, and I respected his opinion and toned things down."<ref name="fouroneone">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |last=Cooling |first=William |date=07-04-21 |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>

Although Grant had not created the character to be used beyond the two-part debut story, positive reactions from reader letters and his editor caused him to change his mind. He then decided to make Lonnie Machin the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], following [[Jason Todd]], desiring a new [[sidekick]] who would act as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Batman, and not have the same motivations for vengeance.  However, this was abandoned when he learned that [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] had already been created to fill the role by [[Marv Wolfman]].<ref name="Robin-Anarky"/>  Quickly rebounding from this decision, Grant instead used the second appearance of Anarky as the antagonist for Tim Drake's first solo detective case.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1990]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Anarky was only rarely incorporated into Batman stories by Grant, being reserved for stories in which he felt the need to make a philosophical point.<ref name="AG intro"/>  As the character was based on a theme of ideas, he had been given no personal, tragic past; a common motivator in comic books.  This was to contrast with Batman, who fought crime due to personal tragedy, while Anarky would do so in the name of ideals and beliefs.<ref name="AG intro"/>   As the character was further developed, he was also intended to contrast with common teenage superheros. Referring to the tradition established by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] of saddling teenagers with personal problems, Alan Grant purposely gave Anarky none.  Nor did he develop a girlfriend or social life for the character.  This was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was single minded in his goals.<ref name="AG intro"/>  On two occasions, Grant nearly went against O'Neil's early wish that Anarky not be a killer.  These events include his appearance during the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga, in which Grant briefly portrayed Anarky as preparing to kill both the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Azrael (comics)|Batman-Azrael]]<ref name="God of Fear one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Bret Blevins | Inker = Mike Manley | Story = The God of Fear, Part One of Three | Title = Shadow of The Bat | Volume = | Issue = 16 | Date = [[September 1]], [[1993]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Grant also implied Anarky was a killer in "''The Last Batman Story''", part of ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Jim Fern | Inker = Steve Leahloha | Story = The Last Batman Story | Title = Batman Annual | Volume = | Issue = 15 | Date = 1991 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Grant later expressed relief that he had not fully committed to portraying Anarky as a killer, as he felt "Anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal-killer."<ref name="AG intro"/>

During the Anarky series, much of the character's development was influenced by the nature of Grant and Breyfogle's association.  As part of the story writing process, the duo would engage in philosophical discussion carried out entirely over [[Fax|fax-transmissions]].<ref>{{cite web |quote=Norm Breyfogle agreed with me in principle, but argued so much in detail that sometimes I wondered who was the writer--I'd get 50-page faxes from him arguing a point I'd made in the script. Great fun. |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |last=Cooling |first=William |date=07-04-21 |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>  These long, in-depth, and occasionally heated debates influenced plot points, as well as the general direction of Anarky's character development.  Because of this, Breyfogle personally considers Anarky to be among their few co-creations, whereas he considers other characters they "made" together, such as the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], to be entirely Grant's creations.<ref name="Breyfogle"/>

{{main|Anarky (comic book)}}
In May 1997, a four-issue Anarky mini-series, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', was produced.  The story, entitled "''Metamorphosis''", maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of [[Frank R. Wallace|neo-tech]], an offshoot of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]].<ref name="zon-power-comic-book"/>  Its success fueled the creation of a [[trade paperback]], ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'', which collected several of his appearances.  With the continuing success of the character, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant, suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Norm Breyfogle, provided Alan Grant would continue as the writer.  Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write the series at Breyfogle's insistence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8581 |title= Catching Up With Norm Breyfogle and Chuck Satterlee |accessdate= 2007-01-24 |last=Carey |first=Edward |date=2006-10-10 |format=html |work=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>  Grant's doubts eventually proved correct.  The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues.  However, Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in [[South America]], perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

In the last issue of the ''Anarky'' series, the possibility was left open that [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] might be Anarky's actual father. As the series is now canceled, it may be some time before this theory is addressed. However, Alan Grant has said that a senior [[DC Comics]] official told him, "'Anarky will never be the Joker's son. You can write the story, but someone else will write the sequel showing it just can't be.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/108672670397105.htm |title=The Panel: Do Fans REALLY Want Change? |accessdate=2007-01-24 |coauthors= Craig & Lucie |date=2004-06-08 |format=html |work=Silverbulletcomics.com}}</ref>  Later, in a dual interview with Breyfogle, the situation behind the decision was explained in greater detail, that it was originally Breyfogle's idea to make Anarky the son of The Joker, and that it was [[Dennis O'Neil]] who protested against it.

<blockquote>
Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky<U+2019>s father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that ... I talked him into letting me write the script anyway by saying the story would create a lot of interest and then maybe in six months time I would write the rebuttal, which proves that Anarky wasn<U+2019>t the Joker<U+2019>s son ... and Denny said OK but of course the monthly title got cancelled long before that point.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>
</blockquote>

Further, Grant and Breyfogle speculate that as Dennis O'Neil is no longer in charge of such decisions at DC Comics, with the final editorial decision now belonging to [[Dan DiDio]], it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>   There is, as yet, no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject.  However, it is worth noting that the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC Universe timeline]] chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/Anarky/Anarky2_008.php |title=ANARKY Vol. 2 #8 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |format=html |work=The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe |quote= Greta claims that the Joker is Lonnie's father and recollects when she met him. However, as it is not 16&nbsp;years since the Joker debuted in the DC Universe Lonnie's age suggests that even if the Joker is his real father the circumstances surrounding his birth had to be different from what Greta tells him.}}</ref>

As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under "work-for-hire" rules, [[DC Comics]] owns all rights to the Anarky character.  Following the cancellation of the series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

===Political and philosophical themes===
[[Image:Clip - Detective Comics -620 (August 1990).jpg|thumb|right|Lonni Machin defends his actions in ''[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics #620]]''.  Political elements include the [[Anarchist symbolism #Circle-A|circle-A]] painted in the background, and an issue of [[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]] being read in the foreground by [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1990]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 19 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref>]]
Originally, Alan Grant created Anarky as an [[anarchism|anarchist]] with [[socialist]] and [[populist]] leanings.  In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.  However, according to Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were hostile to his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of [[Recuperation (sociology)|recuperation]] for commercial gain.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>

Within the books, the nature of the character's political opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] as a character gimmick.  Other themes were occasionally used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic.  During the Anarky limited series, fluttering newspapers were used to bear headlines alluding to social problems.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part One: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 8, 14 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 1,12,13 | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Occasionally, the titles of books found in Anarky's room would express the character's philosophical, political, or generally esoteric agenda.   In ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #620, a copy of ''[[V for Vendetta (comic)|V For Vendetta]]'' can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf, as homage.  Other books in his room at different times have included ''Apostles of Revolution'' by Max Nomad, ''[[The Anarchists]]'' by [[James Joll]], books labeled "''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]''" and "''[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]''", and an issue of ''[[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]]'';<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1990]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 19 | Panel = 1, 3, 4 | ID = }}</ref> various books labeled "[[Plato]]", "[[Aristotle]]", and "[[Emanuel Swedenborg|Swedenborg]]";<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 4 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> and ''Synergetics'', by [[Buckminster Fuller]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 4: Fanfare for the Common Man | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 4 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =16 | Panel =2  | ID = }}</ref>  The character also made references to ''Universe'' by [[Scudder Klyce]], an extremely rare book.<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = [[December 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1995]]| Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>  When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references, Grant responded that he didn't expect many to do so, but was "pleased" that some had.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

During the early years of the character's development, virtually no writers other than Alan Grant used Anarky in DC publications.  In a rare portrayal by an author other than Grant, writer [[Kevin Dooly]] used Anarky in an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'', producing an explicitly [[Gun politics in the United States|anti-firearm]] themed story.<ref name="GA 89">{{Cite comic | Writer = Kevin Dooley | Penciller = Michael Netzer | Inker = Rob Leigh | Story = Forgotten Paths | Title = Green Arrow | Volume = | Issue = 89 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1994]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Over the course of several years, Grant's political opinions shifted from [[libertarian socialism]] to [[free market]] based philosophies.  This could be detected within stories including the Anarky character.  In a story that preceded the Anarky series, Anarky's father comments on the political books in the teenager's room, referring to Bakunin, [[Karl Marx|Marx]], and [[Ayn Rand]].<ref>"He's fifteen years old, for pity's sake!  Look at these books--!  He should be sneaking copies of ''Playboy'' around, not Bakunin and Marx and Ayn Rand!"  {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>  By 1997, Grant's philosophy settled on [[Frank R. Wallace#Neo-Tech philosophy|neo-tech]], a variant of [[neo-objectivism]], and when given the opportunity to write an ''Anarky'' mini-series, he decided to redesign the character accordingly.  Alan Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication.  "I felt" Grant explained, "he was the perfect character [to express neo-tech philosophy] because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness".<ref name="zon-power-comic-book">{{cite web |url=http://gocomics.com/alangrant.htm |title=Holy Penis Collapsor Batman!

The limited and ongoing series were both heavily influenced by neo-tech, despite the term never appearing in a single issue.  New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, such as the depiction of Anarky as an [[atheism|atheist]] and a [[rationalism|rationalist]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part One: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref>   While the ongoing series led the character away from the philosophy he had espoused previously, the primary theme of the character remained [[anti-statism]].  In one issue of the ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' series, a character asked what the nature of Anarky's politics were.  The response was that Anarky was neither [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], nor [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and that he "transcends the political divide".<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = [[October 1]], [[1999]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref>  Despite taking part in multiple interviews regarding the character, Grant has never specified the nature of Anarky's political categorization, preferring to state which philosophies inspired his characterization.  Norm Breyfogle, however, has said that he believes the neo-tech influence allows Anarky to be classified as  an "[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivist]]".<ref>{{cite web |quote=I had more input on Anarky than many of the other characters we developed  because we spent so much time on it and because we were involved in discussions concerning Anarky<U+2019>s philosophy - which is really Alan Grant<U+2019>s philosophy.

Following the cancellation of the ongoing series, [[Roderick T.

With the publication in 2005 of an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'' in which Anarky guest-stared, writer James Peatty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the [[progressivism|liberal progressive]] beliefs of Green Arrow.  "Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn<U+2019>t the case <U+2026> especially as Ollie<U+2019>s radical credentials are pretty antiquated ...

In a review of the ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' mini-series, Anarky was dubbed an "[[anti-villain]]", as opposed to "[[anti-hero]]", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains.  "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the [[Punisher]], an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's ''right''."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rzero.com/books/Anarky.html |title=Anarky |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=VerBeek |first=Todd |format=html |work=Beek's Books}}(Original emphasis.)</ref>  Greg Burga, of ''PopCultureShock.com'', critiqued Anarky as "one of the more interesting characters of the past fifteen or twenty years&nbsp;... because of what he wants to accomplish". He also analyzed the appeal of the character, considering the philosophy of anarchy "radical and untenable, yet still noble".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/features.php?id=1394 |title=Comics You Should Own #17: Detective Comics #583 - 601 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |author=Greg Burga |date=2006-05-22 |work=Comics You Should Own |publisher=PopCultureShock}}</ref>

Before 1996, Anarky was a minor figure in the DC universe, having only appeared in a small number of [[Batman]]-related titles, as well as ''[[Green Arrow]]''<ref name="GA 89"/> and ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = Who's Who in the DC Universe | Volume = | Issue = 14 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1991]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  This changed with the publication of the ''Anarky'' limited series in 1997, the ''Batman: Anarky'' trade paperback in 1998, and featured appearances in both ''[[Secret Files and Origins|DCU Heroes Secret Files and Origins]]'' #1<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = D.

Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time, co-writing an issue of [[The Spectre]] with [[J. M. DeMatteis|John Marc DeMatteis]].  When this story was rejected, Breyfogle came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship.<ref name="Breyfogle"/>

Since the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, Alan Grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character.  In a 2004 interview, he recalled that he had been asked by James Peatty for a critique of an Anarky/Green Arrow script the latter had written.  Peatty desired to know if his presentation of Anarky had been correct.  Grant declined to read the story, explaining during the interview, "you have to let these things go".<ref name="fouroneone">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |last=Cooling |first=William |date=07-04-21 |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>    The script was published in 2005, and Anarky made the guest appearance billed as his "return" to DC continuity in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' #51, ''Anarky in the USA''.<ref name="Green Arrow 51">{{Cite comic | Writer = James Peaty | Penciller = Eric Battle | Inker = Jack Purcell | Story = Anarky In the USA | Title = Green Arrow | Volume = 3 | Issue = 51 | Date = [[August 1]], [[2005]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Despite this "return", Anarky failed to make any further appearances.

During a panel at [[WonderCon]], 2006, multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in DC Comic's limited series, ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]''.  In response, Dan DiDio announced two weeks later, at a DC Comics panel during [[New York Comic Con]], 2006, that the writing team of ''52'' had decided to create a part for the character.<ref name="WonderCon"/>  ''52'' editor, Michael Siglain, later responded to a reader question concerning when Anarky would appear in the series, estimating Anarky would appear in later issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95692 |title= 52 (Reader Questions) About 52 |accessdate= 2007-05-02 |last=Brady |first=Matt|date=2006-12-28 |format=html |work=Newsarama.com |publisher=Newsarama.com, LLC |quote= <br>[Reader question]: We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52.

Reader speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue #48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication.  On the cover, the [[Anarchist symbolism #Circle-A|circle-A]] could be seen as a minor element in the background.</ref>  However, ''52'' concluded without Anarky ever making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series.

As of 2008, Anarky has yet to appear in another DC publication.

Lonnie Machin is introduced as Anarky as early as his first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #608, withholding his [[origin story]] for a later point.  He is established in as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent twelve-year-old.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  The debut story of the character failed to provide a back story to explain his behavior, but a narrative from Batman reveals that he is a socially conscious and arrogant child who believes he knows how to solve societies' problems.

This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing ''Anarky'' to be Lonni Machin's father, Mike Machin.<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = [[December 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

The character made his debut as ''Anarky'' by responding to complaints in the newspaper and attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child.  During this first confrontation, he is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who became loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances.  After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.

Anarky's next appearance came in ''Detective Comics'' #620, approximately a few months after his initial appearance, according to the DC Universe sliding timescale. During his detention, he increases his computer skills to the point of becoming an advanced [[Grey hat|"grey hat"]] computer [[hacker]].  He takes on the [[User (computing)|online user alias]] "Moneyspider" to steal millions of dollars from western corporations, including [[Wayne Enterprises]], outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He then uses the money to create bank accounts for poor farmers in third world countries.  He is caught by [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] in the latter's first solo detective case.<ref name="six twenty">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = ''Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1990]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

In the following years, Anarky is portrayed as frequently escaping from the center and peregrinating around [[Gotham City]].  At this time Anarky was a lesser known, but established antagonist in the Batman franchise.  However, his [[back-story]] had still yet to be elaborated upon.  Grant provided hints to Anarky's origin in ''Robin Annual'' #1, ''The Anarky Ultimatum'', part of ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' crossover event.  Within the story it is revealed that Lonnie Machin was a highly intelligent child who from an early age read prodigiously at local bookstores, but had few friends.<ref name="robin annual">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Tom Lyle | Inker = Scott Hanna | Story = The Anarky Ultimatum | Title = Robin Annual | Volume = | Issue = 1 | Date = [[1992]] | Publisher = DC Comics| Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>  It wouldn't be until 1995 that Grant would finally reveal Lonni Machin's history.

In one of his more notable appearances, during the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga from ''Shadow of The Bat'' #16<U+2013>18 , he takes on both [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Azrael (comics)|Batman-Azrael]].  Grant made use of Anarky at this time to advance a theory influenced by [[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]], suggesting that Batman indirectly encourages super-villains to come into existence.<ref name="God of Fear one"/>

In 1995, Grant began the slow increase in Anarky's abilities that would culminate in the ''Anarky'' series.  In the ''Anarky'' [[story arc]] from ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #40<U+2013>41 , Lonnie is released from juvenile detention, and builds a machine that allows him to fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased intelligence, and what he perceives as [[Enlightenment (concept)|enlightenment]].  Creating an online bookstore, ''Anarco'', to propagate radical literature, he begins to accumulate funds that he donates through another front company, ''The Anarkist Foundation'', to radical organizations, such as [[eco-warrior]]s and gun protesters, or kept for his own projects.  These story devices served to further improve Anarky's skill set, and increase his intelligence and financial independence.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title =Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>

Lonnie Machin is an ordinary child who, while abnormally intelligent, is apolitical and socially unaware.  At eleven he gains a foreign pen pal, Xuasus, as part of a school program.  Every month they would write to each other about their lives; Lonnie about how wonderful the United States is; Xuasus about the poverty and political repression that made up his nation.  After a year of contact, Xuasus stops writing, and all of Lonnie's letters are returned as undeliverable.  A year later Lonnie learns of Xuasus' fate.  He writes Lonnie a final letter explaining that his father has been arrested, his mother has taken ill, his sister has died of malnutrition, and at age eleven, he is homeless and fending for himself.  Driven with worry for his friend, Lonnie fervently learns about Xuasus' country, discovering it to be a [[Third World]] [[dictatorship]] at war with [[Marxist]] guerrillas, with arms dealers from [[Western world|The West]] making millions in profits from the conflict.<ref name="Anarkist manifesto">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>

Further studies into war and political violence leads him to hold radical sympathies.  He comes to view all wars as being caused by political elites, with common individuals forced or cajoled into fighting on behalf of the former.  He also began to read more into esoteric studies regarding science and philosophy, laying the groundwork for his advanced intelligence, and leading to his cover as a straight-A student with a normal job as a paper-boy.  Eventually he discovers the extremely rare book, ''Universe'' by [[Scudder Klyce]], which attempted to unify all knowledge.  Within it he finds several passages that convince him of the need to reshape society.  He becomes convinced that if he cannot help Xuasus, he can fight on in his memory and give the oppressed people of [[Gotham City]] hope.<ref name="Anarkist manifesto">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>

With the success of the ''Anarky'' limited series, an ongoing series was given a green light.  However, Grant notes that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions.  One of the earliest of these was that Grant was "made to" remove Anarky from Gotham City in ''Anarky'' vol.2 #1.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle"/>   This was achieved by explaining that following an [[Batman: Cataclysm|earthquake in Gotham]] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city.

==Skills, abilities, and resources==

Alan Grant developed Anarky as a [[superhero#Types of superheroes|gadgeteer]]; a character who relies on inventions and [[gadget]]s to compensate for a lack of [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]].  In early incarnations, he was portrayed as inexperienced, lacking in many skills, and surviving only by his ingenuity.  In accordance with this, he would often quote the maxim, "the essence of anarchy is surprise".<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = [[December 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Later, during the two ''Anarky'' series, his abilities were increased, and he was portrayed as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology, as well as developing skills in martial arts.  This was indicated in several comics published just before the ''Anarky'' mini-series, and later elaborated upon within the series itself.  According to character dialogue, Anarky's lack of superpowers, and the urgency with which he views his cause, has necessitated that he increase his abilities drastically over the years.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

This steady evolution in Anarky's abilities was criticized in a review of the Anarky ongoing series, by ''Fanzing'' contributor Matt Morrison.  Morrison saw it as having overpowered the character, preventing the suspension of disbelief that was previously possible for a character still described as in his mid-teens, and contributing to the failure of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing27/themount.shtml |title=Anarky: Better Dead Than Read! |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=Morrison |first=Matt |year=2000 |month=July |format=html |work=Fanzing.com}}</ref>

===Strategy===
The character often utilizes cunning and intelligence as tools for victory.  During the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga, the character states, "The essence of anarchy is ''surprise'' -- spontaneous action... even when it does require a little ''planning''!"<ref name="God of Fear one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Bret Blevins | Inker = Mike Manley | Story = The God of Fear, Part One of Three | Title = Shadow of The Bat | Volume = | Issue = 16 | Date = [[September 1]], [[1993]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  On one occasion he defeated Batman in combat by confusing the hero with [[Holography|holographic projections]] long enough to attack and subdue him.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  On another occasion he avoided a gang of villains too dangerous to fight, choosing instead to use a flare gun to anonymously signal for Batman to come, and then pitted the two groups against each other.<ref name="God of Fear one"/>  When in need of back up for intelligence gathering, or a diversion,  he would call on the help of the homeless community in Gotham, who had supported him since his first appearance, even going so far as to assault Batman to allow Anarky to get away during their first confrontation.<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = [[December 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

===Equipment===
[[Image:Panel scan - Detective Comics -608 (November 1989).jpg|thumb|right|Anarky uses an improvised gas-bomb to knockout a guard in ''[[Detective Comics]]''  #608.]]
Early descriptions of the character's gadgets focused on low-tech, improvised tools and munitions, such as [[flare gun]]s,<ref name="God of Fear one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Bret Blevins | Inker = Mike Manley | Story = The God of Fear, Part One of Three | Title =Shadow of The Bat | Volume = | Issue = 16 | Date = [[September 1]], [[1993]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> swing lines,<ref name="robin annual"/> [[shuriken|throwing stars]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> small spherical [[explosive material|explosives]] with wick fuses (mimicking those stereotypically associated with 19th-century anarchists),<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> gas-bombs,<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> [[smoke bomb]]s,<ref name="robin annual"/> and his primary weapon, a powerful [[Electroshock weapon|electric stun baton]].<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  A [[grappling hook]] was later incorporated into the golden rod itself, allowing dual functionality.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

The character's tools often incorporate the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] into them.  The symbol of anarchy is often drawn on the spherical bombs, his throwing stars take the shape of the circle-A, and the flare guns occasionally leave circle-A smoke trails behind.  In his earliest incarnations, he would also use red [[aerosol paint|spray-paint]] to leave the circle-A as his calling card,<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> much in the same way that [[V (comics)|V]] would leave a "''circle-V''" symbol.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Moore | Artist = David Lloyd | Story = Chapter 3: Victims | Title = V for Vendetta | Volume = | Issue = | Date = [[September 1]], [[1988]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = 5 | ID = 0-930289-52-8 }}</ref>

===Costume===
Anarky's costume has undergone two phases in design, both of which were created by Norm Breyfogle, in accordance with suggestions by Alan Grant.

The original costume was composed of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red [[jumpsuit]].  A red, wide brimmed hat baring the circle-a insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit.  The folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = [[November 1]], [[1989]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  This costume was also designed to disguise Anarky's height, and so included a "head extender" under his hood, which elongated his neck.  This was also intended to create a subtle awkwardness that the reader would subconsciously suspect as being fake, until the reveal at the end of Anarky's first appearance.  Despite the revelation of this false head, which would no longer serve its intended purpose at misdirecting the reader, the head extender was included in several return appearances.  Breyfogle finally eliminated this aspect of the character during the 1997 limited series.<ref name="Anarky Trade Paperback Intro">{{cite web |url=http://www.normbreyfogle.com/media/articles.asp?page=anktpb |title=Anarky Trade Paperback Intro |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Breyfogle |first=Norm |authorlink=Norm Breyfogle |format=html |work=Normbreyfogle.com}}</ref>

Anarky's second costume retained the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the red robe and head extender.  New additions included a red cape, golden utility belt, and a single, large circle-a across the chest, akin to [[Superman|Superman's]] iconic [[Superman logo|"S" shield]].  Within the ''Anarky'' series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations.  Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme.  These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a "universal battle suit", was used during the brief series.<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration! Part One: Power Play | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1999]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

=== Combat skills ===
In 1995, Alan Grant described Anarky as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Ba | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref>  By 1997, this ability was described as having progressed remarkably, and to have included training in multiple styles, including [[Aikido]], [[Karate]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Chinese martial arts|Kung Fu]], which he "integrated" into a single fighting style.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> Following previous modes of behavior, he studied all possible fighting arts, but failed to specialize in any.  This largely helped him defend himself against most untrained criminals, but was later described as a decisive weakness whenever he fought opponents who were masters of a particular style.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 5 | Date = [[September 1]], [[1999]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

===Logistics, technology, and enhanced intelligence===
As a wanted criminal, Anarky's methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation.  In his earliest incarnations, he was described as having developed skills as a "[[grey hat]]" computer [[hacker]] to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations.<ref name="six twenty">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = [[August 1]], [[1990]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>  This addition to the character's skill set made him the second major hacker in the DC universe, being preceded by [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Gordon's]] debut as ''Oracle'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Ostrander | first = John  | authorlink = John Ostrander | title = Suicide Squad (Vol. 1) #23| publisher = DC Comics | date = 2007 | url = http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=8207 | isbn = 1401214916}}</ref> and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.<ref name="robin annual"/>  By 1997, the skill was further increased to allow him to tap into [[Batcomputer|Batman's supercomputer]],<ref name="Anarky vol. one #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> and the [[Justice League Watchtower]].<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

[[Image:Clip - Anarky - v1 - -3 (July 1997).jpg|thumb|left|Anarky tracks Batman's movements in ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' (vol.1) #3. The scene exemplifies Anarky's reliance on the homeless, technology, and his [[Front organization|front corporation]], Anarco.]]
By 1996 he was described as using the Internet to earn money through his online bookstore, ''Anarco'', which he used as a [[Front organization|front company]] to propagate his philosophy, and to communicate emergency messages to the general public warning of impending disaster.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = [[October 1]], [[1999]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 3 | Panel = 1<U+2013>5 | ID = }}</ref>  A second front organization, ''The Anarkist Foundation'', was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>  In one issue of the ''Anarky'' series, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the Internet to hold an [[instant messaging|instant messaging session]] with the public in which he debated the need for war, arguing that money and time used on the military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global [[overpopulation]] crisis.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = Anarky | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = [[October 1]], [[1999]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 19 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

In 1996 Grant used a ''Biofeedback Learning Enhancer'' as a plot device to increase Lonnie's abilities.  The device was described as being capable of increasing Anarky's brain functions by a multiple of ten.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = [[July 1]] [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>  With this enhanced intelligence, and the increased financial independence described above, Anarky went on to create an on-board [[Artificial intelligence|AI computer]], MAX (''Multi-Augmented X-Program'');<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

Portrayed as an atheist by Alan Grant, Anarky espoused the belief that "science is magic explained",<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part 2: Revolution Number 9 | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | Date = [[June 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =22 | Panel =4  | ID = }}</ref> and was shown to use scientific analysis to explain and manipulate esoteric forces of magic and energy, such as the demon Blasphemy,<ref name="Anarky vol. one #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = Anarky | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = [[May 1]], [[1997]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> the power of [[Darkseid]],<ref name="Anarky vol. one #two">''Anarky'' (vol.1) #2 (June 1997)</ref> and the spirit of [[Eclipso]].<ref name="robin annual"/>

==Alternate versions==
===Armageddon 2001===
In ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman Annual]]'' # 15, "''The Last Batman Story''", part of the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event,<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Jim Fern | Inker = Steve Leahloha | Story = The Last Batman Story | Title = Batman Annual | Volume = | Issue = 15 | Date = 1991 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> the [[time travel]]er, [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], shows Batman a possible future. In the (relatively) not-too-distant year of 2001, an aged Batman is found guilty of murder for the accidental death of [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], and sentenced to death.  Anarky, now in his mid-twenties, sympathizes with the fallen hero and breaks into the prison in an attempt to rescue Batman mere hours before the execution is to take place.  Believing himself guilty, Batman initially refuses to escape.  However, when he discovers evidence that the accident was set up by a third party, he asks Lonnie Machin to switch costumes with him so that he can pursue the true murderer.  In contrast to his original counterpart, it is implied that this version of Anarky was willing to kill opponents.

===The Tyrant===
In ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual'' #2, an ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story entitled "''The Tyrant''",<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Tom Raney | Copencillers = Joe Staton | Inker = Tom Raney | Coinkers = Horacio Ottolini | Story = The Tyrant | Title = Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual | Volume = | Issue = 2 | Date = 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> a corrupt Batman (under the influence of [[Scarecrow (comics)|Jonathan Crane]]) uses his resources to usurp power in the city of [[Gotham City|Gotham]] and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city's population.  Anarky, armed with a ''Holo-Costume'' projector to disguise himself, becomes a [[Resistance movement|resistance leader]] and attempts to undermine and disrupt Batman's control.  When Lonnie uncovers a secret plan to pump tranquilizer gas into the city water supply, drugging the populace to prevent crime, he unites the city's remaining villains to storm the centers of Batman's power and overthrow his tyranny.  After Crane's manipulations are exposed, Batman confesses his crimes to the people of Gotham City, who then burn him alive inside Wayne Manor.   The story ends with a quote by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: "(For reasons of the state) black becomes white and white becomes black, the horrible becomes humane and the most dastardly felonies and atrocious crimes become meritorious acts."<ref>{{cite speech | title = Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism | author = Bakunin, Mikhail | first = Mikhail | last = Bakunin | authorlink = Mikhail Bakunin | date = 09/1868 | location = Geneva | url = http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/reasprop.html | accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref>

===''The Batman Adventures''===
[[Image:The Batman Adventures -31.jpg|thumb|Anarky, as he appeared in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #31. Cover art by [[Dev Madan]].]]
Anarky appeared in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #31, ''"The People's Court"''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Dev Madan | Inker = Rick Burchett | Story = The People's Court | Title = The Batman Adventures | Volume = | Issue = 31 | Date = [[April 1]], [[1995]] | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Anarky begins holding wealthy business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate TV show.  He charges his victims with such crimes as the creation of [[land mine]]s that kill or cripple thousands, funding [[Third World]] dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from [[wage slavery]].  He also captures [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], and while conceding that Wayne has ethical business practices, implicates him for "the company he keeps".  At each trial, Anarky gives the "defendants" the opportunity to speak for themselves, and then asks the viewing audience to phone in one hundred calls if they find them not guilty, which will deactivate bombs set before the men.  As the citizens begin to debate the fate of these men amongst themselves, [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] succeeds in tracking down the broadcast.  However, when he fails to prevent the explosions from taking place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. Anarky is ultimately apprehended, but Robin is left questioning whether he was right in his charges against the businessmen. As of 2008, this story features the only encounter between any version of Anarky and [[Dick Grayson]].
