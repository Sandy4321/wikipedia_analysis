Between 1984 and 1985 the South African Railways, later renamed Spoornet and then [[Transnet Freight Rail]], placed twenty-five '''Class 7E3, Series 2''' electric locomotives in main line service. Circa 2000 one of these dual cab locomotives was rebuilt to a single cab locomotive and reclassified to [[South African Class 7E4|Class 7E4]]<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Middleton"/>

==Manufacturer==
The '''Class 7E3, Series 2''' 25 kV AC electric locomotive was designed for the South African Railways (SAR) by [[Hitachi]] and built in South Africa by Dorbyl, who also supplied the mechanical components. Twenty-five locomotives were delivered by Dorbyl between 1984 and 1985, numbered E7276 to E7300.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

Like Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW), Dorbyl did not allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers to the locomotives it built for the SAR. While usual practice by most other locomotive builders was to allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers or works numbers to record the locomotives built by them, Dorbyl simply used the SAR locomotive numbers for their record keeping.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Features==
Control of traction and rheostatic braking on the Class 7E3 is by stepless solid-state electronics. The electrical equipment is designed for high power factor operation, obtained by the switching in of power-factor correction capacitors.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

These dual cab locomotives have a roof access ladder on one side only, just to the right of the cab access door. The roof access ladder end is marked as the number 1 end. Series 1 and Series 2 locomotives are visually indistinguishable from each other, but the two sides of the locomotives are sufficiently different in appearance that a pair of them coupled at the same end appear at first glance to be two different locomotive types. The roof access ladder side is smooth, while the other side has several large grilles.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Modifications and reclassifications==
In the period from the early 1990s until about 2007 various modifications to improve downhill braking capacity were done to the Coalink line Hitachi designed locomotives. The first set of upgrades were done on the fifty [[South African Class 7E1|Class 7E1]] locomotives.<ref name="Middleton"/>

===Class 7E4===
Circa 2000 seventeen Class 7E3 locomotives, sixteen Series 1 (E7260 to E7275) and one Series 2 (E7276), underwent significant modifications. This included the installation of Hitachi micro-processor controls with improved rheostatic brakes and conversion from double cab to single cab, since the cab space was required for some of the new equipment that was installed. These modified single cab locomotives were reclassified to [[South African Class 7E4|Class 7E4]].<ref name="Middleton"/>

===Class 7E5===
The conversions to Class 7E4 were costly, however, and it was decided to modify further Class 7E3 locomotives to a lesser extent, gaining almost the same benefits at a lower cost since they remained as double cab locomotives. The first batch to be upgraded in this manner were Series 2 E7286 to E7300, but others followed, in total about fifty locomotives of both series. These were reclassified to Class 7E5, although externally they were still identical to the Class 7E3.<ref name="Middleton"/>

===Class 7E6===
Following some systems failures on the upgraded Class 7E5 locomotives, a further variation in the modifications was applied to the balance of not yet upgraded Class 7E3 locomotives, which were then reclassified to Class 7E6. Eventually all the Class 7E5 locomotives were also modified once again to meet the Class 7E6 specifications.<ref name="Middleton"/>

===Revert to Class 7E3===
Since by October 2007 all these locomotives were fully upgraded and, apart from the single cab Class 7E4 conversions, once again identical, they reverted to their original Class 7E3 classifications. Although E7277 to E7300 are all officially Class 7E3, Series 2 once again, many of them still bear markings to identify them as either Class 7E5 or Class 7E6. The single cab E7276, however, remains classified as Class 7E4.<ref name="Middleton"/>

==Service==
Since 1978, 25 kV AC was introduced on all new main line electrification projects bar one, the one exception being the Orex iron ore line from Sishen to Saldanha, where 50 kV AC is used. The Class 7E3, Series 2 locomotives all serve on the 25 kV Coalink line between Ermelo via [[Vryheid]] to the [[Richards Bay Coal Terminal]] (RBCT). With the introduction of the 25 kV [[South African Class 11E|Class 11E]], most [[South African Class 7E|Class 7E]] locomotives were transferred away from the Richards Bay line to other 25 kV lines, the majority to work from Port Elizabeth via De Aar to Kimberley and Beaufort West. The Hitachi designed locomotives all remained on the Coalink line.<ref name="Middleton"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>
