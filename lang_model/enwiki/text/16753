== History ==
=== Fordham Spire ===
Originally proposed as "Fordham Spire" in July of 2005, the design called for 115 stories.<ref name=OriginalChicagoTribune>Corfman, T., & Kamin, B. (2005, July 26).  ''Tallest tower to twist rivals: Trump blasts iffy edifice that would put his in shadow''.  Chicago Tribune, pp. 1, news.</ref>  Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project.  The building was planned to include a [[hotel]] and condominiums and also featured a tall [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].  On [[March 16]] [[2006]], the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission and on [[March 23]] [[2006]] the same happened at the city's Zoning Committee meeting.<ref name=03162006Crains>McHugh, M. (2006, March 16). Planning commission approves Fordham Spire.  ''Crain's Chicago Business.'' Retrieved December, 11, 2006, from http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=19877</ref>  On [[March 29]] [[2006]] The Chicago City Council also approved that design.<ref name=032906CrainsChicago> Yue, L. (2006, March 29). City Council OKs Fordham Spire. ''Crain's Chicago Business''. Retrieved December 11, 2006, from http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=20016</ref> As part of the approval process, the council passed a measure that raised the height limit on structures at the site to accommodate the 2,000-foot (610 m) tower.  

There was widespread support for the original design of the building among both the residents of the immediate neighborhood and the city of Chicago as a whole partly because the building would block less [[sunlight]] and obscure less of the [[skyline]] than what the land was originally zoned for. [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard M. Daley|Daley]] said he approved of the design stating it was [[environmentally friendly]].  Natarus, who was the 42nd ward alderman when the building was announced, said:  "This is a very unique opportunity for the city of Chicago. This building belongs to Chicago and should be in Chicago."<ref name=032206ChicagoJournal />  Opposition from some neighborhood residents originated from concerns with increased congestion. [[Donald Trump]] immediately voiced opposition to the building stating the structure would be a target for terrorists and did not seem to even be a project.<ref>Slevin, P. (2005, July 25).  Chicago Developer Wants to Erect Tower With a Twist. ''The Washington Post.'' pp. A.03</ref>  His current project, the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], is currently under construction just a few blocks west of the Chicago Spire's proposed site and would be in direct competition with the Chicago Spire.

===Financial problems===
After several months of development Carley failed to obtain sufficient financing for the construction of the building.<ref name=MultiHousingNews />  [[Irish people|Irish]] developer Garrett Kelleher, executive [[chairman]] of Shelbourne Development Group, Inc. stepped in and acquired the land at 400 North Lake Shore Drive.  It was announced that he would fund the development with the assistance of financing from [[Anglo Irish Bank]].<ref name=MultiHousingNews />  With Kelleher taking over the project, much of the uncertainty of its development was greatly diminished, because he was putting up 100 percent of the equity, something Carley was unable to do.<ref>Comerford, M. (2006, July 20). New developer in works for site of Fordham Spire. ''Daily Herald'', pp. 1, Business.</ref>  He also had financial backing to acquire the land, something Carley lacked.  Kelleher stated he would consider using Carley's services on the development and that "Carley will be paid an unspecified sum for his involvement in the deal so far".<ref name=072006Suntimes>Roeder, D. (2006, July 20). New twist in spire project. ''Chicago Sun-Times'', pp. 51, Front.</ref>  Kelleher later renamed the project "Chicago Spire" after shortly going by "400 North Lake Shore Drive", as it was no longer a Fordham project.<ref name=072006Suntimes />

===New designs===

[[Image:Garrett Kelleher front.jpg|right|thumb|115px|[[Garrett Kelleher]] ]]
In the final quarter of [[2006]], Shelbourne Development issued two separate press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire.  In a November 2006 [[News release|press release]], it stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June [[2007]].<ref name=111506PressRelease>Business Wire (2006, November 15). ''[http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/061115/20061115005778.html Shelbourne Development Group, Inc. Announces Global Team to Build 400 North Lake Shore Drive]''. Press release.</ref>  In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that the design of the building had been revised.  This included the removal of the hotel and broadcast antenna, making the building all condominiums. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in increased floor space and more total floors. Finally, the revision removed the [[Multi-storey car park|separate parking structure]] from the original plan, instead incorporating [[underground]] [[parking]] into the spire itself.<ref name=120706PressRelease>Shelbourne Development Group, Inc. (2006, December 07).

Press release.</ref>  This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.<ref name=011407ChicagoSunTimes />  

In late December 2006, the [[Chicago Tribune]] reported that the developer was soliciting opinions on a further revision from community leaders.<ref name=122106ChicagoTribune>Kamin, B.

During the interview, Calatrava drew out design ideas restoring the rotating design of the building and showcasing his vision for the Chicago Spire's lobby.<ref name=012107ChicagoTribune />  On [[March 26]] [[2007]], further revisions were shown during a public presentation by Shelbourne Development showcasing the most current design.<ref name=032607ChicagoTribune>Kamin, B.

=== Design ===
[[Image:Chicago Spire.jpg|right|thumb|A computer rendering of the design as of April 20, 2007.]]
As with many of his designs, Calatrava has been inspired by themes and designs in [[nature]] for the tall, twisting skyscraper.<ref name=CalatravaDesign>Tzonis, A. (2004) ''Santiago Calatrava : the complete works''. Rizzoli: New York.</ref>  For the design of the building, he likened the structure to an imaginary smoke spiral coming from a campfire near the [[Chicago River]] lit by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] indigenous to the area, <ref name=092206Chicagoist>Exoo, T. (2006, September 22). Ask Chicagoist: A-spire-ing Tower?  Message posted to http://www.chicagoist.com/archives/2006/09/22/ask_chicagoist_aspireing_tower.php</ref>  and also related the building's newly designed pinnacle to the "graceful" and "rotating forms" of a snail shell.<ref name=012107ChicagoTribune />

[[Chicago architecture|Chicago's buildings]] are known for innovative and revolutionary designs.  The Chicago Spire will complement this pattern, and standing at 2,000&nbsp;feet (610&nbsp;m), will further transform the already changing Chicago skyline.<ref name=ChicagoArch1>Pridmore, J., & Larson, G.A. (2005) ''Chicago Architecture and Design : Revised and expanded''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc.: New York.</ref><ref name=120706PressRelease /><ref name=120606CrainsChicago />  Plans for the tower include 1,200 [[condominium]]s with each of the building's 150 stories rotating more than two degrees from the one below with a total 360&nbsp;degree rotation.  For supplemental structural support, each floor would be surrounded by [[cantilever]]ed corners and four concave sides.<ref name=Hampton>Hampton, T. (2006, March 27).

The curved design, similar to that of the [[Turning Torso]] in [[Malm<U+00F6>]], [[Sweden]], may provide two major benefits to the structure of the building.  First, curved designs have a tendency of adding to the strength of a structure.<ref name=YBuildingStand>Salvadori, M. (1982). ''Why Buildings Stand Up: The Strength of Architecture''. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref>  A similar principle has been applied in the past when building curved stadium roofs.  In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior will minimize wind forces.  In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building, while as air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face.  This oftentimes causes a sway in tall buildings which can be counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a [[Tuned mass damper|dynamic wind damper]].<ref name=YBuildingStand />  Although the curved design of the Chicago Spire will not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve [[shear wall]]s emanating from it are installed to counteract these forces instead.<ref name=Hampton />

=== Height ===
In North America, the Spire would surpass Chicago's own Sears Tower, currently at 1,450&nbsp;feet (442&nbsp;m) tall, New York's upcoming [[Freedom Tower]], planned to be 1,776&nbsp;feet (541&nbsp;m) tall, and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]' proposed [[Crown Las Vegas]],  planned for 1,888&nbsp;feet (575&nbsp;m), to become North America's tallest tower.<ref name=120706PressRelease /><ref name=120606CrainsChicago />  The current design also will surpass the height of the [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]] to become North America's tallest free-standing [[Architectural structure|structure]].  The Chicago Spire would also surpass the [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] in [[Queensland]], the [[Eureka Tower]] in [[Melbourne]], and the [[Princess Tower]] in [[Dubai|Dubai, United Arab Emirates]], to become the world's tallest all-residential building.<ref name=111506PressRelease />. Other world records, though, will by that year likely rest with the [[Burj Dubai]], currently under construction in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]].
