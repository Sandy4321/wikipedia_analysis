The band is composed of [[Matthew Tuck]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason James (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Michael Thomas (drums). They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by [[Metallica]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with [[Sony BMG]]. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, [[Iron Maiden]], and [[Slayer]]. The band is part of the [[Cardiff music scene]].

Bullet for My Valentine's debut album, ''[[The Poison]]'', was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with [[Valentine's Day]], in a nod to the band's name. The album entered the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' in the US at number 128. It was certified [[Gold album|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The band made appearances at the [[Download Festival]] and ''[[Kerrang!]]'' XXV, and undertook a US tour with [[Rob Zombie]]. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, ''[[Scream Aim Fire]]'', was released on 29 January 2008 and debuted at number four on the ''Billboard 200''. The band's third album, ''[[Fever (Bullet for My Valentine album)|Fever]]'', was released on 26 April 2010 and debuted at number three on the ''Billboard 200''.

== History ==

=== Jeff Killed John and record deal (1998<U+2014>2005) ===

Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael "Padge" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael "Moose" Thomas while studying music at [[Bridgend College]]. Playing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Metallica]] [[cover songs]], the band released a two-track [[extended play|EP]] in 2002, ''You/Play with Me'', which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s broadcast at [[Newport]]'s [[T.J.'s]].<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine biography|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/genres_artists/rock_pop/bfmv.shtml|accessdate=8 April 2009}}</ref> Jeff Killed John's music followed the [[nu metal]] trend set by bands such as [[Korn]] and [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for ''You/Play with Me'' and was replaced by Jason James.<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play thrash metal songs with "harmony guitars and big angelic choruses" according to frontman Tuck.<ref name="R13 interview" />

[[Roadrunner Records]] showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five-album record deal with [[Sony BMG]] and a UK licensing deal with [[Visible Noise]]. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, "We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us."<ref name="R13 interview">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine Interview|publisher=Room Thirteen|date=8 July 2005|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185|accessdate=30 October 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112164113/http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185 |archivedate = 12 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> A [[Bullet for My Valentine (EP)|self-titled]] EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK.

Daniel Lukes of ''[[Decibel Magazine]]'' reviewed the EP by stating, "The worst part is that the music itself isn<U+2019>t all that bad, for the genre." He went on to comment that the band should be "embarrassed" about the release.<ref name="Screamocore takes a dump where it eats">{{cite web|title=Screamocore takes a dump where it eats|author=Lukes, Daniel|work=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/sep2005/bullet_for_my_valentine.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060506025905/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/sep2005/bullet_for_my_valentine.aspx|archivedate=6 May 2006|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref> Zeromag's Josh Joyce complimented the band on "how technical they can get without confusing the kids."<ref name="Bullet For My Valentine&nbsp;<U+2014> Hand of Blood EP">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine <U+2013> Hand of Blood EP|author=Joyce, Josh|work=Zero Magazine|url=http://www.zeromag.com/articles/cd_view.php?id=924&pi=0|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>
