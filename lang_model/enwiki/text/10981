Wall Street Journal MarketWatch, ''Dan Borislow Rides Again'']</ref>, plans which apparently emerged as 'magicJack'.

In August 2007, Borislow applied for several patents related to internet telephony "Network Adapters" and "Computer-related devices and techniques for facilitating an emergency call", including
"a wireless client with a network adapter in a single device which allows a telephone to connect to a network access point for the purpose of establishing Voice over IP"

==Philanthropy==
D&K Charitable Foundation was established by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]]. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D&K made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in [[Clearwater, Florida]] until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two [[yeshiva]]s and $173,450 to a [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, the [[chief financial officer]] of the [[non-profit]], split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.<ref name=Charity>{{cite news |first=Harvy |last=Lipman |url=http://www.ncrp.org/news-room/news-2007/169-charitys-founder-paid-himself-17m |title=Charity's founder paid himself $1.7M |date=June 10, 2007 |work=[[The Bergen Record]] |publisher=North Jersey Media Group, Inc. |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref>
