The '''Hanford Site''' is a mostly decommissioned [[Nuclear technology|nuclear]] production complex on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], operated by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]]. The site has been known by many names, including '''Hanford Works''', '''Hanford Engineer Works''' or '''HEW''', '''Hanford Nuclear Reservation''' or '''HNR''', and the '''Hanford Project'''. Established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] in the town of [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]] in south-central Washington, the site was home to the [[B Reactor]], the first full-scale [[plutonium]] production [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[United States Department of Energy]] | title = B Reactor | url = http://www.energy.gov/about/breactor.htm | accessdate = January 29, 2007}}</ref> Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], tested at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity site]], and in [[Fat Man]], the bomb [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] over [[Nagasaki]], Japan.

During the [[Cold War]], the project was expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large [[Nuclear reprocessing|plutonium processing]] complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the 60,000&nbsp;weapons in the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]].<ref name="Overview">{{cite web | publisher = [[United States Department of Energy]] | title = Hanford Site: Hanford Overview | url=http://www.hanford.gov/?page=215 | accessdate = January 29, 2007}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref><ref name="Arsenal">{{cite news | title = Science Watch: Growing Nuclear Arsenal | work = The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71F38F93BA15757C0A961948260 | date = April 28, 1987 | accessdate = January 29, 2007}}</ref> [[Nuclear technology]] developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced many notable technological achievements.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Hanford Reach National Monument.png|thumb|right|A map shows the main areas of the Hanford Site, as well as the buffer zone that was turned over to the [[Hanford Reach National Monument]] in 2000]]

== Early history ==
The confluence of the [[Yakima River|Yakima]], [[Snake River|Snake]], and Columbia rivers has been a meeting place for [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] for centuries. The archaeological record of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] habitation of this area stretches back over ten thousand years.

== Manhattan Project ==
{{Main|Manhattan Project}}

During [[World War II]], the [[S-1 Uranium Committee|Uranium Committee]] of the federal [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium. The research contract was awarded to scientists at the [[University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory]] (Met Lab). At the time, plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a [[University of California]] laboratory. The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain-reacting "piles" of [[uranium]] to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium. The program was accelerated in 1942, as the United States government became concerned that scientists in [[Nazi Germany]] were developing a nuclear weapons program.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.10}}</ref>

=== Site selection ===
[[Image:Pic hanford highschool.jpg|thumb|Hanford High School, shown before residents were displaced by the creation of the Hanford Site]]
[[Image:Hanford High School.jpg|thumb|right|Hanford High after abandonment]]
In September 1942, the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] placed the newly formed Manhattan Project under the command of [[Leslie Groves|General Leslie R. Groves]], charging him with the construction of industrial-size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium.<ref name="Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12"/> Groves recruited the [[DuPont|DuPont Company]] to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont recommended that it be located far away from the existing uranium production facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. The ideal site was described by these criteria:<ref>{{cite book | last = Gerber | first = Michele | title = Legend and Legacy: Fifty Years of Defense Production at the Hanford Site | publisher = Westinghouse Hanford Company | year = 1992 | location = Richland, Washington | page = 6}}</ref>
* A large and remote tract of land
* A "hazardous manufacturing area" of at least {{convert|12|by|16|mi|km|0}}
* Space for laboratory facilities at least {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} from the nearest reactor or separations plant
* No towns of more than 1,000&nbsp;people closer than {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* No main highway, railway, or employee village closer than {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from the hazardous rectangle
* A clean and abundant water supply
* A large electric power supply
* Ground that could bear heavy loads.

In December 1942, Groves dispatched his assistant [[Franklin Matthias|Colonel Franklin T. Matthias]] and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that Hanford was "ideal in virtually all respects," except for the farming towns of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]].<ref>{{cite conference | first = Matthias | last = Franklin | title = Hanford Engineer Works, Manhattan Engineer District: Early History | booktitle = Speech to the Technical Exchange Program | date = January 14, 1987}}</ref> General Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works, codenamed "Site&nbsp;W". The federal government quickly acquired the land under its [[eminent domain]] authority and relocated some 1,500&nbsp;residents of Hanford, White Bluffs, and nearby settlements, as well as the Wanapum and other tribes using the area.<ref name="Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy 2002 1.12"/>

=== Construction begins ===
[[Image:Hanford B reactor construction.jpg|thumb|right|[[B Reactor]] construction (1944)]]

The Hanford Engineer Works (HEW) broke ground in March 1943 and immediately launched a massive and technically challenging construction project.<ref name=HistoryLink2>{{cite web | last=Oldham | first=Kit | title=Construction of massive plutonium production complex at Hanford begins in March 1943 | work=History Link | url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5363 | date=March 5, 2003 | accessdate=April 6, 2008}}</ref> Nearly 50,000&nbsp;workers lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite, while administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village.<ref name="Thayer">{{cite book | last = Thayer | first = H. | title = Management of the Hanford Engineer Works in World War II | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers Press | year = 1996 | location = New York, NY}}</ref> Construction of the nuclear facilities proceeded rapidly. Before the end of the war in August 1945, the HEW built 554&nbsp;buildings at Hanford, including three nuclear reactors (105-B, 105-D, and 105-F) and three plutonium processing canyons (221-T, 221-B, and 221-U), each {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long.

To receive the radioactive wastes from the chemical separations process, the HEW built "tank farms" consisting of 64&nbsp;single-shell underground waste tanks (241-B, 241-C, 241-T, and 241-U).<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.21<U+2013>1.23}}</ref> The project required {{convert|386|mi|km|0}} of roads, {{convert|158|mi|km|0}} of railway, and four electrical substations.

=== Plutonium production ===
{{further|[[B Reactor]]}}
The B Reactor (105-B) at Hanford was the first large-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. It was designed and built by DuPont based on an experimental design by [[Enrico Fermi]], and originally operated at 250&nbsp;[[megawatt]]s. The reactor was [[graphite]] moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a {{convert|28|by|36|ft|sp=us|adj=on}}, {{convert|1200|ST|t|adj=on}} graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004&nbsp;[[aluminium]] tubes.<ref name="page115130">{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.15, 1.30}}</ref> {{nowrap|Two hundred short tons}} (180&nbsp;t) of uranium slugs the size of rolls of U.S. [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] and sealed in aluminium cans went into the tubes.<ref name="page115130"/> A roll of quarters is about {{convert|1|in|cm}} by {{convert|2.9|in|cm}}.<ref>{{cite web|title = BCW Supplies: Quarters tubes <U+2013> round |publisher = BCW Diversified | url = http://www.bcwsupplies.com/products/Coin-Tubes/ | accessdate  = February 3, 2010}}</ref> [[Cooling water]] was pumped through the aluminium tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of 30,000 US gallons per minute (2,000 liters/sec).<ref name="page115130"/> 
[[Image:Hanford B Reactor.jpg|thumb|left|Workers standing on the elevator at the front face of B Reactor.]]
Construction on B Reactor began in August 1943 and was completed just over a year later, on September 13, 1944. The reactor went [[critical mass|critical]] in late September and, after overcoming [[nuclear poison]]ing, produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.22<U+2013>1.27}}</ref> Plutonium was produced in the Hanford reactors when a [[uranium-238]] atom in a fuel slug absorbed a [[neutron]] to form [[uranium-239]]. U-239 rapidly undergoes [[beta decay]] to form [[neptunium-239]], which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form [[plutonium-239]]. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called "canyons" that were located about {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} away. A series of chemical processing steps separated the small amount of plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] on February 5, 1945.<ref>{{cite book | last=Findlay | first=John | coauthors=Bruce Hevly | title=Nuclear Technologies and Nuclear Communities: A History of Hanford and the Tri-Cities, 1943-1993 | publisher=Hanford History Project, Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington | place=Seattle, WA | year=1995 | page=50}}</ref>

Two identical reactors, D Reactor and F reactor, came online in December 1944 and February 1945, respectively. By April 1945, shipments of plutonium were headed to Los Alamos every five days, and Hanford soon provided enough material for the bombs tested at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] and dropped over [[Fat Man|Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.27}}</ref> Throughout this period, the Manhattan Project maintained a top secret classification. Until news arrived of the bomb dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], fewer than one percent of Hanford's workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.22}}</ref> General Groves noted in his memoirs that "We made certain that each member of the project thoroughly understood his part in the total effort; that, and nothing more."<ref>{{cite book | last = Groves | first = Leslie | title = Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1983 | location = New York, NY | page = xv}}</ref>

=== Technological innovations ===
In the short time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances. As no one had ever built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, [[DuPont]] engineers installed [[ammonia]]-based [[refrigeration]] systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sanger | first = S. L. | title = Working on the Bomb: an Oral History of WWII Hanford | publisher = Continuing Education Press, Portland State University | place = Portland, Oregon | page = 70}}</ref>

Another difficulty the engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive  that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], used as a gasket material, and [[closed-circuit television]], used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sanger | first = S.

== Cold War expansion ==
[[Image:Hanford D Reactor.jpg|thumb|right|Decommissioning D Reactor]]

In September 1946, the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]] assumed management of the Hanford Works under the supervision of the newly created [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. As the Cold War began, the United States faced a new strategic threat in the rise of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet nuclear weapons program]]. In August 1947, the Hanford Works announced funding for the construction of two new weapons reactors and research leading to the development of a new chemical separations process. With this announcement, Hanford entered a new phase of expansion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hanford Cultural Resources Program, U.S. Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site Historic District: History of the Plutonium Production Facilities, 1943-1990 | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 2002 | location = Columbus, OH | isbn = 1-57477-133-7 | page = 1.42<U+2013>45}}</ref>

By 1963, the Hanford Site was home to nine nuclear reactors along the Columbia River, five reprocessing plants on the central plateau, and more than 900 support buildings and radiological laboratories around the site.<ref name="Overview"/> Extensive modifications and upgrades were made to the original three World War II reactors, and a total of 177&nbsp;underground waste tanks were built.<ref name="Overview"/> Hanford was at its peak production from 1956 to 1965. Over the entire 40&nbsp;years of operations, the site produced about {{convert|63|ST|MT|0}} of plutonium, supplying the majority of the 60,000&nbsp;weapons in the U.S. arsenal.<ref name="Overview"/><ref name="Arsenal"/>

=== Decommissioning ===
Most of the reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22&nbsp;years. The last reactor, [[N Reactor]], continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]] (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = City of Richland | title = Cocooning Hanford Reactors | date = December 2, 2003  |url=http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/richland/hanford/index.cfm?PageNum=12 | accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref> The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours.

[[Image:Hanford Site sign.jpg|thumb|right|Highway sign on a road entering the Hanford Site]]

The [[United States Department of Energy]] assumed control of the Hanford Site in 1977. Although uranium enrichment and plutonium breeding were slowly phased out, the nuclear legacy left an indelible mark on the Tri-Cities. Since World War&nbsp;II, the area had developed from a small farming community to a booming "Atomic Frontier" to a powerhouse of the nuclear-industrial complex.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hevly | first = Bruce | coauthors = John Findlay | title = The Atomic West | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1998 | location = Seattle, WA}}</ref> Decades of federal investment created a community of highly skilled scientists and engineers. As a result of this concentration of specialized skills, the Hanford Site was able to diversify its operations to include scientific research, test facilities, and commercial nuclear power production.

Some of the facilities currently located at the Hanford Site:
* The [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], owned by the Department of Energy and operated by [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]
* The [[Fast Flux Test Facility|Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF)]], a national research facility in operation from 1980 to 1992 (in cold standby {{as of|2007|lc=on}})
*  [[LIGO|LIGO's Hanford Observatory]], an interferometer searching for gravitational waves
* [[Columbia Generating Station]], a commercial [[nuclear power]] plant operated by [[Energy Northwest]].

The Department of Energy and its contractors offer tours of the site. Sixty public tours, each five hours long, are planned for 2009. The tours are free, require advance reservation via the department's web site, and are limited to U.S. citizens at least 18 years of age.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = United States Department of Energy | title = Hanford Site: Hanford Site Tours | url=http://www.hanford.gov/?page=317&parent=0 | accessdate = April 9, 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430064445/http://www.hanford.gov/?page=317&parent=0| archivedate = April 30, 2008}}</ref>

== Environmental concerns ==
[[Image:Hare HanfordReach.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hanford Reach]] of the [[Columbia River]], where radioactivity was released from 1944 to 1971]]

A huge volume of water from the Columbia River was required to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. These releases were kept secret by the federal government.<ref name="HHIN"/> Radiation was later measured downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.<ref>{{cite news | title = Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds | work = The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 | date = July 17, 1992 | accessdate = January 29, 2007}}</ref>

The plutonium separation process also resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], Oregon, and [[British Columbia]].<ref name="HHIN"/> [[Downwinders]] were exposed to [[radionuclides]], particularly [[iodine-131]], with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides filtered into the food chain via contaminated fields where [[dairy cows]] grazed; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed the radioactive food and drank the milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the "[[Green Run]]" released 8,000&nbsp;curies of iodine-131 over two days.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gerber | first = Michele | title = On the Home Front: The Cold War Legacy of the Hanford Nuclear Site | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | year = 2002 | location = Lincoln, NE | edition=2nd | isbn=0-8032-7101-8 | pages=78<U+2013>80}}</ref> Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities who depended on the river for their customary diets.<ref name="HHIN"/> A U.S. government report released in 1992 estimated that 685,000 curies of radioactive iodine-131 had been released into the river and air from the Hanford site between 1944 and 1947.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/13/nation/na-hanford13|author=Martin, Hugo|title=Nuclear site now a tourist hot spot|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=August 13, 2008}}</ref>

[[Image:Salmon at Hanford Site.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salmon]] spawning in the Hanford Reach near the H-Reactor]]
Beginning in the 1960s, scientists with the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]] published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, and there were protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. By February 1986, mounting citizen pressure forced the Department of Energy to release to the public 19,000&nbsp;pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford<U+2019>s operations.<ref name="HHIN"/> The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford<U+2019>s operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases.<ref name="HHIN"/> A [[mass tort]] lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years.<ref>[http://www.downwinders.com Hanford Downwinders Litigation Website].

While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s, parts of the Hanford Site remain heavily contaminated. Many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, but there are concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River. There are also continued concerns about workers' health and safety.<ref name=Troubled/>

The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the 53&nbsp;million&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons (204,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177&nbsp;underground tanks. About a third of these tanks have leaked waste into the soil and groundwater.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wald |first=Matthew |title=Panel Details Management Flaws at Hanford Nuclear Waste Site |work=The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D71638F935A25752C0A96E958260 |date=January 16, 1998 | accessdate=January 29, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611085657/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D71638F935A25752C0A96E958260 |archivedate = June 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> {{As of|2008}}, most of the liquid waste has been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, 2.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons (10,600&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of liquid waste, together with 27&nbsp;million&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons (100,000 m<sup>3</sup>) of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks.<ref name="Ecology"/> That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018.

[[Image:Handfor ERDF Grand Opening.jpg|thumb|right|Grand opening of the [[Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility]] (ERDF)]]
Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium has a [[half-life]] of 24,100&nbsp;years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to be safe.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Laura A. | last=Hanson | publisher=University of Idaho | title=Radioactive Waste Contamination of Soil and Groundwater at the Hanford Site | date=November 2000 | url=http://www.agls.uidaho.edu/etox/resources/case_studies/HANFORD.PDF |format=PDF|  accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Gephart | first=Roy | title=Hanford: A Conversation About Nuclear Waste and Cleanup | publisher=Battelle Press | year=2003 | location=Columbus, OH | isbn=1-57477-134-5}}</ref> The Department of Energy is currently building a [[Radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification]] plant on the Hanford Site. Vitrification is a method designed to combine these dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable. [[Bechtel]], the San Francisco based construction and engineering firm, has been hired to construct the vitrification plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $12&nbsp;billion. Construction began in 2001. After some delays, the plant is now scheduled to be operational in 2019, with vitrification completed in 2047. It was originally scheduled to be operational by 2011, with vitrification completed by 2028.<ref name=Troubled/><ref>{{cite news | last=Dininny | first=Shannon | title=Hanford plant now $12.2&nbsp;billion | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/284334_hanford08.html | date=September 8, 2006 | accessdate=January 29, 2007}}</ref>

In May 2007, state and federal officials began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as [[groundwater remediation]]. Those talks stalled in October. In early 2008, a $600&nbsp;million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws.<ref name=Troubled/> They appeared to step back from that threat in April after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/environment/archives/135723.asp | title=State steps back from brink of Hanford suit | last=Stiffler | first=Lisa | publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date=April 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

A sample of purified plutonium was uncovered inside a safe in a waste trench at the site during excavations from 2004 to 2007, and has been dated to approximately the 1940s, making it the second-oldest sample of purified plutonium known to exist. Analyses published in 2009 concluded that the sample originated at Oak Ridge, and was one of several sent to Hanford for optimisation tests of the T-Plant until Hanford could produce its own plutonium. Documents refer to such a sample, belonging to "Watt's group", which was disposed of in its safe when a radiation leak was suspected.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i05/8705notw7.html Chemical & Engineering News: Antique Plutonium: Manhattan Project-era plutonium is found in a glass jug during Hanford Site cleanup]</ref><ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/397375_plutonium26.html Seattle Pi: Historic plutonium found in safe at Hanford]</ref>
