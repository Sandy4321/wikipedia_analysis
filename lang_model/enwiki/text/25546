'''[[World War II]]''' was the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll|deadliest military conflict in history]]. Over 60 million people were killed, which was over 2.5% of the world population. The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses.

==Total dead==

World War II fatality statistics vary, estimates of total dead ranging from 50 million to over 70 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm# |title=Second'&#39;Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'&#39; |publisher=Users.erols.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref> The sources cited in this article document an estimated death toll in World War II of 62 to 78 million, making it the deadliest war in world history in absolute terms of total dead but not in terms of deaths relative to the world population.

When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Civilians killed totaled from 40 to 52 million, including 13 to 20 million from war-related disease and famine. Total [[Battle casualties of World War II|military dead]]: from 22 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.

==Classification of casualties==

Some nations in World War II suffered disproportionally more casualties than others. This is especially true regarding [[civilian casualties]]. The following chart gives data on the number of dead for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. Military figures include [[Killed in action|battle deaths]] (KIA) and [[Missing in action|personnel missing in action]] (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of [[prisoners of war]] in captivity. [[Civilian casualties]] include deaths caused by [[strategic bombing]], [[Holocaust victims]], [[Japanese war crimes]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfers in the Soviet Union]], other War Crimes and deaths due to war related famine and disease. Compiling or estimating the numbers of [[Casualty (person)|deaths]] caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a [[Conflict epidemiology|controversial subject]]. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Second |title='&#39;Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'&#39; |publisher=Users.erols.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref> The distinction between [[Killed in action|military]] and [[civilian casualties]] caused directly by warfare and [[collateral damage]] is not always clear cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the U.S.S.R., China, Poland, Germany and Yugoslavia, our sources can give us only the [[Demographic analysis|total estimated population loss]] caused by the war and a [[Approximation|rough estimate]] of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, [[crimes against humanity]] and war related famine. The [[World War II casualties#Footnotes|footnotes]] give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.

By 1965, the Suchdienst (search service) of the German churches was able to confirm 473,013 civilian deaths in eastern Europe due to the war and expulsions, broken out as follows: Poland 367,392; Czechoslovakia 18,889; Yugoslavia 50,864 other countries 35,871. There were an additional 1,905,991 unconfirmed cases of persons reported missing and presumed dead. Dr.R<U+00FC>diger Overmans gave a summary of this data at a 1994 historical symposium in Poland. Overmans pointed out that the figures are incomplete and only a partial not an exact accounting of total deaths. Overmans believes that since there are only about 500,000 confirmed deaths of German civilians in eastern Europe, the balance being a demographic estimate, that new research on the number of expulsion deaths is needed.<ref name="R<U+0171>diger Overmans- 1994"/> However, the German historian Ingo Harr believes that the Church Service figure of 473,000 confirmed deaths is a realistic view of the total deaths due to the flight during the war and expulsions<ref name="Herausforderung Bev<U+00F6>lkerung pp. 267-281"/><ref name="pism.pl"/> <br/>D. A 1974 study by the German government archives estimated a death toll of about 600,000 of civilians who died as a result of what they call "crimes against international law".

The total of 600,000 is broken out as follows: Poland: c. 400,000(-120,000 Killed by Soviet forces and their Allies; 200,000 dead during the [[Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union]]; 60,000 dead in labor camps in Communist Poland and 40,000 in Soviet camps in Poland.)

A revised demographic analysis published in 1995, which has the support of the German government, estimated 2,020,000 civilians died during the post war expulsions and the [[Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union]] broken out as follows: Poland 1,192,000; Czechoslovakia 220,000; Yugoslavia 106,000; Rumania 75,000; Hungary 84,000; Baltic States 33,000; USSR 310,000.<ref name="Gerhard Reichling 1995"/> The German government maintains that the figure of about 2 million deaths is correct because it includes additional post war deaths from hunger and disease of those civilians subject to the expulsions.<ref name="bundesregierung.de"/> <br/> F. In 1996 a joint Czech-German Historical Commission determined that between 15,000 and 30,000 Germans perished in the expulsions. The commission found that the demographic estimates by the German government of 220,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths due to expulsions from Czechoslovakia were based on faulty data. The Commission determined that the demographic estimates by the German government counted as missing 90,000 ethnic Germans assimilated into the Czech population; military deaths were understated and that the 1950 census data used to compute the demographic losses was unreliable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tschechien-portal.info/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=134 |title=Final Statement and Conclusions of the Czech-German Historical Commission |publisher=Tschechien-portal.info |date=1996-12-17 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref><ref>Hoensch, J<U+00F6>rg K. und Hans Lemberg, ''Begegnung und Konflikt.

The Polish historian [[Bernadetta Nitschke]] has provided a summary of the research in Poland on the calculation of German losses due to the flight and resettlement of the Germans from Poland only, not including other eastern European countries. Nitschke contrasted the estimate of 1.6 million deaths in Poland reported in 1958 by the West German government with the more recent figure of 400,000 that was detailed by Rudiger Overmans in 1994. She noted that the Polish researcher Stefan Banasiak estimated in 1963 that the death toll in the post deportations was 1,136 persons, a figure accepted by other Polish historians who maintain that that most of the deaths occurred during the flight and evacuation during the war, the deportation to the U.S.S.R. for forced labor and after the resettlement due to the harsh conditions in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] in post war Germany.<ref>Bernadetta Nitschke.
