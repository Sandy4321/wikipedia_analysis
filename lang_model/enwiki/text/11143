The '''Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst''', post-nominal letters '''DTD''', is a [[South African military decorations|South African military decoration]]. It was instituted in 1920 as a retrospective award for [[Boer]] officers of the 1899-1902 [[Anglo-Boer War]].<ref name="Forsyth 1">{{cite web|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol011fo.html|title=Dekoratie Voor Trouwe Dienst - South African Military History Society - Journal|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Forsyth 2">{{cite web|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol012df.html|title=Dekoratie Voor Trouwe Dienst - Part II - South African Military History Society - Journal|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Alexander">Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B. and Bateman, A.J.

==Institution==
The '''Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst''' (Decoration for Devoted Service), post-nominal letters '''DTD''', was instituted in terms of Government Notice no. 2307 dated 21 December 1920 and published in the Union of South Africa Government Gazette of 24 December 1920. It was a retrospective award for distinguished and especially meritorious service by [[Boer]] veteran officers during the [[Anglo-Boer War]] between 11 October 1899 and 31 May 1902.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="Forsyth 2"/><ref name="Soldier's Burden"/>

Since neither of the two Boer Republics, the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal) and the [[Orange Free State]], had official honours systems of their own, the decoration was created to afford Boer veteran officers serving as members of the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Forces]] parity with their fellow South Africans who had fought on the British side in the war.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="Alexander"/><ref name="Monick"/>

During the Anglo-Boer War, Republican commanders were instructed to record the names of members of their forces who distinguished themselves in the field. The names were to be sent to the War Council for confirmation and publication in the "Staats Courant" (Government Gazette) with the intention to award a medal after conclusion of hostilities. Since the Republican forces were defeated, however, the intended medal never became a reality.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/>

The Union Defence Forces (UDF) were established in 1912. In 1913 Colonel Skinner, Commandant of the Military School in Bloemfontein, remarked on the fact that some of the officers attending a course who had fought valiantly in the Republican Forces, were without medal ribbons whilst their brother officers who had served on the British side were all well decorated. Colonel Skinner made representations to Defence Headquarters to have this omission rectified but, due to the outbreak of World War I, nothing was done about the matter until 1920 when the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst, the [[Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog]] and the [[Lint voor Verwonding]] were instituted.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="Soldier's Burden">{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserscross.com/40184/465722.html|title=The Soldier's Burden|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="DTD, ABO & LvW"/>

==Award criteria==
The Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst could be awarded to officers of the military forces of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State whose service during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902 had been of such a distinguished and meritorious nature that, in the opinion of the Minister of Defence, they deserved special recognition. Recipients had to be serving members of the Union Defence Forces, or available to be called up for service in terms of the South African Defence Act of 1912.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/>

The gazetted regulations in effect actually excluded many men who had fought on the Boer side, such as the members of the various foreign units and potentially also the Natal and Cape rebels.<ref name="Soldier's Burden"/>

==Order of precedence==
{{main|South African military decorations order of precedence#Order of precedence}}
The Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst took precedence in wearing and officially ranked above the British [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref name="DTD, ABO & LvW">{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserscross.com/40184/465743.html|title=The Soldier's Burden|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Gazette 27376">Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, {{OCLC|72827981}}</ref>

The position of the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst in the official order of precedence was revised on 27 April 1994 when the South African Defence Force (SADF) was integrated with six other independent forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and again when a new series of military orders, decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003.<ref name="Gazette 27376"/>

;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994:
[[File:Ribbon - National Cadet Bisley Grand Champion Medal.gif|x37px|National Cadet Bisley Grand Champion Medal]] [[File:Ribbon - Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst (SAR).png|x37px|Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst]] [[File:South Africa Medal (1854).png|x37px|South Africa Medal (1854)]]

* Succeeded by the ''[[South Africa Medal (1854)]]''.<ref name="Gazette 15093">Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993</ref>

;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 2003:
[[File:Ribbon - Question mark.png|x37px|State President's Medal for Shooting]] [[File:Ribbon - Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst (OFS).png|x37px|Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst]] [[File:South Africa Medal (1854).png|x37px|South Africa Medal (1854)]]
* Preceded by the ''[[State President's Medal for Shooting]]'' of the [[Bophuthatswana|Republic of Bophuthatswana]].
* Succeeded by the ''[[South Africa Medal (1854)]]'' of the [[Cape Colony]].<ref name="Gazette 27376"/>

==Description==
The decoration was struck in silver and is a disk, {{convert|1+7/16|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} in diameter and {{convert|1/8|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} thick at the raised rim. It is affixed to a fixed bar suspender by means of claws and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. The rank and name of the recipient are impressed on the rim.<ref name="Forsyth 2"/>

;Equal sides
Neither side of the decoration is considered as the reverse. Both sides depict an encircled coat of arms on a [[cross patt<U+00E9>e]], encircled around the perimeter by the words "VOOR TROUWE DIENST" above and the years "1899 <U+2022> 1902" below. One side has the coat of arms of the South African Republic in the centre of the cross and the other side has that of the Orange Free State. This enabled each recipient to wear the medal so as to display the coat of arms of the state under whose flag he had fought.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/>

;Ribbon
The ribbon is {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} wide and in the combined colours of the two former Republics. While these colours were gazetted as red, green, white, blue and orange, the orange appears as yellow on the actual ribbons. As worn by a South African Republic veteran, it has a 12 millimetres wide blue band in the centre, edged by a 3 millimetres wide red and a 7 millimetres wide green bands on the left and a 7 millimetres wide orange and a 3 millimetres wide white bands on the right. An Orange Free State veteran would wear the ribbon reversed, with the white band at left.<ref name="Forsyth 2"/>

==Recipients==
Altogether 655 decorations were awarded between 1921 and 1946, all but one to officers. The sole exception was the award to Burgher A. Kuit, who was awarded the decoration for his service whilst occupying the position of "Inspekteur van Veldpos" (Inspector of Field Post).<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="Forsyth 2"/>

A complete list of recipients of the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst was published in the Military History Journals of the South African Military History Society, Volume 1, Numbers 1 and 2, in December 1967 and June 1968 respectively.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="Forsyth 2"/>

==Discontinuation==
The original closing date for applications was 30 June 1921, but this was not strictly adhered to. The award of the decoration was discontinued on 31 December 1946 and the last decoration was dispatched on 22 January 1947, to Kaptein M.C. Avis of General Smuts<U+2019> Commando.<ref name="Forsyth 1"/><ref name="DTD, ABO & LvW"/>
