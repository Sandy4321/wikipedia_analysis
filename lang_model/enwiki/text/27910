On the night of 20-21 January 1960 on a snowy night with gale force winds, [[Britannia Pacific]] No 70052 ''Firth of Tay'' was heading the 21:05 from [[St Enoch railway station|Glasgow St Enoch]] to [[London St Pancras]]. On the descent from [[Ais Gill]] summit the driver heard a repeated knocking which he thought came from the [[Connecting rod#Steam engines|connecting rod]] big ends (the bearing by which the rod rotates on the crank pin on the centre driving wheels). He reduced speed and later stopped the train at [[Garsdale railway station|Garsdale]] but by the light of a small torch was unable to find the cause of the noise. He continued south at between 20-30 mph. The fireman on the right of the train then saw sparks from the side of the locomotive as ballast began to be thrown up against the cab. As the driver made a full brake application an [[LMS Hughes Crab|LMS class 5]] hauled goods train passed in the opposite direction. The engine and eight leading waggons were derailed, ripping into the side of the first three carriages of the express, killing five people and injuring eight more.

===Cause===
A search of the track along which the express had travelled revealed that over the previous ten miles it had shed various components of its side assembly. Eventually the entire connecting rod had ploughed into the ballast near the adjacent line; wrecking the track in front of the oncoming goods train.  The root cause was the failure to tighten slide bar nuts; a problem which had been reported several times previously but without fatal consequences.  As a result of the enquiry the difficult to access nuts were redesigned.
