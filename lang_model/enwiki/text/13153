The '''Rotax 618''' is a {{convert|73.8|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]], two-cylinder, liquid cooled, gear reduction-drive engine that was formerly manufactured by [[Rotax|BRP-Rotax GmbH & Co. KG]]. It was designed for use on [[ultralight aircraft]].<ref name="Raisner">Raisner, William: ''LEAF catalog'', pages 6-105. Leading Edge Airfoils, 1995.</ref> 

==Development==

The 618 features liquid-cooled cylinder heads and cylinders with a rotary valve inlet and an exhaust valve. Cooling is via one or two externally-mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual [[Ducati]] capacitor discharge ignition systems and is equipped with two piston-type [[carburetor]]s. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.<ref name="Raisner" />

The engine's propeller drive is via a Rotax type C or E style gearbox. The standard engine includes a muffler exhaust system and an intake silencer and filter, with an after muffler also available to further reduce engine noise. The standard starter is an electric starter. An integral [[alternating current]] generator produces 12 volts and 200 watts.<ref name="Raisner" />

The Rotax 618 is no longer in production.
