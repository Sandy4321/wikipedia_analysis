'''Snyder''' (originally '''Snyderville''') is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] within the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as [[New York State Route 240]], and Main Street, which is also known as [[New York State Route 5]].  The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the transportation route on Main Street to points west in the 19th and early 20th Century.

As of 2009, the hamlet has several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions.  The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college.  The Snyder community has above average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region.  The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet.

The traditional definition of the hamlet is the "Snyder" postal service area, now merged into the 14226 [[zip code]].  However, using [[United States Census Bureau]]-based data, that does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet.<ref name=SAP16/>

In 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snyderville  and subsequently Snyder.<ref name=SAP3/><ref name=G15>Grande, p. 15</ref><ref name=gnis>{{gnis|965589}}</ref>  Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County.

In 1830, a [[stagecoach]] was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]], and sometimes [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street.<ref name=HotToAN/> By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory.<ref name=HoAN/> Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the [[stagecoach]] line along Main Street.<ref name=SAP4>"Snyder Action Plan", p. 4.</ref>  In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the ''[[Amherst Bee]]'', which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper.<ref name=HotToAN/> L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883.<ref name=HoAN/>

In 1892, an [[electric trolley]], which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as [[U.S. Route 62]], into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's [[streetcar]] system.  This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the "country".  This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs.<ref name=SAP4/> In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street/Harlem Road area, including [[blacksmith]] shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain.<ref name=G35>Grande, p. 35.</ref> In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live in closer proximity to each other in new subdivisions.<ref name=HotToAN/>

Harlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts.

==Transportation==
Snyder is bounded by I-290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this [[interstate highway]] that are both less than a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} from the Main and Harlem center of town.<ref name=SAP61>"Snyder Action Plan", p. 61.</ref>  This provides direct access to the I-90 (The New York State Thruway) and continuing south on Harlem to the [[New York State Route 33]] a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I-90.<ref name=SAP61/>  The community is also serviced by the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA), which provides three different bus routes (30, 48, and 49) connecting directly to the [[light rail]] [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] along Main Street to the west.<ref name=SAP61/>  All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to [[Erie Community College]] (north campus), the [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] and Transit Road ([[New York State Route 78]]).<ref name=ECSM>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfta.com/metro/pdfs/Erie_County.pdf|title=Erie County System Map |accessdate=2009-04-11|publisher=[[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]]}}</ref>  The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations.<ref name=ECSM/>

Historically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street.  In 1836, the street became a [[Macadam]] toll road.<ref>Grande, p. 50</ref>  On  April 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsville {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1}} to the east.  It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road.<ref>Grande, p. 51</ref>

The hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings: [[Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive]] and [[Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard]].  The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918.  Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005.  These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area.<ref>Grande, p. 97</ref>

[[Willard Genrich]] built the [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Amherst]] Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I-290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses.<ref>Grande, p. 100</ref>

==Government==
There is no formal Snyder government.  The hamlet, like the rest of the town of Amherst, is served by the Town of Amherst Government and receives municipal services from the town.  It is serviced by entities such as the Amherst Police Department and the Town of Amherst Highway Department, although Main Street and Harlem Road are serviced by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].<ref name=SAP52>"Snyder Action Plan", p. 52.</ref>  Residents of Amherst, including those in Snyder, pay taxes both to the Town of Amherst and the County of Erie.  However, the town tax is solely a school tax and the county collects the remaining town taxes for municipal services.
