'''Jan Karol Chodkiewicz''' (ca.[[1560]]&ndash; [[September 24]] [[1621]]) ({{lang-be|<U+042F><U+043D> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C> <U+0425><U+0430><U+0434><U+043A><U+0435><U+0432><U+0456><U+0447>}}, {{lang-lt|Jonas Karolis Katkevi<U+010D>ius, in Lithuanian folksongs his name is preserved as Katkus}}) was a famous [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n military commander (from 1601 Field [[Hetman]] of Lithuania, from 1605 Grand [[Hetman]])  and one of the most prominent 17th century [[szlachcic|noblemen]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. 

== Biography ==

He was the son of Jan Hieronim (Hieronymus) Chodkiewicz, [[Ruthenia]]n (or [[Lithuania]]n-[[Ruthenia]]n) rooted [[castellan]] of [[Vilnius|Vilnius (Vilna)]] and Krystyna Zborowska - daughter of famous aristocratic family from Polonia Maior (Wielkopolska). After being educated at the [[Vilnius University|Vilnius Academy]] he went abroad to learn the science of war, fighting in the [[Spain|Spanish]] service under [[Alva]], and also under [[Maurice of Nassau]]. In [[1593]] he married the wealthy Sophia Mielecka, by whom he had one son who predeceased him. His first military service in [[Poland]] was against the [[Severyn Nalyvaiko|Nalyvaiko Cossack uprising]] as lieutenant to hetman [[Stanis<U+0142>aw <U+017B><U+00F3><U+0142>kiewski]], and he subsequently assisted hetman [[Jan Zamoyski]] in his victorious [[Moldavian campaign#1599-1600|Wallachian campaign]].

Honours and dignities were now showered upon him. In [[1599]] he was appointed the Elder of [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitia]], and in [[1601]] Field [[Hetman]] (commander-in-chief) of the [[Lithuania]] army.

Chodkiewicz's first claim to fame were his victories in 1600 during the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]], where he defeated [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and their allies, serving under the command of the Polish Chancellor and [[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]]. A year later, in 1601, he accompanied Zamoyski north, to [[Latvia]]. In the [[Polish-Swedish War|war against Sweden]] for possession of [[Livonia]] he was appointed acting commander in chief of Lithuania after Zamoyski's return to the Poland in 1602. Chodkiewicz, despite inadequate supplies and little support from the Commonwealth [[Sejm]] ([[parliament]]) and King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], brilliantly distinguished himself, capturing fortress after fortress and repulsing the duke of [[S<U+00F6>dermanland]], afterwards [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]], from [[Riga]]. In [[1604]] he captured [[Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]]), twice defeated the Swedish generals at [[Bia<U+0142>y Kamie<U+0144>]] and near [[Bia<U+0142>y Kamie<U+0144>|Weissenstein]] in [[1604]], and was rewarded with the rank of Grand [[Hetman]] (supreme commander) of [[Lithuania]]'s army. Criminally neglected by the diet, which turned a deaf ear to all his requests for reinforcements and for supplies and money to pay his soldiers, Chodkiewicz nevertheless more than held his own against the Swedes. His crowning achievement was the great victory near the [[Dvina]] River in the [[Battle of Kircholm]] (modern [[Salaspils]], [[Latvia]]) on [[September 27]], [[1605]], when with barely 4000 troops, mostly the famous heavy [[hussars]], he annihilated a threefold larger Swedish army; for which feat he received letters of congratulation from the [[Pope Paul V|Pope]], all the Catholic potentates of Europe, and even  [[Ahmed I|the sultan of Turkey]] and the [[Abbas I of Persia|shah of Persia]]. 

Yet this great victory was virtually fruitless, owing to the domestic dissensions which prevailed in the Commonwealth during the following five years. Chodkiewicz's own army, unpaid for years, abandoned him en masse in order to plunder the estates of their political opponents, leaving the hetman to carry on the war as best as he could with a handful of mercenaries paid out of the pockets of himself and his friends. Chodkiewicz was one of the few magnates who remained loyal to the king, and after helping to defeat the [[Sandomierz rebellion]] ([[rokosz]]) against the Polish king in 1606-1607, a fresh invasion of Livonia by the Swedes recalled him thither, and in [[1609]] once more he relieved [[Riga]] besides capturing [[Pernau]].

Meanwhile the war with [[Russia]] broke out (the [[Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618)|Dimitriad wars]]), and Chodkiewicz was sent against [[Moscow]] with an army of 2,000. Moreover, the diet neglected to pay for the maintenance even of this paltry 2,000, with the result, that they mutinied and compelled their leader to retreat through the heart of Russia to [[Smolensk]]. Not till the crown prince, [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw]] arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war assume a different character, Chodkiewicz opening a new career of victory by taking the fortress of [[Dorogobuzh]] in [[1617]]. During that campaign, among many officers under Chodkiewicz's command, was future hetman, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski]].

The [[Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618)|Dimitriads]] had no sooner been ended by the [[treaty of Deulino]] than Chodkiewicz was hastily dispatched southwards to defend the southern frontier against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who after their victory at the [[Battle of <U+0162>u<U+0163>ora (1620)|Cecora]] had high hopes of conquering Poland altogether. An army of 160,000 Turkish veterans led by [[Sultan]] [[Osman II]] in person advanced from [[Adrianople]] towards the Polish frontier, but Chodkiewicz crossed the [[Dnieper]] in September [[1621]] and entrenched himself in the fortress of [[Chocim]] right in the path of the Ottoman advance. Here for a whole month the Commonwealth hetman resisted the sultan's 200-thousand army, repelling all its assaults till the first fall of autumn snow compelled Osman to withdraw his diminished forces. But the cost of victory was dearly paid for by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. A few days before the siege was raised the aged Grand Hetman died in the fortress on [[September 24]], [[1621]].
