==Early days==
The Kogi truck took a while to catch on. After several weeks of parking in different locations and not getting any customers, Kogi began going to clubs and giving [[free samples]] to [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s. They enjoyed them and spread the word.<ref name=shotgun>{{cite paper

Kogi's first "big break" came when it got the idea outside of [[Green Door (California)|Green Door]] in Hollywood to contact food bloggers about trying the tacos who then wrote about Kogi.<ref name=shotgun/>  Its subsequent use of [[Twitter]] to announce its location led to considerable buzz on [[social networking service]]s, leading ''[[Newsweek]]'' to proclaim Kogi "America's first viral eatery".<ref name=newsweek>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/187008|publisher=Newsweek|title=Now 4 Restaurant 2.0: Thanks to Twitter and the Web, L.A. is obsessed with the Korean tacos of America's first viral eatery.|author=Andrew Romano|date=2009-02-28}}</ref>

Kogi initially had no fixed location. In the tradition of LA taco trucks, Kogi operated entirely from a mobile vehicle driven around the city and parked for a few hours in different locations, with some preparation done from a home base in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=NPR|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101881984|title=Tweeting Food Truck Draws L.A.'s Hungry Crowds|author=Ben Bergman|date=2009-03-23}}</ref>  Its fan base has been built up through effective use of the Internet and cell phones to promote an online "Kogi Kulture".<ref name=newsweek/>  By mid-2009 it had 36,000 Twitter followers, and its first fixed location in the Alibi Room, a local lounge. By mid-2011, Kogi had expanded from the original truck to five.<ref name=newsweek/><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/07/17/kogi-wars-korean-taco-business-gets-ugly/|title=Kogi Wars: Korean Taco Business Gets Ugly|date=2009-07-17|author=Katy McLaughlin}}</ref>

In 2010, the creators of Kogi opened two sister restaurants serving Korean inspired food. The restaurant [[Chego]], with a primary focus on bowls, opened on April 7, 2010.<ref>{{ cite web |author=Odell, Kat |title=Welcome to Kogi The Restaurant, Soft Opening This Weekend |url=http://la.eater.com/archives/2010/03/30/welcome_to_kogi_the_restaurant_soft_opening_this_weekend.php|date=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Another restaurant and full bar, The A-Frame, was created from a former [[IHOP]] and modeled around the sloped architecture; it opened on November 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/home_blog/2010/10/a-frame-restaurant-culver-city.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A. at Home}}</ref>

==Reasons for success==
[[image:kogiline.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A line forms for the Kogi truck]]Part of the reason for the sudden and strong interest in Kogi is the food. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has explained the phenomenon as "The food at Kogi Korean BBQ-To-Go, the taco vendor that has overtaken Los Angeles, does not fit into any known culinary category."<ref>{{cite paper

Los Angeles, like many large American cities, has a large percentage of residents from different cultures, and Kogi relies on the familiarity people have with other cuisines.

The attraction, however, depends only partly on the flavors. Media accounts emphasize the social aspect of eating at the ever-mobile Kogi. According to the ''New York Times'', "The truck and its staff of merry makers have become a sort of roving party, bringing people to neighborhoods they might not normally go to, and allowing for interactions with strangers they might not otherwise talk to."<ref name=lat/>
