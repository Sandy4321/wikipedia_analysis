"'''The Goldberg Variation'''" is the sixth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] of the science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 12, 1999. It was written by [[Jeffrey Bell]], directed by [[Thomas J. Wright]], and featured guest appearances by [[Willie Garson]] and [[Shia LaBeouf]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "The Goldberg Variation" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.8, being watched by 14.49 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a mysterious man named Henry Weems, who appears to be the luckiest man in the world.

Bell's original draft of the episode opened with a man falling thirty-thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unharmed. This was later changed to a man falling out of a building for budgetary reasons. [[Willie Garson]]<U+2014>who had appeared in the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[The Walk (The X-Files)|The Walk]]"<U+2014>was cast as Henry Weems, breaking a "long-standing rule" on the show to not recast previous actors. The first cut of the episode was four minutes under-time, and so various insert shots and new scenes had to be filmed in order to compensate.

==Plot==
A man by the name of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona. Cutrona attempts to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of a building. After he lands, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), who promptly take the case. Mulder believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky. The agents track the man down, who happens to be a handyman at an apartment building. After meeting with Weems, Mulder agrees with Scully, concluding that his luck is the [[X-File]] in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but is killed; after accidentally shooting a lamp that knocks over an ironing board, the gunman trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder and Scully talk to Weems, who reveals he has a fascination with Rube Goldberg Machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. In addition, he notes he was also the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash  that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.

Weems picks up a lottery ticket and wins $100,000 but learns that it would take 12 months to get the money, so he throws the ticket away. A man picks the ticket out of the trash and is then hit by a truck after Weems warned him that "something bad will happen." Later, Mulder comes to question Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been trying to find a way to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness a boy in his apartment building, Richie ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), has. Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Henry is also taken but all the mobsters are killed in a bizarre turn of events. In the end, it turns out that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, who gets the treatment.<ref name="plot"/>

===Writing===
The episode title refers to cartoonist [[Rube Goldberg]], who was famous for his drawings of incredibly complex machines made out of everyday objects that performed rudimentary tasks. The elaborate contraptions Henry Weems created are physical examples of such machines.<ref name="big book">Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 177</ref> Episode writer Jeffrey Bell noted that he wanted the episode to function "as a Rube Goldberg device" and so he wrote the story to revolve around the ideas of good luck and bad luck. Originally, the episode's opening scene was to have featured Weems falling thirty thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unscathed. Although Bell's pitch was met with enthusiasm, many writers and producers for the show were cautious, because they realized the episode would have several humorous moments. Executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] explained: "The episode had a lot of humorous moments that we were afraid of doing because as many people who like the funny ones hate the funny ones."<ref name="s80">Shapiro, p. 80</ref> Eventually, the episode was [[Green-light|green-lighted]], but pushed to later in the season because, according to Spotnitz, "we wanted to scare the hell out of everybody during the first few episodes."<ref name="s80"/>

Bell began crafting his script, adding a mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons. The biggest hurdle for the episode, however, was crafting the Rube Goldberg machine. However, because Bell had "extra time" to write his script, the art department was given a head start on crafting the contraption.<ref name="s80"/> Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed in order to make sure everything went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a "long-standing rule" on the show and re-cast [[Willie Garson]]<U+2014>who had appeared in the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[The Walk (The X-Files)|The Walk]]"<U+2014>as Henry Weems. Millikan noted that Garson was "literally the best person for the job."<ref name="s81">Shapiro, p. 81</ref>

===Post-production===
After the episode was finished filming, the footage entered into a long period of editing. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] noted that the episode "wasn't cutting together well and that there were things that just didn't work."<ref name="s81"/> Eventually the resultant footage was reworked into an acceptable manner when suddenly the series ran into another problem: the episode was four minutes under time.<ref name="s81"/> In order to compensate for this, additional inserts of the Rube Goldberg Machine were filmed as well as a scene featuring Mulder and Scully discussing the episode's backstory.<ref name="s81"/> The latter, which was filmed several months after the rest of the episode, required Anderson to wear a wig because her hair style had substantially changed.<ref name="s81"/>

When the episode was finally finished and aired, it was highly enjoyed by ''The X-Files'' cast and crew. Carter called the entry "tight, funny, touching, and quirky."<ref name="s81"/> Series writer [[Vince Gilligan]] was impressed with the episode, and noted that the episode represented the seventh season of the show as whole. He explained: "The seventh season, for my money, was one of our best because we took more storytelling risks than in previous years."<ref name="big book"/>

The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations'', gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] episode "[[The Rain King]]" and noted that "'The Rain King' [written by Jeff Bell] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly came as a surprise to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" entry for [season seven]. It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot."<ref name="kess">Kessenich, p. 97</ref> Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the "finest stand-alone episode" of Season Seven and wrote, "Since 'The X-Files<U+2019> roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid."<ref name="geek">{{cite web|last=Harrisson|first=Juliette|title=A look back over The X-Files<U+2019> finest stand-alone episodes|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1043846/a_look_back_over_the_xfiles_finest_standalone_episodes.html|publisher=Den of Geek|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref> Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four.<ref name=cinepaula>{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=The X-Files Season Seven Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 2000|volume=32|issue=3|accessdate=March 29, 2012|page=18<U+2013>37}}</ref> She called the episode a "charmer" and praised Willie Garvin's characterization of Harry Weems.<ref name=cinepaula/> Kenneth Silber from [[Space.com]] wrote positively of the episode, writing, "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=The X-Files <U+2013> 'The Goldberg Variation'|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081024141005/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_706_991213.html|publisher=Space.com|date=August 19, 2000|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> Other reviews were more mixed. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and noted that despite the episode being "Funny stuff," it was ultimately "a little uneven overall."<ref name="dig">{{cite web|last=Rosell|first=Rich|title=The X-Files: The Complete Seventh Season|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4807|publisher=DigitallyObsessed|date=July 27, 2003|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode three stars out of five. Despite calling the episode "a likeable piece of work", the two explained that the story itself was fine, but that the episode's set piece do not work with the plot.<ref name="shearman">Shearman and Pearson, p. 211</ref> Shearman and Pearson, however, ultimately concluded that the premise was "such a well-meaning little bauble that you want to applaud it for its intent if nothing else."<ref name="shearman"/>
