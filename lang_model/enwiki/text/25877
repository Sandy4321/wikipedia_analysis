'''Bernard Hopkins Jr''', known as ''the Executioner'' (born January 15, 1965, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Boxing|boxer]]. He is  known for his ten year reign as [[middleweight]] [[world champion]] in which he successfully defended his title a record 20 times. He is the first fighter to retain all 4 major boxing governing body belts including the ''Ring Magazine'' belt in the same fight.  In addition to being an active boxer, he is also a minority partner with [[Golden Boy Promotions]].

==Background==
Born to Bernard Hopkins, Sr. and his wife Sue, Bernard grew up in the Raymond Rosey projects with his family. Hopkins turned to crime early in his life.  By the age of thirteen he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in [[Graterford Prison]] for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed rapes and the murder of another inmate in an argument over a pack of cigarettes, but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988, decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to [[Islam]].<ref>Steve Bunce (2001-11-11) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2001/nov/11/boxing.news The forgotten prince] Guardian. Retrieved on 2009-07-29.</ref> While leaving the prison for the final time, the warden told Hopkins he'd "see [Hopkins] again when you wind up back here," to which Hopkins replied "I ain't ever coming back here." <ref>Duran, Coyote. [http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/2375/still-waiting-bernard-hopkins-grow-old/ "Still Waiting for Bernard Hopkins to Grow Old?"] 15 July 2005.</ref>

==Professional career==
He immediately joined the professional boxing ranks as a light heavyweight, losing his debut on October 11, 1988, in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] to Clinton Mitchell. After a sixteen-month layoff, he resumed his career as a middleweight, winning a unanimous decision over Greg Paige at the [[The Blue Horizon|Blue Horizon]] on February 22, 1990.

Between February 1990 and September 1992, Hopkins scored 20 wins without a loss. He won 15 of those fights by [[knockout]], 11 coming in the first round.

===Winning the IBF middleweight championship===
Jones abandoned the middleweight ranks in 1994, and the IBF came again knocking at Hopkins's door on December 17 of that year, matching him with [[Segundo Mercado]] in Mercado's hometown of [[Quito, Ecuador]]. Mercado knocked Hopkins down twice before Hopkins rallied late and earned a draw. This was the first and only knock down of Hopkins's career until he fought Jean Pascal in 2010.  It has been argued that Hopkins was also not properly acclimated to the altitude of nearly 10,000 feet.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate =2008-08-23 }}</ref>

The IBF called for an immediate rematch, and on April 29, 1995, Hopkins became a world champion with a seventh-round [[technical knockout]] victory in [[Landover, Maryland]].

In his first title defense he defeated Steve Frank, whom he stopped in twenty-four seconds. By the end of 2000, he had defended the IBF title 12 times without a loss, while beating such standouts as [[John David Jackson (boxer)|John David Jackson]], [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]] (undefeated at the time and later went on to knock out an aging Roy Jones Jr), [[Simon Brown (boxer)|Simon Brown]], and [[Antwun Echols]].

===2001 middleweight unification tournament===
The arrival of multiple-division champion [[F<U+00E9>lix Trinidad]], a Welterweight into the middleweight ranks set off a series of unification fights between major titleholders. The fights involved in the tournament would be reigning [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Middleweight Champion, Bernard Hopkins. [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Middleweight Champion, Keith Holmes. [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Middleweight Champion, William Joppy. The fourth contestant was the undefeated and former [[Welterweight]] & [[Light Middleweight]] World Champion F<U+00E9>lix Trinidad.

====Keith Holmes====
On April 14, 2001, Hopkins won a unanimous decision over [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Keith Holmes (boxer)|Keith Holmes]] in [[New York City]]. Trinidad, however, knocked out Middleweight mainstay [[William Joppy]] in an impressive five rounds.<ref>{{cite news

====Felix Trinidad====
{{Main|Bernard Hopkins vs Felix Trinidad}}
Then, on September 29, 2001, [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion Trinidad challenged Hopkins for middleweight unification in [[Madison Square Garden]].

For the first time in many years, Hopkins was an underdog in the betting, which led the confident Hopkins to place a $100,000 bet on himself to win the bout. During promotion for the bout, Hopkins caused huge controversy by throwing the [[Puerto Rico]] flag on the floor in press conferences in both [[New York]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the latter conference leading to a riot in which Hopkins had to be run to safety from the angry mob.<ref>http://www.latinosportslegends.com/2001/Trinidad_Hopkins_riot_in_PR-071201.htm</ref>

During the fight, Hopkins was on his way to a lopsided decision victory when, in the 12th and final round, he floored Trinidad.  Referee Steve Smoger called a halt to the fight after Trinidad's father entered the ring to stop the fight. It was the first loss of Trinidad's career, and it made Hopkins the first undisputed world middleweight champion since [[Marvin Hagler]] in 1987. 'The Ring' magazine and the 'World Boxing Hall of Fame' named Hopkins as the 2001 Fighter of the Year.

===Undisputed middleweight champion===
He defended the undisputed title six times. Hopkins bested [[Carl Daniels]] on February 2 surpassing Carlos Monzon's division record of 14 defenses, 2002, by tenth-round technical knockout; [[Morrade Hakkar]] on March 29, 2003, by eighth-round TKO; [[William Joppy]] on December 13, 2003, by unanimous decision; and [[Robert Allen (boxer)|Robert Allen]] on June 5, 2004, also by unanimous decision.

====Oscar De La Hoya====
In the highest-paying fight of his career, Hopkins fought six-division titleholder [[Oscar de la Hoya]], another welterweight for the undisputed middleweight championship on September 18, 2004, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  They fought at a catchweight of 158&nbsp;lbs, two pounds below the [[middleweight]] limit of 160&nbsp;lbs.<ref>http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Aug-21-Sat-2004/sports/24590920.html</ref> Hopkins won the bout by knockout in the ninth round with a left hook to the body and thus became the first boxer ever to unify the titles of all four major sanctioning bodies.  At the time of the stoppage, Hopkins was ahead on two of the scorecards, with De La Hoya ahead on the other.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/more/09/19/delahoya.hopkins/index.html | work=CNN | date=September 19, 2004 | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | title=Body blow}}</ref>

In November 2004 de la Hoya invited Hopkins to join his boxing promotional firm, [[Golden Boy Promotions]], as president of its new East Coast chapter.

====Reaching number 20 - Howard Eastman====
At 40 years old, an age at which most boxers are retired, Hopkins reached the middleweight record of 20 title defenses on February 19, 2005, against ranked #1 WBC Middleweight contender [[Howard Eastman]], the European middleweight champion. Hopkins dominated the fight from start to finish, winning 119-110, 117-111 and 116-112.

====Hopkins vs Taylor====
{{Main|Bernard Hopkins vs. Jermain Taylor I}}

In his next fight on July 16, 2005, Hopkins lost his undisputed middleweight championship to [[Jermain Taylor]] via a split decision. Hopkins started slowly but came on strong over the final four rounds. Many press row writers scored the fight for Hopkins.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate =2008-10-24 }}</ref> Compubox round-by-round punch stats showed Taylor outscoring Hopkins 6-5-1 in total punches. Hopkins out landed Taylor in power punches 78-50.

On December 3, 2005, Hopkins lost his rematch against Jermain Taylor by unanimous decision. All three judges scored the fight 115-113 for Taylor.

Compubox statistics indicated that Hopkins landed more overall punches and significantly more power shots over the course of the fight, however these statistics may not accurately reflect the judging as rounds are scored in isolation.

===Moving up to light heavyweight&nbsp;<U+2014> Antonio Tarver===
Following his two losses to Jermaine Taylor, Hopkins at 41 decided not to retire and made the decision to jump two weight divisions to face off against ''The Ring'' light heavyweight champion [[Antonio Tarver]] on June 10, 2006. Going into the fight, Tarver was a 3-to-1 favorite and had been the first man ever to TKO Roy Jones Jr.  Many now placed Tarver among the sports top competitors. He was constantly ranked in the P4P rankings. However, Bernard Hopkins picked up a lopsided unanimous decision, scoring 118-109 on all three judges scorecards.

Antonio Tarver also lost a $250,000 bet with Hopkins, after he failed to stop Hopkins in the first six rounds.<ref>{{cite web

====Return in 2007 - Winky Wright====
On July 21, 2007, at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Hopkins defended ''The Ring'' light heavyweight championship against former [[List of undisputed boxing champions#Junior Middleweight|undisputed junior middleweight champion]] [[Winky Wright]]. During the weigh-in, Hopkins shoved Wright with an open-hand to the face, igniting a brawl between both fighters' entourages.<ref>{{cite news

====Joe Calzaghe====
{{Main|Bernard Hopkins vs. Joe Calzaghe}}
On April 19, 2008, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Hopkins lost ''The Ring'' light heavyweight championship to [[Joe Calzaghe]] by split decision ''((116-111 and 115-112 - Calzaghe. 114-113 - Hopkins)''. Hopkins started the fight well, dropping Calzaghe in the first round and using his ring savvy to confuse the challenger. As the fight wore on, Calzaghe began to have more success and ended up  winning the fight with late flurrys.<ref>{{cite web

====Kelly Pavlik====
{{Main|Bernard Hopkins vs. Kelly Pavlik}}
On October 18, 2008, Hopkins met middleweight champion [[Kelly Pavlik]] in a non-title fight at a catch-weight of 170&nbsp;lbs. Fans and pundits alike felt that knockout king Kelly Pavlik would become the first man to knock Hopkins out. Pavlik was a 4-1 betting favourite heading into the contest. On the night of the fight, Hopkins turned back the clock to produce a performance he claimed to be the best of his career winning a unanimous decision ''(117-109, 119-106, 118-108)'' over the undefeated Pavlik.
Hopkins prepared for this fight in the late summer heat at his second home , Danny Hawk's "World Famous" Normandy Gym in Miami Beach, FL.

===Recent fights===
After [[Tomasz Adamek]] knocked out [[Johnathon Banks]] of ESPN's Friday Night Fights, Hopkins immediately told ESPN's Dan Rafael that he was interested in moving up to cruiserweight to fight him, wishing to become the [[Ring Magazine]] cruiserweight champion of the world.

During the Ricky Hatton vs. Manny Pacquiao media conferences before their fight on May 3, 2009, Bernard Hopkins stated he would be "interested" in a proposed fight with British super middleweight champion [[Carl Froch]].

====Enrique Ornelas====
On December 2, 2009, Bernard Hopkins fought in his home city of [[Philadelphia]] for the first time since [[2003]] beating [[Enrique Ornelas]] via 12-round unanimous decision ''(120-109, 119-109 & 118-110)'' in what served as a tune-up bout for the 44-year old Hopkins who had not fought since his October 18, 2008 12-round upset victory over undisputed [[middleweight]] champion, [[Kelly Pavlik]].

The bout was supposed to be a tune-up for a scheduled March 13, 2010 rematch with [[Roy Jones, Jr.]] The rematch was later postponed as a result of Jones, Jr. falling to a first round technical knockout loss to [[Australian]], [[Danny Green]].

====Rematch with Roy Jones====
Hopkins and old foe [[Roy Jones Jr.]] agreed to fight in a rematch on April 3, 2010 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The two boxers fought again 17 years after their first bout in 1993. Hopkins defeated Jones by a unanimous decision in a 12-round bout marred by illegal blows and a skirmish at the end of the sixth round involving ring entourage, the referee and security guards.   Judges Don Trella and Glenn Trowbridge scored it 117-110 for Hopkins, while Dave Moretti favored him 118-109. The Associated Press had it 119-108, scoring 11 of 12 rounds for Hopkins.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=5054148</ref> 

He then challenged [[List of current world boxing champions|WBA Heavyweight Champion]] [[David Haye]] who had successfully defended his title against [[John Ruiz]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8602743.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hopkins beats Jones and eyes Haye | date=April 4, 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> Following Hopkins challenge, Haye ruled out the fight stating Bernard was only looking for a payday.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8603435.stm | work=BBC News | title=Haye dismisses Hopkins challenge | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> Hopkins later stated his intentions to fight [[Lucian Bute]] following Bute's third round technical knockout victory over [[Edison Miranda]]. [[Golden Boy Promotions]] also tried to approach retired boxer Joe Calzaghe for a potential rematch in 2010, but the latter reportedly turned the offer down.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=28278 | title =Joe Calzaghe Turns Down Bernard Hopkins Rematch | last =Vester | first =Mark | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =June 3, 2010 | accessdate =June 3, 2010}}</ref>

====Hopkins vs. Pascal====

The bout ended in a majority draw decision. Judge Steve Morrow had it 114-112 for Hopkins, but was overruled by Claude Paquette (113-113) and Daniel Van de Wiele (114-114).<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/12/18/sp-pascal-hopkins.html</ref>
