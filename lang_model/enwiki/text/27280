'''Joan Bocher''' (died 2 May 1550 [[Smithfield, London]]) was an [[English people|English]] [[Anabaptist]] [[burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]]. She has also been known as Joan Boucher or Butcher, or as Joan Knell or Joan of [[Kent]].

Bocher's origins are unclear, but it is known that families named Bocher and Knell lived in the area round [[Romney Marsh]]. She was associated with [[Baptist]]s and [[Anabaptist]]s in Kent, some of them immigrants who had fled persecution in the [[low countries]]. In the 1530s and 1540s she was "much in favour in reforming circles" in [[Canterbury]].<ref> DNB </ref> Although there is a lack of definitive written evidence, there are long-standing traditions associating her with [[Eythorne Baptist Church]].

Her first conflict with church and state came after she spoke against the [[Eucharist|sacrament of the altar]], but she was released from imprisonment by a commissary of [[Thomas Cranmer]], Christopher Nevinson. This leniency was held against Nevinson when he was charged in 1543 with involvement in the [[Prebendaries' Plot]].

Bocher developed an interest in [[Anabaptist]] ideas, and took up the idea of Christ's [[Theology_of_Anabaptism#Christology|celestial flesh]], "not incarnate of the Virgin Mary".<ref>Evans quoting Gilbert Burnet's ''History of the Reformation'' (1682)</ref>. She was arrested as a heretic in 1548 and convicted in April 1549. Then followed a year's imprisonment during which various well-known religious figures were enlisted to try to persuade her to recant. She was unmoved, and Cranmer was involved in bringing her to the stake on 2 May 1550, though accounts of him forcing [[Edward VI]] to sanction this  - with Edward "driven to pen the mandates", as [[Wordsworth]] put it<ref> [http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww633.html William Wordsworth, ''Edward signing the warrant for the execution of Joan of Kent'']</ref> - may be inaccurate.<ref> DNB </ref>

Some well-known stories about Bocher were first recounted by [[Richard Parsons|Richard Persons]] in 1599: for instance, Joan's friendship with [[Anne Askew]] and her involvement in smuggling [[William Tyndale|Tyndale]]'s [[New Testament]] into England, and into the royal court under her skirts. According to Persons in ''A temperate ward-word'', he had learned these things from someone who had been present at her trial.
