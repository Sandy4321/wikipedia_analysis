The '''San Francisco Bay Area''', commonly known as '''the Bay Area''', is a metropolitan region that surrounds the [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] and [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] [[estuary|estuaries]] in [[Northern California]].  The region encompasses metropolitan areas such as [[San Francisco]]-[[Oakland]] (12th largest in the country), [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (31st largest in the country), along with smaller urban and rural areas. Overall, the Bay Area consists of nine counties, 101 cities, and 7,000 square miles.<ref name="bayareavision.org">[http://www.bayareavision.org/bayarea/index.html San Francisco Bay Area Vision Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The nine counties are [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]], [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[Solano County, California|Solano]], and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]].<ref name="bayareavision.org"/><ref>[http://www.abag.ca.gov/ The Association of Bay Area Governments]</ref> 

The [[United States Census Bureau]] considers the Bay Area a [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA) with approximately 7.4 million people, making it the sixth largest CSA in the United States.<ref>http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2009/CBSA-EST2009-02.xls</ref> The Bay Area hosts many cities, towns, [[military base]]s, [[airport]]s, and associated regional, state, and [[national park]]s, connected by a massive network of roads, [[highway]]s, [[rail transport|railroads]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnels]] and [[commuter rail]]. The combined [[urban area]] of San Jose and San Francisco is the [[List of urban areas by population|50th largest urban area in the world]]. 

San Francisco is surrounded by water on three sides, bordering the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. It is the cultural and financial center of the Bay Area, and it has the second-highest population density (after [[New York City]]) of any city over 100,000 people in [[North America]].<ref>http://www.demographia.com/db-2000city50kdens.htm</ref>San Jose is the largest city in the Bay Area in terms of both land area and population.

The Bay Area is home to many well-known cities. San Francisco is famous for its steep hills, cable cars and historic streetcars, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and [[Fisherman's Wharf]]. Oakland, on the east side of the bay, has the fifth largest container shipping port in the [[United States]]. The city is also a major rail terminus.<ref name="North America Container Traffic Rankings">{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/Statistics/NORTHAMERICANPORTCONTAINERTRAFFIC2009.pdf|title=North American Container Traffic, 2009 Port Ranking|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> San Jose sits nestled within [[Silicon Valley]], the premier [[high technology]] region of the world.

==Subregions==
===East Bay===
{{Main|East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}
The eastern side of the bay, consisting of Alameda and Contra Costa counties, is known locally as the '''[[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]]'''. The East Bay is split into two regions, the inner East Bay, which sits on the Bay shoreline, and the outer East Bay, consisting of inland valleys separated from the inner East Bay by hills and mountains.
* The '''inner East Bay''' includes the western portions of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, including the cities of [[Oakland]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], as well as many smaller suburbs such as [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[Union City, California|Union City]], [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], [[Albany, California|Albany]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]], [[El Sobrante, California|El Sobrante]], [[Pinole]], [[San Lorenzo, California|San Lorenzo]], [[Hercules, California|Hercules]], [[Rodeo, California|Rodeo]], [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], and [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]]. The inner East Bay is more urban, more densely populated, has on average an older building stock, and a more ethnically diverse population. Oakland hosts the region's largest [[seaport]] and professional sports franchises in [[Golden State Warriors|basketball]], [[Oakland Raiders|football]], and [[Oakland Athletics|baseball]]. In 2002, more than 50% of all homicides in the Bay Area in 2002 occurred within the city limits of [[Uniform Crime Reports|Oakland and Richmond]]. Yet, despite a 2010 reduction in police, homicide numbers are significantly lower in Oakland. On a brighter issue, Rand McNally ranked Oakland's climate as the best in the United States. Weather, location, hillside neighborhoods with stunning views of San Francisco and the Bay, aggressive policies to reduce crime, and a substantial offering of shopping districts and restaurants representing cuisines both homegrown and worldwide have led real-estate prices in the inner East Bay to increase markedly in the past decade. <ref>http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Oakland,_California</ref>

* The '''outer East Bay''' consists of the eastern portions of [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]] and [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]] counties and is divided into 5 distinct areas: Lamorinda, Central Contra Costa County, East Contra Costa County, the San Ramon Valley, and the Livermore-Amador Valley. The word Lamorinda was coined by combining the names of the cities it includes: [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]], [[Moraga, California|Moraga]], and [[Orinda, California|Orinda]]. [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]] is situated east of Lamorinda and north of the San Ramon Valley and, together with [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], and [[Pleasant Hill, California|Pleasant Hill]] comprises ''Central Contra Costa County''. The cities of [[Pittsburg, California|Pittsburg]], [[Antioch, California|Antioch]], [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]], [[Oakley, California|Oakley]] and the unincorporated areas surrounding them comprise ''East Contra Costa County''. The cities of [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], [[Livermore, California|Livermore]], comprise the Livermore-Amador Valley (sometimes joined with the San Ramon Valley and called the [[Tri-Valley]]), or more popularly referred to as the [[Livermore Valley]] because Livermore is the largest city in the valley. The San Ramon Valley consists of [[Alamo, California|Alamo]], [[Danville, California|Danville]], [[Diablo, California|Diablo]] and its namesake, [[San Ramon, California|San Ramon]] to the south. The outer East Bay is connected to the inner East Bay by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]], Interstates [[Interstate 80 (California)|80]], [[Interstate 580 (California)|580]], and [[Interstate 680 (California)|680]], and [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] via the [[Caldecott Tunnel]]. The outer East Bay is particularly rural in Livermore {{Citation needed| reason=Livermore is a suburban community with more than 80,000 residents|date=July 2009}}, while being part suburban in Pleasanton-Dublin, and its infrastructure was mostly built up after World War II. This area remains largely white demographically, although the Hispanic and Filipino populations have grown significantly over the past 2-3 decades, particularly in the Concord area.

===North Bay===
{{Main|North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}

[[Image:Lightmatter napa valley.jpg|right|thumb|250px|right|[[Napa Valley]] is most famous for its [[wine]].]]

The region north of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] is known locally as the '''North Bay'''. This area encompasses [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], [[Napa County, California|Napa County]] and extends eastward into [[Solano County, California|Solano County]]. The city of [[Fairfield, California|Fairfield]], being part of Solano County, is often considered the eastern most city of the North Bay, though due to a stronger cultural and socioeconomic similarity to many East Bay cities, it is also often considered the northern most city of the East Bay.

With few exceptions, this region is quite affluent: Marin County is ranked as the wealthiest in the state. The North Bay is comparatively rural to the remainder of the Bay Area, with many areas of undeveloped open space, farmland and vineyards. [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] in Sonoma County is the North Bay's largest city, with a population of 157,985 and a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] population of 466,891, making it the fifth largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The North Bay is the only section of the Bay Area that is not currently served by a commuter rail service. The lack of transportation services is mainly because of the lack of population mass in the North Bay, and the fact that it is separated completely from the rest of the Bay Area by water, the only access points being the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] leading to San Francisco, the [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge|Richmond-San Rafael]] and [[Carquinez Bridge]]s leading to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], and the [[Benicia-Martinez Bridge]] leading to [[Martinez, California|Martinez]].

===Peninsula===
{{Main|San Francisco Peninsula}}

[[Image:Colma-california-panoramic1w.jpg|thumb|750px|center|View of [[Colma, California]], looking down from [[San Bruno Mountain]] ]]

The area from San Francisco to the Silicon Valley, geographically part of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], is known locally as the ''Peninsula''. This area consists of a series of cities and suburban communities in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] and the northwestern part of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], as well as various towns along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, such as [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]] and [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]]. This area is extremely diverse, although it contains significant populations of affluent family households with the exception of [[East Palo Alto]] and some parts of [[Redwood City]]. Many of the cities and towns had originally been centers of rural life until the post-World War II era when large numbers of middle and upper class Bay Area residents moved in and developed the small villages. Since the 1980s the area has seen a large growth rate of middle and upper class families who have settled in cities like [[Palo Alto]], [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], [[Portola Valley]], and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] as part of the technology boom of Silicon Valley. Many of these families are of foreign background and have significantly contributed to the diversity of the area. The Peninsula is also home to what used to be one of the deadliest cities in the United States, [[East Palo Alto]]. Peninsula cities include: [[Atherton, California|Atherton]], [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], [[Colma]], [[Daly City]], [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]], [[Foster City]], [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]], [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]], [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[Millbrae]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]], [[Portola Valley, California|Portola Valley]], [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[Redwood Shores, California|Redwood Shores]], [[San Bruno]], [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]], [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[South San Francisco]] and [[Woodside, California|Woodside]].

===San Francisco===
{{Main|San Francisco, California}}
[[Image:SanFrancisco from TwinPeaks dusk MC.jpg|thumb|800px|center|San Francisco panorama from Twin Peaks.]]

San Francisco is surrounded by water on three sides; the north, east, and west.  The city squeezes approximately 845,000 people in only 46.7 square miles, making it the second most densely populated major city in [[North America]] after New York City.<ref>http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-1/2008-09/documents/E-1_2009%20Press%20Release.pdf</ref> On any given day, there can be as many as 1 million people in the city because of the [[commuting]] population and tourism. San Francisco also has the largest commuter population of the Bay Area cities. The limitations of land area, however, make continued population growth challenging, and also has resulted in increased real estate prices. Though San Francisco is located at the tip of the peninsula, when the peninsula is discussed, it usually always refers to the communities and geographic locations located south of the city.

===South Bay===
{{Main|South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}
[[Image:Panoramic Downtown San Jose.jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panorama over [[Downtown San Jose|Downtown]] [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]]]

The communities at the southern region of the San Francisco Bay Area are primarily located in what is known as the [[Santa Clara Valley]]. These include the major city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and its suburbs, including the high-tech hubs of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] as well as many other cities like [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] and the [[commuter town|exurbs]] of [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]] and [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]. Some [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] and [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] towns are sometimes recognized as being in the Santa Clara Valley. Generally, the term South Bay refers to Santa Clara County, but the northwest portion of the county (Palo Alto and Mountain View) is considered part of the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] (even though these cities are in Santa Clara County). 

The South Bay was primarily an agricultural center from the time of California's founding until [[World War II]]. During and after the war, working and middle class families migrated to the area to settle and work in the burgeoning aerospace and electronics industries. The South Bay Area  experienced rapid growth as agriculture was gradually replaced by high-technology. During this period, the Santa Clara Valley became the stereotypical suburban region. Today, the growth continues, fueled primarily by technology jobs, the weather, and immigrant labor. Urbanization is gradually replacing suburbanization as the population density of the valley increases. This trend has resulted in a huge increase in property values, forcing many middle class families out of the area or into lower income neighborhoods in older sections of the region.

The South Bay is also known as [[Silicon Valley]], the premier technology center of the United States. Some [[Silicon Valley#Notable companies|notable tech companies headquartered in the South Bay]] are [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Brocade Communications Systems|BROCADE]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[eBay]], and [[Yahoo!]]. As a consequence of the rapid growth of these and other companies, the Silicon Valley has gained increasing political and economic influence within California, the U.S., and throughout the world.

San Jose is the tenth largest city in the [[United States]] and the most populous city in the Bay Area. San Jose is the oldest city in California and was its first capital. The city prides itself on being an environmentally conscious city. It recycles a greater percentage of its waste than any other large American city. Over the past several decades, the South Bay Area has experienced rapid growth. To try and limit the effects of [[urban sprawl]], planned communities were laid out to control growth. [[Urban growth boundary|Urban growth boundaries]] have been established to protect remaining open space (primarily in the surrounding hills and southern border) from development. Most new growth has been [[urban infill]] in the form of [[high density housing]] to increase density rate. The growth rate has slowed, but the area continues to have steady growth.

San Jose and the South Bay have a [[Mediterranean Climate]]. The South Bay hosts many outdoor events
throughout the year as a result, including concerts, sporting events, and other outdoor activities. San Jose is home to many sports teams both amateur and professional, such as the [[San Jose Sharks]] of the [[NHL]], and the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] of the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]].
 
The South Bay has a large transportation infrastructure that includes many freeways, [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] bus service and light rail, [[Amtrak]], and commuter rail such as [[Caltrain]]. The [[San Jose International Airport]] serves air traffic in the South Bay Area and is conveniently located just north of downtown in the center of [[Silicon Valley]]. The height of buildings in [[Downtown San Jose|Downtown]] is limited (due to [[FAA]] regulations and city ordinance) because it is situated directly under the flight path. The South Bay is poised to have a more efficient transportation network with the extension of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system to San Jose, which would allow elevated/subway travel into San Francisco.<ref>http://www.vta.org/bart/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nx8rNysZSI&fmt=18</ref>

===Santa Cruz and San Benito===
{{Main|Santa Cruz County, California|San Benito County, California}}
The regional governments in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the [[Association of Bay Area Governments]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco Bay Area)|Metropolitan Transportation Commission]], the [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District]], and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board include only the nine counties above in their boundaries or membership. (The BAAQMD includes all of the nine counties except the northern portions of Sonoma and Solano; the RWQCB includes all of San Francisco and the portions of the other eight counties that drain to San Francisco Bay or to the Pacific Ocean.)<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/body_boundary.html Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region (2) Boundaries].

Meanwhile, the California State Parks Department defines the Bay Area as including ten counties,<ref name=parks>{{cite web | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/parkindex/region_info.asp?regiontab=0&id=5 | title = Find a park - San Francisco Bay Area Region | publisher = California State Parks | accessdate = 2006-06-20}}</ref> including Santa Cruz but excluding San Benito. On the other hand, Santa Cruz and San Benito along with [[Monterey County]] are part of a different regional government organization called the [[Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments]]. Additionally, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties are considered part of the Bay Area in local media.<ref>[http://www.nbcbayarea.com/weather/]</ref><ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/channel?section=news/local/south_bay&id=7102664]</ref><ref>[http://weather.sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/auto/kpixV4/Region/Southwest/2xRadar.html?gimg=http://llnw.radar.cbslocal.com/anim/kpix/radar4_anim.gif&gtitle=CBS5%20South%20Bay]</ref><ref>http://www.ktvu.com/baytrafficmap_southbay/index.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.kron.com/Regions/SouthBay/tabid/65/Default.aspx]</ref>

Some residents of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] ([[Boulder Creek, California|Boulder Creek]], [[Brookdale, California|Brookdale]], [[Ben Lomond, California|Ben Lomond]], [[Felton, California|Felton]], [[Scotts Valley]]) do not usually consider themselves to be residents of the Bay Area, rather just of the Santa Cruz Mountains themselves. The Santa Cruz Mountains run along the spine of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], beginning in San Francisco and continuing down to their terminus near the City of Gilroy, effectively creating the [[Santa Clara Valley]].

The city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] is geographically isolated from the rest of the Bay Area, and is sometimes considered a part of the [[Monterey Bay]] area since the city lies on the north end of the Monterey Bay. The city may be regarded as the northernmost point of the [[Central Coast, California|California Central Coast]], which extends south along the state's coastline to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. Santa Cruz is a major tourist and beach town, home of the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]], one of the remaining boardwalk seaside amusement parks left on the [[West Coast (U.S.)|West Coast]]. Most of remainder of the county is agricultural and forested except for the seaside towns of [[Capitola, California|Capitola]] and [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]]. With its drier climate, San Benito County is primarily agricultural and is home to the [[Pinnacles National Monument]]. 

This partial inclusion of these two counties in the Bay Area is one manifestation of a "spillover" where, because of high housing prices in the Bay Area proper, people with Bay Area jobs purchase homes in outlying areas and endure long commutes. This blurs the outer borders of the Bay Area, which now can be said to spillover not only to the south (Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey counties) but to the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] counties of [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]], and [[Yolo County, California|Yolo]].

According to the 2007 American Community Survey,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} the Bay Area's population was 6.958 million, up from 6.784 million in 2000. In 2000 the racial makeup of the 9 County Bay Area was 58.1% [[White American|white]], 19.0% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.5% [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]], 7.5% [[African American|black]], 0.6% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 9.2% from other races, and 4.9% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]]. 19.4% of the population was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] of any race. 27.4% of the population was foreign born; of this, 51.3% from Asia, 32.5% came from Latin America, 11.4% from Europe, 4.8% from other parts of the world.

In 2007 the [[population density]] was 1,057 people per square mile. There were 2,499,702 housing units with an average family size of 3.3. Of the 2,499,702 households, approximately one-third were renter occupied housing units, while two-thirds were owner occupied housing units. 12.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 11.6% of households had someone 65 years of age or older, and 27.4% of households were non-families.<ref>http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm</ref>

==Political views==
The San Francisco Bay Area is widely regarded as being among the most [[Liberalism|liberal]] areas in the country. According to the [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] (CPVI), [[congressional districts]] the Bay Area tends to favor [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates by roughly 40 to 50 percentage points, considerably above the mean for [[California]] and the nation overall. All congressional districts in the region voted for Democrat [[Barack Obama]] over Republican [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]].
Over the last four and a half decades the 9-county Bay Area voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates only twice, once in 1972 for [[Richard Nixon]] and again in [[:Category:1980 in politics|1980]] for [[Ronald Reagan]], both Californians. The last county to vote for a Republican Presidential candidate was [[Napa County, California|Napa county]] in 1988 for [[George H. W. Bush]].

==Affluence==
The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the wealthiest regions in the [[United States|U.S]], due, primarily, to the economic power engines of [[San Francisco]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. The Bay Area has approximately 123,621 [[millionaire]] households.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/25/BU1611EF3L.DTL | title=Ranks Of Millionaires Still Swelling | first=Sam | last=Zuckerman | date=2008-06-26 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Among medium-sized cities, [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] has the highest household income in the country, and [[Livermore, California|Livermore]] the third highest. However, discretionary income is very comparable with the rest of the country, primarily because the higher cost of living offsets the increased income.<ref name=affluence>{{cite web | url = http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/localnews/ci_4259660 | title = Pleasanton tops county in median household income | publisher = Inside Bay Area | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>

A study by Claritas indicates that in 2004, 5% of all households within the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas held $1 million in investable assets.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/10/BUG2VD678F1.DTL&type=printable] "Assets".</ref>

As of 2007, there were approximately 80 public companies with annual revenues of over $1 billion a year, and 5-10 more private companies. Nearly 2/3 of these are in the Silicon Valley section of the Bay Area. According to the May 2009 Fortune Magazine analysis of the US "Fortune 500" companies, the combined San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan region ranks second nationally (along with metro Chicago and Houston) with 29 companies. (May 4, Fortune Magazine) Additionally, when the combined total revenue of the Fortune 500 list companies is considered, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland region again ranks second nationally after New York with $884 billion. (May 4, Fortune Magazine) As of 2010, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland region ranks second only to New York City (and ahead of Chicago and Houston) as the number of Fortune 500 companies has increased to 31 companies. (April 2010 Fortune Magazine)

[[Image:San Francisco Bay Area Skyline Blvd2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rain is rare in the San Francisco Bay Area during the summer months. As a result, the surrounding hills quickly become dry and golden-hued in grassy areas.]]
[[Image:San Francisco Bay Area Skyline Blvd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Skyline Boulevard]] stretches through the Santa Cruz Mountains, here near Palo Alto, California. During winter and spring, the hills surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area are lush and green.]]
Because the hills, mountains, and large bodies of water produce such vast geographic diversity within this region, the San Francisco Bay Area offers a significant variety of [[microclimate]]s. The areas near the [[Pacific Ocean]] are generally characterized by relatively small temperature variations during the year, with cool foggy summers and mild rainy winters. Inland areas, especially those separated from the ocean by hills or mountains, have hotter summers and colder overnight temperatures during the winter. Few residential areas ever experience snow, but peaks over {{convert|2000|ft|m}} (including [[Mount Saint Helena|Mount St. Helena]], [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], [[Mission Peak]], [[Mount Diablo]], and [[Mount Tamalpais]]) occasionally receive snow. San Jose at the south end of the Bay averages fewer than {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain annually, while Napa at the north end of the Bay averages over 30 and parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains just a few miles west of San Jose get over 55. In the summer, inland regions can be over 40 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) warmer than the coast. This large temperature contrast induces a strong pressure gradient, which results in brisk coastal winds which help keep the coastal climate cool and typically, foggy during the summer. Additionally, strong winds are produced through gaps in the coastal ranges such as the [[Golden Gate]], the [[Carquinez Strait]], and the [[Altamont Pass]], the latter the site of extensive [[wind farm]]s. During the fall and winter seasons, when not stormy, a high pressure area is usually present inland, leading to an offshore flow. While negatively impacting air quality, this also clears fog away from the Pacific shore, and so the best weather in San Francisco can usually be found from mid September through mid October. Winter storms are typically wet and mild in temperature during this time of year, being caused by cold fronts sweeping the eastern Pacific and often originating in the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. During November into mid March, winter storms are usually several days in length, wet and cool, with severely damaging storms rare. Occasionally during the Summer, spells of warm humid weather will drift over the Bay Area from the [[North American Monsoon|Southwest Monsoon]] or from the residue of Western Pacific hurricanes near Mexico, usually bringing high variable clouds as well, and more rarely, high-based [[thunderstorm]]s.

==Ecology==
{{Main|San Francisco Bay}}
[[Image:Sfestuaryhistorical.gif|thumb|300px|right|San Francisco Bay ca. 1770-1820]]
Despite its urban and industrial character, San Francisco Bay and the [[Sacramento River Delta|Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] remain perhaps California's most important [[ecology|ecological]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. California's [[Dungeness crab]], Pacific [[halibut]], and Pacific [[salmon]] [[fisheries]] rely on the bay as a nursery. The few remaining [[salt marsh]]es now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh, supporting a number of endangered [[species]] and providing key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and [[sediment]]s from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the [[Pacific Flyway]]. Millions of [[waterfowl]] annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Two [[endangered species]] of birds are found here: the [[California least tern]] and the [[California clapper rail]]. Exposed [[bay mud]]s provide important feeding areas for [[shorebird]]s, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. San Francisco Bay provided the nation's first wildlife refuge, Oakland's artificial [[Lake Merritt]] (constructed in the 1860s) and America's first urban National Wildlife Refuge, the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]] (SFBNWR) (1972). The Bay is also invaded by non-native species.

[[Steelhead trout]] (''Oncorhyncus mykiss'') populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes.  The Central California Coast [[distinct population segment]] (DPS) was listed as threatened under the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] on August 18, 1997; threatened status was reaffirmed on January 5, 2006. This DPS includes all naturally spawned [[Fish migration|anadromous]] steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] to [[Aptos Creek]], and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays.<ref>{{cite report |title=Central California Coast Steelhead DPS |publisher=NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Regional Office |url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/ESA-Salmon-Listings/Salmon-Populations/Steelhead/STCCC.cfm |accessdate=Feb. 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Map showing endangered species status of west coast steelhead |publisher=[[Alameda Creek]] Alliance |url=http://www.alamedacreek.org/Steelhead%20trout/steelhead%20listing%20status.gif |accessdate=Feb. 14, 2010 }}</ref> The U.S. [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] has a [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/salmon.htm detailed description of threats].

[[Burrowing owl|Western Burrowing Owl]]s (''Athene cunicularia'') were listed as a [[California species of special concern|Species of Special Concern]] (a pre-listing category under the [[Endangered Species Act]]) by the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 90's, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Owl Be Damned:Developers plow into the homes of the burrowing owl |author=Rendon, JIm |newspaper=Metro, Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper |date=Nov.-Dec., 1999 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.24.99/cover/species5-9947.html }}</ref> In 1994, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] nominated the Western Burrowing Owl as a Federal Category 2 candidate for listing as endangered or threatened, but loss of habitat continues due to development of the flat, grassy lands used by the owl. A 1992-93 survey reported no breeding burrowing owls in [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], and [[San Francisco County|San Francisco]] counties, and only a few in [[San Mateo County|San Mateo]] and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]]. The [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] population is declining and restricted to a few breeding locations, leaving only [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Contra Costa County|Contra Costa]], and [[Solano County|Solano]] counties as the remnant breeding range.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=Wild Neighbors: Antioch Owls Face Evicition |author=Joe Eaton |newspaper=Berkeley Daily Planet |date=Jan. 14, 2010 |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-01-14/article/34485?headline=Wild-Neighbors-Antioch-Owls-Face-Evicition |accessdate=Jan. 14, 2010 }}</ref> Despite organized protests at Kiper Homes' Blue Ridge property in [[Antioch, California]] by ''Friends of East Bay Owls'', one-way doors were installed in the birds' burrows so that the owl families could not return to their nests in early 2010.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title= Owl advocates protest birds relocation |author= Katherine Tam |date= Jan. 3, 2010 |url= http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_14115773?nclick_check=1 |newspaper= Contra Costa Times |accessdate= Jan. 3, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, in 2008, [[Mountain View, California]] evicted a pair of burrowing owls so that it could sell a parcel of land to [[Google]] to build a hotel at Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road.<ref>{{cite news |title=Burrowing Owls vs. Google:Pair of birds found on Google's hotel site will cost city $150,000 |author=DeBolt, Daniel |newspaper=Mountain View Voice |date=January 10, 2008 |url=http://www.mv-voice.com/news/show_story.php?id=348 }}</ref> Eviction of the owls is controversial because the birds regularly reuse burrows for years, and there is no requirement that suitable new habitat be found for the owls.

Tellingly, much of the SFBNWR consists of [[salt]] [[evaporation]] ponds purchased or leased from [[Leslie Salt Company]] and its successor, [[Cargill|Cargill Corporation]]. These salt ponds produce salt for a variety of industrial purposes, including [[chlorine]] [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]] and [[plastic]]s manufacture, as well as supporting dense populations of [[brine shrimp]], and therefore serving as feeding areas for waterfowl. In 2003, California and Cargill entered one of the largest private land purchases in American history, with the state and federal governments paying about $200 million for 16,000 acres (65&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of salt ponds in the south bay. SFBNWR and state biologists hope to restore some of the recently purchased ponds as [[tide|tidal]] wetlands.

The seasonal range of water temperature in the Bay is from about 8 <U+00B0>C (46 <U+00B0>F) to about 23 <U+00B0>C (73 <U+00B0>F).

[[Humphrey the Whale]], a [[humpback whale]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae''), entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations, and was successfully rescued and redirected each time in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This occurred again with [[Dawn and Delta]] a mother and calf in 2007.

Industrial, mining, and other uses of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's [[phytoplankton]] and contamination of its sportfish.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Environ Contam Toxicol |year=2008 |volume=194 |pages=29<U+2013>54 |title= Mercury in the San Francisco Estuary |author= Conaway CH, Black FJ, Grieb TM, Roy S, Flegal AR |pmid=18069645}}</ref> In November 2007, a ship named ''[[Cosco Busan]]'' collided with the San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled over 58,000 gallons of bunker fuel, creating the largest [[oil spill]] in the region since 1996.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bay9nov09,1,1303799.story?coll=la-headlines-california |title=Oil oozes in S.F.

==Geology and landforms==
[[File:Glen Canyon Park Chert Outcrop.jpg|thumb|right|A portion of the [[Franciscan Assemblage]] (former seabed), one of the terrane types]]

===Multiple terrains===
The area is well known worldwide for the complexity of its landforms, the region being composed of at least six [[terrane]]s ([[continent]]al, [[seabed]], or [[island arc]] fragments with distinct characteristics) pushed together over millions of years by the forces of [[plate tectonics]]. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. Formations include the [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]] of [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], and [[shale]] in uplifted seabeds, [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] rock, [[coal]] deposits, and [[igneous]] forms such as basalt flows, rhyolite outcroppings, granite associated with the [[Salinian Block]] west of the San Andreas Fault, and ash deposits of extinct [[volcano]]s. [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene-era]] [[fossil]]s of [[mammal]]s are abundantly present in some locations.

===Vertical relief===
The region has considerable vertical relief in its landscapes that are not in the [[alluvial plain]]s leading to the bay or in inland valleys. In combination with the extensive water regions this has forced the fragmented development of urban and suburban regions and has led to extensive building on poor soils in the limited flatland areas and considerable expense in connecting the various [[subregion]]s with roads, tunnels, and bridges.
[[Image:BayareaUSGS.jpg|thumb|USGS satellite photo of the Bay Area taken in 1999.]]
Several mountains are associated with some of the many ridge and hill structures created by compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. These provide spectacular views (in appropriate weather) of large portions of the Bay Area and include Marin County's [[Mount Tamalpais]] at 2,571 feet (784 m). Contra Costa County's [[Mount Diablo]] at 3,849 feet (1,173 m), Alameda County's [[Mission Peak]] at 2,517 to 2,604 feet (767 to 776 m), and Santa Clara County's [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] at 4,213&nbsp;ft (1,284 m), the latter with significant astronomical studies performed at its crowning [[Lick Observatory]]. Though Tamalpais and Mission Peak are quite lower than the others, Tamalpais has no other peaks and few hills nearby. Mission Peak is coast facing and is an interior mountain  and therefore has excellent views of both sides.

The three major ridge structures (part of the [[Pacific Coast Range]]) which are all roughly parallel to the major faultlines:
* The various ranges which form the spine of the San Francisco Peninsula and Marin County ([[San Andreas Fault]])
* The [[Berkeley Hills]], [[San Leandro Hills]] and their southern ridgeline extension through [[Mission Peak]] ([[Hayward Fault]])
* The [[Diablo Range]], which includes [[Mount Diablo]] and [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] ([[Calaveras Fault]])

===Major waterways===
{{Main|Hydrography of the San Francisco Bay Area}}
* [[San Joaquin River]]
* [[Sacramento River]]
* [[Napa River]]
* [[Sonoma Creek]]
* [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]]
* [[Coyote Creek (Santa Clara County)|Coyote Creek]]
* [[Petaluma River]]

* [[Wildcat Creek (California)|Wildcat Creek]]
* [[Oakland Estuary]]
* [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]]
* [[San Lorenzo River]]
* [[Gulf of the Farallones]]
* [[Alameda Creek]]

===Earthquake faults===
[[Image:Flat eq map anotated.png|left|thumb|235px|Map showing some of the major faults in the Bay Area. Numerous minor faults are also capable of generating locally destructive earthquakes.]]
The region is also traversed by six major slip-strike fault systems with hundreds of related faults, many of which are "sister faults" of the infamous [[San Andreas Fault]], all of which are stressed by the relative motion between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] or by compressive stresses between these plates. Significant blind [[thrust fault]]s (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and the northern reaches of the [[Diablo Range]] and [[Mount Diablo]].

==Natural hazards==
===Earthquakes===
[[Image:ShakeSuseptBayamateMod.gif|thumb|right|235px|Map showing earthquake amplification due to soil type.]]
The region is particularly exposed to hazards associated with large [[earthquake]]s,<ref>http://quake.abag.ca.gov/ - Maps and information about Bay Area threats including earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis.</ref><ref>[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1868virtualtour/bayarea.php/ USGS site with Google Earth KMZ files related to geology and seismic activity]</ref> owing to a combination of factors:
* Numerous major active faults in the region.
* A combined thirty year probability of a major earthquake in excess of seventy percent.
* Poorly responding native soil conditions in many places near the bay and in inland valleys, soils which amplify shaking as shown in the map to the right.
* Large areas of filled marshlands and bay mud that are significantly urbanized, with most subject to [[earthquake liquefaction|liquefaction]], becoming unable to support structures.
* A large inventory of older buildings, many of which are expected to perform poorly in a major earthquake.
* Extensive building in areas subject to [[landslide]], [[mudslide]], and in some locations directly over active fault surface rubble zones.
* Most lowrise construction is not fireproof and water systems are likely to be extensively damaged and so large areas are subject to destruction by fire after a large earthquake.
* The coastal location makes the region vulnerable to Pacific Ocean [[tsunami]]s.<ref>[http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/web_tsus/19600522/damage.htm Describes Bay Area damage from 1960 tsunami.]</ref>

Some of these hazards are being addressed by [[seismic retrofit]]ting, education in household seismic safety, and even complete replacement of major structures such as the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge|eastern span of the San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]].

For an article concerning a typical fault in the region and its associated hazards see [[Hayward Fault Zone]].

===Flooding===
Some flooding occurs on local drainages under sustained wet conditions when the ground becomes saturated, more frequently in the North Bay area, which tends to receive substantially more rainfall than the South Bay. In one case, the [[Napa River]] drainage, floodplain developments are being purchased and removed and natural wetlands restored in the innovative [[Napa River Flood Project]] as the previous [[river engineering#Channelization|channelization]] of insufficient capacity around such developments was causing flooding problems upstream. Many of the local creeks have been channelized, although modern practice and some restoration work includes returning the creeks to a natural state with dry [[stormwater]] bypasses constructed to handle flooding. While quite expensive, the restoration of a natural environment is of high priority in the intensively urbanized areas of the region.

===Windstorms and wildfires===
Typically between late November and early March, a very strong Pacific storm can bring both substantial rainfall (saturating and weakening soil) and strong wind gusts that can cause trees to fall on power lines. Owing to the wide area involved (sometimes hundreds of miles of coast), service can be interrupted for up to several days in some more remote localities, but service is usually restored quickly in urban areas. These storms occasionally bring lightning & thunder. More rarely they even spawn tornadoes. For example, during the abnormal hurricane-like storm in early 2010, a funnel cloud sparked an extremely rare Tornado Warning in Morgan Hill.

In the spring and fall, [[Diablo wind|strong offshore winds]] periodically develop. These winds are an especially dangerous fire hazard in the fall when vegetation is at its driest, as exemplified historically by the [[1923 Berkeley Fire]] and the [[Oakland Firestorm of 1991|1991 Oakland Firestorm]].

===Mudslides and landslides===
Some geologically unstable areas have been extensively urbanized, and can become mobile due to changes in drainage patterns and grading created for development. These are usually confined to small areas, but there have been larger problems in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in the Bay Area}}
[[Image:Sfbridgemap.jpg|thumb|right|'''(1)''' [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge]], '''(2)''' [[Golden Gate Bridge]], '''(3)''' [[San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]], '''(4)''' [[San Mateo-Hayward Bridge]], '''(5)''' [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]], '''(6)''' [[Carquinez Bridge]], '''(7)''' [[Benicia-Martinez Bridge]] ]]
The Bay Area is served by many [[public transportation]] <!-- are airports considered public transport? aren't they more like air taxis? -->systems, including three international [[airport]]s ([[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]], [[Oakland International Airport|OAK]], [[Mineta San Jose International Airport|SJC]]), six major overlapping [[bus]] transit agencies ([[AC Transit]], [[San Francisco Muni|Muni]], [[SamTrans]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]], [[Golden Gate Transit]], [[County Connection]]), in addition to dozens of smaller ones. There are four [[rapid transit]] and [[regional rail]] systems including [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and [[CalTrain]] and two [[light rail]] systems ([[San Francisco Muni Metro]] and [[VTA Light-rail]]). There are also several regional rail lines provided by [[Amtrak]], notable the [[Capitol Corridor]]. In addition to rail lines, there are multiple public and private ferry services (notably [[Golden Gate Ferry]] and [[Blue and Gold Fleet]]), which are being expanded by the [[San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority]]. The regional ferry hub is San Francisco [[Ferry Building]]. AC Transit and some other agencies provide an extensive network of express "transbay" commuter buses from the [[suburbs]] to [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]].

The [[freeway]] and [[highway]] system is very extensive; however, many freeways are heavily [[traffic congestion|congested]] during [[rush hour]], especially the trans-bay bridges ([[Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate]] and [[San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]). Furthermore there are some large gaps in the highways which run onto city streets in San Francisco, partially due to the [[Freeway and expressway revolts#San Francisco|Freeway Revolt]] ([[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|SF Board of Supervisors]] decisions made in 1959, 1964 and 1966), which prevented completion of freeways connecting the [[San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]] western terminus ([[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]]) with the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge, and [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] through San Francisco, and additionally due to the destruction of several of those very freeway structures that sparked the revolt, which were damaged in the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] and subsequently removed rather than being reinforced or rebuilt.

==Higher education==
The region is home to many [[colleges]] and [[seminaries]], most notably [[Stanford University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. In addition, the Bay Area is home to two of the twenty-eight [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities|Jesuit universities]] in the [[United States]], [[Santa Clara University]] (founded in [[1851]]), and [[University of San Francisco]] ([[1855]]), which also hold the distinction of being the two oldest institutions of higher learning in the state of [[California]].  [[Saint Mary's College of California]], built in 1863 is also a private college and is administered by the Christian Brothers. In 2008, there were approximately 588,000 students enrolled in college or graduate school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-context=st&-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_S1401&-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&-tree_id=3308&-redoLog=false&-_caller=geoselect&-geo_id=33000US488&-format=&-_lang=en|accessdate=October 21, 2010|title=American Community Survey: 2006-2008 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates: S1401.

Also, [[Infineon Raceway]] is a motorsport track which currently hosts [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] and [[IndyCar Series]] races.

==Music==
===Classic rock===
San Francisco proper was headquarters for the [[hippie]] counterculture of the [[1960s]] and the music scene that became associated with it. One of the area's most notable acts was [[The Grateful Dead]], formed in 1965, who played regularly at the legendary venue [[The Fillmore|''The Fillmore Auditorium'']]. Other local artists in that movement included [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Janis Joplin]]; all three would be closely associated with the [[Summer of Love|1967 Summer of Love]]. [[Jimi Hendrix]], although born in [[Seattle]] and later a resident of [[London, England]], had strong connections to the movement and the metropolitan Bay area, as he lived in Berkeley for a brief time as a child and played many local venues in that decade. [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] (of [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]]) would gain traction as an associated band of the [[Anti-war movement#The Anti-Vietnam War Movement: 1962-1975|anti-Vietnam war movement]]. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame legend [[Neil Young]] has lived in the Bay Area in [[La Honda, CA]] for more than 40 years.  [[Carlos Santana]] from [[San Francisco]] became famous in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his [[Santana band]] which pioneered a blend of rock, salsa, and jazz fusion.
The [[Doobie Brothers]], from San Jose, had a successful career with several albums earning [[RIAA]] gold certification.

===Heavy metal===
{{See also|Bay Area thrash metal}}

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Bay Area was home to one of the largest and most influential [[thrash metal]] scenes in the world, containing acts like [[Slayer]],[[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], [[Death Angel]], [[Vio-lence]], [[Megadeth]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Metallica]] (although Metallica had initially formed in [[Los Angeles]], it wasn't until their relocation to El Cerrito in 1983 that [[Cliff Burton]] and [[Kirk Hammett]] joined as bassist and lead guitarist). Many [[death metal]] bands had also formed in the area, including [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] (considered one of the first in the genre), and in the 90's, bands [[Impaled (band)|Impaled]], [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]] and [[Vile (band)|Vile]].

[[sludge metal|Sludge]] and [[groove metal]] bands [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Skinlab]] formed in Oakland. In the [[alternative metal]] and [[nu-metal]] scenes worldwide, [[Faith No More]] (from San Francisco) and [[Primus (band)|Primus]] (from El Sobrante, and featuring former Possessed guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]]) have been considered progenitors to both subgenres.<ref>Essi Berelian (2005), ''The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal'', p. 259, "Faith No More must be counted among the pioneers [of nu metal]"</ref><ref>Joel McIver (2002), ''NU-METAL- The Next Generation Of Rock & Punk ''</ref>

===Alternative rock===
Many bands of the 1990s [[post-grunge]] era started and still reside in the Bay Area, including [[Third Eye Blind]] (of San Francisco), [[Counting Crows]] (of Berkeley) and [[Smash Mouth]] (of San Jose), all of whom have received extensive [[radio]] play across the world and released multi-platinum records during their career.

===Punk===
{{See also|924 Gilman Street}}
