'''''Shinobi''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Overworks]] and published by [[Sega]] as part of the ''[[Shinobi (series)|Shinobi]]'' series. It was released on November 10, 2002 in North America; December 5 in Japan; and May 15, 2003 in Europe. The game stars the [[ninja]] [[Hotsuma]], who wields Akujiki, a sword that feeds on souls. He can also use ninja magic, [[shuriken]]s, and special moves. Upon finding a golden castle after an earthquake, Hotsuma makes it his goal to defeat the sorcerer Hiruko.

Planned for the [[Dreamcast]], ''Shinobi'' was later moved to the [[PlayStation 2]]. The game was designed to place emphasis on the [[action game|action]] elements of action-adventure gameplay and appeal to the action market. Other gameplay elements resulted from a desire to mix old and new elements. Upon release, ''Shinobi'' was well-received by critics. A [[comic book]] adaptation, [[video game soundtrack]] album, and sequel entitled ''[[Nightshade (2003 video game)|Nightshade]]'' have also been released.

==Gameplay==
[[File:ShinobiPS2Screenshot.JPG|thumb|left|Hotsuma kills an enemy in the game's urban Japanese setting. The necessity of his sword to absorb the souls of his victims creates urgency in the action gameplay.]]
''Shinobi'' is a fast-paced [[hack and slash]] game. The protagonist, [[Hotsuma]], utilizes the legendary Akujiki katana to kill hordes of enemies that usually appear in groups at a time, combined with a dash maneuver mapped by default to the X button on the [[PlayStation 2]] controller. The dash allows Hotsuma to immediately move around enemies or evade their attacks. Like the earlier games in the series, Hotsuma can also use a limited number of [[shuriken]], though his shuriken can only paralyze foes for a few seconds while inflicting little damage. For difficult battles, Hotsuma has access to three kinds of Ninjutsu magic.

Due to Akujiki's cursed state, Hotsuma must continuously kill enemies to feed the blade's thirst for souls or it will absorb his health instead. This is indicated by a red meter that fades as time passes and replenishes with each kill. To ensure that the meter remains full, players can kill four or more enemies within a brief timeframe to perform a "tate"; a set of quickly executed kills that trigger a violent cutscene and release more souls for Akujiki. In addition, killing enemies in quick succession temporarily increases Akujiki's power, as shown by the blade glowing in different colors. [[Boss (video games)|Boss]] battles generally involve using this feature, since most bosses are accompanied by groups of weaker minions that periodically respawn.

The game also incorporates platforming elements, requiring the player to stay in the air over long chasms and obstacles, using Hotsuma's air dash technique and his ability to link together mid-air kills. This, along with the cursed blade's constant need to kill, makes every level timed for the player. There are also no checkpoints during levels except at the beginning of boss battles; if the player dies at any point prior to facing the boss of that level, he/she must restart the level from the beginning. These gameplay elements were frowned upon by various gameplay reviews, although the sequel, [[Nightshade (2004 video game)|''Nightshade'']], alleviated some of its predecessor<U+2019>s difficulty.{{fact|date=April 2010}}

==Plot==
===Characters===
====Main characters====
;{{nihongo|[[Hotsuma]]|<U+79C0><U+771F>}}
:The game<U+2019>s protagonist. Hotsuma is the leader and last remaining ninja of the Oboro Clan. Wielding Akujiki, a sword cursed to take the souls of those it slays, Hotsuma ventures into the demon-infested ruins of Tokyo and makes his way to the Golden Palace.
;{{nihongo|Moritsune|<U+5B88><U+6052>}}
:Hotsuma<U+2019>s deceased older brother. He and Hotsuma were made to fight to the death to see who would be the clan leader. In the end Hotsuma won, but in doing so and with a heavy heart he killed his own brother. Moritsune is later revived by Hiruko, only to reveal himself to be nothing more than a puppet, a demon using Moritsune<U+2019>s body. After being defeated, he is stabbed by Akujiki and his soul that was residing within the cursed blade exorcises the demon in his body. He then takes Ageha<U+2019>s soul with him into Akujiki but not before telling Hotsuma to avenge the Oboro Clan.
;{{nihongo|Ageha|<U+6731><U+5203>}}
:A childhood friend of Hotsuma and Moritsune. When they were children, Moritsune saved Ageha from Akujiki's soul absorbing blade, after which Ageha developed romantic feelings for him when she grew up. After the death of Moritsune, she left the clan and broke the seal to release Hiruko, hoping that he would resurrect Moritsune. She gets in Hotsuma's way when he tries to kill Hiruko, resulting in a battle between them. She flees after being defeated, running to Hiruko to see if Moritsune has been revived. However, upon seeing Moritsune alive, she embraces him only to be stabbed and killed by him seconds later.
;{{nihongo|Kobushi|<U+62F3>}}
:An elder ninja who leads the Jonin of the Oboro Clan. He raised and trained Hotsuma, Moritsune, and Ageha when they were children.
;{{nihongo|Kagari Ubusuna|<U+7523><U+571F> <U+7BDD>|Ubuzuna Kagari}}
:A shrine maiden kidnapped by Hiruko.
;{{nihongo|Hiruko Ubusuna|<U+7523><U+571F> <U+30D2><U+30EB><U+30B3>|Ubuzuna Hiruko}}
:The game's [[antagonist]]. Hiruko is an evil sorcerer sealed away 72 years before the present events of the story. Ageha freed him so that he can bring Moritsune back from the dead. He also brought several Oboro Clan members back to life as his henchmen along with legions of hellspawn. His goal is to let Hotsuma kill all of his minions so that their souls will fuse in Akujiki and make the sword stronger, after which he can kill Hotsuma and use Akujiki to help him take over the world. After a long battle, Hiruko is killed by Hotsuma and his soul is devoured by Akujiki.

====The Oboro Clan====
;{{nihongo|The Aragane Twins|<U+92FC><U+5144><U+5F1F>}}
:Oboro Clan siblings {{nihongo|Akagane|<U+9285>}} (the female) and {{nihongo|Shirogane|<U+9280>}} (the male) form a fearsome duo. Both wield [[kusarigama]] but each uses completely different attack methods. They both ask Hotsuma to kill them, knowing that if they are left alone they will end up hurting innocent people. Despite Hiruko's control over them, they show respect to Hotsuma by calling him "Master" (''sempei''). In the end, they are both defeated by Hotsuma and are given the death they asked for. 
;{{nihongo|Hakuraku|<U+72DB><U+697D>}}
:An old man who can summon ninja dogs to fight for him. Hakuraku is not a fighter, summoning his dogs to do battle on his behalf, and if Hotsuma gets too close or if he as has been hit he will hide in the large box he carries and teleport from one part of the arena to another. He was shown to be very reluctant (or possibly fearful) when battling Hotsuma, constantly shouting, <U+201C>Stay away from me!<U+201D>, but in the end he thanks Hotsuma for killing him and allowing him to rest in peace.
;{{nihongo|Homura|<U+7114>}}
:Another member of the Oboro clan. Homura has a cocky attitude and specializes in fire attacks, as well as being able to teleport in a fiery explosion. He wields a telescope-like ''kiseru'' (Japanese smoking pipe). At the end of the fight, instead of letting Hotsuma kill him, he commits suicide by blowing himself up.
;{{nihongo|Kongou|<U+91D1><U+525B>}}
:A large and powerful member of the Oboro Clan. Kongou is a man with a love for a good fight, going as far as to consider thanking Hiruko for allowing him to have the chance to fight Hotsuma (a fight he has wanted for some time). He wields a shield that is as large as he is, which doubles as a shuriken with retractable blades. When defeated, he compliments Hotsuma on his strength, even jokingly saying that <U+201C>it must run in the family<U+201D> before succumbing to death.
;{{nihongo|Kizami|<U+523B>}}
:A mysterious swordsman of great caliber. Despite being blind, he has superb hearing which he uses to its fullest in the flooded corridor where he fights Hotsuma. He fights using the [[Iaido]] style, creating shockwaves in the water with each slash. After Hotsuma defeats him, he comments on Akujiki<U+2019>s blade and that Hotsuma might just have what is needed to kill Hiruko.

====The Hellspawns====
;{{nihongo|Shirakumo|<U+767D><U+96F2>}}
:One of the Four Hellspawn Lords. He appears to be a giant [[tarantula]] with a [[Tiger|tiger's]] head. He was the first of the Hellspawn Lords to be killed.
;{{nihongo|Benisuzume|<U+7D05><U+5929><U+86FE>}}
:One of the Four Hellspawns Lords. She appears to be a giant [[moth]] with the face of a woman. She was the second to be defeated, but instead of letting Hotsuma finish her off, she decided to blow herself up in a final attempt to kill him.
;{{nihongo|Kurakuda|<U+7384><U+4E5D><U+86C7>}}
:One of the Four Hellspawn Lords. He appears to be loosely based on the Nine-Tailed Fox from Japanese mythology, except that he has the upper body of a human, the lower body of a [[snake]] with a snake's head at the end, and carries a golden structure on his back with eight fan-like tails and a giant fox head at the top. He was the third to be killed.
;{{nihongo|Aomizuchi|<U+84BC><U+86DF><U+9F8D>}}
:A ninja who attacks Hotsuma early in the game. He has a wound on his neck that glows and causes pain when he gets near Akujiki. He flees upon defeat in his first encounter with Hotsuma. His true identity is eventually revealed to be Moritsune, Hotsuma<U+2019>s dead brother. Aomizuchi is actually the fourth and final Hellspawn Lord, a dragon-like demon with the power over lightning, using Moritsune's body as a puppet.
;{{nihongo|Yatsurao|<U+516B><U+9762><U+738B>||The King of Eight Faces}}
:A giant four armed living statue that was disabled and sealed by the Oboro 72 years before the present events of the story. Hiruko attempts sacrifices Kagari to reawaken him. Hotsuma eventually defeats Yatsurao but its soul is absorbed by Hiruko, giving him youth and even more power, which Hiruko reveals to have been his plan with it all along.

===Story===
Raised together within the Oboro Clan, Hotsuma and Moritsune were seldom apart during their youth. Being the younger of the two, Hotsuma looked up to Moritsune, and considered his older brother to be a superior warrior. 

Eventually, the Oboro Clan commandment was revealed to the two boys after they discovered Akujiki, the evil soul stealing sword that would be used in the ritual to decide the clan's leader.

The commandment deems that the next clan leader must be determined by a duel to the death between the eldest clan heirs<U+2014>in this case, Moritsune and Hotsuma. Aware of their destiny, the brothers trained incessantly, instructed by their foster parent, Kobushi.

10 years passed as the brothers refined their techniques and honed their senses. The duel occurred beneath a full moon, and after a long exhausting fight, Hotsuma finally slew his brother, though he felt a great deal of guilt from it. Four years after, a massive earthquake struck Tokyo, and a mysterious Golden Palace appeared in the center of the destroyed city.

With the appearance of the palace came the return of the powerful sorcerer Hiruko, who was thought to have been defeated and sealed by the Oboro Clan long ago. He summoned hellspawn to wreak havoc upon the city, and all but destroyed the Oboro Clan. The city's residents became paralyzed with fear. With the Oboro Clan ravaged and Tokyo on the verge of collapse, Hotsuma placed himself at the heart of the chaos, determined to reach the mysterious Golden Palace and avenge the death of his clan. Along the way, Hotsuma is also forced to battle the slain Oboro ninja who had been reanimated to serve Hiruko.

Midway into his journey, Hotsuma encounters a young shrine maiden who believes that she is intended to be sacrificed by Hiruko to release a statue called Yatsurao. She asks Hostuma to kill her, but feeling guilty over killing his brother and the similarity of the situation where the girl wants him to kill her, he is unable to do it. This leads to her capture by Hiruko's minions. Hotsuma confronts and destroys Yatsurao, but in doing so allows Hiruko to absorb its power and restore his youth, which had apparently been his plan with Yatsurao the whole time. Hiruko returns to his palace with Hotsuma continuing his pursuit.

Eventually, Hotsuma's childhood friend Ageha meets him and reveals that she released Hiruko. She also reveals that the death match between him and Moritsune was not really to decide the Oboro's leader, but to provide a soul to keep Akujiki sated. Ageha secretly worked with Hiruko to get him to resurrect Moritsune, not knowing that the revived Moritsune would become one of Hiruko's henchmen with no memory of his past. Moritsune kills Ageha, then fights Hotsuma. Hotsuma defeats him again.

After the battle, Hotsuma breaks to Hiruko's Golden Palace, where Hiruko reveals that he had all along intended for Hotsuma to kill all of the hellspawn and the undead Oboro so that their souls would fuse inside Akujiki. He could then take the sword and use it to rule the world. Hotsuma vows to kill Hiruko and destroy Akujiki, as he blames the evil sword for everything that happened. Hotsuma fights and kills Hiruko after an intense battle, absorbing the sorcerer's soul into Akujiki, and leaves the palace.

==Development==
[[Overworks]], a division of [[Sega]], had been the developer of the ''Shinobi'' series throughout its early years. Other projects had prohibited Overworks from developing ''Shinobi'' titles for the [[Sega Saturn]] or [[Dreamcast]]. However, in 2001 Overworks member Noriyoshi Ohba realized that he had time to develop a new ''Shinobi'' game, and Sega returned to publish it.<ref name="fox"/> Development of ''Shinobi'' began around May 2001, with a team of roughly 50 people. Takashi Uriu filled in as producer. The game was originally planned for the Dreamcast until the console was discontinued and Sega began creating games for other companies' consoles.<ref name="q&a">{{cite web|title=Shinobi Q&A|author=Staff|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/shinobi/news.html?sid=2883663&mode=previews|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> The [[PlayStation 2]] console was chosen over the competing [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Xbox]] because of its familiarity to the team;<ref name="e3"/> Uriu had become experienced with the console's software during his past work on the ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' series. The console's relative popularity was also a decisive factor.<ref name="fox">{{cite web|title=Interview With Shinobi Developers|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/23740/interview-with-shinobi-developers/|publisher=[[GamePro]]|last=Fox|first=Fennec|date=May 24, 2002|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref>

''Shinobi'' marked the jump of the series to [[3D computer graphics|3D]], attributed to the changing video game market. The [[2D computer graphics|2D]] gameplay of past ''Shinobi'' games had made consistent use of shuriken-based combat. However, such combat would have been difficult to master in a 3D game. Thus, an auto-targeting system was born, and the gameplay emphasis shifted to swordplay rather than shurikens.<ref name="fox"/> Due to the 3D rendering of ''Shinobi'', Overworks decided to grant Hotsuma the ability to run on walls. His usage of ninja magic was a recurring feature in the series, implemented as part of a desire to mix older and newer gameplay elements. However, his "stealth dash" move was a new addition consistent with the overall fast-paced nature of the game.<ref name="e3"/>

Although Overworks had worked mainly on [[simulation game|simulation]] and [[role-playing video games]], experience with the ''[[Streets of Rage (series)|Streets of Rage]]'' series helped with the creation of an [[action game|action]]-based game.<ref name="bigshots"/> Ohba decided to tailor the game to the needs of the relatively small action market amidst the emergence of [[stealth game|stealth]]-oriented ninja-focused games.<ref name="e3"/> Uriu was discontent with contemporary [[action-adventure game]]s' emphasis on [[adventure game|adventure]] gameplay in which "action is two and adventure is eight, as far as the ratio." He thus aimed to create an action-adventure game with a ratio of "six to four".<ref name="bigshots"/> Hotsuma's character, as well as the game's setting and plot, resulted from a desire to create a "darker hero" for the game.<ref name="e3"/> Hotsuma's "stealth dash" move hatched from Uriu's knowledge of [[real life]] ninja's ability to "divide themselves into different bodies."<ref name="bigshots">{{cite web|title=E3 2002: Shinobi Interview|author=IGN Staff|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/360/360651p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 23, 2002|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

===Sequel===
{{main|Nightshade (2003 video game)}}
''Nightshade'', a sequel to ''Shinobi'', was later developed by [[Wow Entertainment]] and again published by Sega exclusively for the PlayStation 2. The game stars female ninja Hibana, who is stylistically and kinetically analogous to Hotsuma. ''Nightshade''{{'}}s Japanese title ''Kunoichi'' refers to a female ninja, just as ''Shinobi'' refers to a male ninja. The gameplay is also structured similarly to ''Shinobi''{{'}}s. Hotsuma appears as a [[secret character]] in the game. The game was released on December 4, 2003.<ref name="nightshade">{{cite web|title=Nightshade Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/nightshade/review.html|publisher=GameSpot|date=February 10, 2004|last=Kasavin|first=Greg|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref>
