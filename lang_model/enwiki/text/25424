The '''flag of West Virginia''' is the official [[flag]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]] and was officially adopted by the [[West Virginia Legislature]] on March 7, 1929. The present flag consists of a pure white field bordered by a blue stripe with the coat of arms of West Virginia in the center, wreathed by ''[[Rhododendron maximum]]'' and topped by an unfurled red ribbon reading "State of West Virginia." 

The first flags to represent West Virginia following statehood were battle flags utilized by West Virginia regiments during the [[American Civil War]]. West Virginia's first official state flag was adopted in 1905, based upon the flag designed and used by the West Virginia State Commission at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in 1904. This flag was altered in 1907 for the [[Jamestown Exposition]] and featured the coat of arms on the obverse and a sprig of ''Rhododendron maximum'' on the reverse. In order to reproduce the flag more inexpensively, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the current flag with the state's coat of arms integrated with the rhododendron, which appears on both the obverse and the reverse. The "Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag" was unanimously adopted by the office of the [[Secretary of State of West Virginia]] in 1977.

[[File:West Virginia state coat of arms (illustrated, 1876).jpg|thumb|right|190px|An 1876 rendering of West Virginia's coat of arms, based upon the state seal.]]
Prior to the adoption of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by multiple flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical.<ref name = "WVL1"/> The first [[West Virginia Legislature]] commissioned [[Joseph H. Diss Debar]] of [[Doddridge County, West Virginia|Doddridge County]] to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863.<ref name = "WVL1"/> On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms.<ref name = "WVL1"/> Despite the adoption of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.<ref name = "WVL1"/><ref name = "Giggenbach1">{{cite newspaper| last =Giggenbach | first =Christian  | author-link =| title =State didn't have official flag until 1905 | newspaper = [[The Register-Herald]] | publication-place = [[Beckley, West Virginia]] | volume = | issue = | date = June 19, 2008 | page =  | url = http://www.register-herald.com/news/local_news/state-didn-t-have-official-flag-until/article_746c005f-07ee-58c5-af31-02a0680aa6f4.html | accessdate = January 14, 2015}}</ref>  

=== American Civil War ===
{{Details|West Virginia in the American Civil War}}
Prior to West Virginia's [[History of West Virginia#Separation|separation from Virginia]] on June 20, 1863, pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] supporters in western Virginia created unique flags to show their support for the Union cause. In January 1861, the residents of [[Kingwood, West Virginia|Kingwood]] erected a flagpole measuring about {{convert|105|ft|m}} in height and on it, they hoisted a handmade streamer with the word "UNION" prior to Virginia's secession.<ref name = "WVDCH3">{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/sesquicentennial/18610125.html |title= Timeline of West Virginia: Civil War and Statehood <U+2013> January 25, 1861  |date=2014 |website= West Virginia Division of Culture and History website |publisher= West Virginia Division of Culture and History |accessdate=January 14, 2015 }}</ref> During the war, western Virginia regiments in the [[Union Army]] carried unique flags handmade by supportive women, as was the case with the [[5th West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Fifth Regiment Virginia Volunteer Infantry]] who carried a flag bearing the legend "5th Va.

[[File:Greater coat of arms of the United States.svg|thumb|left|190px|A version of the [[Great Seal of the United States|United States national emblem]] was painted on the reverse of flags carried by West Virginia regiments during the [[American Civil War]].]]
In January 1864, the West Virginia Legislature approved a flag for the [[4th West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Fourth Regiment West Virginia Volunteer Infantry]] to acknowledge the regiment's battles at [[Battle of Charleston (1862)|Charleston]], [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[Battle of Missionary Ridge|Missionary Ridge]]; all four of which were listed on the flag.<ref name = "SGM1">{{cite newspaper| last = | first =  | author-link =| title = Mountain State Has Many More Official Symbols; Sugar Maple Trees Thrive in the High Elevations of West Virginia | newspaper = [[Charleston Gazette-Mail|Sunday Gazette-Mail]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | volume = | issue = | date = June 16, 2013 | page =  | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34787984.html | accessdate = January 14, 2015}}</ref> This was the first among many battle flags to represent West Virginia after statehood which were utilized by soldiers of West Virginia regiments throughout the war.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> State battle flags were presented to each of West Virginia's Union regiments.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> These early state flags were squares of silk cloth measuring {{convert|6|ft|m}}, and were dark blue and trimmed with golden fringe.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> The obverse side of these flags were painted with the state's newly-minted seal within an oval, along with the name of the respective West Virginia regiment and the names and dates of the battles in which they had participated.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> On the reverse side, the [[Great Seal of the United States|United States national emblem]] was painted and consisted of a [[bald eagle]] with its wings outstretched, clutching a bundle of 13 arrows in its right talon and an olive branch in its left, and a tricolor shield placed across its breast.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> In its beak, the eagle clutched a scroll with the national [[Latin]] motto ''[[E pluribus unum]]'' (English: "Out of Many, One").<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> Following the conclusion of the American Civil War, the state of West Virginia had no official flag, and the matter was not taken up until the early 20th century.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/>

=== 1905 flag ===
[[File:Flag of West Virginia (1905-1907).png|thumb|right|190px|upright|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] The obverse of the West Virginia state flag from 1905 to 1907.]]
The need for an official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis]] reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent and distinguish itself among the other [[U.S. state]]s at the exposition.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/><ref name = "NRS1">{{Harvnb|National Reporter System|1906|p=5.}}</ref><ref name = "Harris1">{{Harvnb|Harris|1922|p=60.}}</ref> In lieu of an official state flag, the commission adopted and used a state flag of its own design at the West Virginia building at the exposition, which was a "sprig of mountain laurel upon an immaculate white field with a pale blue border."<ref name = "NRS1"/><ref name = "Harris1"/> 

In its report to the West Virginia Legislature, the West Virginia State Commission recommended the adoption of their flag design as the official state flag.<ref name = "NRS1"/> On February 24, 1905, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the commission's flag design following its passage of Joint Resolution Number 16 during the gubernatorial administration of [[Albert B. White]].<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/><ref name = "NRS1"/> The legislature adopted the commission's flag design, with the addition of a fringe or border of [[Carmine (color)|carmine red]].<ref name = "NRS1"/> The state flag was approved by the legislature to be employed on occasions where a special display of the state's individuality was necessary or regarded as appropriate.<ref name = "Harris1"/> According to the 1905 joint resolution:<ref name = "NRS1"/>

{{quote|Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in the proportion of nine to thirteen, this being the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part; the field thereof shall be pure white, upon the center of which shall be a sprig of the rhododendron maximum or "big laurel," having flowers and leaves; and on the reverse side shall be the state coat-of-arms and the motto; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue, and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip of fringe of carmine red; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state's individuality shall become necessary, or be regarded as appropriate.<ref name = "NRS1"/>}}

Following its formal adoption by the legislature, schools and other institutions throughout West Virginia began flying the new state flag. The teachers and students at the schools in [[Ronceverte, West Virginia|Ronceverte]] purchased the new state flag in June 1906, which measured {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} in length, and used it along with the United States flag for salutes and patriotic exercises.<ref name = "WVDE1">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Department of Education|1906|p=34.}}</ref>

=== 1907 flag ===
[[File:Flag of West Virginia (1907-1929).png|190px|thumb|right|upright|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] The obverse of the West Virginia state flag from 1907 to 1929.]]
[[File:West Virginia Flag 1922.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The obverse of the 1907 state flag as illustrated in the ''West Virginia Legislative Hand Book and Manual and Official Register'' (1922).]]
By 1907, the West Virginia Legislature found the 1905 state flag design to be completely infeasible due to the lettering on one side reading toward the staff, and the differing colors on each respective side showing through the opposite side of the flag's white field of cloth.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/><ref name = "SGM1"/><ref name = "Hogg1">{{Harvnb|Hogg|1914|pp=5<U+2013>6.}}</ref> The state legislature found that this destroyed "the distinctive features of the banner and leaving the state without a prescribed official flag."<ref name = "Hogg1"/> The West Virginia Legislature sought to remedy the state flag's design in 1907 so that the state could be properly represented at the [[Jamestown Exposition]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/><ref name = "Hogg1"/> On February 25, 1907, during the administration of Governor [[William M. O. Dawson]], the West Virginia Legislature passed Joint Resolution 2, which amended the flag by removing the seal and motto from the reverse side and changing the color of the bordering fringe from carmine red to [[old gold]].<ref name = "Hogg1"/> Instead of the seal and motto, the reverse of the flag was changed to consist of "a spring or sprig of the rhododendron maximum."<ref name = "Hogg1"/> According to the 1907 joint resolution:<ref name = "Hogg1"/>

{{quote|Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in proportion the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part; the field thereof shall be pure white, upon the center of which on the observe side shall be the great seal or coat of arms of the state, beneath which shall appear the legend "State of West Virginia," in a scroll; on the reverse side shall appear a sprig or sprigs of the rhododendron maximum, or big laurel, our state flower, having blossoms and leaves; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue, and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip or fringe of old gold; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state's individuality shall become necessary, or be regarded as appropriate.<ref name = "Hogg1"/>}}

=== 1929 flag ===
The flag design ratified in 1907 continued as the state's official flag until 1929.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> The state of West Virginia sought a flag design that could be produced inexpensively so that the state flag could be mass produced for the state's public schools.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> The 1907 flag proved to be more costly to reproduce due to the two different symbols on each side of the banner, the state's coat of arms in the obverse and the state's flower on the reverse.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> The West Virginia Legislature decided the state flag should be stamped with a design that would integrate both the coat of arms and the state flower on both sides.<ref name = "Giggenbach1"/> The design of the present state flag was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929, by [[West Virginia Senate]] Joint Resolution Number 18.<ref name = "WVL1"/><ref name = "WVGO2">{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.wv.gov/Pages/LearnMoreaboutWestVirginia.aspx |title= Learn More about West Virginia: State Flag  |date=2015 |website= Office of the Governor website |publisher= State of West Virginia |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name = "WVL2">{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/educational/Kids_Page/symbols.cfm |title= Official State Symbols of West Virginia: State Flag  |date=2015 |website= West Virginia Legislature website |publisher= [[West Virginia Legislature]] |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> According to the joint resolution:<ref name = "WVGO2"/><ref name = "WVL2"/>

Above the coat-of-arms of the State of West Virginia there shall be a ribbon lettered, 'State of West Virginia,' and arranged appropriately around the lower part of the coat-of-arms of the State of West Virginia a wreath of Rhododendron maximum in proper colors. The field of pure white shall be bordered by a strip of blue on four sides. The flag of the State of West Virginia when used for parade purposes shall be trimmed with gold colored fringe on three sides and when used on ceremonial occasions with the United States ensign, shall be trimmed and mounted in similar fashion to the United States flag as regards fringe, cord, tassels, and mounting.<ref name = "WVGO2"/><ref name = "WVL2"/>}}

In 2001, the [[North American Vexillological Association]] surveyed its members and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, [[US Territory|U.S. territorial]], and [[Canadian province|Canadian provincial]] flags.<ref name = "NAVA1">{{cite journal |url=http://www.nava.org/sites/default/files/documents/nava-news/NAVANews_2001_vol34no2.pdf |title= New Mexico Tops State/Provincial Flags Survey; Georgia Loses By Wide Margin | date=June 10, 2001 |journal=NAVA News |publisher=[[North American Vexillological Association]] | ISSN = 1053-3338 | issue = 170 | volume = 34 | number =  | accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> Members ranked the West Virginia state flag at 51 out of the 72 flags surveyed.<ref name = "NAVA1"/> U.S. state flags with state seals on solid-color fields, like that of West Virginia's state flag, proved unpopular in the survey.<ref name = "NAVA1"/>

=== Half-mast protocol===
Effective July 18, 2013, the office of [[Governor of West Virginia|West Virginia Governor]] [[Earl Ray Tomblin]] established guidelines in accordance with the [[United States Code]] and West Virginia precedent and customs regarding the [[half-mast]] display of United States and West Virginia state flags on West Virginia state properties.<ref name = "WVGO1"/> Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be hoisted to full-mast, before being lowered to the half-mast position; likewise both flags are to be hoisted full-mast prior to being lowered for the day.<ref name = "WVGO1"/> Both flags are only to be displayed in the half-mast position in accordance with Federal law on the following occasions:<ref name = "WVGO1"/>

*[[Memorial Day]] (the last Monday in May): flags are displayed at half-mast from sunrise until noon, then raised to full-mast.
*[[Peace Officers Memorial Day]] (May 15): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day, unless that day is also [[Armed Forces Day]] (the third Saturday in May).
*[[Patriot Day]] (September 11): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
*[[National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day]] (December 7): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
*Flags are displayed at half-mast for 30 days following the day of death of either a current or former [[President of the United States]].
*Flags are displayed at half-mast for ten days following the day of death of the [[Vice President of the United States]], the Chief Justice or retired [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], or the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].
*Flags are displayed at half-mast from the day of death until the day of [[burial|interment]] of a former Vice President, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department of the United States, or a Governor of a U.S. state, territory, or possession. 
*Flags are displayed at half-mast on the day of death and the following day for a member of the [[United States Congress]].
*Flags displayed at half-mast on state properties following a proclamation by the Governor of West Virginia during other unique instances outlined in the 2013 guidelines.

=== Desecration ===
According to West Virginia state law, the desecration of either the flag of the United States or the West Virginia state flag is an offense punishable as a misdemeanor and upon conviction, a guilty verdict can result in a fine "not less than five nor more than one hundred dollars," or confinement in jail "for a period not exceeding thirty days" at "the discretion of the court or justice trying the case."<ref name = "WVC <U+00A7>61-1-8">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Legislature||loc=West Virginia Code <U+00A7>61-1-8.}}</ref> 

However, such laws are unenforceable as the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', {{ussc|491|397|1989}}, and reaffirmed in ''[[United States v. Eichman|U.S. v. Eichman]]'', {{ussc|496|310|1990}}, has ruled that due to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as "[[symbolic speech]]."

== Pledge of allegiance ==
On February 8, 1977, the office of the [[Secretary of State of West Virginia]] unanimously adopted the "Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag."<ref name = "WVDCH1">{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/pledge.html |title= Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag  |date=2014 |website= West Virginia Division of Culture and History website |publisher= West Virginia Division of Culture and History |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> The motion to adopt the pledge was moved by Charles S.
