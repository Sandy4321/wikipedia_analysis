'''Fulton John Sheen''', born '''Peter John Sheen''' (May 8, 1895 <U+2013> December 9, 1979) was an [[United States|American]] [[archbishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] known for his preaching and especially his work on television and radio. His cause for [[canonization]] for sainthood was officially opened in 2002, and so he is now referred to as a "[[Servant of God]]".

Ordained a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Diocese of Peoria]] in 1919,<ref name="cause-bio"/> Sheen quickly became a renowned theologian, earning the [[Cardinal Mercier Prize for International Philosophy]] in 1923. He went on to teach theology and philosophy as well as acting as a [[parish priest]] before being appointed [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of New York]] in 1951. He held this position until 1966 when he was made the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Bishop of Rochester]]. Sheen held this position for three years before resigning and being made the Archbishop of the [[Titular See]] of [[Newport, Wales#Religion|Newport]], [[Wales]].

For 20 years he hosted the night-time radio program ''The Catholic Hour'' (1930<U+2013>1950) before moving to television and presenting ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]'' (1951<U+2013>1957). Sheen's final presenting role was on the syndicated ''The Fulton Sheen Program'' (1961<U+2013>1968) with a format very similar to that of the earlier ''Life is Worth Living'' show. For this work, Sheen won an [[Emmy Award]] for Most Outstanding Television Personality. Starting in 2009, his shows were being re-broadcast on the [[EWTN]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]'s [[Church Channel]] cable networks.<ref name="foundation">{{cite web | url=http://www.archbishopsheencause.org/links.html | title=The Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation | accessdate=2009-09-14}}{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>{{dead link|date=May 2010}} Due to his contribution to televised preaching Sheen is often referred to as one of the first [[televangelists]].<ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1634110.html</ref><ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/448/000166947/</ref>

==Childhood==
Sheen was born in [[El Paso, Illinois]], the oldest of four sons of Newton and Delia. Though he was known as Fulton, his mother's maiden name, he was baptized as Peter John Sheen.<ref name="cause-bio">{{cite web | url = http://www.archbishopsheencause.org/fulton-sheen-biography-and-inspiration | title = Fulton Sheen Biography and Inspiration | work = Archbishop Fulton John Sheen Foundation | accessdate = 2010-05-16 }}</ref>  As an infant, Sheen contracted [[tuberculosis]].<ref> Fulton J. Sheen. ''Treasure in Clay'', Ch. 2 "The Molding of the Clay", p. 9,  1980 .</ref>  After the family moved to nearby [[Peoria, Illinois]], Sheen's first role in the Church was as an altar boy at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria|St. Mary's Cathedral]].<ref name="cause-bio"/>

==Education==
After earning high school valedictorian honors at Spalding Institute in Peoria in 1913, Sheen was educated at [[St. Viator College]] in [[Bourbonnais, Illinois]].

Sheen attended [[Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity|Saint Paul Seminary]] in [[Minnesota]] before his [[ordination]] on September 20, 1919,<ref name="cause-bio"/> then followed that with further studies at [[The Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=FJSweb>{{cite web | title=About Fulton J. Sheen | publisher=Fulton J. Sheen website | url=http://www.bishopsheen.com/store.asp?pid=13501&catid=19766 | accessdate=2007-12-20 }}</ref>  His youthful appearance was still evident on one occasion when a local priest asked Sheen to assist as altar boy during the celebration of the Mass.

Sheen earned a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Catholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]] in 1923.<ref name=FJSweb /> While there, he became the first American ever to win the [[Cardinal Mercier]] award for the best philosophical treatise.

==Career==
Sheen then taught theology at [[St. Edmund's College, Ware]] in [[England]]. In 1926, Bishop [[Edmund Michael Dunne|Edmund Dunne]] of Peoria, Illinois asked Sheen to take over St. Patrick's Parish. After eight months, Sheen returned to Catholic University in Washington, D.C., where he taught [[philosophy]] until 1950.<ref>[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/catholic_stories/cs0100.html]</ref>

He was consecrated a bishop on June 11, 1951,<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsheen.html Archbishop Fulton John Sheen [Catholic-Hierarchy&#93;]</ref> and served as an [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of the [[Archdiocese of New York]] from 1951 to 1965. The Principal Consecrator was the Discalced Carmelite Cardinal [[Adeodato Giovanni Piazza]], the [[Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina e Poggio Mirteto]] and the Secretary of the [[Sacred Consistorial Congregation]] (what is today the [[Congregation for Bishops]]); the Cardinal had previously served as the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, Italy). The Principal Co-Consecrators were [[Archbishop]] [[Leone Giovanni Battista Nigris]], the [[Titular Archbishop]] of [[Philippi]] and the Secretary of the [[Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] (what is today the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]]); and [[Archbishop]] Martin J. O'Connor, Titular Archbishop of [[Laodicea in Syria]] and President Emeritus of the [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]] (O'Connor had been Rector of the [[Pontifical North American College]]).

===Radio===
A popular instructor, Sheen wrote the first of 73 books in 1925, and in 1930 began a weekly Sunday night [[radio]] broadcast, ''The Catholic Hour''.<ref name=FJSweb />  Two decades later, the broadcast had a weekly listening audience of four million people. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' referred to him in 1946 as "the golden-voiced Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen, U.S. Catholicism's famed proselytizer" and reported that his radio broadcast received 3,000&ndash;6,000&nbsp;letters weekly from listeners.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=2007-12-16|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934406,00.html|title=Radio Religion|date=January 21, 1946|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>  During the middle of this era, he conducted the first religious service broadcast on the new medium of [[television]], putting in motion a new avenue for his religious pursuits.

===Television===
In 1951 he began a weekly television program on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, ''Life is Worth Living''.  The program consisted of Sheen simply speaking in front of a live audience, often speaking on the theology of current topics such as the evils of [[Communism]] or the usage of [[psychology]], occasionally using a chalkboard. The show, scheduled for Tuesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m., was not expected to offer much of a challenge against ratings giants [[Milton Berle]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], but surprisingly held its own, causing Berle to joke, "He uses old material, too."  In 1952, Sheen won an [[Emmy Award]] for his efforts,<ref name=Trib09>{{cite news|last=Bearden|first=Michelle|title=Mass Today Promotes Sheen For Sainthood|publisher=[[The Tampa Tribune|''Tampa Tribune'']]|date=January 24, 2009|page=10}}</ref> accepting the acknowledgment by saying, "I feel it is time I pay tribute to my four writers&mdash;Matthew, Mark, Luke and John."

One of his best-remembered presentations came in February 1953, when he forcefully denounced the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime of [[Joseph Stalin]].  Sheen gave a dramatic reading of the burial scene from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar]]'', substituting the names of Caesar, [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Brutus]] with those of prominent Soviet leaders Stalin, [[Lavrenty Beria]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], and [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]. He concluded by saying, "Stalin must one day meet his judgment." The dictator suffered a stroke a few days later and died within a week.<ref name="snopes">Mikkelson, Barbara and David P. "[http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/sheen.htm Stalin for Time: Did Bishop Fulton Sheen foretell the death of Stalin?]" [[Snopes.com]], 8 August 2007.</ref>

The show ran until 1957, drawing as many as 30&nbsp;million people on a weekly basis.  In 1958, he became national director of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Faith]], serving for eight years before being appointed Bishop of [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester, New York]], on October 26, 1966. Sheen also hosted a nationally-syndicated series, ''The Fulton Sheen Program'', from 1961 to 1968 (first in black and white and then in color). The format of this series was essentially the same as ''Life is Worth Living''.

===Evangelization===
Sheen was credited with helping convert a number of notable figures to the Catholic faith, including writer [[Heywood Broun]], politician [[Clare Boothe Luce]], American automaker [[Henry Ford II]], American writer [[Louis F. Budenz]], American theatrical designer [[Jo Mielziner]], Austrian violinist and composer [[Fritz Kreisler]], American spy [[Elizabeth Bentley]], and American actress [[Virginia Mayo]].

==Later years==
While serving in Rochester, he created the ''Sheen Ecumenical Housing Foundation'', which survives to this day. He also spent some of his energy on political activities, such as his denunciation of the [[Vietnam War]] in August 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  On October 15, 1969, one month after celebrating his 50th anniversary as a priest, Sheen resigned from his position and was then appointed [[Archbishop]] of the [[Titular See]] of Newport (Wales) by [[Pope Paul VI]].  The largely ceremonial position allowed Sheen to continue his extensive writing. Archbishop Sheen wrote 73&nbsp;books and numerous articles and columns.<ref name=Trib09 />

On October 2, 1979, two months before Sheen's death, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in [[New York City]] and embraced Sheen, saying, "You have written and spoken well of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are a loyal son of the Church."

==Death and legacy==
Sheen died of heart disease on December 9, 1979.<ref name=Trib09 /> He is buried in the crypt of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], near the deceased [[Roman Catholic Bishops and Archbishops of New York|Archbishops of New York]].  The official repository of Sheen's papers, television programs, and other materials is at [[St. Bernard's School of Theology and Ministry]] in [[Rochester, New York]].<ref>[http://www.stbernards.edu/fjsheen.htm The Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen Archives] accessed 15 August 2007</ref>

The Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation was formed in 1998 by Gregory J. Ladd and Lawrence F. Hickey to make known the life of the archbishop.  The foundation approached [[Cardinal John O'Connor]] of the [[Archdiocese of New York]] for permission to commence the process of for cause, which is now under the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Diocese of Peoria]].<ref name="foundation"/>

In 2002, Sheen's [[canonization|Cause for Canonization]] as a saint was officially opened, and so he is now referred to as a "[[Servant of God]]".

On February 2, 2008, the archives of Archbishop Sheen were sealed at a ceremony during a special [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the [[St. Mary's Cathedral (Peoria, Illinois)|Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]], where the diocese is sponsoring his canonization.<ref name=Trib09 />

In 2009, the diocesan phase of the investigation came to an end, and the records were sent to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] at the Vatican in Rome for further investigation by a panel of prelates, other members, and consultors of the congregation. They will ultimately give a report and recommendation to the Congregation's Pro-Prefect, Archbishop Angelo Amato, who will forward his recommendations with their report to Pope Benedict XVI for a final decision as to whether he has lived the theological and ecclesiastical virtues. Then, he would be called "Venerable". If an authentic miracle were then successfully attributed to him through prayer, he would be beatified and another would be needed for his canonization. The Vatican and the Sheen Foundation, as part of their investigation, would like to see and are currently arranging a coordinated world offering of Masses for his cause so as to know that enthusiasm for his cause (and thus, his example) is indeed a global, not just a Western, phenomenon.<!---needs rewording. Sounds like "fishing" for support = [[WP:SPAM]]--->

A commemorative Mass was held by Archbishop [[Timothy M. Dolan]] at St. Patrick's Cathedral{{ambiguous|date=May 2010}}<!-- Dolan's own cathedral, or the Old Cathedral, or what? --> on Wednesday, December 9, 2009, to mark the 30th anniversary of his death. Cardinals and bishops from around the world concelebrated the Mass, including Bishop Daniel R. Jenky of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Joseph Campanella]] introduces the re-runs of Sheen's various programs that are aired on EWTN. Reruns are also aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network. In addition to his television appearances, Archbishop Sheen can also be heard on [[Relevant Radio]].

Actor [[Martin Sheen]], whose birthname is Ram<U+00F3>n Gerardo Antonio Est<U+00E9>vez, adopted his [[stage name]] early in his career, in honor of Fulton J. Sheen, a popular religious figure on television during the 1950s,<ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', May 18, 2003</ref> whose radio broadcasts he admired since childhood.
