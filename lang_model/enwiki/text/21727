The '''Battle of Carillon''', also known as the '''1758 Battle of Ticonderoga''',<ref name=C57>[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 57</ref> was fought on July 8, 1758, during the [[French and Indian War]] (which was part of the global [[Seven Years War]]).  It was fought near Fort Carillon (now known as [[Fort Ticonderoga]]) on the shore of [[Lake Champlain]] in the [[frontier]] area between the British colony of [[Province of New York|New York]] and the French colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]] (roughly the present-day [[Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]).

In the battle, which took place primarily on a rise about three-quarters of a mile (one&nbsp;km) from the fort itself, a [[France|French]] army of about 4,000 men under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] and the [[Chevalier de Levis]] decisively defeated an overwhelmingly numerically superior force of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops under General [[James Abercrombie (general)|James Abercrombie]], which frontally assaulted an entrenched French position without using [[field artillery]].  The battle was the bloodiest of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered, of which over 2,000 were British.<ref name="Nester7">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 7</ref>

American historian [[Lawrence Henry Gipson]] wrote of Abercrombie's campaign that "no military campaign was ever launched on American soil that involved a greater number of errors of judgment on the part of those in positions of responsibility".<ref name="GipsonQuote">[[#Gipson|Gipson]], p. 232</ref>  Many military historians have cited the Battle of Carillon as a classic example of tactical [[military incompetence]].<ref name="Nester162_4Fault"/> Abercrombie, confident of a quick victory, ignored several viable military options, such as [[flanking maneuver|flanking]] the French [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]s, waiting for his artillery, or laying siege to the fort. Instead, relying on a flawed report from a young [[military engineer]], and ignoring some of that engineer's recommendations, he decided in favor of a direct [[frontal assault]] on the thoroughly entrenched French, without the benefit of [[artillery]].  Montcalm, while concerned about the weak military position of the fort, conducted the defense with spirit.  However, due in part to a lack of time, he committed strategic errors in preparing the area's defenses that a competent attacker could have exploited, and he made tactical errors that made the attacker's job easier.

The fort was [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|captured by the British the following year]], and it has been known as Fort Ticonderoga (after its location) ever since.  This battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability that had an effect on future military operations in the area.  Despite several large-scale military movements through the area, in both the French and Indian War and the [[American Revolutionary War]], this was the only major battle fought near the fort's location.

==Geography==
[[Image:MontresorNewYorkState1777DetailBW.jpg|thumb|rightupright|200px|Detail of a 1777 map showing the area between Crown Point and Fort Edward.  Mount Defiance is labeled "Sugar Bush".]]
[[Fort Ticonderoga|Fort Carillon]] is situated on a point of land between [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], at a natural point of conflict between French forces moving south from [[Canada, New France|Canada]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley across the lake toward the [[Hudson Valley]], and British forces moving up the Hudson from [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The fort was sited with Lake Champlain to the east, with [[Mount Independence]] rising on the far side.  Immediately to the south of the fort lay the [[La Chute River]], which drains Lake George.  The river was largely non-navigable, and there was a [[portage]] trail from the northern end of Lake George to the location of a sawmill the French had built to assist in the fort's construction.  The trail crossed the La Chute twice; once about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Lake George, and again at the sawmill, which was about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the fort.

To the north of the fort was a road going to [[Fort St. Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric]].  To the west was a low rise of land, beyond which lay Mount Hope, a rise that commanded part of the portage trail, but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger.<ref name="Lonergan26">[[#Lonergan|Lonergan (1959)]], p. 26</ref>  The most serious geographic defect in the fort's location was [[Mount Defiance]] (known at the time of this battle as Rattlesnake Hill, and in the 1770s as Sugar Bush), which lay to the south of the fort, across the La Chute River.  This {{convert|900|foot|m}} hill, which was steep and densely forested, provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort.<ref name="AmericanMade134">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 134</ref>  Nicolas Sarrebource de Pontleroy, Montcalm's chief engineer, said of the fort's site, "Were I to be entrusted with the siege of it, I should require only six mortars and two cannon."<ref name="AmericanMade135">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 135</ref>

==Background==
{{main|French and Indian War|Seven Years' War}}
Prior to 1758, the [[French and Indian War]] had gone very poorly for the British, whose military met few of its objectives.  Following a [[French and Indian War#French victories, 1756<U+2013>1757|string of French victories in 1757 in North America]], coupled with military setbacks in Europe, [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] gained full control of the direction of British military efforts in the [[Seven Years' War]].  Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe, where France was strong, and offense in North America, where France was weak, he resolved to attack [[New France]] (the colonial holdings of France in North America) in three strategic campaigns.<ref name="AC213_32">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], pp. 213,232</ref>  Large-scale campaigns were planned to capture [[Fort Duquesne]] on the [[Pennsylvania]] frontier and the fortress at [[Louisbourg]] (on <U+00CE>le-Royale, now known as [[Cape Breton Island]]). The third campaign, assigned to General [[James Abercrombie (British Army general)|James Abercrombie]], was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley.<ref name="Nester59">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 59</ref>  Pitt probably would have preferred to have [[George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe|George Howe]], a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader, lead this expedition, but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead.  Howe was appointed a [[brigadier general]], and placed as Abercrombie's second in command.<ref name="Nester60_5">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 60,65</ref>

He appears to be in his forties, and is wearing mid-eighteenth century styles, including a powdered wig.]]
The French, who had started construction on Fort Carillon in 1755,<ref name="Lonergan22">[[#Lonergan|Lonergan (1959)]], p. 22</ref> used it as a launching point for the successful [[siege of Fort William Henry]] in 1757.<ref name="AndersonMade109_15">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], pp. 109<U+2013>115</ref>  Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758.  As early as March, [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]], the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the [[Pierre Fran<U+00E7>ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|Marquis de Vaudreuil]], [[New France]]'s governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King [[Louis XV of France]].<ref name="Nester92">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 92</ref>  The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which was dominated by Britain's [[Royal Navy]].<ref name="Nester68">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 68</ref>  This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.<ref name="Nester58">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 58</ref>

Montcalm and Vaudreuil, who did not get along with each other, differed on how to deal with the British threat.  They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and a limited number of Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000.<ref name="Nester68"/>  Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and [[Louisbourg]], and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the [[Mohawk River]] on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York.  Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack.<ref name="Nester89_90">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>  Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left [[Quebec City|Quebec]] for Carillon.<ref name="Nester95_6">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref>

==British preparations==
The British amassed their army, under the command of General [[James Abercrombie (British Army general)|James Abercrombie]], near the remains of [[Fort William Henry]], which lay at the southern end of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] but had been destroyed following its [[Siege of Fort William Henry|capture by the French]] the previous year. The army numbered fully 16,000 men, making it the largest single force ever deployed in [[North America]] at the time.<ref name="AndersonMade133">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 133</ref> Its complement of 6,000 regular troops included Lord John Murray's Highlanders of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Highland Regiment]] (1st Battalion) the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th]], [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th]], [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th]], and [[55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot|55th]] regiments, and the 1st and 4th battalions of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th]], while the provinces providing militia support included [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]].<ref name="Parkman93">[[#Parkman|Parkman (1884)]], p. 93</ref>  On July 5, 1758, these troops embarked on boats, which unloaded them at the north end of Lake George on July 6.<ref name="AndersonMade133_4"/>

==French defensive preparations==
Colonel Fran<U+00E7>ois-Charles de Bourlamaque, in command of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British offensive was about to begin.  He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; the fact that the British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp.  Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.<ref name="Nester106_7">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref>

[[Image:Ticonderoga1.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Ticonderoga, as seen from [[Lake Champlain]]]]
Montcalm arrived at Fort Carillon on June 30, and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison, with only 3,500 men, and food sufficient for only nine days.<ref name="Nester107"/>  Bourlamaque's scouts reported that the British had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of [[Fort William Henry]].  Given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort's site, Montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort.<ref name="N114">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 114</ref>  He immediately detached Bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) from the northern end of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], about {{convert|6|mi|km}} from the fort.  Montcalm himself took two battalions and occupied and fortified an advance camp at the sawmill, while remaining troops were put to work preparing additional defenses outside the fort.<ref name="KingsfordIV162">[[#Kingsford|Kingsford (1890)]], p. 162</ref>  He also sent word back to Montreal of the situation, requesting that, if possible, the [[Chevalier de L<U+00E9>vis]] and his men, be sent as reinforcement; these were troops that Vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts.<ref name="Parkman88">[[#Parkman|Parkman (1884)]], p. 88</ref><ref name="Nester107">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 107</ref>  L<U+00E9>vis had not yet left Montreal, so Vaudreuil instead ordered him and 400 troops to Carillon.  They departed Montreal on July 2.<ref name="Nester108">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 108</ref>

When word reached Bourlamaque on July 5 that the British fleet was coming, he sent Captain Tr<U+00E9>pezet and about 350&nbsp;men to observe the fleet, and, if possible, to prevent their landing.  On learning the size of the British fleet, which was reportedly "large enough to cover the face of [Lake George]",<ref name="AndersonMade133_4">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 133<U+2013>134</ref>  Montcalm ordered Bourlamaque to retreat.  Bourlamaque, who was satisfied with his defensive situation, resisted, not withdrawing until Montcalm repeated the orders three times.<ref name="N123">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 123</ref>  Montcalm, now aware of the scope of the movement, ordered all of the troops back to Carillon, and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed.<ref name="KingsfordIV163">[[#Kingsford|Kingsford (1890)]], p. 163</ref>  These withdrawals isolated Tr<U+00E9>pezet and his men from the main body,<ref name="KingsfordIV164"/> a situation made worse for Tr<U+00E9>pezet when his Indian guides, alarmed by the size of the British fleet, abandoned him.<ref name="Chartrand51">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 51</ref>

Beginning on the evening of July 6, the French began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort, about {{convert|0.75|mi|km}} away, that commanded the land routes to the fort.<ref name="AndersonMade135">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 135</ref>  On July 7, they constructed a lengthy series of [[abatis]] (felled trees with sharpened branches pointed outward) below these entrenchments.  By the end of that day, they had also constructed a wooden [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]] above the trenches.  These hastily-erected defenses, while proof against small arms fire, would have been ineffective if the British had used [[cannon]]s against them.<ref name="AndersonMade135"/>

<!-- [[Battle of Bernetz Brook]] redirects to this section -->

==Bernetz Brook==
[[Image:CarrillonAbercrombieRoute1758.png|right|upright|thumb|300px|Map showing the intended route the British troops took toward the fort in their first attempt]]
The British army began an unopposed landing at the north end of Lake George on the morning of July 6.  Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it recently deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure.  The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed.  However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.<ref name="KingsfordIV164">[[#Kingsford|Kingsford (1890)]], p. 164</ref>

Near the area where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Tr<U+00E9>pezet and his troop, who were attempting to return to the French lines, encountered [[Phineas Lyman]]'s Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods.  General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it in that direction.  As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear.  In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trep<U+00E9>zet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured.  Fifty men, including Trep<U+00E9>zet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute.  Trep<U+00E9>zet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.<ref name="Chartrand41">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 41</ref>

British casualties were light, only ten dead and six wounded.<ref name="Nester131">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 131</ref>  The British, frustrated by the difficult woods, demoralized by Howe's death, and exhausted from the overnight boat ride, camped in the woods, and returned to the landing point early the next morning.<ref name="KingsfordIV168">[[#Kingsford|Kingsford (1890)]], p. 168</ref>

==Portage road==
On July 7 Abercrombie sent Lieutenant Colonel [[John Bradstreet]] and a sizable force down the portage path.  On reaching the first crossing, where Bourlamaque had camped, they rebuilt the bridge there, and proceeded on to the sawmill crossing.  The army then followed, and set up its camp there.  Scouts and prisoners reported to Abercrombie that Montcalm had 6,000 men and was expecting the Chevalier de L<U+00E9>vis to arrive at any moment with 3,000 reinforcements.<ref name="KingsfordIV168"/>  Abercrombie ordered his engineer, Lieutenant Matthew Clerk, and one of his aides, Captain [[James Abercrombie (British Army colonel)|James Abercrombie]] (it is uncertain if the Abercrombies were related or not) to reconnoiter the French defenses.  After ascending Rattlesnake Hill (as Mount Defiance was then known), they reported that the French position appeared to be incomplete, and could be "easily forced, even without cannon".<ref name="Nester138">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 138</ref>  They were unaware that the French had disguised much of the works with shrubs and trees, and that they were in fact largely complete.<ref name="Chartrand58">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 58</ref> Clerk's report included recommendations to fortify both the summit and the base of Rattlesnake Hill.<ref name="Nester143"/>  Abercrombie decided that they had to attack the next morning, hopefully before L<U+00E9>vis and his supposed 3,000 arrived.<ref name="KingsfordIV168"/>  L<U+00E9>vis arrived at the fort on the evening of July 7 with his troop of 400 regulars.<ref name="Parkman103">[[#Parkman|Parkman (1884)]], p. 103</ref>
[[Image:TiconderogaJeffreys1758.jpg|left|thumb|120px|A 1758 map depicting the battle lines]]

Abercrombie held a war council that evening. The options he presented to his staff were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three.<ref name="AndersonCrucible243">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], p. 243</ref>  Abercrombie's plan of attack omitted Clerk's recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; in addition to the frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 [[bateaux]] of troops to support the effort.<ref name="Nester142">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 142</ref>

Early on the morning of July 8, Clerk went out once again to the base of Rattlesnake Hill to observe the French defenses; his report indicated that he still felt the French lines could be taken by assault.<ref name="Nester143">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 143</ref>

The battle began on the morning of July 8 with [[Rogers' Rangers]] and light infantry from Colonel [[Thomas Gage]]'s [[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]] pushing the few remaining French scouts behind the entrenchments.<ref name="AndersonCrucible243"/>  They were followed by provincials from New York and Massachusetts, and then three columns of regulars, who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack.  The 27th and 60th made up the right column, under the command of the 27th's Lt. Col. William Haviland, the 44th and 55th under Lt. Col. John Donaldson made the center, and the 42nd and 46th under the 42nd's Lt. Col. Francis Grant formed the left column.  Each column was preceded by the regimental [[light infantry]] companies.  Held in reserve were provincial regiments from Connecticut and New Jersey.<ref name="Nester148">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 148</ref><ref name="Chartrand61_2">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>

Montcalm had organized the French forces into three brigades and a reserve.  He commanded the Royal Roussillon and Berry battalions in the center of the entrenchments, while L<U+00E9>vis commanded the Bearn, Guyenne, and La Reine battalions on the right, and Bourlamaque led the La Sarre and Languedoc battalions on the left.  Each battalion was given roughly 100 yards (91m) of the entrenchment to defend.  Redoubts with cannon protected the flanks of the entrenchments, although the one on the right had not been completed.  The low ground between the left flank and the La Chute River was guarded by militia and marines, who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position.  Reserve forces were either in the fort itself, or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on Mount Hope.  Portions of each battalion were also held in reserve, to assist in areas where they might be needed.<ref name="Nester139_40">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 139<U+2013>140</ref>

==Battle==
[[Image:Portrait of Montcalm.JPG|left|thumb|General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]]|alt=A half-length portrait of a man dressed mainly in black, but also wearing a metal breastplate, against a dark brown background.  He is wearing a powdered wig.]]
While Abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm, by 12:30 elements of the New York regiments on the left began engaging the French defenders.<ref name="Chartrand64">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 64</ref>  The sounds of battle led Haviland to believe that the French line might have been penetrated, so he ordered his men forward, even though not all of the regulars were in place, and Abercrombie had not given an order to advance.<ref name="Chartrand65_8">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 65,68</ref>  The result, rather than an orderly, coordinated advance on the French position, was a piecemeal entry of the regulars into the battle.  As companies of the regulars came forward, they arranged themselves into lines as instructed, and then began to advance.  The right column, with a shorter distance to travel, attacked first, followed by the center, and then the left. The 42nd had initially been held in reserve, but after insisting on being allowed to participate, they joined the action.<ref name="Nester151_3">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 151<U+2013>153</ref>

The French position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with ''[[abattoir]]'', or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field.  By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed.<ref name="Chartrand70_1">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 70<U+2013>71</ref>  Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met.<ref name="Chartrand72">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 72</ref>  Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like [[Francis Parkman]] and [[Thomas Mante]] to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action),<ref name="Parkman106">[[#Parkman|Parkman (1884)]], p. 106</ref><ref name="Mante159">[[#Mante|Mante (2005)]], p. 159</ref> was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle,<ref name="Nester156">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 156</ref> and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle.<ref name="Chartrand68">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 68</ref>  It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks.  Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.<ref name="Nester152">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 152</ref>

Around 2 pm, the British barges carrying artillery floated down the La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between an island in the La Chute and the shore. This brought them within range of the French left and some of the fort's guns.  Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.<ref name="Chartrand71_2">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref>

Abercrombie ordered his reserves, the Connecticut and New Jersey provincials, into the battle around 2, but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed.  Abercrombie then tried to recall the troops, but a significant number, notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the British left, persisted in the attack.  Around 5 pm the 42nd made a desperate advance that actually succeeded in reaching the base of the French wall; those that actually managed to scale the breastwork were [[bayonet]]ed.<ref name="Chartrand76_0">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 76<U+2013>80</ref>  One British observer noted that "Our Forces Fell Exceeding Fast", while another wrote that they were "Cut Down Like Grass".<ref name="AndersonC244">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], p. 244</ref>  The slaughter went on until nightfall, with a great many men retreating behind a breastwork that had been erected at the back of the battlefield.<ref name="AndersonC246">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], p. 246</ref>

Finally realizing the scope of the disaster, Abercrombie ordered the troops to muster and march down to the landing on Lake George.  The retreat in the dark woods became somewhat panicked and disorganized, as rumors of French attacks swirled among the troops.  By dawn the next morning, the army was rowing back up Lake George, reaching its base at the southern end around sunset.<ref name="AndersonC246"/>  The humiliating nature of the retreat was immediately apparent to some of its participants; Lieutenant Colonel [[Artemas Ward]] wrote that they "shamefully retreated".<ref name="AndersonC247">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], p. 247</ref>

==Aftermath==
Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines.  The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack.<ref name="Nester157">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 157</ref>

News of the battle was received in England shortly after news of the fall of Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory.  The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France.<ref name="AndersonC298">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], p. 298</ref>  Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759;<ref name="N206">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 206</ref> as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from [[Fort Oswego]], Quebec, and Carillon, which was [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759]] by forces under the command of [[Jeffrey Amherst]], the victor at Louisbourg.<ref name="AndersonC312ff">See e.g. [[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], pp. 312ff, for details on the remainder of the war.</ref>

Abercrombie never led another military campaign.<ref name="Nester206"/>  Although he was active at Lake George, he did little more than provide support for John Bradstreet's [[Battle of Fort Frontenac|successful attack on Fort Frontenac]], which was authorized in a war council on July 13. Bradstreet left with 3,000 men on July 23, and Abercrombie then refused to engage in further offensive acts, alleging a shortage of manpower.<ref name="Nester168">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 168</ref>  [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], the British [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] who had designed the British military strategy and received word of the defeat in August, wrote to Abercrombie on September 18 that the "King has judged proper that you should return to England."<ref name="Nester204">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 204</ref>  Abercrombie continued to be promoted, eventually reaching the rank of full General in 1772.<ref name="Nester206">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 206</ref>

The fact that Indians allied to the British witnessed the debacle first hand complicated future relations with them.  News of the defeat circulated widely in their communities, which had a significant effect on the ability of British agents to recruit Indians to their side for future operations.<ref name="Nester147">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 147</ref>

==Casualties==
The battle was the bloodiest of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered.<ref name="Nester7">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 7</ref> French casualties are normally considered to be comparatively light: 104 killed and 273 wounded in the main battle.  Combined with the decimation of Tr<U+00E9>pezet's force on July 6, there were about 550 casualties, about 13 percent of the French force, a percentage similar to the losses of the British (who Chartrand calculates as having lost 11.5 to 15 percent).<ref name="Chartrand88">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 88</ref>

General Abercrombie reported 547 killed, 1356 wounded, and 77 missing.  L<U+00E9>vis in one report claimed that the French recovered 800 British bodies, implying that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll.  Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded.  The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded, and the loss of General Howe.<ref name="Chartrand86">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 86</ref>

The 42nd Regiment, known as the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]], paid dearly with the loss of many lives and many severely wounded.  More than 300 men (including 8 officers) were killed, and a similar number were wounded, representing a significant fraction of the total casualties suffered by the British.<ref name="Stewart315_6">[[#Stewart|Stewart (1825)]], pp. 315<U+2013>316</ref>  [[George III of England|King George III]], later in July 1758, designated the 42nd a "Royal" regiment, due to its gallantry in earlier battles, and issued letters of service for adding a second battalion "as a testimony of his Majesty's satisfaction and approbation of the extraordinary courage, loyalty, and exemplary conduct of the Highland regiment."<ref name="Stewart317_8">[[#Stewart|Stewart (1825)]], pp. 317<U+2013>318</ref>  However, the king did not learn of the regiment's decimation in this battle until August.<ref name="Nester46">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 46</ref>

A legend has long circulated concerning the death of the Black Watch's Major [[Duncan Campbell (British Army officer)|Duncan Campbell]]. In 1742, the ghost of Campbell's dead brother is said to have appeared to him in a dream with a promise to meet him again at "Ticonderoga", a place name that was unknown to him at the time.  Campbell died of wounds sustained during the battle.<ref name="Lonergan47_53">[[#Lonergan|Lonergan (1959)]], pp. 47<U+2013>53</ref>

==Analysis==
The actions of both commanders have been extensively analyzed in this action.  While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some strategic options escaped his notice, and some of his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question.  In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned.  It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.<ref name="Anderson173Fault">[[#AndersonMade|Anderson (2005)]], p. 172, calls Abercrombie "the least competent officer ever to serve as British commander in chief in America"</ref><ref name="Nester162_4Fault">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 162<U+2013>164 lists a variety of historically critical sources, and also rebuts a number of attempted defenses of Abercrombie.</ref>

===Montcalm===
Both commanders were a product of the environment of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare.  Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like [[Rogers' Rangers]], but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment.<ref name="Nester147"/><!--Abercrombie--><ref name="Chartrand20">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], p. 20</ref><!--Montcalm-->  Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.<ref name="Nester159">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 159</ref><!--few indians--><ref name="Chartrand25_50">[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2000)]], pp. 25,50</ref><!--Montcalm dislike-->

Montcalm in particular would have benefited from practicing a more irregular form of warfare.  He apparently never inspected the landing area at the north end of Lake George, which was a location from which he could contest the British landing.  Furthermore, the French could then have used the confined woodlands to blunt the numerical advantage of the British, and contested the entire portage road.  The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking.  Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations.<ref name="Nester117_8">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 117<U+2013>118</ref>
<!--TODO Montcalm not fortifying Defiance-->

===Abercrombie===
[[#Holden|James Holden]], writing in 1911, noted that American and British writers, both contemporary and historical, used words like "imbecile", "coward", "unready", and "old woman" to describe Abercrombie.<ref name="Holden69">[[#Holden|Holden (1911)]], p. 69</ref>

====Before the battle====
Criticisms of Abercrombie's strategy begin with his reliance on relatively poor intelligence.  Reports reached him that the French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected.  Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry.  Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm.  The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.<ref name="Nester146">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 146</ref>

He is wearing a red military jacket with a gold tassel on the right shoulder.  His body is facing three-quarters right, but he is looking straight ahead.]]
Abercrombie's next strategic error was an apparent over-reliance on the analysis of William Clerk.  His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defenses to be repeatedly misread.<ref name="Nester145">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 145</ref>  What is clear is that Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, did not want to act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice.  Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame.<ref name="Nester144">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], p. 144</ref>  Captain [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] of the [[44th Foot]] wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French in a very short time from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells."<ref name="AndersonC247_8">[[#AndersonCrucible|Anderson (2000)]], pp. 247<U+2013>248</ref>

The strategic decision not to bring cannons forward was probably one of Abercrombie's most significant errors.  The use of cannon against the French works would have cleared paths through the abatis and breached the breastworks.<ref name="Nester152"/>

Abercrombie also had the option to avoid a [[pitched battle]], instead beginning [[siege]] operations against the French position.  His force was large enough that he could have fully [[investment (military)|invested]] the French position and fended off any arriving reinforcements.<ref name="Nester152"/>

====Tactics====
Abercrombie made two notable errors of judgment during the battle.  One was a failure to recognize after the first wave of attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work.  Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions.  The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to [[enfilade]] the British attackers.<ref name="Nester152_3">[[#Nester|Nester (2008)]], pp. 152<U+2013>153</ref>

====After the battle====
[[Image:Flag of Carillon.svg|thumb|100px|The ''Carillon Flag'', proposed as the flag of Quebec in 1902<ref name="FraserFlag"/>|alt=A rectangular flag with a blue background divided into quadrants by thick white lines.  Each quadrant has a small gold fleur-de-lis near the outer corner with the top pointed in toward the center.]]

The disorganized nature of the British retreat demonstrated a loss of effective command.  An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French.  Abercrombie, to the surprise of some in his army, ordered a retreat all the way back to the south end of Lake George.  Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.<ref name="Nester157"/>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Flag of Quebec.svg|thumb|100px|The current [[Flag of Quebec]]|alt=A rectangular flag with a blue background divided into quadrants by thick white lines.  Each quadrant has a small white upright fleur-de-lis located in the center of the quadrant.]]
While the fort itself was never endangered by the British assault, Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability.   Even though the fort was effectively [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|handed to the British by a retreating French army in 1759]], future defenders of the fort and their superior officers, who may not have been familiar with the site's shortcomings, fell under the spell of this idea.  In 1777, when General [[John Burgoyne]] advanced down Lake Champlain at the beginning of the [[Saratoga campaign]], General [[George Washington]], who had never seen the fort, thought highly of its defensive value.<ref name="Furneaux51">[[#Furneaux|Furneaux (1971)]], p. 51</ref>  [[Anthony Wayne]], who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne's arrival, wrote to Washington that the fort "can never be carried, without much loss of blood".<ref name="Furneaux58">[[#Furneaux|Furneaux (1971)]], p. 58</ref>  Fort Ticonderoga was [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1777)|surrendered by the Americans without a fight]] in July 1777.<ref name="Furneaux65_74">[[#Furneaux|Furneaux (1971)]], pp. 65<U+2013>74</ref>

The modern [[Flag of Quebec]] is based upon a banner supposedly carried by the victorious French forces at Carillon.<ref name="QuebecEmblems">[[#QuebecEmblems|Emblems of Quebec]]</ref> However, the story appears to be a 19th-century fabrication, as there is no evidence that the large religious banner (2 by 3 meters, or 6 by 10 feet) on which the flag design was based was actually used as a [[ensign|standard]] at the battle.<ref name="FraserFlag">[[#FraserFlag|Fraser (1998)]]</ref>
