'''Interstate 787''' (abbreviated '''I-787''') is an [[auxiliary Interstate Highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. I-787 is the main highway for those traveling into and out of downtown [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. As I-87 does not have a direct exit in the city of Albany, I-787 serves as the most direct route between Albany and points south on I-87. The southern terminus is at the [[Interstate 87]]/[[New York State Thruway]] exit 23 [[toll plaza]] southwest of downtown [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The northern terminus of the route is unclear, with some sources placing the terminus at 8th Street in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], creating an overlap with [[New York State Route 7]] between [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]] and Troy. Other documents show I-787 as terminating at its interchange with NY 7 and [[New York State Route 787|NY 787]] in Green Island. Regardless, the route is {{convert|10.16|mi|km|2}} long if extended to Troy, or {{convert|9.55|mi|km|2}} excluding the NY 7 overlap. Any concurrency that exists between NY 7 and I-787 is unsigned.

North of NY 7, the right-of-way of I-787 continues north as [[New York State Route 787|NY 787]] to the city of [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]].

==Route description==
I-787 officially begins at the [[toll barrier]] for I-87/Thruway exit 23;<ref name="dot" /> however, a short {{convert|0.57|mi|km|2|sing=on}} spur between [[U.S. Route 9W]] and the interchange connecting I-787 to the Thruway, designated as '''New York State Route 912S''', an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], is signed as I-787.<ref name="dot2">{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/tvr908fthru953b.pdf|title=Traffic Data Report - NY 908F to NY 953B|format=PDF|publisher=[[NYSDOT]]|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref><ref name="ne" /> At the east end of the interchange (exit 1) with I-87, I-787 northbound merges with NY 912S, progressing due east for a short distance before curving to the northeast ahead of the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] mainline near exit 2 ([[New York State Route 32|NY 32]]). Past NY 32, I-787 parallels the [[Hudson River]] as it heads northward into the heart of downtown Albany, featuring a pair of exits with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]] and [[U.S. Route 20]] at a massive interchange southeast of the [[Empire State Plaza]] on the west bank of the Hudson.

[[Image:Dunn Memorial Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|300px|I-787 exits 3 and 4 (at left) and the Dunn Memorial Bridge in Albany.]]
North of downtown Albany, I-787 interchanges with [[Interstate 90 (New York)|Interstate 90]] at exit 5 prior to crossing into [[Menands, New York|Menands]] and meeting NY 32 once more at exit 6 by way of a [[trumpet interchange]]. The ramp from the trumpet to NY 32, a {{convert|0.28|mi|km|2|sing=on}} long roadway, is designated as '''New York State Route 913T'''.<ref name="dot2" /> Farther north in Menands, I-787 intersects [[New York State Route 378|NY 378]] (exit 7) by way of a near-[[cloverleaf interchange]]. In [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]], I-787 has one interchange with 23rd Street (exit 8) before reaching another near-cloverleaf interchange with NY 7 and NY 787 (exit 9) in Green Island. From this point, I-787's alignment becomes uncertain.

===Northern terminus===
The northern terminus of I-787 is unclear. Appendix E of the 2006 [[NYSDOT]] Traffic Data Report places the terminus at 8th Street in Troy, creating an [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 7]] across the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Collar City Bridge]].<ref name="dot">{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/tvr427thru908f.pdf|title=Traffic Data Report - NY 427 to NY 908F|format=PDF|publisher=[[NYSDOT]]|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Other sources, including the [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]] [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] map of Albany and the official description of signed routes in New York State, identifies the terminus as the NY 7/[[New York State Route 787|NY 787]] interchange in Green Island.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep10/nhs/maps/ny/albany_ny.pdf|title=National Highway System - Albany, NY|year=2003|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]]|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="dotdes">{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/tour_route_0.pdf|title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Bicycle Routes in New York State|publisher=[[NYSDOT]]|accessdate=2007-08-22|month=October | year=2004|format=PDF}}</ref> Contemporary maps of the Albany area also lack I-787 shields on the Collar City Bridge, signing the roadway only as NY 7.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|title=The Road Atlas 2007|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]|scale=13/16" = 3 miles|page=69|section=SH5|isbn=0-528-95824-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[American Map]]|title=New York|year=2007|cartography=[[American Map]]|scale=1" = 3 miles|section=V9|isbn=0-8416-5418-2}}</ref> In reality, there is generally no signage on NY 7 that would indicate a concurrency between NY 7 and I-787; however, two old I-787 shields do exist along NY 7. The first is located on a ramp onto the [[Collar City Bridge]] east of the [[Hudson River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/mp/787_007.htm|title=New York Routes - I-787/NY 7 overlap|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> The second is on the westbound side of the bridge.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

According to the NYSDOT traffic counts, I-787 is {{convert|10.16|mi|km|2}} long; by limiting I-787 to the section between the Thruway and NY 7, the length is reduced to {{convert|9.55|mi|km|2}}.<ref name="dot" />

==History==
In 1965, what became I-787 was under construction near its southern terminus and marked as proposed along the remainder of its future alignment. The Collar City Bridge was included as part of the proposed route.<ref name="1965map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|title=New York|year=1965|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref> By 1971, the expressway, signed as I-787, was complete and open to traffic between I-87 and Vine Street (near modern exit 2) as well as between I-90 and NY 378. The missing segments from 1965, with the exception of the Collar City Bridge, remained shown as proposed.<ref name="1971map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Humble Oil & Refining Company]]|title=New York|year=1971|cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> By 1973, all of I-787 had been completed north to 23rd Street.<ref name="1973map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Standard Oil]]|title=Northeastern United States With Interstate Strip Maps|year=1973|edition=1973-74|cartography=[[Universal Printing Company]]}}</ref> Within three years time, the remainder of modern I-787 and the southern extent of NY 787, including all the ramps for modern exit 9, was completed. However, at the time, the NY 7 interchange did not connect to any roads on either end.<ref>[http://terraserver.microsoft.com/ImageInfo.aspx?T=2&S=12&Z=18&X=758&Y=5916 USGS Topographic Map - Watervliet, New York]. Drawn 1971; revised 1978 using data from 1976. Accessed on [[2007-08-22]].</ref>

In 1981, the Collar City Bridge, stretching from exit 9 east across the Hudson to Troy, was built.<ref name="NBI">[[National Bridge Inventory]], a database compiled by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] [[Federal Highway Administration]], available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed [[2007-08-22]].</ref> By 1985, the right-of-way of I-787 (now NY 787) was extended north from Green Island to the intersection of NY 32 and Tibbits Avenue near the Watervliet city line. The NY 7 freeway west of Green Island, marked as NY 7 Alternate, was under construction.<ref name="1985map">{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |title=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-528-91040-X}}</ref> In 1986, NY 7 "Alternate" opened, becoming part of a realigned NY 7.<ref name="NBI" /> With the opening of the freeway, the layout of exit 9, as well as the remainder of modern I-787, was complete.
