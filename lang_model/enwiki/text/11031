American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has created a large amount of controversy with [[The MDNA Tour]]. It is her ninth [[concert tour]] which supports her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' (2012). The tour has generated many newspaper headlines and news coverage for its use of fake firearms during performances, Madonna's nudity on stage, and her promotion of [[LGBT]] rights, [[freedom of speech]] and political issues. Madonna was threatened with a lawsuit in [[France]] for using an image of [[French people|French]] [[far-right]] politician [[Marine Le Pen]] with a [[swastika]] on her forehead during a video interlude and also in [[Russia]] for her promotion of the rights of the LGBT community by giving free pink wristbands to people attending her concert.

During the song "[[Nobody Knows Me]]" in her concert in [[Tel Aviv]] on May 31, 2012, during a morphing collage the face of [[French people|French]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]] politician [[Marine Le Pen]] appeared on the screen with a [[swastika]] superimposed on her forehead.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/madonna/9310578/Marine-Le-Pen-threatens-to-sue-Madonna.html |title=Marine Le Pen threatens to sue Madonna|author= Samuel, Henry|date=4 June 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343078357MASAKZHJFS |archivedate=23 July 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

At the performance in Nice, France at the Stade Charles-Ehrmann, many of Le Pen's supporters had covered up The MDNA Tour announcement posters with Le Pen's campaign posters. It was even speculated that French far right was to attend the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madonnaunderground.nl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2797%3Afront-national-aanwezig-bij-mdna-in-nice&catid=22%3Aalgemeen&lang=en |title=Front National attending MDNA in Nice? |publisher=Madonnaunderground.nl |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref> However, Madonna removed the swastika from the video of "Nobody Knows Me" and replaced it with a question mark. A local party supporter Gael Nofri welcomed the change stating: "As far as I know, Madonna has never changed a video clip. This is proof that our arguments were valid. This is excellent news." Nevertheless, after that performance, Madonna has used the original video clip. Madonna later defended her use of the swastika image, stating she did it to raise awareness of intolerance towards religious minorities and immigrants (the National Front is [[Opposition to immigration|against immigration]].)

Madonna has been a strong supporter of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. She created controversy at her performance in Washington D.C. when she urged fans to vote for President Obama and claimed that he is a "Black Muslim" which was largely seen as offensive since President Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past.  Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said <U+201C>Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim <U+2014> though I know that plenty of people in this country think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don<U+2019>t care what religion Obama is <U+2014> nor should anyone else in America.<U+201D><ref name="The Huffington Post">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/madonna-obama-black-muslim_n_1912400.html | title= Madonna: Obama Is 'A Black Muslim In The White House,' Deserves Votes (VIDEO) [UPDATE] |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref>  Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience.  However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience.  Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, "I don't care who you vote for.  Do not take this great privilege for granted." <ref>{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-madonna-obama-boos-concert-new-orleans,0,2837761.story|title=Madonna booed (and cheered) after Obama endorsement in New Orleans|publisher=Los Angeles Times Entertainment|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>

In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to [[Malala Yousafzai]], a 14 year old Pakistani girl who was shot by the [[Taliban]] for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog ... who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her ... Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" Madonna went on to shout, "Support education! Support the people who support women!"  Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bertram|first=Colin|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/celebrity/Madonna-Offers-Onstage-Support-to-Malala-the-Pakistani-Teen-Shot-by-the-Taliban-173940881.html|title=Madonna Dedicates Song to "Malala," the Pakistani Teen Shot by Taliban Gunmen|publisher=NBC Chicago|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref>

Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in [[Colorado]]. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, with the use of the props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local MP".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |title=Pop superstar Madonna ignores gun ban as she plays Scots gig |author=Lyons, Beverly|date=22 July 2012 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079499GTIVONUSYZ |archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. Activist group, Mothers Against Guns, released a statement stating Madonna "should know better". They further stated the use of the props are in bad taste, even more so after the Colorado shootings. The singer's camp responded saying, "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She<U+2019>s not about to start listening to them now".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment |title=Madonna & Guns: Singer Brandishes Fake Pistols & Machine Guns Despite Warnings, Recent Events (PHOTOS) |author=Makarechi, Kia |date=23 July 2012 |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079799NJKZPFOOWU|archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

Following her concert in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], many fans felt the pop star was being "insensitive" to the community with the use of firearms in the first act. Many concert-goers tweeted the act was "too dark" and "[[Satanism|satanic]]", causing them to leave the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kdvr.com/2012/10/19/twitter-madonna-over-2-hours-late-to-denver-show-fakes-shooting-audience/ |title=Madonna over 2 hours late to Denver show, pretends to shoot audience |publisher=KDVR |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> To comment on the story, Liz Rosenberg released the following statement: <blockquote>"It's like taking out the third act of Hamlet.

Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna "as a positive role model for older women." While some initially claimed Madonna as "clingy" and "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that<U+2019>s only natural <U+2014> Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, it was an incredible feeling." She goes on to say about Madonna, "She looks incredible now <U+2014> better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, "If she is a good mother that<U+2019>s all that matters." Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna "will not change" despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it<U+2019>s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it<U+2019>s only a nipple for goodness sake".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|title=Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53 |author=Williams, Stewart |date=11 June 2012 |work=The Sun |publisher=News International |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343081055QQXYPSKVBO|archivedate=23 July 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

==L'Olympia show==
Madonna's second show in Paris at [[L'Olympia]] was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, with most of the criticism centering on the fact that the concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the others full stage MDNA Tour shows and fans had not been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a "tremendous effort".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2012/07/28/madonna-booed-after-45-minute-paris-concert |title=Madonna booed after 45-minute Paris concert |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> According to TMZ, the riot at Madonna concert in Paris had nothing to do with her brief performance but with around 10 "fans" in the audience who overheard yelling about Marine Le Pen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.tmz.com/article_head.ftl?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2012%2F07%2F29%2Fmadonna-france-concert-riot%2F |title=TMZ |publisher=M.tmz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref> However, several French news outlets reported that the backlash against Madonna's performance was started by a considerable number of fans rather than an isolated group of Marine Le Pen supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/actu-people/madonna-conspuee-sur-le-web-apres-son-concert-a-l-olympia-27-07-2012-2104458.php|title=Madonna conspu<U+00E9>e sur le Web apr<U+00E8>s son concert <U+00E0> L'Olympia|author= |date=27 July 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |publisher=LES |accessdate=27July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI |archivedate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2012/07/27/03006-20120727ARTFIG00530-madonna-sur-twitter-la-reine-est-morte.php|title=Madonna sur Twitter: "La Reine est Morte |author= |date=27 July 2012 |work=[[Le Figaro]] |publisher=LES |accessdate=27 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI |archivedate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Musique/News/Madonna-huee-par-ses-fans-apres-son-concert-a-l-Olympia-2130804 |title=Madonna hu<U+00E9>e par ses fans apr<U+00E8>s son concert <U+00E0> L'Olympia |publisher=elle.com |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>

Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band [[Pussy Riot]], Madonna responded: "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and [[freedom of speech]] so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially.

I've seen people being locked up and put in jail for speaking their minds, for being gay, for not practicing the right religion, for not dressing the proper way. Yeah, it's scary. But what it made me realize is how lucky I am to be living here in America. It doesn't mean that this is the perfect country. We have a long way to go." <ref name="The Huffington Post"/>

[[File:MDNAMasterpiece.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna's performance of "[[Masterpiece (Madonna song)|Masterpiece]]" was normally preceded by a speech.]]Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the [[LGBT community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madonna.com/news/title/support-the-gay-lesbian-community-at-madonnas-st-petersburg-show |title=> News > Support the LGBT Community At Madonna's St. Petersburg Show |publisher=Madonna.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref> In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped in the middle of the show to speak on the issues at hand: "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." She continued, noting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their "love and support of the gay community." She concluded, "for people quoting the [[Bible]], and using [[God]] as a defense mechanism: [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Buddha]], and [[Moses]] preached this<U+2014>it's in every Holy book<U+2014>'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnEUMA-nPd4 |title=Madonna's Full St. Petersburg Speech |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-08-11 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Edward |first=Brett |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/08/10/madonna-transforms-st-petersburg-concert-unofficial-gay-pride |title=Madonna Transforms St Petersburg Concert into Unofficial Gay Pride Rally |work=The Advocate |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

Though her speech was met with much praise from the media, on August 17, it was announced that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting "homosexual propaganda" which was against the law, and allegedly "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" at the concert.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/17/madonna-sued-gay-rights-russia?newsfeed=true |title=Madonna sued over gay rights stance by Russian campaigners |work=Guardian |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref> According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna<U+2019>s concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders<U+2014>for me it causes moral suffering."<ref>{{cite news|first=Liza |last=Dobkina |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/08/17/anti-gay-activists-sue-madonna-over-hurt-feelings |title=Anti-gay activists sue Madonna over hurt feelings |work=Toronto Sun |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref>
