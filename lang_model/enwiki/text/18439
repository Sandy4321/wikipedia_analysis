According to fossil evidence, the primitive ancestors of primates may have existed in the late [[Cretaceous]] period around 65&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|mya]] (million years ago), and the oldest known primate is the Late Paleocene ''[[Plesiadapis]]'', ''c.'' 55<U+2013>58&nbsp;mya. [[Molecular clock]] studies suggest that the primate branch may be even older, originating in the mid-Cretaceous period around 85&nbsp;mya.

The Primates order has traditionally been divided into two main groupings: [[prosimian]]s and [[simian]]s.  Prosimians have characteristics most like those of the earliest primates, and included the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]], [[Lorisiformes|lorisiforms]], [[Aye-aye]] and [[tarsier]]s.  Simians included the monkeys and apes.  More recently, [[Taxonomy|taxonomists]] have created the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]], or "wet-nosed" primates, to include non-tarsier prosimians and the suborder [[Haplorrhini]], or "dry-nosed" primates, to include tarsiers and the simians.  Simians are divided into two groups: the platyrrhines ("flat nosed") or [[New World monkey]]s of South and Central America and the [[Catarrhini|catarrhine]] ("narrow nosed") monkeys of Africa and southeastern Asia.  The New World monkeys include the [[Capuchin monkey|capuchin]], [[howler monkey|howler]] and [[squirrel monkey]]s, and the catarrhines include the [[Old World monkey]]s (such as [[baboon]]s and [[macaque]]s) and the [[ape]]s. Humans are the only catarrhines that have spread outside of Africa and southeastern Asia, although fossil evidence shows many species once existed in Europe as well.

Considered [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] mammals, primates exhibit a wide range of characteristics. Some primates (including humans and baboons) do not live primarily in trees, but all species possess adaptations for climbing trees.  Locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree, walking on two or four limbs, knuckle-walking, and swinging between branches of trees (known as [[brachiation]]). Primates are characterized by their large brains, relative to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic]] vision at the expense of smell, the dominant sensory system in most mammals.  These features are most significant in monkeys and apes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. [[Trichromacy|Three-color vision]] has developed in some primates. Most also have [[thumb|opposable thumb]]s and some have [[Prehensility|prehensile]] tails.  Many species are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], which means males and females have different physical traits, including body mass, canine tooth size, and coloration.  Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, and reach maturity later but have longer lifespans. Some species live in solitude, others live in male<U+2013>female pairs, and others live in groups of up to hundreds of members.

The Primates [[order (biology)|order]] are a part of the clade [[Eutheria]] which is nested within the [[Euarchontoglires]] clade of the class [[Mammal]]ia. Recent molecular genetic research on primates, [[colugo]]s, and [[treeshrew]]s has shown that the two species of colugos are more closely related to the primates than the treeshrews,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Molecular and Genomic Data Identify the Closest Living Relative of Primates|journal=Science|year=2007|author=Jane<U+010D>ka, J.

This clade combines with the [[Glires]] clade (composed of the [[Rodent]]ia and [[Lagomorpha]]) to form the Euarchontoglires clade. Variously, both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders. Also, some scientists consider Dermoptera a suborder of Primates and call the "true" primates the suborder Euprimates.<ref>{{cite book | author = McKenna, M. C. and Bell, S.

In modern [[Cladistics|cladistic]] reckonings, the Primates order is [[Clade|monophyletic]].

Until recently the Aye-aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini.<ref name="MSW3" /> Theories had been proposed that its family, [[Daubentoniidae]], was either a lemuriform primate (meaning its ancestors split from lemur line more recently than the lemurs and lorises split) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines. In 2008, the Aye-aye family (Daubentoniidae) was confirmed to be a lemuriform and descended from the same ancestral lemur population that rafted to the island, it is contained within the Chiromyiformes infraorder, forming a sister clade to the lemurs.<ref name="genome" />

The suborder [[Haplorrhini]], the "dry-nosed" primates, is composed of two sister clades.<ref name="MSW3" /> The [[prosimian]] tarsiers in family [[Tarsier|Tarsiidae]] (monotypic in its own infraorder [[Tarsier|Tarsiiformes]]), represent the most primitive division at about 58 mya.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Evolutionary Biology of Tarsiers|author=Shekelle, M.|year=2005|url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/bejc/|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Rapid electrostatic evolution at the binding site for cytochrome c on cytochrome c oxidase in anthropoid primates|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1088365|author=Schmidt, T.

Like the lemurs, the New World monkeys have unclear origins.

Although primates are well studied in comparison to other animal groups, several new species have  [[Primates discovered in the 2000s|been recently discovered]]; genetic tests on some populations have revealed previously unrecognised species.

Notable new species not listed in MSW3 include the [[Bemaraha Woolly Lemur]] (''Avahi cleesei'', named after [[United Kingdom|British]] [[actor]] and [[lemur]] enthusiast [[John Cleese]]) and the [[GoldenPalace.com Monkey]] (whose name was put up for auction).

Primate [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] usually arise in captivity,<ref name="songs">{{cite journal |title=Songs of hybrid gibbons (''Hylobates lar'' <U+00D7> ''H. muelleri'') |author=Tenaza, R. |year=1984 |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=249<U+2013>253 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350080307}}</ref> but there have also been examples in the wild.<ref name="natoccur">{{ cite journal |year=1966 |title=Naturally occurring primate hybrid |author=Bernsteil, I.

==Distinguishing features==
Primates have diversified in [[arboreal]] habitats (trees and bushes) and retain many characteristics that are adaptations to this environment.<ref name="pough" /> They are distinguished by:
* retention of the [[clavicle|collar bone]] in the [[pectoral girdle]];<ref name="pough" /> 
* [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]]s which allow high degrees of movement in all directions;<ref name="pough" /> 
* five digits on the fore and hind limbs with [[Thumb|opposable]] thumbs and big toes;<ref name="pough" /> 
* nails on the fingers and toes (in most species);<ref name="NailsAndClaws">{{cite journal | author = Soligo, C., M<U+00FC>ller, A.E. | year = 1999 | title = Nails and claws in primate evolution | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 36 | pages = 97&ndash;114 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.1998.0263}}</ref>

* a trend towards a reduced snout and flattened face, attributed to a reliance on vision at the expense of [[olfaction]] (most notably in haplorrhines, and less so in strepsirrhines);<ref name="EncycMammals" />
* a complex visual system with [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]], high [[visual acuity]] and [[color vision]];<ref name="pough" />

Not all primates exhibit these anatomical traits, nor is every trait unique to primates.  For example, other mammals have collar bones, three kinds of teeth and a pendulous penis, while [[spider monkey]]s have greatly reduced thumbs, [[ruffed lemur]]s have six mammary glands and strepsirrhines generally have longer snouts and a strong sense of smell.  Primates are generalist mammals.<ref name="EncycMammals" />

In regard to behavior, primates are frequently highly [[Social behavior|social]], with flexible dominance hierarchies.<ref name="palaeos">{{cite web |author=White, T. & Kazlev, A. |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/480Archonta/480.400.html#Primates | title=Archonta: Primates |publisher=[[Palaeos]]| accessdate=2008-06-03 | date=2006-01-08}}</ref> New World species form [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[pair bond]]s, and show substantial [[Father|paternal care]] of their young, unlike most Old World monkeys.<ref name="vertlife" />

==Anatomy, physiology and morphology==
Primates have forward-facing eyes on the front of the skull; [[binocular vision]] allows accurate distance perception, useful for the [[Brachiation|brachiating]] ancestors of humans.<ref name="pough" /> There is a [[supraorbital ridge|bony ridge]] above the eye sockets; this ridge reinforces weaker bones in the face which are put under strain during chewing. [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirrhine]]s have a [[postorbital bar]], a bone which runs around the eye socket, to protect their eyes; in contrast, the higher primates, [[Haplorrhini|haplorrhine]]s, have evolved fully enclosed sockets.<ref name="Campbell">{{cite book | author = Campbell, B.

[[Image:Primate skull series with legend.png|thumb|Primate skull size and weight comparison]]
The primate skull has a large domed [[Skull|cranium]] which is particularly prominent in [[anthropoid]]s. The cranium protects the large brain, a distinguishing characteristic of this group.<ref name="pough" /> The endocranial volume (the volume within the skull) is three times greater in humans than in the greatest non-human primate, reflecting a larger brain size.<ref name="aiello" /> The mean endocranial volume is 1201 [[cubic centimetre|cubic centimeters]] in humans, 469&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in gorillas, 400&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in chimpanzees and 397&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in orangutans.<ref name="aiello">{{cite book | author= Aiello, L. & Dean, C. | year=1990 | title=An Introduction to Human Evolutionary Anatomy | publisher=Academic Press | pages=193 | isbn=0120455900}}</ref> The primary evolutionary trend of primates has been the elaboration of the brain, in particular the [[neocortex]] (a part of the [[cerebral cortex]]), which is involved with [[sense|sensory perception]], generation of [[motor cortex|motor commands]], spatial reasoning, [[consciousness|conscious thought]] and, in humans, [[language]].<ref name="britannica" /> While other mammals rely heavily on their [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], the arboreal life of primates has led to a [[Somatosensory system|tactile]], [[Visual perception|visually]] dominant sensory system,<ref name="britannica" /> a reduction in the olfactory region of the brain and increasingly complex social behavior.<ref name="adw">{{cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Primates.html | title="Primates" (On-line) |publisher=Animal Diversity Web | author=Myers, P. | year=1999 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref>

[[Image:PrimateFeet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 1893 drawing of the hands and feet of primates]]
Primates generally have five digits on each limb ([[Dactyly#pentadactyly|pentadactyly]]), with keratin nails on the end of each finger. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have [[tactile pad|sensitive pads]] on the [[distal phalanges|fingertips]]. Most have [[thumb|opposable thumbs]], a characteristic primate feature; however, opposing thumbs are not limited to this order ([[opossum]]s, for example, also have them).<ref name="pough" /> Thumbs allow some species to use [[Tool use by animals|tools]].  In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relic of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop [[brachiation]] (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of transportation. Prosimians have clawlike nails on the second toe of each foot, called [[toilet-claw]]s, which they use for grooming.<ref name="pough" />

The primate [[clavicle|collar bone]] is retained as prominent element of the [[pectoral girdle]]; this allows the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] broad mobility.<ref name="palaeos" /> Apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the [[scapula]], broad ribcages that are flatter front-to-back, and a shorter, less mobile spine compared to Old World monkeys (with lower [[vertebra]]e greatly reduced, resulting in tail loss in some species). Old World monkeys are unlike apes in that most have tails.  The only primate family with [[prehensile tail]]s are the New World [[Atelidae|Atelids]], including the [[howler monkey|howler]], [[spider monkey|spider]] and [[woolly monkey]]s.

Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced [[snout]].<ref name="palaeos" /> Technically, Old World monkeys are distinguished from New World monkeys by the structure of the nose, and from apes by the [[dentition|arrangement of their teeth]].<ref name="adw" /> In New World monkeys the nostrils face sideways; in Old World monkeys, they face downwards.<ref name="adw" /> There is a considerably varied dental pattern in primates and although some have lost most of their [[incisor]]s, all retain at least one lower incisor.<ref name="adw" /> In most strepsirhines, the lower incisors and canines form a [[toothcomb]], which is used in grooming and sometimes foraging,<ref name="adw" /><ref name="EncycMammals" /> and the first lower premolar is shaped like a canine.<ref name="EncycMammals" /> Old World monkeys have eight [[premolar]]s, compared with twelve in New World monkeys.<ref name="adw" /> The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending on the number of [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s on their [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s; apes have five, Old World monkeys have four,<ref name="adw" /> although humans may have 4 or 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wheeler's Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion |author=Ash, M. M., Nelson, S. J. & Wheeler, R. C. |publisher=W.B. Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=9780721693828 |pages=12}}</ref> The main hominid molar cusp ([[hypocone]]) evolved in early primate history, while the cusp of the corresponding primitive lower molar ([[paraconid]]) was lost. Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips, the moist tip of their nose and forward-facing lower front teeth.

The [[evolution of color vision in primates]] is unique among most [[eutheria]]n [[mammal]]s. While the remote [[vertebrate]] ancestors of the primates possessed [[trichromacy|three color vision]] (trichromaticism), the [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], [[warm-blooded]], mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the [[retina]] during the [[Mesozoic]] period. Fish, reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic or [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromatic]] while all mammals, with the exception of some primates and [[marsupial]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Arrese, C. A., ''et al.'' | year=2005 | title=Cone topography and spectral sensitivity in two potentially trichromatic marsupials, the quokka (''Setonix brachyurus'') and quenda (''Isoodon obesulus'') | journal=Proceedings of Biological Science | volume=272 | issue=1565 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3009 | pages=791<U+2013>796}}</ref> are dichromats or [[Monochromacy|monochromats]] (totally color blind).<ref name="EncycMammals" /> Nocturnal primates, such as the [[night monkey]]s and [[Galago|bush babies]], are often monochromatic.

===Sexual dimorphism===
{{main|Sexual dimorphism in non-human primates}}
[[Image:Hamadryas Baboon.jpg|thumb|right|Distinct sexual size dimorphism can be seen between the male [[Hamadryas Baboon]]s (grey) and the female (brown).]]
[[Sexual dimorphism]], the variation between individuals of different sex in the same species, is often exhibited in [[simian]]s, though to a greater degree in Old World species (apes and some monkeys) than New World species. Recent studies involve [[Comparative analysis|comparing DNA]] to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism.

===Locomotion===
[[Image:Diademed ready to push off.jpg|thumb|[[Diademed Sifaka]], a vertical clinger and leaper, ready to leap to another tree]]
Primate species move by [[brachiation]], [[bipedalism]], [[Jumping|leaping]], arboreal and terrestrial [[quadruped]]alism, [[climbing]], [[knuckle-walking]] or by a combination of these methods. Several prosimians are primarily vertical clinger and leapers.  These include many [[Galago|bushbabies]], all [[Indriidae|indriids]] (i.e., [[sifaka]]s, [[avahi (genus)|avahi]]s and [[indri]]s), [[sportive lemur]]s, and all [[tarsier]]s.<ref name="Sussman1999">{{cite book|title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 1: Lorises, Lemurs and Tarsiers|author=Sussman, R.

Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds, while some are leapers. Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers. [[Gibbon]]s, [[muriqui]]s and [[spider monkey]]s all use brachiation extensively.<ref name="Strier2007" />  [[Woolly monkey]]s also sometimes brachiate.<ref name="Sussman2003" /> [[Orangutan]]s use a similar form of locomotion called quadramanous climbing, in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through the trees.<ref name="Strier2007" /> [[Chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s knuckle walk,<ref name="Strier2007" /> and can move bipedally for short distances. Although numerous species, such as the [[Australopithecine]]s and [[Homo (genus)|early hominids]], have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion, humans are the only extant species with this trait.

==Behavior==
===Social systems===
[[Richard Wrangham]] stated that [[Social structure|social systems]] of non-human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wrangham, R. W. |authorlink=Richard Wrangham |chapter=Mutualism, kinship and social evolution |year=1982 |title=Current Problems in Sociobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=269<U+2013>289 |isbn=0521242037}}</ref> He proposed four categories: 
*Female transfer systems <U+2013> females move away from the group in which they were born. Females of a group will not be closely related whereas males will have remained with their natal groups, and this close association may be influential in social behavior. The groups formed are generally quite small. This organization can be seen in chimpanzees, where the males, who are typically related, will cooperate in defense of the group's territory. Among New World Monkeys, [[spider monkey]]s and [[muriqui]]s use this system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Fiore, A. D. & Campbell, C. J.|chapter=The Atelines|year=2007|pages=175|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Campbell, C. J., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K. C., Panger, M. & Bearder, S. K.|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref>
[[Image:Jigokudani hotspring in Nagano Japan 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Japanese Macaque]]s bathe together in Jigokudani Hot Spring]]
*Male transfer systems <U+2013> while the females remain in their natal groups, the males will emigrate as adolescents. [[Polygyny|Polygynous]] and multi-male societies are classed in this category. Group sizes are usually larger. This system is common among the [[Ring-tailed Lemur]], [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[Cercopithecinae|cercopithecine monkeys]].<ref name="Strier2007" />
*Monogamous species <U+2013> a male<U+2013>female bond, sometimes accompanied by a juvenile offspring. There is shared responsibility of parental care and territorial defense. The offspring leaves the parents' territory during adolescence. [[Gibbon]]s essentially use this system, although "monogamy" in this context does not necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Bartlett, T. Q.|chapter=The Hylobatidae|year=2007|editor=Campbell, C. J., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K. C., Panger, M. & Bearder, S. K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4|pages=283}}</ref>
*Solitary species <U+2013> often males who defend territories that include the home ranges of several females.  This type of organization is found in the prosimians. [[Orangutan]]s do not defend their territory but effectively have this organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Knott, C. D. & Kahlenberg, S.

K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4|pages=294}}</ref>

Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with [[howler monkey]]s both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related.<ref name="Sussman2003" /> Some prosimians, [[Colobinae|colobine]] monkeys and [[Callitrichinae|callitrichid]] monkeys use this system.<ref name="Strier2007" />

===Interspecific associations===
Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild. Some of these associations have been extensively studied.  In the [[Ta<U+00EF> National Park|Tai Forest]] of Africa, several species coordinate anti-predator behavior. These include the [[Diana Monkey]], [[Campbell's Mona Monkey]], [[Lesser Spot-nosed Monkey]], [[Western Red Colobus]], [[King Colobus]] and [[Sooty Mangabey]], which coordinate anti-predator alarm calls.<ref name="tai">{{cite book|title=Monkeys of Tai Forest, An African Primate Community|chapter=Interactions between African Crowned Eagles and Their Prey Community|author=Shultz, S. & Thomsett, S.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=181}}</ref> Among the predators of these monkeys is the [[Common Chimpanzee]].<ref name="tai2">{{cite book|title=Monkeys of Tai Forest, An African Primate Community|chapter=Interactions between Red Colobus Monkeys and Chimpanzees|author=Bshary, R.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=155<U+2013>170}}</ref>

===Life history===
Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals.<ref name="Strier2007" /> All non-human primate infants are [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] by their mothers and rely on them for grooming and transportation.<ref name="Strier2007" /> In some species, infants are protected and transported by males in the group, particularly males who may be their fathers.<ref name="Strier2007" /> Other relatives of the infant, such as siblings and aunts, may participate in its care as well.<ref name="Strier2007" /> Most primate mothers cease ovulation while breastfeeding an infant; once the infant is [[Weaning|wean]]ed the mother can reproduce again.<ref name="Strier2007" /> This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt to continue breastfeeding.<ref name="Strier2007" />

Primates have a longer [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size.<ref name="Strier2007" /> During the juvenile period, primates are more susceptible than adults to [[predation]] and [[starvation]]; they gain experience in feeding and avoiding predators during this time <ref name="Strier2007" /> They learn social and fighting skills, often through playing.<ref name="Strier2007" />  

Primates, especially females, have longer lifespans than other similarly sized mammals.<ref name="Strier2007" />

===Diet and feeding===
[[Image:Colubusmonkey.JPG|thumb|Leaf eating [[Mantled Guereza]], a species of [[black-and-white colobus]]]]
Primates exploit a variety of food sources. Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s for energy.<ref name="Strier2007" /> However, they require other foods, such as leaves or insects, for [[amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and [[mineral]]s. Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods, such as fruit, leaves, gum or [[insect]]s.<ref name="Strier2007" /> For example, leaf eaters such as [[howler monkey]]s, [[black-and-white colobus]]es and [[sportive lemur]]s have extended digestive tracts to enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult to digest.<ref name="Strier2007" /> [[Marmoset]]s, which are gum eaters, have strong [[incisor]] teeth, enabling them to open tree bark to get to the gum, and claws rather than nails, enabling them to cling to trees while feeding.<ref name="Strier2007" /> The [[Aye-aye]] combines rodent-like teeth with a long, thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker. It taps on trees to find insect larvae, then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvae out.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milliken, G. W., Ward, J.

For example, the [[Grey-cheeked Mangabey]] has thick [[tooth enamel|enamel]] on its teeth, enabling it to open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys cannot.<ref name="Strier2007" />

==Habitat and distribution==
[[Image:Macaque India 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rhesus Macaque]] at [[Agra Fort]], India]]
Primates evolved from [[arboreal]] animals, and many species live most of their lives in trees.  Most primate species live in [[tropical rain forest]]s.  The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively [[correlation|correlated]] to the amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Geographic and climatic control of primate diversity|author=Reed, K. & Fleagle, J.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=92|issue=17|pages=7874<U+2013>7876|date=August 15. 1995|year=1995|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/92/17/7874.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.17.7874}}</ref>  Accounting for 25% to 40% of the [[frugivore|fruit-eating animals]] (by [[biomass|weight]]) within tropical rainforests, primates play an important [[Ecology|ecological]] role by dispersing seeds of many tree species.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Chapman, C. & Russo, S.|chapter=Primate Seed Dispersal|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Campbell, C.

Some species are partially [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], such as [[baboon]]s and [[Patas Monkey]]s, and a few species are fully terrestrial, such as [[Gelada]]s and [[Human]]s. Non-human primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats in the tropical latitudes of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and South America, including [[rainforest]]s, [[mangrove]] forests, and [[montane]] forests. There are some examples of non-human primates that live outside of the tropics; the mountain-dwelling [[Japanese Macaque]] lives in the north of [[Honsh<U+016B>|Honshu]] where there is snow-cover eight months of the year; the [[Barbary Macaque]] lives in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Algeria and Morocco. Primate habitats span a range of altitudes: the [[Black Snub-nosed Monkey]] has been found living in the [[Hengduan Mountains]] at altitudes of 4,700&nbsp;meters (15,400&nbsp;ft),<ref name="Long94">{{cite journal | author = Long, Y.

==Interactions with humans==
Despite the close evolutionary relationship, non-human primates (NHPs) are rarely granted the same legal rights as humans. There are difficult moral and legal questions pertaining to the use of primates in research, entertainment and conservation.

The close evolutionary relationship and interactions between humans and NHPs create pathways for the transmission of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]]. Viruses such as ''[[Herpesviridae]]'' (most notably [[Herpes B Virus]]), ''[[Poxviridae]]'', [[measles]], [[ebola]], [[rabies]], the [[Marburg virus]] and [[viral hepatitis]] can be transmitted to humans; in some cases the viruses produce potentially fatal diseases in both humans and non-human primates.<ref name="Renquist1987">{{cite journal | author=Renquist, D.

Within the order Primates, only humans are recognized as [[person]]s and protected in law by the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].{{ref label|article6|b|b}}  The legal status of non-human primates (NHPs), on the other hand, is the subject of much debate, with organizations such as the [[Great Ape Project]] (GAP) campaigning to award at least some of them legal rights.<ref name="GA">{{cite web |author=Cavalieri, P. & Singer, P. |url=http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.php |title=Declaration on Great Apes |publisher=[[Great Ape Project]] |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> In June 2008, Spain became the first country in the world to recognize the rights of some NHPs when its parliament's cross-party environmental committee urged the country to comply with GAP's recommendations, which are that the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture be extended to chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas.<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Glendinning, L. |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/26/humanrights.animalwelfare?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront |title=Spanish parliament approves 'human rights' for apes |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Singer, P. |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/18/animalwelfare.animalbehaviour |title=Of great apes and men |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref>

[[Image:Shanghai-monkey.jpg|left|thumb|160px|A man [[begging|panhandling]] for money while displaying an exotic primate to tourists]]
Many species of NHP are kept as pets by humans.

[[Image:Cebus albifrons edit2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Capuchin monkeys]]' manual dexterity is one reason they can assist [[quadriplegic]] humans.]]
NHPs are kept in [[zoo]]s around the globe.  Historically, zoos were primarily a form of entertainment, but more recently have shifted their focus to conservation, education and research.  Many zoos now feature naturalistic exhibits and educational material for the public; in the United States many participate in the [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP), developed by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA), to maximize [[genetic diversity]] through captive breeding.  Zoos and other [[animal welfare]] supporters generally oppose animal rights initiatives and the GAP's insistence that all NHPs be released from captivity for two primary reasons. First, captive-born primates lack the knowledge and experience to survive in the wild if released.  Second, zoos provide living space for primates and other animals threatened with extinction in the wild.
