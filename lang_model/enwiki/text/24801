==Playing career==
Bobrovsky was never drafted into the NHL. [[Philadelphia Flyers]] General Manager [[Paul Holmgren]] has said that the Flyers considered drafting him during the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]], but ultimately decided not to given the difficulty of signing Russian players at the time.<ref name="BobsStory">{{cite news | url = http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=542686 | title = The Story of Bob | publisher = "PhiladelphiaFlyers.com" | author = Joe Siville | date = 2010-11-05 | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref> After playing his first four professional seasons with [[Metallurg Novokuznetsk]] in Russia, Bobrovsky signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Flyers on May 6, 2010.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=528306 | title = Flyers Sign Three Prospects | publisher = ''Philadelphia Flyers'' | date = 2010-05-06 | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}</ref> He was initially slated to begin his North American career with the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Adirondack Phantoms]],<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=534396 | title = Flyers confident they have a future starting goalie | author = Adam Kimelman | publisher = ''[[NHL.com]]'' | date = 2010-07-14 | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref> but after impressing coaches during training camp, Bobrovsky replaced the injured starter [[Michael Leighton]] on the roster.<ref name="NamedStarter">{{cite news | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=539892 | title = Russian rookie Bobrovsky gets nod in Flyers' net | author = Mike G. Morreale | publisher = ''[[NHL.com]]'' | date = 2010-10-07 | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref> Even after Leighton recovered, Bobrovsky continued to share duties with [[Brian Boucher]].

Flyers head coach [[Peter Laviolette]] named Bobrovsky the starting goaltender for the opening game of the [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season|2010<U+2013>11]] season against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] on October 7, 2010.<ref name="NamedStarter"/> In his NHL debut, Bobrovsky picked up a 3<U+2013>2 win and was named the game's first star in the first regular season game at [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Consol Energy Center]].<ref name="FirstGame">{{cite news | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2010020002 | title = Flyers spoil Pens' debut in new home with 3-2 win | publisher = ''[[NHL.com]]'' | date = 2010-10-07 | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref> At 22 years and 17 days, he became the youngest goaltender to win a season-opening game for the Flyers, eclipsing [[Ron Hextall]], who started at 22 years and 159 days on October 9, [[1986<U+2013>87 NHL season|1986]].<ref name="FirstGame"/> He was also the first Flyers rookie goaltender to win his NHL debut since [[Antero Niittym<U+00E4>ki]] in [[2003<U+2013>04 NHL season|2004]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://eaglesphans.com/community/index.php?/topic/137584-bobrovskys-play-needs-no-translation-as-flyers-beat-penguins-todays-paper-nwes-8-oct-10/ | title = Bobrovsky's play needs no translation as Flyers beat Penguins (Todays paper nwes, 8 Oct 10) - PhilaPhans | publisher = "PhilaPhans" | date = 2010-10-08 | accessdate = 2010-10-11}}</ref> Bobrovsky enjoyed a successful rookie season in posting a 28-13-8 record along with a .915 save percentage. However, after a disappointing showing during the [[2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoffs]] in which he was often benched in favor of backup [[Brian Boucher]], the Flyers signed [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] to a nine-year contract to be the new starter.

After a year backing up Bryzgalov, on June 22, 2012 Bobrovsky was traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for Columbus' second-round and a fourth-round picks in the [[2012 NHL Entry Draft]] and [[Phoenix Coyotes|Phoenix]]'s fourth-round pick in the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2012-06-22/sergei-bobrovsky-trade/55761958/1|title=Blue Jackets acquire goalie Bobrovsky|publisher=''[[USAToday]]''|author=Mike Brehm|date=2012-06-22|accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>

As a result of the [[2012<U+2013>13 NHL lockout]], Bobrovsky signed a contract with [[SKA Saint Petersburg]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] but began playing for the Blue Jackets when the lockout finished. After splitting time early in the season, Bobrovsky supplanted [[Steve Mason (ice hockey)|Steve Mason]] as Columbus's starting goaltender; it was Bobrovsky's first time as a starter since his rookie season in Philadelphia. Bobrovsky was instrumental in the Blue Jackets' push for a playoff spot, which ultimately came up just short, as the team finished in 9th place in the Western Conference. Despite this, Bobrovsky had 21 wins, and career highs of a 2.00 GAA and a .932 save percentage. He was nominated for the [[Vezina Trophy]], awarded to the league's top goaltender.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=669815&navid=nhl:topheads | title = Bobrovsky, Lundqvist, Niemi named Vezina finalists | publisher = ''[[NHL.com]]'' | date = 2013-05-08 | accessdate = 2014-05-08}}</ref>

Bobrovsky participated in the [[2007 Super Series]], an eight-game series between Canadian and Russian juniors commemorating the 35th anniversary of the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]], and garnered the most ice-time of any goaltender. At the end of that year, he played in the [[2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], backstopping Russia to a bronze medal.
