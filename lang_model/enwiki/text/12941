'''Lincoln Castle''' is a major castle constructed in [[Lincoln, England]] during the late 11th century by [[William the Conqueror]] on the site of a pre-existing [[Roman Britain|Roman]] fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two [[Motte-and-bailey|motte]]s.<ref name=PS1>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=326536|mname=Lincoln castle|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at [[Lewes Castle|Lewes]] in [[Sussex]]. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a [[prison]] and [[law court]] into modern times, and is one of the better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a [[museum]].

When William the Conqueror defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] and the English at [[The Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October 1066, he continued to face resistance to his rule in the north of England. For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the [[Danelaw]] (an area traditionally under the control of [[Scandinavia]]n settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the north and midlands of England. It was at this time that the new king built major castles at [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]], [[Nottingham Castle|Nottingham]] and [[York Castle|York]]. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and [[Viking]] city of Lincoln.

When William reached Lincoln (one of the country's major settlements), he found a Viking commercial and trading centre with a population of 6,000 to 8,000. The remains of the old Roman walled fortress located 60 metres (200&nbsp;ft) above the countryside to the south and west, proved an ideal strategic position to construct a new castle.  Also, Lincoln represented a vital strategic crossroads of the following routes (largely the same routes which influenced the siting of the Roman fort):

* [[Ermine Street]] - a major Roman road and the Kingdom's principal north-south route connecting London and York.
* [[Fosse Way]] - another important Roman route connecting Lincoln with the city of [[Leicester]] and the south-west of England
* The Valley of the [[River Trent]] (to the west and southwest) - a major river affording access to the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]], and thus the major city of York.
* The [[River Witham]] - a waterway that afforded access to both the Rivers Trent (via the [[Foss Dyke|Fossdyke]] Roman canal at [[Torksey]]) and the North Sea via [[The Wash]].
* The [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] - an upland area to the northeast of Lincoln, which overlooks the [[Lincolnshire Marsh]] beyond.

A castle here could guard several of the main strategic routes and form part of a network of strongholds of the Norman kingdom, in Danish [[Mercia]], roughly the area of the country that is today referred to as the [[East Midlands]], to control the country internally. Also (in the case of the Wolds) it could form a center from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the [[River Welland|Welland]], to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans had constructed for the same purpose.

The castle was built in the south-west corner of the upper walled town, the remainder of which was occupied by the town. The [[Domesday Book]] entry for Lincoln records that of the 1164 residences in the city, 166 were demolished to make way for the castle. Of the 1164 pre-[[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] residences, perhaps 600 will have been in the upper town.

Work on the new fortification was completed in 1068. It is probable that at first a wooden keep was constructed which was later replaced with a much stronger stone one. Lincoln castle is very unusual in having two [[Motte-and-bailey|motte]]s, the only other surviving example of such a design being at [[Lewes Castle|Lewes]]. To the south, where the Roman wall stands on the edge of a steep slope, it was retained partially as a curtain wall and partially as a revetment retaining the mottes. In the west, where the ground is more level, the Roman wall was buried within an earth rampart and extended upward to form the Norman castle wall. The Roman west gate (on the same site as the castle's westgate) was excavated in the 19th century but began to collapse on exposure, and so was re-buried.

==1141: First Battle of Lincoln==
{{Main|Battle of Lincoln (1141)}}
The castle was the focus of attention during the [[First Battle of Lincoln]] which occurred on 2 February 1141, during the struggle between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and [[Empress Maud]] over who should be [[monarch]] in England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Jim|title=The medieval archer|year=1985|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=0-85115-194-9|page=53|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=USbo1S80sIAC&pg=PR7&dq=battle+of+Lincoln&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p_eDUc-XH-K44ATe3oHYAw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20Lincoln&f=false}}</ref>  It was held but damaged, and a new tower, called the Lucy Tower, was built.<ref name=PS1/><ref name=DB>{{cite book|last=Jaques|first=Tony|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges|year=2007|location=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-031333-538-9|page=588|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&pg=PA588&dq=battle+of+Lincoln&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p_eDUc-XH-K44ATe3oHYAw&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20Lincoln&f=false}}</ref><ref name=PS2>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=326634|mname=Earthwork, 1144|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Battle of Lincoln (1217)}}
[[File:BitvaLincoln1217ortho.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Castle (left), shown during the [[Second Battle of Lincoln]]]]
Lincoln Castle was again the site of a siege followed by the [[Second Battle of Lincoln]], on 20 May 1217, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]] in the course of the [[First Barons' War]]. This was the period of political struggle which led to the signing of [[Magna Carta]] on June 15, 1215.  After this, a new [[barbican]] was built onto the west and east gates.<ref name=DB/><ref name=PS3>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1393578|mname=Battle of Lincoln 1217|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>
==Other defences==
Other medieval defensive works in Lincoln have been recorded, but are no longer extant.

==Post-medieval==
As in [[Norwich]] and other places, the castle was used as a secure site in which to establish a prison. At Lincoln, the prison [[Gaol]] was built in 1787 and extended in 1847. Imprisoned debtors were allowed some social contact but the regime for criminals was designed to be one of isolation, according to the [[separate system]]. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each could see only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new jail in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Thomas|title=The history of the county of Lincoln|year=1833|publisher=John Saunders Jr.|location=London & Lincoln|page=199|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A-EHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA199&dq=lincoln+prison&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v_uDUYiqKuOt4ATZ74Fo&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=lincoln%20prison&f=false}}</ref> <ref name=PS4>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1128351|mname=Prison|accessdate=3May 2013}}</ref> The prison in the castle was left without a use until the [[Lincolnshire Archives]] were housed in its cells.

[[William Marwood]], the 19th century [[Executioner|hangman]], carried out his first execution at Lincoln. He used the [[Hanging|long drop]], designed to break the victim's neck rather than to strangle him, to execute [[William Frederick Horry|Fred Horry]] in 1872. Until 1868, prisoners had been publicly hanged on the mural tower at the north-east corner of the curtain wall, overlooking the upper town.

Lincoln castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense 12th century walls with its ramparts providing a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the [[Lincoln Cathedral|cathedral]], the city, and the surrounding countryside.

Another attraction is the opportunity to see one of the four surviving originals of the [[Magna Carta]], sealed by King John after his meeting with the Barons at [[Runnymede]] in 1215, a document which is now housed within Lincoln castle. There is also an accompanying exhibition, explaining the origin of the Magna Carta and its far reaching effects. Parts of the prison are also open as a museum, including the 19th century chapel, which is the only original chapel designed for the 'Separate System' (every seat is enclosed) left in the world today. The women's wing of the prison opened to visitors in 2005.

In the castle grounds are the graves of those executed here for various crimes. They have simple markers featuring only the initials of the condemned and the date of death. [[William Frederick Horry]] is buried in the Lucy Tower, along with many other criminals' graves.

The grounds also contain remains of Lincoln's [[Eleanor cross]],<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=326269|mname=Eleanor cross fragment|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> an [[oriel window]] moved from Sutton Hall and incorporated into the main gate, and the Bust of George III.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/section.asp?sectiontype=listmixed&catid=9462|title=Lincoln Castle's History Discover Lincoln Castle<U+2019>s history|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref>

At the western end of the castle is an ivy clad building built in 1826 as the Assize courts. These are still used today as Lincoln's Crown Courts.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.fairweather/docs/Lincoln_castle.htm Lincoln Castle]</ref><ref name=PS5>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1371045|mname=Assize courts|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>

The castle's grounds are used for music concerts and other public entertainment.

The castle is now owned by [http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk Lincolnshire County Council] and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1005049|desc=Lincoln Castle|grade=Scheduled|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>
