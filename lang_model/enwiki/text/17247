'''Kerrie Agnes Biddell''' (February 8, 1947 <U+2013> September 5, 2014) was an Australian jazz and [[Studio recording|session]] singer, as well as a pianist and teacher.

Born in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales]], to alcoholic parents, Biddell was sent to St Vincent's Convent in [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] at a young age, soon after her father left her mother.<ref name="SMH">{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/kerrie-biddell-first-lady-of-australian-jazz-20140909-10eaff.html |title=Kerrie Biddell, first lady of Australian jazz |last=O'Grady |first=Anthony |date=September 9, 2014 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> In 1962, Biddell suffered a collapsed lung and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], the latter of which affected her piano playing. She decided to become a singer, and, in 1967, sang for [[Dusty Springfield]] on backing vocals.<ref name="TAU">{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/australian-jazz-star-kerrie-biddell-dies/story-fn3dxiwe-1227049060465?nk=319482de0ea77e72e6647f8b09ed9c00 |title=Australian jazz star Kerrie Biddell dies |date=September 5, 2014 |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> Impressed, Springfield suggested she become a lead singer.<ref name="SMH" />

==The late-1960s==
Biddell joined the local band, The Echoes, and, in 1968, [[The Affair (band)|The Affair]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=McFarlane|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian McFarlane|title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] |chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'The Affair' |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040803081222/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=16 |url=http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=16|accessdate=September 9, 2014|year=1999|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]]|archivedate=August 3, 2004|isbn=1-86508-072-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milesago.com/Artists/affair.htm|title=The Affair|last=Kimball|first=Duncan|publisher=Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964<U+2013>1975. Ice Productions|year=2002|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref>  Affair guitarist Jim Kelly called Biddell "a world-class vocalist".<ref name="SMH" /> With her voice, the group could do various musical styles, such as [[Aretha Franklin]]-type soul, [[Sly Stone]] funk, and [[Jimmy Webb]] compositions.<ref name="SMH" /> In 1969, the national competition [[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]] added a vocal-group category to its main pop/rock category. Kelly stated that The Affair was not a vocal group, but Biddell "rehearsed us till we were".<ref name="SMH" /> The group won the category, with its prize being a trip to London, where the group relocated in mid-1970, only to disband months later. Before disbanding, they recorded Sly and the Family Stone's "[[Sing a Simple Song]]", which would become one of Biddell's signature songs.<ref name="SMH" />

==The early-1970s==
Biddell returned to Australia in 1970, where she toured with the Daly Wilson Big Band, which performed [[swing music]].<ref name="SMH" /><ref name="TAU" /> In 1972, she married David Glyde, a former saxophonist for [[Sounds Incorporated]], who opened for [[The Beatles]] on tour. Glyde had contacts in Canada, and he and Biddell moved there. Her career as a session singer began soon after. She and her husband toured in the United States, including clubs in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. She was offered a three-year six-figure USD contract with the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], and, despite being desperate to be a star, she discovered she did not care for the business side of Vegas. "I started to see that the amount they wanted to take away from me was too much," she stated, and moved back to Australia in 1972, enrolling in the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]].<ref name="SMH" />

==Solo career==
Biddell became a solo singer, and her first album won two [[Australian Recording Industry Association|Australian Record awards]].<ref name="SMH" /><ref name="TAU" /> She and Glyde divorced in 1977. She sang on hundreds of jingles, film scores and television shows, including the theme from 1980s' ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]''.<ref name="TAU" /> In 1983, she joined the faculty of the Jazz Diploma course at the Conservatorium, where she periodically taught into her later years.<ref name="SMH" /><ref name="TAU" /> In 1992, she wrote a one-woman show, ''Legends'', that later included [[June Bronhill]], [[Lorrae Desmond]], [[Toni Lamond]], and [[Jeanne Little]].<ref name="SMH" /> In 2001, due to poor health, she retired from performing, but continued teaching.

==Death==
On September 5, 2014, Biddell died from a stroke. She was 67.<ref name="SMH" /><ref name="TAU" />
