The '''Pouto Peninsula''' is a landform on the northern [[Kaipara Harbour]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]], [[New Zealand]]. The Peninsula runs in the north west to south east direction and is approximately 55 km long. The width varies from about 5.4 km to about 14 km, with the widest part of the peninsula near its southern end. The [[Tasman Sea]] is to the west, and the Kaipara Harbour is to the south. The [[Wairoa River]] and Kaipara Harbour are to the east. [[Dargaville]] and [[State Highway 12 (New Zealand)|State Highway 12]] lie directly to the north east of the peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reed New Zealand Atlas|year=2004|id=ISBN 0-7900-0952-8|author=Peter Dowling (editor)|publisher=Reed Books|pages=maps 6, 7, 10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Geographic Atlas of New Zealand|year=2005|id=ISBN 1-877333-20-4|author=Roger Smith, GeographX|publisher=Robbie Burton|pages=maps 26, 30}}</ref> 

The most substantial settlement on the peninsula is [[Te Kopuru]]. The locality of Pouto, originally a M<U+0101>ori village, is in the south east of the peninsula.

==Geography and conservation==
Much of Pouto - over 600 ha - is covered by sand dunes, which are one of the largest unmodified dune systems in New Zealand. Many of the dunes rise over 100 m above sea level, and the highest reaches 214 m. There are also both permanent and temporary wetlands, and more than 20 freshwater lakes and swamps.<ref name=DoC>{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=34405|title=Natural features of Pouto Peninsula|publisher=[[New Zealand Department of Conservation]]|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> The interior is planted in exotic forests.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Northland/NorthlandPlaces/14/en|title=Upper Kaipara Harbour|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}</ref>

Several threatened plants, birds, invertebrates and a freshwater fish are found on the peninsula.<ref name=DoC />

==Shipwrecks==
There have been 113 recorded shipwrecks on the coast of Pouto, because the low-lying peninsula makes the north head of the Kaipara Harbour treacherous, and there are a lack of landmarks on the peninsula from which to take bearings. Tradition recounts that [[Rongomai]], the captain of the [[waka (canoe)|waka]] ''[[Mahuhu|M<U+0101>huhu]]'', drowned when his canoe capsized near the entrance to Kaipara Harbour in the early days of M<U+0101>ori settlement of New Zealand.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgatiWhatua/1/ENZ-Resources/Standard/3/en|title=Pout<U+014D>, Kaipara Harbour heads|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}</ref><ref name=Byrne>{{cite book|title=The Unknown Kaipara|last=Byrne|first=Brian|isbn=0-473-08831-2|year=2002|pages=p 4}}</ref> The first shipwreck in recorded history was of the ''Aurora'', a 550-ton barque, in 1840,<ref>{{cite book|title=Tall Spars, Steamers & Gum|last=Ryburn|first=Wayne|year=1999|isbn=0-473-06176-7|pages=p 230}}</ref><ref>Byrne, pp 170-71</ref> and the most recent was the yacht ''Aosky'' in 1994.<ref name=TeAra />

==History==
Descendants of the ''M<U+0101>huhu'' crew settled around Pouto and the South Head of Kaipara Harbour, possibly in the 13th century CE. Some of the crew of ''[[Aotea (canoe)|Aotea]]'' may have joined them in the 14th century. In the 15th century, [[Taramainuku]], a grandson of the ''[[Arawa (canoe)|Arawa]]'' captain, settled at Pouto near the North Head, killing or driving away some of the previous occupant. According to tradition, the greater area of Kaipara is called after a [[h<U+0101>ngi]] Taramainuku hosted, at which the [[para]] fern (''Marattia salicina'') was served. "Kai" means food in the [[M<U+0101>ori language]].<ref name=Byrne />

In the late 17th century, or early 18th, [[Ng<U+0101>ti Wh<U+0101>tua]] occupied the Pouto Peninsula as part of their move southwards. In 1820, during the [[Musket Wars]], [[Ng<U+0101> Puhi]] laid siege to Ng<U+0101>ti Wh<U+0101>tua's Tauhara pa near Pouto, but were unable to capture it. A truce was agreed, to be cemented by the marriage of a Ng<U+0101> Puhi chief to the daughter of a Ng<U+0101>ti Wh<U+0101>tua chief. During the festivities, Ng<U+0101> Puhi and their allies suddenly turned on their hosts and massacred them.<ref>Byrne, p 12</ref><ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=5FlCAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Polack#PPA204,M1|pages=pp 204-5|title=New Zealand: Being a Narrative of Travels and Adventures During a Residence in that Country Between the Years 1831 and 1837|last=Polack|first=Joel Samuel|year=1838}} Polack erroneously gives the year as 1826.</ref>

In 1874, a customs house and pilot station were built at Pouto. A signal mast was erected in the sandhills at North Head in 1876, 5-6 miles west of the station. The following year, a telegraph system was set up between the two.<ref>Byrne, pp 247-57; Ryburn, p 44</ref> A lighthouse was built at North Head in 1884. The customs office was shifted to Te Kopura in 1903.<ref>Ryburn, p 140-44</ref> The lighthouse was automated in 1947, and closed in the mid 1950s. The structure still exists and was renovated in 1982-84.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kauricoast.co.nz/Feature.cfm?WPID=53|title=Pouto Point and the Kaipara Lighthouse}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/nz.htm|title=Lighthouses of New Zealand}}</ref>

[[Gum-digger]]s operated on the peninsula from the 1870s and lasting into the 1930s. Dairy farming was established in the early 20th century.<ref>Ryburn, pp 68, 170, 203</ref> Sand from Pouto was used to build dams in the [[Waitakere Ranges]], and was also barged around the Kaipara Harbour.<ref>Ryburn, pp 161-62, 181</ref> The southern part of the peninsula was slow to be developed, with the road only reaching to Taingaehe in 1930, and extending another 35 km to Pouto itself in 1931. Until then, contact with the rest of the world was by steamer. The road wasn't [[metal (pavement)|metal]]led until the 1940s.<ref>Ryburn, pp 170, 192</ref>

==Education==
[[Pouto School]] is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school with a decile rating of 4 and a roll of 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tki.org.nz/e/schools/display_school_info.php?school_id=1085|title=Te Kete Ipurangi - Pouto School|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]}}</ref> A school was first established at Pouto in 1878.<ref>Ryburn, p 48</ref>

There is also a primary school at Te Kopuru.
