'''Kentville''' is a [[town]] in [[Kings County, Nova Scotia]]. It is one of the main towns in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and it is the county seat of [[Kings County]].  As of [[2006]], the town of Kentville had a population of 5816 people.

==History==
Kentville owed its location to the Cornwallis River which downstream from Kentville becomes a large tidal river.  Kentville was the limit of navigation of sailing ships and more importantly was the most accessible crossing place on the river.  The ford and later the bridge at Kentville made the settlement an important crossroads for settlements in the Annapolis Valley.

===Acadian settlement===
The area was first settled by [[Acadians]], who built many dykes along the river to keep the high [[Bay of Fundy]] tides out of their farmland. These dykes created the ideal fertile soil that the [[Annapolis Valley]] is known for.  The Acadians were expelled from the area in [[1755]] by the [[Acadian Expulsion|British authorities]] because they would not swear allegiance to the British King. The area was then settled by [[New England Planters]]. Settlement was expedited by the [[United Empire Loyalists]] during the [[American Revolution]].

===English settlement===
The town was originally known as Horton's Corner, but was named Kentville in [[1826]] after [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent]] (brother of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and father of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]), who visited the area in [[1794]].  The village was at first relatively small and dwarfed by larger valley towns with better harbours such as [[Canning]] and [[Wolfville]].  The crossroads location did attract early shopkeepers and several stagecoach inns.  Kentville developed a reputation for rowdy drinking and horseraces in the early 19th century, earning the nickname "the Devil's half acre."

===Growth===
When the Windsor and Annapolis railway (later named [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]]) established its headquarters in Kentville in [[1868]] and began shipping [[Annapolis Valley]] apples to British markets, the community began to thrive. The railway not only employed a large number of people, up to a third of the town's population, but also attracted other industries such as mills, dairies, a large foundry, and a carriage works which even entered autombobile production.  The railway also attracted large institutional developments such as a large regional TB hospital, the Kentville Sanitorium, a federal agricultural research station and an army training base at [[LFAATC Aldershot|Camp Aldershot]]. The town became a major travel centre highlighted by the large Cornwallis Inn built at the town's centre by the railway.

===Post war challenges===
Kentville faced serious challenges after World War Two. The dominant apple industry suffered severe declines due to the loss of its Brtish export market.  The near-by military training base at [[LFAATC Aldershot|Camp Aldershot]] was significantly downsized and the town's major employer, the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] suffered serious declines with the collapse of the apple idustry and the growth of highway travel. Further decline followed in the 1970s as the town lost its retail core to the growth of shopping malls and later "big box" stores in near-by New Minas. The town was also eclipsed in restaurant, upscale retail and cultural institutions by the near-by university town of [[Wolfville]]. Kentville lost many heritage buildings in the postwar period and is one of the only towns in Nova Scotia without a single designated heritage building.  Major losses included the large railway station, one of the most historic in Canada which was demolished in 1990.  In July 2007 the town demolished the last railway structure in town, the roundhouse, despite protests and calls for it to be restored and developed as a retail and cultural centre.

==Population==
Kentville's 2006 population of 5816 people reflects a modest population growth of 4.7% which has been lower than [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings County]] as a whole (7.1%) but slightly higher than the provincial average (3.0%).<ref>Clairmont, Lynda and Anthony Thomson: "Kentville Police Service: Structure and Organization", 1990, Atlantic Institute of Criminology, Occasional Paper Series, page 1.
http://ace.acadiau.ca/soci/agt/justice/kentvillepd1990.htm</ref> Kentville's own population however is closely integrated with adjacent communities of [[Coldbrook]] and [[New Minas]] making for a combined population of 14,613 and forming part of the fast-growing area of eastern Kings County with an overall population of 25,969.
 
==Industries==
During the early part of the 20th century Kentville emerged as the business centre of [[Kings County]] and desite the post-war loss of commerce to other valley communities, it remains the professional centre of the [[Annapolis Valley]]. Kentville is home to numerous professional services such as lawyers offices, doctors, and investment firms. On the outskirts of the town is the Valley Regional Hospital, built in 1991. The town is also home to the Annapolis Valley Regional Industrial Park which employs numerous people in the area through a variety of different businesses.

[[Agriculture]], especially fruit crops such as [[apple]]s, remain a prominent [[industry]] in the Kentville area, and throughout the eastern part of the valley. Kentville is home to one of the largest agricultural research facilities in Nova Scotia founded in [[1911]], known to the locals as The Research Centre. The site now employs over 200 people and sits on 473 acres of the land at the east end of the town.

Kentville shares its northern boundary along the Cornwallis River with [[LFAATC Aldershot|Camp Aldershot]], a military training base founded in 1904. At its peak during World War II, the camp housed approximately 7000 soldiers. [[Kentville]] native Donald Ripley wrote a book chronicling Camp Aldershot and its effect on the town entitled "On The Home Front"<ref>Ripley, Donald: "On the Home Front: Wartime Life in Camp Aldershot and Kentville, N. S." Halifax: Nimbus, 1991 http://www.fnsh.ns.ca/news_sept04_centennial.html</ref> Today the camp functions as an army reserve training centre and is the headquarters of [[The West Nova Scotia Regiment]].

==Community events==
The [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival|Apple Blossom Festival]], founded in [[1933]] is held each May to celebrate the blossoming of local apple orchards. It is centred primarily in Kentville, with events occurring in several other communities in the [[Annapolis Valley]]. The biggest event is the Grand Street Parade, lasting about 2 hours, and comprised of floats from local businesses, and organizations and community groups. The annual fireworks display is sponsored by one of the region's largest employers, the [[Michelin]] tire company, which has a large [[factory|plant]] in Waterville, a village to the west of Kentville.
