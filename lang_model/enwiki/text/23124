'''Mar Thoma Church''', is [[Apostolic Succession|Apostolic]] in origin, [[Universal]] in nature, [[Biblical]] in faith, [[Evangelism|Evangelical]] in principle, [[Ecumenical]] in outlook, [[Oriental]] in worship, [[Democratic]] in function, and [[Episcopal]] in character.<ref>Rev.C.P.Philipose, in Introduction to Concise History of Malankara Marthoma Church (1936) by T.C. Chacko, Page 12-13.</ref>

On the South Western coast of [[India]] lies a small state known as [[Kerala]]. It was here in the first century, [[Thomas the Apostle]] arrived to preach the [[gospel]] to the Jewish community. Some of the Jews and locals became followers of Jesus of [[Nazareth]]. The remnant of that Church, still independent and under local leadership is called '''[[Malankara Church|Malankara]] Mar Thoma Syrian Church.''' also known as '''Marthoma Church'''.

The Church presently has around one million members. The majority of the membership of the Church is in the southern [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] but it has spread with the 20th century Indian diaspora to [[North America]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], this in addition to a sizeable population in the rest of India.

==Early period==
====First century BC====
On the south western side of the Indian peninusula; between the mountains and the Erythraean Sea (now Arabian Sea); stretching from [[Kannoor]] to [[Kanyakumari]] was the land called Cherarajyam, which was ruled by local chieftens. Later this land came to be known as [[Malabar]] (now [[Kerala]] or <U+2018>God<U+2019>s Own Country<U+2019>). [[Muziris]] (now known as [[Pattanam]]<ref> Kerala Council of Historical Research findings in 2006-07.</ref> near [[Cochin]]) was the imortant entry port. After the discovery of [[Hippalus]], every year 100 ships arrived here from various parts of the then known world, including Red Sea ports.

Even before the time of Christ, during the time of Moses and [[King Solomon]], there was trade in spices and luxury articles between [[Malabar]] Coast and [[Palestine]].<ref> <U+2018><U+2019>Bible<U+2019><U+2019>; I Kings. 9:26-28; 10:11,22; 2 Chro: 8:18; 9:21.</ref> During the second exile (586 BC) some of the Jews came and settled in Kerala. They were known as [[Bene Israel]]. (Most of them have returned to [[Israel]] by twentieth century.<ref> N.M.Mathew, <U+2018><U+2019>Malankara Mar Thoma Sabha Charitram<U+2019><U+2019>. Vol. I (Malyalam) Page 25, 32, 33</ref> While [[Augustus]] Caesar (31 BC- 14 AD) was the Emperor of Rome and [[Herod the Great]] (37-4 BC) was King of [[Judea]], ambassadors from [[Malabar]] visited the Emperor Augustus. These ambassadors are called The [[Wise Men From the East]] in the Bible.<ref>Matthew 2:1</ref> Even today, the descendants of these Wise Men gather every year at a place in [[Kerala]].<ref>Mathew, N.M. ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1.(2006). Page 68-69.</ref>
===Arrival of Saint Thomas===
[[Image:St thomas apostle.jpg|thumb|150px|left|St.Thomas]]
It was to this country [[Kerala]], [[Thomas the Apostle]], one of the disciples of [[Jesus Christ]] arrived in the first century, (believed to be in 52 AD). He landed at [[Muziris]] (now known as [[Pattanam]],<ref> Kerala Council for Historical Research findings in 2006-07.</ref> near [[Cochin]] on the [[Malabar Coast]]). During his stay some of the Jews and the Wise Men became followers of Jesus of Nazareth.<ref>Bowler, Gerry. (2000). <U+2018><U+2019>The World Encyclopedia of Christmas<U+2019><U+2019>. Page 139.</ref> They were called [[Nazrani]]s, meaning <U+201C>followers of Jesus of [[Nazareth]].<U+201D> By twenty-first century they called themselves as [[Christians]].

It is believed that the Malankara Church was established by [[Thomas the Apostle]] at the same time as Saint Paul established the church in Corinth. After leaving Malankara, St. Thomas proceeded to the East coast of India and died a martyrs<U+2019> death at a place called [[Mylapore]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].

===First 15 centuries===
The Most Rev. Dr. [[Juhanon Mar Thoma]] Metropolitan concludes the chapter on the St Thomas tradition in his book ''Christianity in India and a Brief History of the Mar Thoma Church'', as follows:

The History of the Christian Church in the first century does not depend entirely on historical documents. Tradition is often more true and more compelling than plain historic proof. In this sense St Peter<U+2019>s founding of the Roman Church and St Thomas founding of the [[Malabar]] Church, may be said to stand on the same footing. Both are supported by traditions which are sufficiently early and sufficiently strong.<ref> The Most Rev. Dr. Juhanon Marthoma Metropolitan. (1952). ''Christianity in India and a Brief History of the Mar Thoma Church'', Page 10-11. Pub. K.M.Cherian.</ref>

Those who were converted by St. Thomas continued to attend the worship in [[synagogue]]s. Then they moved to their homes and by the second century, they began to build their own churches in various places. We may assume that there were such small gatherings at Maliankara, [[Piravom]] , and [[Niranam]] (Nelcynda).
====Visitors====
190 AD- [[Pantaenus]] the Philosopher visited India and found that there were many evangelists in [[India]] with them he found a copy of the Gospel According to Matthew in Hebrew.<ref> 
''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' of Eusebius Book V, Chapter 10.</ref>
 
345 AD. <U+2013> There is a tradition that during the time of King [[Shapur II]] (310-379) of [[Persia]], a group of 400 immigrants from [[Persia]] arrived in Malabar under the leadership of a merchant named Thomas of Cana, known as Knaye Thommen. Mention is made also of another immigration from Persia in the year 825 under the leadership of a Persian merchant named Marwan Sabriso with two Bishops named Mar Sapro and Mar Prodh. They cooperated with the Malankara Church, attended worship services together but remained a separate identity.

883 AD. <U+2013> [[Alfred the Great]] (849-899), King of Wessex, England sent gifts to Mar Thoma Christians of India through Sighelm, bishop of Sherbon..<ref><U+2019><U+2019>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle<U+2019><U+2019>.</ref>

1225 AD. <U+2013> [[Chau-Ju-Kua]] a [[Chinese]] traveller visited [[Kerala]]. In his writings he described the dress of a St.Thomas Christian bishop.<ref>Mathew, N.M. (2003)St.Thomas Christians of Malabar Through Ages. Page 76.</ref><ref>Mathew, N.M. ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1. Page 98.</ref>.

1282 AD. <U+2013> [[Kublai Khan]] (1215-1294) Emperor of [[China]] sent an emissary to [[Kollam]], It was followed by an emissory from [[Kollam]] under the leadership of a St. Thomas Christian.<ref>Mathew, N.M. (2003)St.Thomas Christians of Malabar Through Ages. Page 76-77.</ref><ref>Mathew, N.M. ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1.Page 99-100.</ref>

1292 AD. <U+2013> Marco Polo (1254-1324) on his return journey from China visited Kerala, mentioned that there were Christians and Jews in Kerala.<ref> Marco Polo. ''The Book of Travels''. Page 287.</ref>

====Collection of deeds====
The rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation their assistance, gave to the [[Malankara]] Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates. Five sheets of them are now in the custody of St. Thomas Christians.
#Iravi Corttan Deed: In the year 1225 AD. Sri Vira Raghava Chakravarti, gave a deed to Iravi Corttan of Mahadevarpattanam in 774 (?). Two [[Brahmin]] families are witness to this deed showing that Brahmins were in Kerala by the eighth century. According to history of Brahmins they started arriving in Kerala by the third century.
#Tharissa palli Deed I: Perumal Sthanu Ravi Gupta (844-885) gave a deed in 849 AD, to Isodatta Virai for Tharissa Palli (church) at Curakkeni Kollam. According to historians, this is the first deed in Kerala that gives the exact date.<ref> Sreedhara Menon, A. ''A Survey of Kerala History''.(Mal).Page 54.</ref>
#Tharissa palli Deed II: Continuation of the above, given after 849 AD.

====Administration====
During the first fifteen centuries, each parish appointed its own elders (Idavaka Mooppen). These elders met together and elected their Elder (Malankara Mooppen). Laying of hands on the Malankara Mooppen was by twelve Idavaka Mooppens. By 1500, Malankara Church was spread from [[Kannur]] in the North to Kollam in the South.

At the [[Synod of Diamper]], Archbishop Menezes used the word <U+2018>Malankara Mooppen<U+2019> a number of times, but the Latin word [[Archid<U+00E3>conus]] was used only three times, because the Latin word was not familiar to Malankara people.

==Arrival of the Portuguese==
The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] started settling in India with the arrival of [[Vasco Da Gama]] on Sunday, [[May 20]], [[1498]]. From that time the Portuguese were powerful in the western parts of India and had control over the sea routes.

====Synod of Diamper====
The [[Malankara Church]] had hardly any contact with the Christians of Europe. Many of them did not even know that there was a Pope in Rome. But the Portuguese used their power to bring the [[Malankara Church]] under the supremacy of Rome. A powerful Archbishop [[Aleixo de Menezes]]<ref>Also known as Alejo-de-Menezes, and in Kerala people called him as Allosos Metran</ref> arrived in [[Goa]] in 1595. He then convened a Synod at [[Udayamperoor]], south of Ernakulam, from 20<U+2013>26 June, 1599. This is known as the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Here the Archbishop demanded obedience to the supreme Bishop of Rome. The representatives sent from various parishes in and around [[Cochin]] were forced to accept the decrees read out by the Archbishop. Thus those parishes of the [[Malankara Church]] were made part of the Catholic Church under Pope of Rome. But the remaining churches continued their original Apostolic beliefs and practices.<ref> Herberts. (1636). ''Some years Travels Into Asia And Afrique''.Page. 304-305.</ref>

====The Great Swearing====
{{main|Coonan Cross Oath}}
Under the leadership of Malanakra Mooppen Thomas, [[Nazranis]] around [[Cochin]] gathered at [[Mattancherry]] church on Friday, January 24, 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3) and made an oath that is known as Oath at the crooked Cross.

====Syrian Christian====
After the Swearing, out of about 200,000 persons about 400 joined the Catholics.<ref>Travancore Manuel. Volume II, Page 185</ref> Their language of worship was Latin while that of [[Malankara Church]] was [[Syriac]]. So the Roman Catholics started using the name Latin Christians for Catholics and Syrian Christians for the Malankara Church.

==Marthoma metropolitans==
After the The Great Swearing in Ceremony, the parish elders (Idavaka Mooppens) of the Church met together and elected [[Kuravilangad]] Parampil Thomas Kathanar as Malankara Elder (Malankara Mooppen). Following the ancient custom.<ref>Holy Bible Acts 6:1-6, 1 Timothy 4:14)</ref> twelve Idavaka Mooppens laid their hands on him and appointed him as Malankara Mooppen. The Catholics considered this illegitimate, because this was not their practice. So the Marthoma Nazranis were forced to send letters to various other eastern Churches asking to send a bishop. In 1854, Mar Gregorios Abdul-Jaleel, Patriarch of Jerusalem arrived. Thus began the relation between the Malankara Church and the [[Antioch]]ian [[Jacobite]] church.

[[Image:malankarathrone.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Malankara Throne,The throne used for this consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] in 1653 ]]

[[Mar Thoma I]]. - In 1653, Malankara Mooppen Thomas, was consecrated with the title Mar Thoma by Mar Gregorios. The throne used for this consecration in 1653 is still in the possession of the Mar Thoma Church and kept in the [[Poolatheen]], the residence of the Malankara Marthoma Metropolitan at Tiruvalla. It has been used in the installation of every Mar Thoma Metropolitan, to this day, so that the continuity of the throne of Mar Thoma is ensured. Mar Thoma survived a number of assassination attempts.

Important events:
# At this time Mar Thopma IX was also alive. Both of them had a claim to the interest of the Vattipanam. (Fixed Deposit). Because Mar Thoma X was the one approved by the people, Rani Gouri Parvathi Bhai, ruler of Travancore issued a Royal Proclamation declaring that Pulikkotil Joseph Mar Dionysus as Malankara Metropolitan.

#In 1815 Classes began in [[Kottayam]] Suryani Seminary. He appointed the teaching staff.

[[Mar Philoxenos II]]. <U+2013> of the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]. (November 25, 1816 <U+2013> October 10, 1817). Due to the sudden demise of Mar Thoma X, Mar Philoxenos II took charge of the Malankara Church. Because there were no other Metropolitans in Malankara at this time Mar Philoxenos was accepted as Malankara Metropolitan and the government issued a Royal Proclamation.

Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram, Vol.I. E.J.Institute. Page 253-254.</ref>

Important events:
#Problems arose with C.M.S. Missionaries. So he convened a meeting of the representatives of the parishes at Mavelikara (January 16, 1836) and proclaimed allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch. He did not support Reformation of the Church. [[Abraham Malpan]] and many other leaders of reformation did not attend this meeting.
#C.M.S. missionaries formed C.M.S. Church. By a government award known as Cochin Award, they were given a few properties of the Malankara Church. From this time Malankara Church was also called The Jacobite Church.
#He was not able to consecrate a successor. But Palakunnathu Mathews, nephew of [[Abraham Malpan]] went to Anitoch and was consecrated as [[Mathews Mar Athanasius]] by the [[Patriarch of Antioch]].

During his time Reformation of the Church became strong. Ouseph Kathanar from [[Kunnamkulam]], who objected to Reformation went to Antioch and was consecrated as Joseph Mar Dionysius on April 3, 1865. After his return, those who opposed [[Mathews Mar Athanasius]] invited the Patriarch of Antioch. The large majority of the people were conservative and the reform party was a very small minority.

Mar Dionysius and his supporters filed a case on March 4, 1879. The final verdict came after ten years. Before the verdict was made known, Maharaja of Travancore called the two Metropolitans and two represetntives from both sides. In that meeting Thomas Mar Athanasius Metropolitan testified that Malankara Church was never under any foreign rule and he was unwilling to move away from the traditional teachings and give away the authority and Church possessions to a foreign Patriarch. The Church was split into two. The majority under the leadership of Mar Dionysius and six Metropolitans appointed by Antioch chose to be under Antioch. The reform party decided to remain as an independent Malankara Church.

Without a place to live except his own house, Thomas Mar Athanasius Metropolitan returned to [[Maramon]], Died on August 10, 1893 and was interred at Maramon palli.

Palakunnathu [[Abraham Malpan]] was a strong Churchman, loyal to the best traditions of his Church. He wanted only to effect such reforms in the Church as were consistent with the apostolic and truly evangelical traditions of the Church. This he tried to do by translating and revising the liturgy and by doing away with the unscriptural practices which had crept into the Church and by restoring the Church to what he considered to be its pristine position before the Synod of Diamper. .. .. .. He also insisted on a high moral standard of conduct for laity and clergy alike. All this created a ferment in the Church and its effects are still discernible in the Syrian Church as a whole<U+201D>.<ref>Mar Thoma Sabha Directory (1999), Page 24.</ref>

===History===
During the time of Marthoma VI, Rev.Dr. [[Claudius Buchanan]], an Anglican missionary visited Malankara. He met Marthoma in 1806.<ref>Buchanan, Rev. Claudius. Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for British India, Page 76.</ref> With his help, the Bible was translated from the original Aramaic language and was distributed to the parishes. Soon after his meeting, representatives of the parishes met at Aarthattu church and declared (Aarthattu Padiola) that the people should not follow the teachings by Rome, Antioch or other foreign Churches.<ref> Aarthattu padiola</ref> This meeting can be considered to be the beginning of 'Purification Movement' in Malankara Church.

Mar Thoma XI, (Punnathra Mar Dionysius) convened a meeting of representatives of the Malankara Church at [[Mavelikkara]], on December 3, 1818. In that meeting a committee was appointed to recommend reforms in the Church. [[Abraham Malpan]], Kaithayil Geevarghese Malpan, Eruthikkal Markose Kathanar, Adangapurathu Joseph Kathanar were members of this committee. This was the first step in carrying out Reformation in Malankara Church.

Mar Thoma XII, (Cheppattu Mar Dionysius) did not like the interference of the Anglican Missionaries. So he convened a Synod at [[Mavelikkara]] on January 16, 1836, in which the Synod declared that , <U+201C>We, the Jacobite Syrians are under the rule of the Patriarch of Antioch.<U+201D><ref>Mavelikara Padiola </ref> [[Abraham Malpan]] did not attend this synod.

===Trumpet call===
On September 5, 1856, the battle cry for reformation was sounded. Strategy was formed by a group of 12 senior clergy under the leadership of Abraham Malpan. They issued a letter describing the wrong teachings and a statement listing twenty-four evil practices of the Church which crept in by its association with other Churches and religions.<ref>Zac Varghese & Mathew A.Kallumpram. (2003). ''Glimpses of Mar Thoma Church History''. Page28-33.

===Reformation in action===
[[Image:MaramonMarthomaChurch.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Maramon Mar Thoma Church (2005)]]

[[Abraham Malpan]] on Sunday, August 27, 1837 conducted the Holy Communion service in Malayalam at his home parish at [[Maramon]]. Clergy, who supported him also did the same thing in various other parishes on the same day.

Every year on the first week of October, there was a church festival at Maramon, connected with a saint who died in 1685 at [[Kothamangalam]]. During that time a wooden image of that saint (they called <U+2018>Muthappen<U+2019>) was taken around in procession and people used to venerate that saint by offering prayers and ask for intercession. In 1837, Abraham Malpan took the image and threw it into a well saying, <U+201C>Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?<U+201D> (Isaiah 8:19). So when the festival came there was no image to be taken out for procession.

The use of the revised liturgy and the changes he brought about in practices offended Marthoma XII. So [[Abraham Malpan]] and was excommunicated and deacons trained under him were refused priesthood. But Abraham Malpan was not disheartened. He continued with the reforms. He returned to Maramon. Many of his students joined him to continue their studies. All those who believed that the Church need to revitalize also joined him. Members of parishes in [[Kozhencherry]], [[Kumbanad]], [[Eraviperoor]], [[Thumpamon]], [[Elanthoor]], [[Kundara]], [[Kottarakara]], [[Mavelikkara]], [[Mallapally]], and many other places made trips to Maramon to attend the service in Malayalam and listen to his sermons. Doors were also opened for reformation in other places by clergy who supported him.

At this stage he had three choices in front of him. Repent and go back to the old beliefs under Antioch; join the Anglican Church with western beliefs; or go forward with the reformation restoring the Church to what he thought was its original purity. He chose the third choice. [[Abraham Malpan]] died in 1845.

Mathen, a nephew of [[Abraham Malpan]] also followed his uncle<U+2019>s steps. He went to [[Antioch]] and returned consecrated by the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] as [[Mathews Mar Athanasius]] Metropolitan. After Cheppattu Philipose Mar Dionysius abdicated due to ill health, to collect the interest of the Vattipanam (Fixed Deposit), Mar Athanasius was approved as Malankara Metropolitan by the governments of Kerala and Cochin on August 30, 1852.<ref> Agur, C.M. ''Church History of Travancore''.</ref> Mar Athanasius published the liturgy without the prayer to St. Mary.<ref> Mathew, N.M. (2007). ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', Volume II. Page 63.</ref> He consecrated the bishop for Malabar Independent Church.<ref> Varughese, Rev. K.C., ''Malabar Swathantra Suryani Sabhyude Charitram''.</ref> These actions angered many clergy and Pulikkottil Ouseph Kathanar went to Antioch in 1864. He returned as Joseph Mar Dionysius in 1865. During the time of [[Thomas Mar Athanasius]] Metropolitan, Mar Dionysius demanded the possession of the Seminary and the control of assets of the Church. Mar Dionysius and his supporters filed a case on March 4, 1879. During a meeting convened by the Maharaja of Travancore, Mar Athanasius testified that [[Malankara Church]] was never under any foreign rule and that he was unwilling to move away from the teachings or give the authority and Church possessions to a foreign Patriarch. The final verdict came after ten years was against the reform party.

The Metran Kakshi (supporters of Thomas Mar Athanasious) decided to remain as an independent Malankara Church to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ as it was before 1500 CE., and to give primary authority to the Holy Bible. Later this group chose the name Malankara Mar Thoma Suryani Sabha.

==History of the name==
It is necessary to understand how the name Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church evolved.
Malankara now known as Kerala is the name of the place in South India where these Christians lived from the first century. Only in the twentieth century they began to move out of Kerala.
In the first century,the name was Malankara Sabha (Group of believers in Malankara). The people were known as [[Nazranis]] (followers of Jesus of Nazereth). They were not called Christians because Apostle Thomas left for India before the Greeks were called Christians.<ref>Holy Bible Acts 11:26</ref> Mar Thoma literally means Saint Thomas. This is because gospel was first preached in Malabar by Saint Thomas the disciple of [[Jesus Christ]].

===Liturgy===
The word Syrian in the name of the Church is very often misunderstood by people of foreign origin. It does not mean that the Mar Thoma Christians were Syrians (people who came from Syria) or the Church is under a Syrian Church.

The origianl liturgical language used by [[Malankara Church]] was Aramiac. The Bible that was in use was in Hebrew.<ref>''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' of Eusebius (AD 260-341) Book V, Chapter 10.)</ref> Their traditions was also Jewish as was in first century churches. Later when Syriac replaced Aramiac in eastern countries, [[Malankara Church]] also started using Syriac. Their Bible during that period was Estrangelo Syriac.<ref>Buchanan, Rev. Claudius in Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesisatical Establishment for British India. Foot notes Page 76</ref><ref> A copy of this Bible given to Dr. Buchanan for translation was later presented to him and is kept in Cambridge University Library.</ref> This was the Bible that was in use till Malayalam (language of Kerala) translation was available. It is interesting to note that even though bishops from Syrian churches visited Kerala regularly, they did not change the Bible into one of the new forms of Syriac. In June 1876, Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Pathrose IV, visited Kerala and a majority of [[Malankara Church]] accepted him. They recognized the relationship with the Antiochan Syrian Church and were known as Jacobites. Those who did not join them kept their identity and became the members of the Mar Thoma Church. Note that the Mar Thoma Church continued to use the Eastern Syriac, while the others started using the Western (Antiochan) syriac. Because Syriac is still used sparingly in its liturgy, Mar Thoma church also is called a Syrian church.

Now the Church has the liturgy translated into various languages including Eastern Syriac, Malayalam, English, Hindi, Tamil, etc. Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church was never under any of the Syrian Churches. They have a combination of Jewish and Indian traditions.

===Syrian Christians===
After the arrival of the Portuguese, they converted a number of Nazranis in and around Cochin to Roman Catholic faith. In 1599, at the Synod of Udayamperoor, Roman Archbishop Alejo-de-Menezes referred the original Christians as Marthoma Nazranis or Malankara Nazranis. Nowhere it was mentioned that they were Syrians or Christians. The language of liturgy of the Roman Church was Latin and that of Nazranis was Syrian (Aramiac). To distinguish these two groups, later the Roman Catholics called themselves Latin Christians and the other Malankara Nazranis, Syrian Christians.<ref>Canons of Synod of Diamper</ref>

===Puthenkootu (Puthenkur)===
In the synod of Diamper Marthoma Nazranis were referred as Pazhaya Margam (Old path) and Catholics, Puthya Margam (New path). It is after 1758 when Roman Bishop of Verapoly wrote to the Dutch Company, that the Marthoma Nazranis were new to Malankara, the Puthenkootu (New House) came into use.<ref>Mathew, N.M. ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1.Page 202.</ref>
===Jacobites===
After the Cochin Award in April 1840, some of the Nazranis joined the Anglican missionaries and formed the C.M.S. Church. The C.M.S. called the remaining Malankara Nazranis "<i>Jacobites</i>".

===Reformed Christians===
When the 'Purification Movement' (Reformation) began there were two groups in the Church. The Metran Kakshi met together in 1909 and decided to accept the name Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, combining the original name with the names that Malankara Nazranis received in the course of time.<ref> George, Dr. K.K. Rev.Naveekaranathinte Thrithya Jubilie (Third Jubilee of Reformation) Page 63.</ref> It is now generally known as Mar Thoma Church.

==Independence of the Church==
During the course of a litigation (1879-1889), answering a question Thomas Mar Athanasius Metropolitan said, <U+201C> The Episcopal throne of Patriarch is the throne of St. Peter, while the throne of Malankara Church is that of St. Thomas. Malankara Church is as old as the Church in Antioch, equal in status, and both are independent.<U+201D>

==Administration==
Mar Thoma church has a well defined constitution. His Grace the Metropolitan is the supreme head of the Church. It has a democratic pattern of administration with a Legislative assembly (Prathinidhi Mandalam), an executive body of the Mandalam (Sabha Council) and an Episcopal Synod. Its regular work as well as special projects are almost entirely financed by contributions from its members at home and abroad.

===Administrative divisions===
For administrative purpose, the Church is divided into 12 Dioceses headed by a Metropolitan or by an Episcopa. They are:
Diocese of Adoor; Diocese of Chengannur_Mavelikara.; Diocese of Chennai-Bangalore; Diocese of Delhi; Diocese of Kottayam-Kochi; Diocese of Kunnamkulam-Malabar; Diocese of Malaysia-Singapore-Australia; Diocese of Mubai; Diocese of Niranam-Maramon; Diocese of North America-U.K. & Europe; Diocese of Ranny-Nilackel; Diocese of Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam

The Church has 38 social welfare institutions, 14 destitute homes and ten hospitals. The Mar Thoma Theological Seminary, [[Kottayam]] (established 1926), E.J. Institute of Evangelism, and 5 other institutes cater to the theological education of both the clergy and the laity. Further, there are three study centers at Managanam, [[Kottayam]] and Trivandrum for arranging regular study programs and to provide opportunities for creative dialogue between Church and society on various ethical, moral, social and religious issues. The religious education of children is looked after by the Sunday School Samajam (organized in 1905) and the work among youth is carried on by the Youth Department, (the Yuvajana Sakhyam organized in 1933). The Church has a Women's Department (the Mar Thoma Suvisesha Sevika Sanghom organized in 1919).

==Maramon Convention==
[[Image:maramonconvention.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Maramon Convention]]

The [[Maramon Convention]] is the largest annual Christian gathering in Asia ,organized by the Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association, the missionary wing of the Mar Thoma Church. It takes place at [[Maramon]], during the month of February on the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the [[Kozhencherry]] Bridge. The first convention was held in 1895 March, for a period of 10 days. The convention tent has a seating capacity in excess of 150,000 and is made of interwoven coconut leaves by the parishners of nearby churches. All around the tent there are temporary sheds and tents for various purposes related to the Convention. Stalls for the sale of religious literature, Church offices and restaurants run by charity organizations are allowed to operate in the vicinity of the tent under the strict control of the Church authorities.

The Maramon Convention is pre-eminently an assembly of Christians who once a year come here for listening to the gospel as read and expounded by leaders of Christian thought from all over India as well as abroad. But those who attend sit on the sand bed, (old & invalid people are given chairs) men on one side and ladies on the other. Without caste, creed, colour or age they come and listen to the messages. One after noon session is for ecumenical messages from invited leaders of other Churches.

== Ecumenical relations ==
The Church actively participates in the programs of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Christian Conference of Asia]], the [[National Council of Churches]] and the [[Kerala]] Christian Council.

Mar Thoma Church was attending the meetings of [[World Council of Churches]] from its first meeting in 1948. At the WCC meeting held in Evanston, Dr. [[Juhanon Mar Thoma]] Metropolitan was elected as one of its presidents. Since then the Church representatives attended all the General meetings.

The Mar Thoma Church is in communion relationship with the Independent Syrian Church of Thozhiyoor, although the doctrinal positions are not mutually accepted in full.
The Church also is in Communion with the [[Anglican Church]] (1958), the (Protestant) [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] (1981), the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] (1983), the [[Church of South India]], the [[Church of North India]] (2004), and Anglican Church, Australia (2007).

==Customs and traditions==
Marthoma Church still follows some of the ancient customs. One of them is given below:

===Weddings===
Ceremony at the church is in two parts. First is Betrothal or blessing of the ring. This is to make sure that the bride agrees to the wedding. The groom passes a ring to the officiating priest who examines it and hand it over to the bride requesting her to accept it. If she accepts the ring, wedding ceremony will continue. If it is returned the wedding will not be held. The value of the ring should not be more than what the poorest in the community can pay for, although this is not strictly observed in modern times. Before seventh century it was the practice for the groom to give copper coins, <U+2018>from his earnings,<U+2019> to the bride through a third party. Now coins have been replaced by a ring. A Marthoma lady will wear her wedding ring till the end of her life.

Because they are going to be the heads of a new family, they are to be crowned as king and Queen of the new home. The crown used is a golden chain, the one used by the earlier generations. Then the husband ties a gold pendant, known as minnu on his wife<U+2019>s neck. Pendant is in the shape of a banyan tree leaf. A Marthoma lady will wear her pendant till the end of her life. To show that the husband is capable of protecting her, he clothes her in a new dress known as manthrakodi. Soon after the wedding ceremony, she changes to her new dress. Traditionally, a Marthoma lady keeps this dress till the end of her life and at her death, the body is dressed in her Manthrakodi.

After the wedding ceremony, there is traditionally a function at home with immediate relations and close friends. The couple gives gifts (Dakshina) to their first teacher and elders of the family, although this may take place before the wedding ceremony. The groom gives a [[sari]] to the bride's mother.
