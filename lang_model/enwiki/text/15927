ISRO is amongst the six largest [[List of space agencies|government space agencies]] in the world, along with USA's [[NASA]], Russia's [[RKA]], Europe's [[ESA]], China's [[CNSA]] and Japan's [[JAXA]]. Its primary objective is to advance [[space technology]] and use its applications for national benefit.<ref name=isro_aboutus>{{cite web|url=http://isro.org/scripts/Aboutus.aspx|title=About ISRO <U+2013> Introduction|publisher=ISRO}}</ref>

Established in 1969, ISRO superseded the erstwhile [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]] (INCOSPAR). Headquartered in [[Bangalore]], ISRO is under the administrative control of the [[Department of Space]], [[Government of India]]. <u/>

ISRO has achieved numerous milestones since its establishment. India's first [[satellite]], [[Aryabhata (satellite)|Aryabhata]], was built by ISRO and launched by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1975. [[Rohini (satellite)|Rohini]], the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, [[Satellite Launch Vehicle|SLV-3]], was launched in 1980. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (PSLV) for putting satellites into [[polar orbit]]s and the [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV) for placing satellites into [[geostationary orbit]]s. These rockets have launched numerous [[communications satellite]]s, [[earth observation satellite]]s, and, in 2008, [[Chandrayaan-1]], India's first mission to the [[Moon]].

Over the years, ISRO has conducted a variety of operations for both Indian and foreign clients. ISRO's satellite launch capability is mostly provided by indigenous [[launch vehicle]]s and launch sites. In 2008, ISRO successfully launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], while future plans include indigenous development of [[GSLV]], [[Indian human spaceflight programme|manned space missions]], further lunar exploration, [[Mangalyaan|mars exploration]] and interplanetary probes. ISRO has several field installations as assets, and cooperates with the international community as a part of several bilateral and multilateral agreements.

==Formative years==
[[Image:Vikram Sarabhai.jpg|thumb|[[Vikram Sarabhai|Dr. Vikram Sarabhai]], the father of India's Space Programme.]]
Modern space research in India is most visibly traced to the activities of scientist [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S. K. Mitra]] who conducted a series of experiments leading to the sounding of the [[ionosphere]] by application of ground based radio methods in 1920's [[Calcutta]].<ref name=daniel486>Daniel, 486</ref> Later, Indian scientists like [[C.V. Raman]] and [[Meghnad Saha]] contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences.<ref name=daniel486/> However, it was the period after 1945 which saw important developments being made in coordinated space research in India.<ref name=daniel486/> Organised space research in India was spearheaded by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai<U+2014>founder of the [[Physical Research Laboratory]] at [[Ahmedabad]]<U+2014>and [[Homi Bhabha]], who had played a role in the establishment of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in 1945.<ref name=daniel486/> Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of [[cosmic rays|cosmic radiation]], high altitude and airborne testing of instruments,<u/> deep underground experimentation at the [[Particle experiments at Kolar Gold Fields|Kolar mines]]<U+2014>one of the deepest mining sites in the world <U+2013> and studies of the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]].<ref name=daniel487>Daniel, 487</ref> Studies were carried out at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations.<ref name=daniel487/><ref name=daniel488>Daniel, 488</ref>

Government support became visible by 1950 when the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] was founded with [[Homi Bhabha]] as secretary.<ref name=daniel488/> The Department of Atomic Energy provided funding for space research throughout India.<ref name=daniel489>Daniel, 489</ref> Tests on the [[Earth's magnetic field]]<U+2014>studied in India since the establishment of the observatory at [[Colaba]] in 1823<U+2014>and aspects of [[meteorology]] continued to yield valuable information and in 1954, [[Uttar Pradesh]] state observatory was established at the foothills of the [[Himalayas]].<ref name=daniel488/> The Rangpur Observatory was set up in 1957 at [[Osmania University]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]].<ref name=daniel488/> Both these facilities enjoyed the technical support and scientific cooperation of the United States of America.<ref name=daniel488/> Space research was further encouraged by the technically inclined [[prime minister of India]]<U+2014>[[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=daniel489/> In 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] successfully launched [[Sputnik]] and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launch.<ref name=daniel489/> The [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]] (INCOSPAR) was found in 1962 with Vikram Sarabhai as its chairman.

==Goals and objectives==
The prime objective of ISRO is to develop space technology and its application to various national tasks.<ref name=isro_aboutus/> The Indian space programme was driven by the vision of [[Vikram Sarabhai|Dr Vikram Sarabhai]], considered the father of Indian Space Programme.<ref name="Burleson136">Burleson, 136</ref> As stated by him in 1969:
'''{{cquote|1=''There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To us, there is no ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight. But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society.<ref name=isro_aboutus/>''}}'''''

As also pointed out by [[APJ Kalam|Dr APJ Abdul Kalam]]:
'''{{cquote|1=''Many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation, which was finding it difficult to feed its population. Their vision was clear if Indians were to play meaningful role in the community of nations, they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real-life problems. They had no intention of using it as a means of displaying our might.''<ref name=apj_autobiography>In ''[[Wings of Fire|Wings of Fire: An Autobiography of APJ Kalam (1999)]]'', his autobiography.</ref>}}'''

India's economic progress has made its space programme more visible and active as the country aims for greater self-reliance in space technology.<ref name=newsweek1/> Hennock etc. hold that India also connects space exploration to national prestige, further stating: "This year India has launched 11 satellites, including nine from other countries<U+2014>and it became the first nation to launch 10 satellites on one rocket."<ref name=newsweek1>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/160037 Hennock etc. (2008), "The Real Space Race Is In Asia", ''Newsweek''.]</ref>
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully put into operation two major satellite systems namely Indian National Satellites (INSAT) for communication services and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for management of natural resources; also, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching IRS type of satellites and Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for launching INSAT type of satellites.
On July 2012, former president, [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] said that research by ISRO and [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]] is under way for developing cost reduction technologies for access to space.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/isro-drdo-pursuing-research-to-lessen-cost-of-access-to-space/972550/| title=ISRO, DRDO pursuing research to lessen cost of access to space | date= 10 July 2012}}</ref>

==Launch vehicle fleet==
[[Image:Indian carrier rockets.svg|thumb|Comparison of Indian carrier rockets. Left to right: [[Satellite Launch Vehicle|SLV]], [[ASLV]], [[PSLV]], [[GSLV]], [[GSLV III]].]]
Geopolitical and economic considerations during the 1960s and 1970s compelled India to initiate its own [[launch vehicle]] programme. During the first phase (1960s<U+2013>1970s) the country successfully developed a sounding rockets programme, and by the 1980s, research had yielded the Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 and the more advanced [[Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (ASLV), complete with operational supporting infrastructure.<ref name=Gupta1697>Gupta, 1697</ref> ISRO further applied its energies to the advancement of launch vehicle technology resulting in the creation of [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (PSLV) and [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV) technologies.

===Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV)===
{{Main|Satellite Launch Vehicle}}
::''Status: <span style="color:gray;">Decommissioned</font color="Grey">''
The Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually known by its abbreviation SLV or SLV-3 was a 4-stage solid-fuel light launcher.

The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually known by its abbreviation ASLV was a 5-stage solid propellant rocket with the capability of placing a 150&nbsp;kg satellite into [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]]. This project was started by the ISRO during the early 1980s to develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. Its design was based on Satellite Launch Vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/aslv.htm| title=ASLV| publisher=ISRO| accessdate = 2009-01-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071017032729/http://www.isro.org/aslv.htm |archivedate = 17 October 2007}}</ref> The first launch test was held in 1987, and after that 3 others followed in 1988, 1992 and 1994, out of which only 2 were successful, before it was decommissioned.<ref name="ISROms"/>

===Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)===
{{Main|PSLV}}
::''Status: <span style="color:Green;">Active</font color="Green">''
The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually known by its abbreviation PSLV, is an [[expendable launch system]] developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into [[sun synchronous orbit]]s, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV, commercially viable only from Russia. PSLV can also launch small satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The reliability and versatility of the PSLV is proven by the fact that it has launched 55 satellites / spacecraft ( 26 Indian and 29 Foreign Satellites) into a variety of orbits so far.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/launchvehicles/launchvehicles.aspx ISRO's Website: ISRO's Launch Vehicle]</ref><ref name="Chandrayaan_1_Launch">[http://isro.org/pressrelease/Oct22_2008.htm PSLV-C11 Successfully Launches Chandrayaan-1]</ref> In April 2008, it successfully launched 10 satellites at once, breaking a world record held by Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7681701.stm| title= India sets its sights on the Moon| publisher=BBC| accessdate = 2008-10-23| date = 21 October 2008| first=Sanjoy| last=Majumder}}</ref>

On 25 February 2013 the PSLV flew its 22nd consecutive successful launch mission.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/pslvc20-puts-saral-6-other-satellites-in-precise-orbits/article4452165.ece|title= PSLV-C20 puts SARAL, 6 other satellites in precise orbits |accessdate=13 September 2012 |date=10 September 2012 |work= The Hindu |location=India}}</ref> Its only failure in 22 flights was its maiden voyage in September 1993, providing the rocket with a 95 percent success rate.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/launchvehicles/PSLV/pslv.aspx ISRO's Website: Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]</ref>

===Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)===
{{Main|GSLV}}
::''Status: <span style="color:Green;">Active</font color="Green">''
The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually known by its abbreviation GSLV, is an expendable launch system developed to enable India to launch its [[Indian National Satellite System|INSAT]]-type satellites into geostationary orbit and to make India less dependent on foreign rockets. At present, it is ISRO's heaviest satellite launch vehicle and is capable of putting a total payload of up to 5 tons to Low Earth Orbit.  The vehicle is built by India with the cryogenic engine purchased from Russia while the ISRO develops its own engine programme.

In a setback for ISRO, the latest attempt to launch the GSLV, GSLV-F06 carrying GSAT-5P, failed on 25 December 2010. The initial evaluation implies that loss of control for the strap-on boosters caused the rocket to veer from its intended flight path, forcing a programmed detonation. Sixty-four seconds into the first stage of flight, the rocket began to break up due to the acute angle of attack. The body housing the 3rd stage, the cryogenic stage, incurred structural damage, forcing the range safety team to initiate a programmed detonation of the rocket.<ref name=dec25failure>{{cite news|title=Indian space programme hit by another launch mishap|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1012/25gslv/|newspaper=SpaceFlightNow|date=25 December 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:Insat-1B.jpg|thumb|INSAT-1B.]]

India's first satellite, the [[Aryabhata (satellite)|Aryabhata]], was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] on 19 April 1975 from [[Kapustin Yar]] using a [[Cosmos-3M]] launch vehicle. This was followed by the Rohini series of experimental satellites which were built and launched indigenously. At present, ISRO operates a large number of earth observation satellites.

===The INSAT series===

{{Main|Indian National Satellite System}}

INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology and search-and-rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is a joint venture of the Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, [[India Meteorological Department]], [[All India Radio]] and [[Doordarshan]]. The overall coordination and management of INSAT system rests with the Secretary-level INSAT Coordination Committee.

===The IRS series===
{{Main|Indian Remote Sensing satellite}}
Indian Remote Sensing satellites (IRS) are a series of earth observation satellites, built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar [[sun-synchronous orbit]] and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 ([[IRS-1A|A]],B, [[IRS-1C|C]], [[IRS-1D|D]]) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, Resource Sat.

===Radar Imaging Satellites===

ISRO currently operates two [[RISAT|Radar Imaging Satellites]].[[RISAT-1]] was launched from Sriharikota Spaceport on 26 April 2012 on board a PSLV.RISAT-1 carries a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) payload, operating in a multi-polarisation and multi-resolution mode and can provide images with coarse, fine and high spatial resolutions.<ref name="ndtv">{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/isro-successfully-launches-spy-satellite-risat-1-202464?pfrom=home-otherstorieso|title='ISRO successfully launches 'spy satellite' RISAT-1'|date=26 April 2012|publisher=ndtv}}</ref> India also operates [[RISAT-2]] which was launched in 2009 and acquired from Israel at a cost $110 million.<ref name="ndtv"/>

It remained in orbit for 12 days before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and splashing down into the Bay of Bengal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2007/01/24/stories/2007012404431200.htm |title=The Hindu : Opinion / Letters to the Editor : Well done ISRO |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=24 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}</ref>
The SRE-1 was designed to demonstrate the capability to recover an orbiting space capsule, and the technology for performing experiments in the microgravity conditions of an orbiting platform. It was also intended to test thermal protection, navigation, guidance, control, deceleration and flotation systems, as well as study hypersonic aero-thermodynamics, management of communication blackouts, and recovery operations.
ISRO also plans to launch SRE-2 and SRE-3 in the near future to test advanced re-entry technology for future manned missions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/uop-part-of-isros-bio-experiment-in-space/447572/ |title=UoP part of ISRO's bio experiment in space |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}</ref>

===Astronaut training and other facilities===
ISRO will set up an astronaut training centre in [[Bangalore]]  to prepare personnel for flights on board the crewed vehicle. The centre will use simulation facilities to train the selected astronauts in rescue and recovery operations and survival in [[zero gravity]], and will undertake studies of the radiation environment of space.
ISRO will build [[High-G training|centrifuges]] to prepare astronauts for the acceleration phase of the mission. It also plans to build a new Launch pad to meet the target of launching a manned space mission in 7 years of funding clearance. This would be the third launchpad at the [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]], Sriharikota.

==Planetary sciences and astronomy==
India's space era dawned when the first two-stage sounding rocket was launched from [[Thumba]] in 1963. Even before this, noteworthy contributions were made by the Indian scientists in the following areas of space science research:
* Cosmic rays and high energy astronomy using both ground based as well as balloon borne experiments/studies such as neutron/meson monitors, [[Geiger<U+2013>M<U+00FC>ller tube|Geiger Muller particle detector]]s/counters etc.
* Ionospheric research using ground based radio propagation techniques such as [[ionosonde]], VLF/HF/VHF radio probing, a chain of magnetometer stations etc.
*Upper atmospheric research using ground based optical techniques such as [[Dobson spectrometer]]s for measurement of total ozone content, air glow photometers etc.
*Indian astronomers have been carrying out major investigations using a number of ground based optical and radio telescopes with varying sophistication.

With the advent of the Indian space programme, emphasis was laid on indigenous, self-reliant and state-of-the-art development of technology for immediate practical applications in the fields of space science research activities in the country.

There is a national balloon launching facility at [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] jointly supported by [[TIFR]] and ISRO. This facility has been extensively used for carrying out research in high energy (i.e., X- and gamma ray) astronomy, IR astronomy, middle atmospheric trace constituents including CFCs & aerosols, ionisation, electric conductivity and electric fields.

The flux of secondary particles and [[X-ray]] and gamma-rays of atmospheric origin produced by the interaction of the cosmic rays is very low. This low background, in the presence of which one has to detect the feeble signal from cosmic sources is a major advantage in conducting hard X-ray observations from India. The second advantage is that many bright sources like [[Cyg X-1]], [[Crab Nebula]], [[Scorpius X-1]] and Galactic Centre sources are observable from Hyderabad due to their favourable declination. With these considerations, an [[X-ray astronomy]] group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an orientable [[X-ray telescope]] for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources including Scorpius X-1, [[Cygnus X-1|Cyg X-1]], [[Her X-1]] etc. and the [[Diffuse X-ray background|diffuse cosmic X-ray background]] were studied. Many new and astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/space_science/images/BalloonXrayStudies.htm ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

One of most important achievements of ISRO in this field was the discovery of three species of bacteria in the upper stratosphere at an altitude of between 20<U+2013>40&nbsp;km. The bacteria, highly resistant to [[ultra-violet radiation]], are not found elsewhere on Earth, leading to speculation on whether they are extraterrestrial in origin. These three bacteria can be considered to be [[extremophile]]s. Until then, the upper stratosphere was believed to be inhospitable because of the high doses of ultra-violet radiation. The bacteria were named as Bacillus isronensis in recognition of ISRO's contribution in the balloon experiments, which led to its discovery, Bacillus aryabhata after India's celebrated ancient astronomer [[Aryabhata]] and Janibacter Hoylei after the distinguished astrophysicist [[Fred Hoyle]].<ref>[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14871264&?vsv=TopHP1 ISRO finds <U+2018>alien<U+2019> life in upper atmosphere]</ref>

====Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD)====
As a first step towards realising a Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) fully re-usable launch vehicle, a series of technology demonstration missions have been conceived. For this purpose a Winged Reusable Launch Vehicle technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) has been configured. The RLV-TD will act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies viz., hypersonic flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and hypersonic flight using air-breathing propulsion. First in the series of demonstration trials is the hypersonic flight experiment (HEX).

===Extraterrestrial Exploration===
India's first mission beyond Earth's orbit was [[Chandrayaan-1]]. ISRO plans to follow up [[Chandrayaan-2]] with unmanned missions to [[Mars]], [[Venus]] and [[Near-Earth object]]s such as asteroids and comets.

====Lunar exploration====
{{Main|Chandrayaan-1}}
Chandrayaan-1 is India's first mission to the moon. The unmanned lunar exploration mission includes a lunar orbiter and an impactor called the [[Moon Impact Probe]]. India launched the spacecraft using a modified version of the [[PSLV]] is C11 on 22 October 2008 from [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]], Sriharikota. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. It carries high-resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over its two-year operational period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain [[lunar ice|ice]]. The lunar mission carries five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other international space agencies including [[NASA]], [[ESA]], and the [[Bulgarian Aerospace Agency]], which were carried free of cost. The Chandrayaan-1 became the first lunar mission to discover existence of water on the moon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/30/stories/2009083060730100.htm|title=<U+2018>Mission definitely over<U+2019>|date=30 August 2009|publisher=The Hindu|work=90<U+2013>95% of the job done|accessdate=2009-08-29|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>

* Following the success of [[Chandrayaan-1]], the country's first moon mission, ISRO is planning a series of further lunar missions in the next decade, including a manned mission which is stated to take place in 2020 <U+2013> approximately the same time as the [[China National Space Administration]] (CNSA) manned lunar mission and [[NASA]]'s [[Project Constellation]] plans to return to the moon with its Orion-Altair project.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

ISRO will have the prime responsibility for the Orbiter and Rover; Roskosmos, Russia will be responsible for Lander. Chandrayaan-2 will be launched on India<U+2019>s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-MkII) around 2012<U+2013>13 timeframe. The science goals of the mission are to further improve the understanding of the origin and evolution of the Moon using instruments onboard Orbiter and in-situ analysis of lunar samples using Lander and Rover.

====Mars orbiter mission====

===Space science missions===
'''[[Space Capsule Recovery Experiment II]]'''
The main objective of SRE II is to realise a fully recoverable capsule and provide a platform to conduct microgravity experiments on Micro-biology, Agriculture, Powder Metallurgy, etc. SRE-2 is proposed to be launched on board PSLV.

'''[[Aditya (spacecraft)]]'''
The First Indian space based Solar Coronagraph to study solar Corona in visible and near IR bands. Launch of the Aditya mission is planned during the next high solar activity period ~ 2012 but has been postponed to 2015<U+2013>2016 due to the extensive work involved in the fabrication and other technical aspects . The main objectives is to study the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and consequently the crucial physical parameters for space weather such as the coronal magnetic field structures, evolution of the coronal magnetic field etc. This will provide completely new information on the velocity fields and their variability in the inner corona having an important bearing on the unsolved problem of heating of the corona would be obtained.

===Satellite navigation===

====GAGAN====
{{main|GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation}}
The Ministry of Civil Aviation has decided to implement an indigenous Satellite-Based Regional GPS Augmentation System also known as Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) as part of the Satellite-Based Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS)/Air Traffic Management (ATM) plan for civil aviation. The Indian SBAS system has been given an acronym GAGAN <U+2013> GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation. A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of Technology Demonstration System (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept has been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Centre (MCC) located near Bangalore.

The first GAGAN navigation payload has been fabricated and it was proposed to be flown on GSAT-4 during Apr 2010. However, GSAT-4 was not placed in orbit as GSLV-D3 could not complete the mission. Two more GAGAN payloads will be subsequently flown, one each on two geostationary satellites, GSAT-8 and GSAT-10. On 12 May 2012, ISRO announced the successful testing of its indigenous cryogenic engine for 200 seconds for its forthcoming GSLV-D5 flight.<ref>{{cite news|title=Isro successfully tests indigenous cryogenic engine|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Chennai/Isro-successfully-tests-indigenous-cryogenic-engine/Article1-854840.aspx|accessdate=12 May 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=12 May 2012}}</ref>

====IRNSS====
{{Main|IRNSS}}
The Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS) is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation which would be under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like [[GPS]] are not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO plans to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014.

==Applications==
India uses its satellites communication network <U+2013> one of the largest in the world <U+2013> for applications such as land management, water resources management, natural disaster forecasting, radio networking, weather forecasting, meteorological imaging and computer communication.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1738>Bhaskaranarayana, 1738<U+2013>1746</ref> Business, administrative services, and schemes such as the [[National Informatics Centre]] (NICNET) are direct beneficiaries of applied satellite technology.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhaskaranarayana, 1738</ref> Dinshaw Mistry<U+2014>on the subject of practical applications of the Indian space programme<U+2014>writes:

The INSAT-2 satellites also provide telephone links to remote areas; data transmission for organisations such as the [[National Stock Exchange of India|National Stock Exchange]]; mobile satellite service communications for private operators, railways, and road transport; and broadcast satellite services, used by India's state-owned television agency as well as commercial television channels. India's [[EDUSAT (Satellite)|EDUSAT]] (Educational Satellite), launched aboard the GSLV in 2004, was intended for adult literacy and distance learning applications in rural areas. It augmented and would eventually replace such capabilities already provided by INSAT-3B.

The IRS satellites have found applications with the Indian Natural Resource Management programme, with regional Remote Sensing Service Centres in five Indian cities, and with Remote Sensing Application Centres in twenty Indian states that use IRS images for economic development applications. These include environmental monitoring, analysing soil erosion and the impact of soil conservation measures, forestry management, determining land cover for wildlife sanctuaries, delineating groundwater potential zones, flood inundation mapping, drought monitoring, estimating crop acreage and deriving agricultural production estimates, fisheries monitoring, mining and geological applications such as surveying metal and mineral deposits, and urban planning.

India's satellites and satellite launch vehicles have had military spin-offs. While India's 93<U+2013>124-mile (150<U+2013>250&nbsp;km) range [[Prithvi missile]] is not derived from the Indian space programme, the intermediate range [[Agni missile]] is drawn from the Indian space programme's SLV-3. In its early years, when headed by Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, ISRO opposed military applications for its dual-use projects such as the SLV-3. Eventually, however, the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO)]]<U+2013>based missile programme borrowed human resources and technology from ISRO. Missile scientist [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] (elected president of India in 2002), who had headed the SLV-3 project at ISRO, moved to [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]] to direct India's missile programme. About a dozen scientists accompanied Abdul Kalam from ISRO to [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]], where Abdul Kalam designed the Agni missile using the SLV-3's solidfuel first stage and a liquid-fuel (Prithvi-missile-derived) second stage. The IRS and INSAT satellites were primarily intended and used for civilian-economic applications, but they also offered military spin-offs. In 1996 New Delhi's Ministry of Defence temporarily blocked the use of [[IRS-1C]] by India's environmental and agricultural ministries in order to monitor ballistic missiles near India's borders. In 1997 the [[Indian air force]]<U+2019>s "Airpower Doctrine" aspired to use space assets for surveillance and battle management.<ref name=mistry94>Mistry, 94<U+2013>95</ref>

Institutions like the [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]] (IGNOU) and the [[Indian Institute of Technology]] use satellites for scholarly applications.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744>Bhaskaranarayana, 1744</ref> Between 1975 and 1976, India conducted its largest sociological programme using space technology, reaching 2400 villages through video programming in local languages aimed at educational development via [[ATS-6]] technology developed by NASA.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1737>Bhaskaranarayana, 1737</ref> This experiment<U+2014>named [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]] (SITE)<U+2014>conducted large scale video broadcasts resulting in significant improvement in rural education.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1737/>

ISRO has applied its technology to "telemedicine", directly connecting patients in rural areas to medical professionals in urban locations via satellites.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> Since high-quality healthcare is not universally available in some of the remote areas of India, the patients in remote areas are diagnosed and analysed by doctors in urban centres in real time via [[video conferencing]].<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> The patient is then advised medicine and treatment.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> The patient is then treated by the staff at one of the 'super-specialty hospitals' under instructions from the doctor.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> Mobile telemedicine vans are also deployed to visit locations in far-flung areas and provide diagnosis and support to patients.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/>

ISRO has also helped implement India's Biodiversity Information System, completed in October 2002.<ref name=sen490/> Nirupa Sen details the programme: "Based on intensive field sampling and mapping using satellite remote sensing and geospatial modelling tools, maps have been made of vegetation cover on a 1 : 250,000 scale. This has been put together in a web-enabled database which links gene-level information of plant species with spatial information in a BIOSPEC database of the ecological hot spot regions, namely [[North-East India|northeastern India]], [[Western Ghats]], [[Himalayas|Western Himalayas]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. This has been made possible with collaboration between the Department of Biotechnology and ISRO."<ref name=sen490>Sen, 490</ref>

The Indian IRS-P5 ([[CARTOSAT-1]]) was equipped with high-resolution panchromatic equipment to enable it for cartographic purposes.<ref name="Burleson136" /> IRS-P5 (CARTOSAT-1) was followed by a more advanced model named IRS-P6 developed also for agricultural applications.<ref name=Burleson136/> The [[CARTOSAT-2]] project, equipped with single panchromatic camera which supported scene-specific on-spot images, succeed the CARTOSAT-1 project.<ref name=Burleson143>Burleson, 143</ref>

==Global cooperation==
ISRO has had the benefit of International cooperation since inception.
* Establishment of [[TERLS]], conduct of SITE & STEP, launches of [[Aryabhata]], [[Bhaskara Satellite series|Bhaskara]], APPLE, IRS-IA and IRS-IB/ satellites, manned space mission, etc. involved international cooperation.
* ISRO operates LUT/MCC under the international COSPAS/SARSAT Programme for Search and Rescue.
* India has established a Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTE-AP) that is sponsored by the United Nations.
* India hosted the Second UN-ESCAP Ministerial Conference on Space Applications for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific in November 1999.
*India is a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, [[Cospas-Sarsat]], [[International Astronautical Federation]], [[COSPAR|Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR), [[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee]] (IADC), [[International Space University]], and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS).<ref name=Suri&Rajaram447>"Space Research", ''Science and Technology in India'' edited by R.K. Suri and Kalapana Rajaram, 447.</ref>
* [[Chandrayaan-1]] carried scientific payloads from [[NASA]], [[ESA]] and the [[Bulgarian Space Agency]].
* The [[Russian Space Agency]] is cooperating with India in developing the rover for [[Chandrayaan-2]] and also in the Indian manned mission.
* The United States on 24 January 2011, removed several Indian government defence-related companies, including ISRO, from the so-called Entity List, in an effort to drive hi-tech trade and forge closer strategic ties with India.<ref>{{cite news|title=US removes ISRO, DRDO from export control list|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-25/us/28363238_1_entity-list-high-technology-trade-export-control|author=Times of India|accessdate=2011-02-24|publisher=The Times of India|date=25 January 2011}}</ref>
