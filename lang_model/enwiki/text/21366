'''Mladen  Petri<U+0107>''' [{{IPA|<U+02C8>mlad<U+025B>n <U+02C8>p<U+025B><U+02D0>trit<U+0255>}}] (born 1 January 1981 in [[Dubrave]]), is a [[Croatia]]n [[association football|football]] [[striker|forward]] who plays for [[Hamburger SV]] in the [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] and is a member of the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]].

==Early life==

Born in Dubrave (inside [[Br<U+010D>ko (city)|Br<U+010D>ko]] municipality, [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Petri<U+0107> first moved with his family to [[Vinkovci]], Croatia, due to war and then later to [[Neuenhof, Switzerland|Neuenhof]], Switzerland, where he started to play football at the local club [[FC Neuenhof]] before moving to [[FC Baden]] and starting his professional career at the club in the summer of 1998. He left FC Baden after one season and went on to sign with [[Grasshopper-Club Z<U+00FC>rich|Grasshoppers Z<U+00FC>rich]] in the summer of 1999.

==Club career==
===Youth years in Switzerland===

At club level, Petri<U+0107> spent five seasons with Grasshoppers Z<U+00FC>rich before leaving the club for [[FC Basel]] in the summer of 2004 with lots of critics that are still active against him, because he burned a [[FC Basel]] scarf during the Swiss Champion celebration of Grasshoppers Z<U+00FC>rich almost exactly one year before leaving Grasshoppers, for a transfer fee of three million [[euro]]s and signing a four-year contract until June 2008. Playing for Grasshoppers, he made a total of 114 [[Swiss Super League|domestic league]] appearances and scored 30 goals for the club in the league.

Petri<U+0107> was the fourth best goalscorer of the Swiss Super League for the 2005<U+2013>06 season, scoring 15 goals in 31 matches. In the same season, he also appeared for FC Basel in all of their 12 [[UEFA Cup]] matches and managed to score three goals before the club was eliminated by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the quarterfinals of the competition. He continued to perform well for FC Basel in the 2006<U+2013>07 season of the Swiss Super League. In their first-round UEFA Cup game that year, he netted a brace in a 6-2 home victory over [[FK Rabotni<U+010D>ki|Rabotni<U+010D>ki Kometal]].

In the final moments of FC Basel's UEFA Cup group-stage match versus [[AS Nancy-Lorraine]] on November 23, 2006, Petri<U+0107> was installed in goal after Basel's keeper [[Franco Costanzo]] was sent off for a foul on Nancy's [[Issiar Dia]] and the team had already made all three substitutions. The foul resulted in a penalty kick that gave Nancy the final chance for an away victory, but Petri<U+0107> was able to make an amazing save and stopped the penalty kick taken by [[Micka<U+00EB>l Chr<U+00E9>tien]], helping his team to drive home one point with a 2-2 draw.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UWYPQDwO3I YouTube video of Petri<U+0107>'s penalty save] (commentary in Swiss German)</ref> 

He ended the [[Swiss Super League 2006/07]] as the top goalscorer, with 19 goals for FC Basel.

===Borussia Dortmund=== 

On 11 June 2007 Petri<U+0107> signed for [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] team [[Borussia Dortmund]] along with fellow national team player [[Robert Kova<U+010D>]] as part of the sides squad rebuilding. While originally being intended to act as a playmaker behind the forwards in a [[Formation (football)#4-4-2_diamond_or_4-1-2-1-2|4-4-2 diamond]] system, it quickly turned out that he was more effective as a striker up front. He enjoyed a good start to the season, scoring a brace in Dortmund's 3-0 victory against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. He was one of the league's top scorers in his first season in Germany, and also made a notable assistance to his side reaching the [[DFB-Pokal]] final in which he scored a stoppage time equalizer against eventual winners and champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].

===Hamburger SV===

On 17 August 2008, Petri<U+0107>'s transfer from Dortmund to [[Hamburger SV]] was confirmed by both clubs' official websites as part of a deal that also saw [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian international]] [[Mohamed Zidan]] moving in the opposite direction, with both players signing four-year contracts.<ref>{{cite news

Petri<U+0107> made his Bundesliga debut for Hamburg on 23 August 2008 in their 2-1 win at home to [[Karlsruher SC]], coming on as a substitute for [[Jonathan Pitroipa]] in the 73rd minute. He scored his first goal for the club on September 13, 2008, netting the winner in their 3-2 win against [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]. In three consecutive matches in late September and early October 2008, Petri<U+0107> scored all five goals in Hamburg's 2-0 victories over [[VfL Bochum]] in the German Cup and [[FC Unirea Voluntari Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] as well as their 1-0 victory over [[Borussia M<U+00F6>nchengladbach]] in the Bundesliga. On 5 October 2008, he netted a last-minute winner in Hamburg's 2-1 away victory at [[FC Energie Cottbus]] to keep them top of the Bundesliga table.

==International career==

In 2001, Petri<U+0107> was spotted in Switzerland by [[Mirko Jozi<U+0107>]], head coach of the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]] at the time, and made his international debut for Croatia during the team's South Korean tour in November 2001, where they played two friendly matches against the [[Korea Republic national football team|Korean national team]]. Petri<U+0107> appeared in both of the two matches as a second-half substitute, but was subsequently nevertheless not called up to be part of the Croatian squad at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] finals. He scored his first goal for Croatia in their friendly match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 21 August 2002 in [[Vara<U+017E>din]], which ended in a 1-1 draw. He subsequently made his competitive international debut as a second-half substitute in Croatia's opening match of the [[2004 European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] qualifying against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], but did not play any international matches at the A-team level for three and half years following this match.

In early 2006, Petri<U+0107> made his international comeback with the Croatian national team by appearing as a second-half substitute in the team's friendly matches against Korea Republic at the [[Carlsberg Cup]] in Hong Kong and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in [[Basel]]. He was eventually omitted from the final 23-man squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] finals, but received a pre-invitation. 

In early August 2006, he was called up by the Croatian national team's new coach [[Slaven Bili<U+0107>]] to be part of the team in their friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 16 August 2006 in [[Livorno]] and appeared in the match as a second-half substitute. He was an active member with his national side in their [[2008 European Football Championship|Euro 2008]] qualifying campaign, appearing in almost all of the team's qualifying matches. In the second qualifier, against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] on 7 October 2006 in [[Zagreb]], he scored four goals in only 60 minutes of playing and became the first ever player to score four goals for the Croatian national football team in a competitive match. Croatia won the match 7-0, celebrating their highest competitive victory ever.
In the return leg against Andorra on 12 September 2007, he scored twice.
On 21 November the last day of [[Euro 2008]] Qualifiers, Petri<U+0107> was brought on as a substitute in the away fixture against England. With Croatia already qualified and the match tied at 2-2, Petri<U+0107> scored the winning goal from about 25 yards to send England out of [[Euro 2008]]. It was England's first competitive defeat at the [[Wembley Stadium|New Wembley]]. After the match, he refused to swap his jersey, going on to say "this is the proudest moment of my career. I didn't want to swap this jersey for anything". 

Because of his impressive qualifying campaign, he was named in Croatia's [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] squad. Croatia won their first round group, winning all their matches, including a surprise win over a strong [[Germany national football team|German side]], but were knocked out by [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in the quarter-finals after a penalty shootout.
