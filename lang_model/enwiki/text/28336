"'''Don't Stop the Music'''" is a song by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]] recorded for her third studio album ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007). It was written by Tawanna Dabney, [[Michael Jackson]], [[Mikkel S. Eriksen]] and [[Tor Erik Hermansen]] with its  production helmed by the latter two under their stage-name [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]]. The song was released as the album's fourth single on September 7, 2007 worldwide. "Don't Stop the Music" is a [[Dance music|dance]]-[[Pop music|pop]] and [[Techno music|techno]] song that features a wide variety of rhythmic devices used mainly in [[hip hop music]]. The song samples the line, "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" which is taken from Jackson's 1983 single "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]". For using the line, both Rihanna and Jackson faced a lawsuit from the Cameroonian musician [[Manu Dibango]], who claimed that the hook is originally from his 1972 song "[[Soul Makossa]]".

"Don't Stop the Music" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics with many of them praising the interpolation of the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" hook into the song. It was nominated for several accolades, eventually winning the award for Best International Song at the [[2008 NRJ Music Awards]]. "Don't Stop the Music" was commercial success, reaching number-one in over ten countries worldwide including Australia, Austria, France, Germany and Switzerland. The single peaked at number three on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and at number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. The song was certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for selling more than 3 million copies in the US.

[[Anthony Mandler]] shot the accompanying music video for the song in [[Prague]], the [[Czech Republic]]. It features Rihanna together with two of her friends sneaking into the back of a candy store where there is a secret club. Other scenes include Rihanna partying with the people in the club. Since its release, "Don't Stop the Music" has become a staple in Rihanna's live performances. It was part of the [[set list]]s of her three major tours, [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour|Good Girl Gone Bad]] (2007<U+2013>09), [[Last Girl on Earth Tour|Last Girl on Earth]] (2010<U+2013>11) and the [[Loud Tour]] (2011). English recording artist [[Jamie Cullum]] recorded a jazz version of the song for his 2009 studio album ''[[The Pursuit (album)|The Pursuit]]''.

==Background and release==
[[File:Manu dibango1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pictured Cameroonian musician [[Manu Dibango]] sued both Rihanna and Michael Jackson for using the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" line, without his permission.
