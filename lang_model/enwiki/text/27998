The '''J. Willard and Alice Sheets Marriott School of Management''' (MSM) is a [[business school]] located in [[Provo, Utah]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), a private university in the United States of America owned by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Going by several different names since its inception in 1891, the business school at BYU has been known as the Marriott School of Management since 1988, when [[Marriott International]] founders [[J. Willard Marriott|J. Willard]] and [[Alice Marriott]] made a $15 million donation to the school. The MSM is housed on-campus in the [[N. Eldon Tanner Building]] and offers four undergraduate and seven graduate degrees.

Ethical decision-making is strongly emphasized at the school: undergraduate students are required to complete 14 hours of religion coursework for graduation, all MSM students must take at least one course in management [[ethics]], and both students and faculty must commit to abide by the [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|university's honor code]]. The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty bodies are members of the LDS Church.

Many MSM students obtain a level of foreign language proficiency while serving as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]]. (Seventy-five percent of the student body is [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], while 30 percent is [[Multilingualism|trilingual]].) Consequently, the Marriott School sponsors high-proficiency business language courses in 11 languages.{{cn|date=August 2012}} The school claims over 44,000 alumni and is accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].

==History==
In 1891, Brigham Young Academy, the predecessor to BYU, formed the ''Commercial College'', which offered coursework in business education. A decade later (1901), the college began offering its first four-year degree program.<ref name="Lucky7">{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/marriottmag/fall09/features/feature05.cfm |title=Lucky Number Seven |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=''Marriott Magazine'' |accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref> After Brigham Young Academy was separated into [[Brigham Young High School]] and Brigham Young University in 1903,<ref name="byhigh">{{cite web |url=http://www.byhigh.org/History/HistoryDecades/From1903to1920.html |title=Brigham Young High School History |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Brigham Young High School |accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref> the college was renamed the ''College of Commerce and Business Administration'' as part of the university. The next decade was tough for the college, as "BYU struggled through the [[World War I]], a [[flu epidemic]] [that] closed the school during the fall term of 1918, and school indebtedness that resulted in the 1918 LDS purchase of both BYU's assets and debts."<ref name="Old history">{{cite book |title=International Dictionary of University Histories |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Carol J.

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] significantly depleted LDS Church funds, which caused the church to consider closing BYU. However, "the transference of a number of church junior colleges allowed BYU to remain in operation."<ref name="Old history"/> By 1935 the church regained its financial footing and provided more aid to BYU, the school growing slowly over the next ten years. The business college subsequently began offering master's degrees in 1939;<ref name="Lucky7"/> however, the programs were hit hard beginning in 1941 when its enrollment (particularly that of men) dropped due to U.S. involvement in [[World War II]].<ref name="Old history"/> But later that decade, U.S. military veterans returned to school, and in 1945 enrollment doubled. William F. Edwards oversaw the college's growth over the next several years until 1957,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/BYUPhotos&CISOPTR=640&CISOBOX=1&REC=17 |title=William F.

[[File:MaeserBuilding.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A granite building with a pillared facade.|The [[Maeser Building]] housed the business school from 1921-60.]]
A [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program was added in 1961, and the school formed its National Advisory Council in 1966. In 1973, the school bestowed its first International Executive of the Year Award to [[AT&T]] President [[Robert D. Lilley]].<ref name="Lucky7"/> Bruce B. Orton served as interim dean of the school for a year until 1975, when [[Merrill J. Bateman]] was recruited from a management position at candy-maker [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars, Inc.]] for the job as dean. That same year, the school was separated into the ''School of Management'' for undergraduate studies and the ''Graduate School of Management'', which grouped together the MBA, [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]], [[M.O.B.|MOB]], and [[MAcc]] programs.<ref name="Lucky7"/> A year later (1976), the business school created a [[BYU School of Accountancy|School of Accountancy]] within its jurisdiction and printed its first issue of ''Exchange'' magazine (now ''Marriott Alumni Magazine''). In 1977, the BYU Management Society was organized.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mgtsoc/members/chapter_webpage.cfm?chapter_id=39 |title=BYU Management Society |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BYU Management Society |accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref>

In 1979, [[William G.

Two years later (1986), the International Student Sponsor Program was started, which continues to provide financial assistance to married LDS international students to this day.

In 1989, [[K. Fred Skousen]] became dean of the school. In that year, the school's endowment exceeded $10 million, and the school was awarded a Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) grant by the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. In 1993, the Organizational Leadership and Strategy Department was created, and a year later the school instituted a limited-enrollment policy. Also in 1994, the school began offering a minor in management. By 1998, the school's endowment had reached $40 million and the Institute of Public Management was renamed in honor of [[George W. Romney]], who during his lifetime served as [[Chairman]] of [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]], [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], and [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]]. That same year, [[Ned C. Hill]] was named dean of the Marriott School.<ref name="Lucky7"/>

The school's Center for Economic Self-Reliance (CESR) was formed in 2003,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/72109/ |title=BYU conference centered around movement dedicated to creating jobs, fighting poverty |publisher= ''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]'' | first = Stephen | last = Chapek | date=2003-03-14 |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> and the Information Systems Department was created in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/news/release.cfm?id=241 |title=School of Accountancy and Information Systems Separate |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=Marriott School}}</ref> That same year the CESR also participated in the production of the [[microcredit]] documentary ''Small Fortunes'', which aired nationwide on October 27, 2005, on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/kbyu/smallfortunes/ |title=Small Fortunes |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |work=PBS Feature Programming }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/news/release.cfm?id=250 |title=Microcredit Documentary to Air Nationwide October 27 on Public Television |date=2005-10-24 |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=Marriott School}}</ref> In 2006 the school's worldwide initiatives were organized under the Kay and Yvonne Whitmore Global Management Center, named for former [[Kodak]] [[CEO]] [[Kay Whitmore]] and his wife.<ref name="urlGlobal Management">{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/enewsline/archive_print/vol5-issue3.pdf |title=BYU Names Global Management Center for former Eastman Kodak Chief Executive |date=2006-02-22 |publisher=[[The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] |work=AACSB eNewsline |accessdate=2008-05-01|format=PDF}}</ref>

In 2006, members of the school's faculty were involved in controversy surrounding the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries]]. On October 9, Dean Hill and Associate Dean W. Steve Albrecht sent an e-mail to 50 BYU Management Society members and 100 members of the school's National Advisory Council asking them to support [[Mitt Romney]]'s bid for the U.S. presidency. Hill and Albrecht signed the message with their official BYU titles, sent the e-mail from a BYU e-mail address, and began the message "Dear Marriott School Friend." Both the LDS Church and BYU, as [[tax-exempt]], [[nonprofit organizations]], are [[Campaign finance in the United States#Corporate and union activity|prohibited by federal law]] from endorsing a particular candidate or political party. Albrecht said that he should not have sent it in his capacity as a BYU dean: "It wasn't something BYU did, it wasn't something I probably should have done, and it was bad judgment."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/19/romney_camp_consulted_with_mormon_leaders/?page=1 |title=Romney camp consulted with Mormon leaders |accessdate=2008-08-06 |last=Helman |first=Scott  |date=2006-10-19  |publisher=''[[Boston Globe]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/political_neutrality_the_lds_romney_connection_it_may_all_be_innocent_but_i/C104/L104/ |title="Political Neutrality" The LDS-Romney Connection: It may all be innocent, but it sure looks bad |accessdate=2008-08-06 |last=Seigal |first=Amy |coauthors= |date=2006-10-25 |work= |publisher=''[http://www.newwest.net/saltlakecity/ New West]''}}</ref>

The Marriott School is located on the campus of [[Brigham Young University]], which is situated in the urban, [[Wasatch Front]] area of [[Provo, Utah]]. The school is principally housed inside the [[N. Eldon Tanner Building]] (TNRB). At the building's construction announcement in 1980, university President [[Dallin H.

As part of the larger institution of BYU, the Marriott School is ultimately administered by [[List of presidents of Brigham Young University|BYU's President]] and Board of Trustees. Under them, the school is directly managed by a Dean (currently [[Gary C.

Faculty are grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": accounting, business management (including business law, management communication, managerial economics, marketing, and supply-chain management), finance, information systems, organizational leadership and strategy, public management, and recreation management and youth leadership. The school is also home to four research centers that organize research in different fields of business administration and establish liaisons between the Marriott School and the corporate world. Both undergraduate and graduate students may be invited to work as [[teaching assistant|teaching]] and [[research assistant]]s, and some MAcc students teach accounting classes during the spring or summer terms, as well as at the [[Brigham_Young_University_campus#BYU_Salt_Lake_Center|BYU's Salt Lake Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ce.byu.edu/sl/ |title=BYU Salt Lake Center |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]}}</ref> However, research productivity is hampered by the fact that the MSM has no doctoral programs, and therefore, no doctoral students focused on research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/98/next25/comments14.htm |title=MSM Profile |accessdate=2010-01-20 |year=1998 |publisher=''[[BusinessWeek]]''}}</ref> The MSM faculty was ranked #64 nationally and #71 globally in 2008 for its research productivity in the ''[[University of Texas at Dallas|UTD]] Top 100 Business School Research Ranking''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://som.utdallas.edu/top100Ranking/ |title=UTD Top 100 Business School Research Ranking |accessdate=2010-01-20 |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Texas at Dallas]]}}</ref>

Matriculation into the Marriott School as an undergraduate requires an application independent from normal acceptance to BYU. Once in the program, students go through a one-semester "core" where students in the block are in the same classes together as teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/management/core.cfm |title=Management Integrated Core Program |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=Marriott School}}</ref> All undergraduates must also complete a one-semester mentoring program where each student selects a Marriott School alumnus to converse with over the course of the semester.<ref name="MarriottFacts"/> The MSM's class schedules mirror those of the university: two 16-week semesters (fall and winter) and two terms over the summer break (spring and summer). Students must carry 12 credit hours in order to be considered a full-time student, and 18 credit hours is the maximum unless permission is granted to take more.

About 70% of student [[tuition]] is funded by LDS Church [[tithe|tithing]] funds, making tuition less expensive for church members than at similar private universities.

Some are program-specific, others are need-based. The ''Hawes Scholars'' program is the highest scholarship distinction given to MBA students at the school.

The Marriott School is one of the few colleges at BYU that requires application from undergraduate students post-matriculation to the university itself. In addition to essays and pre-baccalaureate academics, students are evaluated on performance in 13 credit hours of "pre-management" coursework at BYU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/undergrad/PreManagementGuidebook.pdf |title=Pre-Management |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=Marriott School}}</ref> For 2008, the MSM admitted 69 percent of undergraduate applicants, comprising a class of 1,783 students.<ref name="BW_Under"/>

Applicants to the MBA program are evaluated based on commitment to the mission of BYU and the LDS Church, undergraduate academic performance, [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) standardized test scores, essays, work experience, recommendations, written applications, and interviews, if applicable. For 2009, the MBA program admitted 51 percent of applicants or 478 students.

Many alumni also choose to participate in the [[BYU Management Society]], which was founded in 1977 by Dean [[Merrill J. Bateman]]. The organization is an alumni association "with inclusivity", inviting non-alumni to join as well. The fourfold mission of the society is networking, career development, supporting BYU and the Marriott School, and community service. The Society membership is now at 6,000 members in 40 U.S. cities and 10 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mgtsoc/index.cfm |title=About the Management Society |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=Marriott School}}</ref>
