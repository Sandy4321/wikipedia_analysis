'''Lewiston''', in [[Androscoggin County, Maine|Androscoggin County]], is the second-largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]]. As of the [[2000 census (USA)|2000 census]], the city's population was 35,690. It is one of two principal cities of and included within the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Metropolitan [[New England City and Town Area]] and the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (which is part of the [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]-Lewiston-[[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], Maine [[Combined Statistical Area]]).

A former industrial center, it is located in southwest Maine, at the falls of the [[Androscoggin River]], across from [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]]. Lewiston and Auburn are often thought of as a single entity and referred to as '''Lewiston-Auburn''', which is colloquially abbreviated as '''L-A''' or '''L/A''', and have a combined population of roughly 59,000 people. Lewiston is home to [[Bates College]], the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, the [[University of Southern Maine]]'s Lewiston-Auburn College, and two significant regional general hospitals: Central Maine Medical Center and Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center. 
== History ==
===Industrial Development===
Lewiston was settled in 1770 and officially incorporated in 1795. At least four houses that existed in 1795 in Lewiston have survived to the present and are currently designated "Historic Buildings" by the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1809, Michael Little built a large wooden sawmill next to the falls. Burned in 1814 by an [[arson]]ist, it was later rebuilt. In 1836, local entrepreneurs &mdash; predominantly the Little family and friends &mdash; formed the Androscoggin Falls, [[Dam]], [[canal lock|Lock]] and [[Canal]] Company.

<blockquote>"for the purpose of erecting and constructing dams, locks, canals, mills, works, machines, and buildings on their own lands and also manufacturing cotton, wool, iron, steel, and paper in the towns of Lewiston, [[Minot, Maine|Minot]], and Danville".<ref>Elder, Janus G. ''A History of Lewiston, Maine with a Genealogical Register of Early Families'' page 52.</ref></blockquote>

Later reorganized as the ''Lewiston Water Power Company'' the new sales of stock attracted Boston investors &mdash; including [[Thomas J. Hill]], [[Lyman Nichols]], [[George L. Ward]], [[Alexander De Witt]], and [[Benjamin E. Bates]] (Namesake of [[Bates College]]) &ndash; who financed a [[canal]] system and several [[textile]] [[Factory|mills]] on the Androscoggin river, beginning Lewiston's transformation from a small community into a hub of textile production. 

Lewiston's population boomed during these years. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], high demand for textiles provided Lewiston with a strong industrial base. Starting in the 1870s, [[railroad]] connections to [[Canada]] brought an influx of [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] millworkers, and the city's population has been largely Franco-American since.

The local [[Shriners|Kora Shrine]] was organized in 1891 and held its first meetings in a [[freemasonry|masonic temple]] on Lisbon street. This group would from 1908 to 1910 build the Kora Temple on Sabattus street, the largest home of a [[Fraternal and service organisations|fraternal organization]] in the state. Architect [[George M. Coombs]] would design its [[Moors|Moorish]] style structure.

City leaders decided to build a church to which the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland]] would relocate. Construction of the ''Church of Saints Peter and Paul'' began in 1905 and ended in 1938, mostly funded through thousands of small donations from Lewiston residents.

While the Diocese of Portland did not relocate to Lewiston, the church  is a prominent landmark and source of pride, and became a [[basilica]] in 2004. It is one of the few American basilicas located outside of a major metropolitan area.

===Industrial Decline===
Starting in the late 1950s, lower production costs elsewhere led to the closure of many of Lewiston's textile mills, which were the city's economic base and once produced a quarter of American textiles. Today, health care is Lewiston's largest industry. Other industries include paper manufacturing, shoe manufacturing, and tourism. [[Central Maine Medical Center]] is the city's largest employer.

=== Somali Influx ===
In 2001, approximately 1,100 [[Somalia|Somalis]] began immigrating to Lewiston from Somalia and the greater [[Atlanta]] area.

In October 2002, then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond, the son of immigrants himself, wrote an open letter addressed to leaders of the Somali community, predicting a negative impact on the city's social services and requesting that Somali leaders discourage further Somali relocation to Lewiston. The letter angered some persons and prompted some community leaders and residents to speak out against the mayor, drawing national attention. Demonstrations were held in Lewiston, both by those who supported the Somalis' presence and those who opposed it. 

In January 2003, a small group from the [[white supremacist]] [[Creativity Movement]] demonstrated in Lewiston against the Somali population, prompting a simultaneous counter-demonstration of about 4,000 people [http://www.hamzehmystiquefilms.com/theletter/] at [[Bates College]] and the organization of the "Many and One Coalition." Widespread publicity was given to the fact that the mayor chose to be out of state "on vacation" on the day of the rallies, while the governor and other dignitaries attended.

In May 2004, the City of Lewiston announced an ambitious plan for [[urban renewal]] near its downtown area. The plan, still in its formative stages, is to demolish several blocks of nineteenth-century millworker housing, lay new streets with updated infrastructure, construct more owner-occupied, lower-density housing, and build a boulevard through the neighborhood, using federal [[Community Development Block Grant]] funds provided over a period of ten years. Many residents of the affected neighborhoods felt that the plan was initially announced with very little input from them.  They formed a neighborhood group called "The Visible Community," which has been actively involved in the planning process.
