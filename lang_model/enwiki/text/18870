"'''This Charming Man'''" is a song by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smiths]], written by guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] and singer/lyricist [[Morrissey]]. It was released as the group's second [[single (music)|single]] in October 1983 on the [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The song is defined by Marr's [[jangle pop]] guitar riff and Morrissey's characteristically morose lyrics, which revolve around the recurrent Smiths themes of sexual ambiguity and lust.<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin. ''The Great Rock Discography''. Edinburg: Canongate Books, 2000. p. 901. ISBN 0-8419-5017-3</ref>

Feeling detached from and unable to relate to the early 1980s mainstream [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]], Morrissey wrote "This Charming Man" to evoke an older, more coded and self-aware underground scene. The singer explained of the song's lyrics, "I really like the idea of the male voice being quite vulnerable, of it being taken and slightly manipulated, rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody."<ref name="Snow" />

Although only moderately successful on first release<U+2014>the single peaked at number 25 on the British singles chart<U+2014>"This Charming Man" has been widely praised in both the music and mainstream press. In 2004, [[BBC Radio 2]] listeners voted it number 97 on the station's "Sold On Song Top 100" poll.<ref name=BBC>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/thischarmingman.shtml "BBC - Radio 2 - Sold On Song Top 100"].

==Background==
By early 1983, The Smiths had gained a large following on the UK live circuit and had signed a record deal with the [[Independent music|indie]] label Rough Trade. The deal, along with positive concert reviews in the weekly music press and an upcoming sessions on [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[John Peel]]'s radio show, generated a large media buzz for the band. In a music scene dominated by corporate and video-driven acts, the Smiths' [[gay|camp]] and bookish image stood out, and many expected the band to be the breakthrough act of the UK [[post punk]] movement.<ref name="Snow" /> The previous October [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] released their iconic gay track "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]", which was seen as an anthem to an [[Coming out|out]] [[alpha male]] self-assertiveness, and alien to many UK homosexuals. However, The Smiths May 1983 debut single "Hand in Glove" failed to live up to critical and commercial expectations, mostly due to its perceived low production values. When Rough Trade label mates [[Aztec Camera]] began to receive day-time national radio-play with their track "Walk out to Winter", Marr admitted to "feeling a little jealous, my competitive urges kicked in". The guitarist believed The Smiths needed an up-beat song, "in a major key", in order to gain a chart positioning that would live up to expectations.<ref name="Snow" />

Marr wrote the music to "This Charming Man" especially for the Peel session<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/images/pdfs/John_Peel_Biography.pdf John Peel Biography]" (PDF). BBC.co.uk, 2005. p. 15. Retrieved on [[22 March]] [[2008]].</ref> on the same night that he wrote "Still Ill" and "Pretty Girls Make Graves".<ref>Macone, Stuart. "The Secret History of...". ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', December 1993.</ref> Based on the Peel performance, Rough Trade label boss [[Geoff Travis]] suggested that the band release the song as a single instead of the slated release "Reel Around The Fountain", which had gathered notoriety in the press due to what were seen as lyrical references to paedophilia.<ref name="R178">Rogan 1993, p. 178.</ref><ref name="Young">Young, Rob. ''Rough Trade''. London: Black Dog Publishing, 2006. p. 102.</ref> The Smiths entered Matrix Studios in London on September 1983 to record a second studio version of the song for release as a single.<ref name="R178"/> However, the result<U+2014>known as the 'London version'<U+2014>was unsatisfactory and soon after the band travelled to [[Strawberry Studios]] in [[Stockport]] to try again. Here, they recorded the more widely heard A-side.<ref name="Goddard">Goddard 2004, p. 50</ref>

==Music and lyrics==

The lyrics of "This Charming Man" comprise a first person narrative in which the male protagonist punctures one of his bicycle's wheels on a remote hillside. A passing "charming man" in a luxury car stops to offer the cyclist a lift, and although the protagonist is at first hesitant, after much deliberation he accepts the offer. While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: "I would go out tonight, but I haven't go a stitch to wear". The cyclist eventually submits to the motorist's advances with the qualifier: "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care".<ref name="Snow" />

Morrissey deliberately used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for "This Charming Man". His use of phrases and words such as 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, in the words of the music critic Mat Snow "nothing to do with fashion".<ref name="Snow" /> Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title<U+2014>in "Handsome Devil", the B-side to "Hand in Glove"<U+2014>and observed in a 1983 interview with [[Barney Hoskyns]] that he used the word to "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery."<ref name="Snow" /> Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: "I hate this 'festive [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]' thing...People listen to "This Charming Man" and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way."<ref name="Snow"/>

As with many of Morrissey's compositions, the song's lyrics features dialog borrowed from a cult film. The line "A jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place" is borrowed from the 1972 film adaptation of [[Anthony Shaffer]]'s 1970 homoerotic play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'', in which [[Laurence Olivier]] plays a [[cuckold]]ed author to [[Michael Caine]]'s '[[Trade (gay slang)|bit of rough]]'.<ref name="Goddard"/><ref name="Snow"/>

Both studio versions begin with a introductory guitar [[riff]], joined by the rhythm section. Morrissey's vocals are first heard eight seconds into the track. His vocal melodies are [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]], and consciously avoid [[Blues music|blues]] inflections.<ref name=Rooksby>Rooksby, Rikky. ''Inside Classic Rock Tracks''. Backbeat Books, September 2001. p. 107. ISBN 0-87930-654-8</ref> The [[refrain|chorus]] is played twice; the first time it is followed by a brief pause, the second by the closing of the song. The [[rhythm section]] of [[Andy Rourke|Rourke]] and [[Mike Joyce|Joyce]] provide a beat more danceable than usual for a Smiths track. The drums were originally programmed on a [[Linn LM-1|Linn Drum Computer]], under the direction of producer [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]]. Porter used the programme to trigger the sampled sounds of the live drum kit, featuring a [[Motown]]esque [[bassline]].<ref name=Mulholland>Mulholland, Garry. ''This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk and Disco''. Cassell, 2002. ISBN 0-304-36186-0.</ref> Marr's guitar part consists of single notes of thirds as opposed to strummed [[bar chords]], and his guitar serves to creates a [[counter-melody]] throughout the song. Marr overdubbed numerous guitar parts onto the song,<ref name=Rooksby/> and in a December 1993 interview, told ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine:

:I'll try any trick. With the Smiths, I'd take this really loud [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] of mine, lay it on top of a Fender Twin Reverb with the [[vibrato]] on, and tune it to an open chord. Then I'd drop a knife with a metal handle on it, hitting random strings. I used it on "This Charming Man", buried beneath about 15 tracks of guitar ... [it] was the first record where I used those [[highlife]]-sounding runs in 3rds. I'm tuned up to F# and I finger it in G, so it comes out in A. There are about 15 tracks of guitar. People thought the main guitar part was a [[Rickenbacker]], but it's really a '54 Tele. There are three tracks of [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]], a backwards guitar with a really long reverb, and the effect of dropping knives on the guitar <U+2013> that comes in at the end of the chorus.<ref>Gore, Joe.

==Reception==

On release, the song received near unanimous critical praise. [[Paul Morley]] of the ''[[NME]]'' wrote, ""This Charming Man" is an accessible bliss, and seriously moving. This group fully understand that the casual is not enough... This is one of the greatest singles of the year, a poor compliment. Unique and indispensable, like '[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]' and '[[Karma Chameleon]]' - that's better!"<ref>Morley, Paul. "This Charming Man". ''[[NME]]'', [[12 November]] [[1983]].</ref> A contemporary review in ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' asked, "Where has all the wildness and daring got to? Some of it has found its way onto The Smiths' record, "This Charming Man". It jangles and crashes and Morrissey jumps in the middle with his mutant choir-boy voice, sounding jolly and angst-ridden at the same time. It should be given out on street corners to unsuspecting passers-by of all ages."<ref name=Criticaldiscography>[http://foreverill.com/disc/charming.htm "Critical Discography - This Charming Man"]. Retrieved on [[08 January]] [[2006]].</ref> While the band was little-known in the United States at the time, Robert Palmer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the song as "sparkling, soaring, superlative pop-rock, and proof that the guitar-band format pioneered by [[The Beatles]] is still viable for groups with something to say".<ref>Palmer, Robert.

[[Allmusic|All Music Guide]]'s [[Ned Raggett]] noted that "Early [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] would have approved of the music, [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] of the words", and described the track as "an audacious end result by any standard".<ref name=AMG1>Raggett, Ned.

During an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', Morrissey appeared waving [[gladioli]].<ref name="Strong"/> A 2004 BBC Radio&nbsp;2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr".<ref name=BBC/> ''UNCUT'' magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that "Thursday evening when [[Manchester]]'s feyest first appeared on [''Top of the Pops''] would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event in the lives of a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties [[New Wave music]], as exemplified by [[Culture Club]] and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril."<ref name=Criticaldiscography/> Noel Gallagher said of the performance: "None of my mates liked them - they were more hooligan types. They [came] into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on "Top of the Pops" with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing."<ref name="Uncut07" />

==Versions and release history==
The earliest version of "This Charming Man" was recorded on [[21 September]] [[1983]], in Maida Vale Studio 4, for [[John Peel]]'s radio programme.<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1983/Sep14thesmiths/ 14/09/1983 - The Smiths]".

Two [[music videos]] were made for "This Charming Man". The first was filmed by the British television show ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'', and features the band playing the song in an empty room. The second is from a [[7 November]] [[1983]] recording at the Riverside television programme, and shows the band playing the song in a room with a floor covered by flowers.

In December 1983, DJ [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Kevorkian]] released a "New-York" [[House music|house mix]] of the single on Megadisc records.<ref name="peter">Paphides, Peter.
