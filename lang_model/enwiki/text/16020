'''San Jose''' ({{IPA2|s<U+00E6>n ho<U+028A><U+02C8>ze<U+026A>}}) is the third-largest city in  [[California]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|tenth-largest]] in the [[United States]].  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]].  For the past several years, it has held the title of The Safest Big City in America.<ref name="Morgan_Quitno_06">[http://www.morganquitno.com/cit06pop.htm#500,000+ City Crime Rankings by Population Group]</ref><ref> A Big City is a city with a minimum population of 500,000.</ref> San Jose is located in [[Silicon Valley]], at the south end of the [[San Francisco Bay]].  With a population of 953,679 San Jose is the largest city in [[Northern California]]. Once a small farming city, by 1950 San Jose was a magnet for suburban newcomers in new housing developments (1960s to the 1990s) and became a large thriving urban center of [[Northern California]]. San Jose is sometimes nicknamed ''L.A. North'' which points out its similarity to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] as of the end of the 20th century. 

Originally known as '''''El Pueblo de San Jos<U+00E9> de Guadalupe''''', it was founded on [[November 29]], [[1777]] as the first [[town]] in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colony]] of Nueva California, which later became [[Alta California]]. The city served as a farming community to support Spanish military installations at [[San Francisco]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. After California gained statehood in 1850, San Jose served as its first capital. After over 150 years as an agricultural center, increased demand for housing from soldiers and other veterans returning from [[World War II]] and starting families, as well as aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s led to San Jose being a [[bedroom community]] for Silicon Valley in the 1970s, which attracted more businesses to the city. By the 1990s, San Jose's central location within the booming technology industry in the area earned the city the nickname as the ''Capital of Silicon Valley''.

On [[April 3]], [[1979]], the city council adopted '''San Jos<U+00E9>''' as the spelling of the city name on the city seal and official stationery; however, the name is still more commonly spelled without the [[Diacritic|diacritical mark]]. The official name of the city is ''The City of San Jos<U+00E9>''. In the late 1980s after four decades of spectacular development and population growth, San Jos<U+00E9> surpassed San Francisco as the third most populous city in California.

==History==
===Site chosen by De Anza===
For thousands of years before the arrival of [[Europe]]an settlers, the area now known as San Jose was inhabited by several groups of [[Ohlone]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Permanent European presence in the area came with the 1770 founding of the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]] and [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]] by [[Gaspar de Portol<U+00E0>]] and Father [[Jun<U+00ED>pero Serra]], about sixty miles (100 km) to the south. Don [[Pedro Fages]], the military governor at Monterey, passed through the area on his 1770 and 1772 expeditions to explore the [[East Bay (California)|East Bay]] and [[Sacramento River Delta]]. Late in 1775, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] led an expedition to bring colonists from [[New Spain]] to California and to locate sites for two [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s, one [[presidio]], and one pueblo (town). He left the colonists at Monterey in 1776, and explored north with a small group. He selected the sites of the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As<U+00ED>s]] in what is now [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]; on his way back to Monterey, he sited [[Mission Santa Clara de As<U+00ED>s]] and the pueblo San Jose in the [[Santa Clara Valley]]. De Anza returned to [[Mexico City]] before any of the settlements were actually founded, but his name lives on in many buildings and street names.

===Early Spanish pueblo===
[[Image:1725.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The 200th anniversary of the founding was marked by this commemorative postage stamp.]]
'''''El Pueblo de San Jos<U+00E9> de Guadalupe''''' (The Town of [[Saint Joseph]] from Guadalupe) was founded by [[Jos<U+00E9> Joaquin Moraga]] on [[November 29]], [[1777]], the first settlement not associated with a [[Spanish Missions of California|mission]] or a military post (''presidio'') in [[Alta California]]. (Mission Santa Clara, the closest mission, was founded earlier in 1777, three miles (5 km) from the original pueblo site in neighboring [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. [[Mission San Jos<U+00E9>]] was not founded until 1797, about 20 miles (30 km) north of San Jose in what is now [[Fremont, California|Fremont]].) The town was founded by the colonists led to California by de Anza, as a farming community to provide food for the presidios of San Francisco and Monterey. In 1778, the pueblo had a population of 68. In 1797, the pueblo was moved from its original location, near the present-day intersection of [[Guadalupe Parkway]] and Taylor Street, to a location in what is now Downtown San Jose, surrounding Pueblo Plaza (now [[Plaza de Cesar Chavez|Plaza de C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez]]).

In the ensuing years a number of [[Mexican]] Land Grants were confirmed within the lands now considered San Jose.  For example, the [[Rincon de Los Esteros]] Grant was conferred upon Rafael Alvisa in the year 1859; the name of this rancho became the monicker for the modern [[redevelopment]] project area.

===Early statehood===
[[Image:San jose california 1875.jpg|thumb|300px|San Jose, 1875.]]
During the [[Bear Flag Revolt]], Captain [[Thomas Fallon]] led a small force from [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and captured the pueblo without bloodshed on [[July 11]], [[1846]]. Fallon received an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] from [[John D. Sloat]], and raised it over the pueblo on [[July 14]], as the California Republic agreed to join the [[United States]] following the start of the [[Mexican-American War]]. Fallon would later become the tenth mayor of San Jose. It's unclear whether or not Fallon ordered all townspeople of Spanish/Mexican origin out of San Jos<U+00E9>, as some local historians claimed.

During the [[California Gold Rush]] period, the New Almaden Mines just south of the city were the largest [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines in North America (mercury was used to help separate gold from ore). The [[cinnabar]] deposits were discovered in 1845 by a Mexican cavalry captain, Don Andres Castillero, when he recognized the red powder used by local Ohlone Indians to decorate the chapel at [[Mission Santa Clara]].  Mining operations began in 1847 at what was the first operating mine in the province, just in time for the Gold Rush. The importance of the mercury industry at the time explains why the local newspaper is named the ''[[San Jose Mercury News|Mercury News]]''.

On [[March 27]], [[1850]], San Jose became the first incorporated city in the [[U.S. state]] of California; the first mayor was [[Josiah Belden]]. It also served as the state's first capital with the first and second sessions of the [[California Legislature]], known as the ''Legislature of a Thousand Drinks'', being held there in 1850 and 1851. The legislature was unhappy with the location, as no buildings suitable for a state government were available in the city, and took up State Senator [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]'s offer to build a new capital on land he donated to the state in what is now [[Benicia, California|Benicia]].

In 1884, [[Sarah L. Winchester]] (n<U+00E9>e Pardee), the widow of William Winchester and heiress to the empire that manufactured the [[Winchester rifle]], was told that the Winchester family was cursed and haunted by ghosts who were killed by the rifle. She moved from [[Connecticut]] to San Jose and began a construction project of such magnitude that it was to occupy the lives of carpenters and craftsmen until her death: the house was continually under construction for thirty-eight years. It is believed that she built the massive, bewildering house to confuse these spirits. Before the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake]], the [[Winchester Mystery House]] reached a height of 7 stories; today it stands three stories with approximately 160 rooms. Many visitors to the house claim to have felt the presence of ghosts.

===Notable events===
[[Image:ReplicaSanJoseLightTowerInHistoryPark-rot-crop.jpg|thumb|This replica of the Light Tower at the San Jose History Park stands only half of the original tower's 237 feet (72 m).]]

In 1881, because of a forceful campaign by editor J.J. Owen of the ''San Jose Mercury'', the city council authorized the construction of the San Jose Electric Light Tower, ostensibly to replace the gas streetlights that had illuminated downtown San Jose since 1861. It didn't provide sufficient illumination, and by 1884 was used only for ceremonial purposes. It collapsed during a [[gale]] in 1915. In 1989, an informal "Court of Historical Inquiry" looked into the issue of whether the [[Eiffel Tower]] was a [[copyright infringement]] of the Electric Light Tower; the Justice ruled that it was not.

The 1933 [[kidnap]]ping and [[murder]] of [[Brooke Hart]] resulted in mob violence in San Jose. About 10,000 residents (approximately 1/6 of the city's population at the time) stormed the jail and [[lynching|lynched]] the two men who had confessed to the killing. The case drew international attention to San Jose, for the kidnapping, lynching, and for the praise that [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[James Rolph]] directed to those who participated. It is also notable as the last public lynching in California's history. Photos of the lynchings were even used as [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]], to demonstrate that Americans were supportive of their Jewish population (the Hart family was Jewish).

During [[World War II]], San Jose experienced racial tension in neighborhoods where large populations of [[African Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]] and [[Japanese Americans]] lived on the city's western and eastern edges. Most of the Japanese community were removed and interned in war detention camps in the course of the war. Anti-Mexican violence based on the earlier [[zoot suit riots]] in [[Los Angeles]] took place in the summer of 1943 in San Jose. And after large numbers of blacks from the Southern states moved to San Jose's growing wartime manufacturing industry, locals were well divided but grown to accept the thousands of new residents, who happen to be black.

San Jose was a [[conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] bastion until the 1980s, when continued population growth yielded a political shift away from the more conservative agricultural heritage still shared by most of rural California to a more urban outlook, mirroring the voting patterns of the more densely populated urban centers of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. San Jose now has a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] majority in party registration.

===Earthquakes===

San Jose lies near the [[San Andreas Fault]]; a major source of [[earthquake]] activity in California.  Significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, 1868,1891 and 1906. The [[Daly City]] Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. Most recently, the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] of 1989 also caused some major damage to parts of the city. The most serious earthquake, the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], with its epicenter slightly off the coast of [[San Francisco]] near [[Golden Gate Park]]<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/04/11/BAGB163KV81.DTL Officials unmoved by quake notoriety Plan to note change of 1906 epicenter lacking support]</ref> , devastated many buildings in San Jose. The city was still primarily rural and the population much smaller than San Francisco, so houses and businesses were not so closely built, providing no opportunity for a major fire like the one that destroyed the city up the Peninsula. The all-brick Agnews Asylum (later Agnews State Hospital) suffered possibly the worst damage in the San Jose area, killing over 100 people as the walls and roof collapsed. The 8-year-old San Jose High School's three-story stone and brick structure also collapsed, and many other buildings were severely damaged.  There have been many other earthquakes felt in San Jose that cause little or no damage other than causing a "stir" around town and a few broken bottles or windows.  Although most damages from earthquakes are quickly repaired, if you look closely, earthquake damage may be seen around town in the way of cracked sidewalks, raised curbs, slanted or cracked walls, patched freeway divider walls. 
The other [[Geologic fault|faults]] near San Jose are the Monte Vista Fault, [[Hayward Fault Zone|South Hayward Fault]], Northern Calaveras Fault, [[Silver Creek Fault]] and Central Calaveras Fault.

===Transition from agriculture to technology===
For nearly two centuries a farming community, San Jose produced a significant amount of fruits and vegetables until the 1960s, and many past and current names of teams, streets, buildings, and so on reflect its agricultural beginnings. [[Plum|Prune]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[apricot]]s were some of the major crops. In 1922, the first commercial [[farming]] of [[broccoli]] in the U.S. was started in San Jose, by brothers Stephano and Andrea D'Arrigo. The [[Del Monte]] cannery in [[Sunol-Midtown, California|Midtown]] was the largest employer in the city for many years.<ref name=PolHist>[http://www2.sjsu.edu/depts/PoliSci/faculty/christensen/flashback.htm Flashback: A short political history of San Jose]</ref>

[[Food Machinery Corporation]] (FMC) was founded in San Jose as the ''Bean Spray Pump Company'' in 1883. In 1941 the company received an order from the [[United States War Department]] for one thousand [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s, bringing defense contracts to San Jose for the first time. After [[World War II]], FMC continued as a [[defense contractor]], with the San Jose facilities designing and manufacturing military platforms such as the [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier]], the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]], and various subsystems of the [[M1 Abrams]]. FMC's military business would later be spun off into [[United Defense]].<ref>[http://www.uniteddefense.com/co/history.htm BAE Systems History]</ref>

[[IBM]] established their west coast headquarters in San Jose in 1943.  In 1952 they opened a research and development facility in downtown, where [[Reynold Johnson]] and his team invented [[RAMAC]].  In 1956 IBM opened its Cottle Road manufacturing facility in the [[Santa Teresa (San Jose)|Santa Teresa]] neighborhood, where [[disc drive]]s were invented in 1962. IBM moved the research and development operation out of downtown, opening the [[Santa Teresa Laboratories]] in the [[Coyote Valley]] in 1976, and the [[Almaden Research Center]] in 1986.<ref>Winslow, Ward (editor); ''The Making of Silicon Valley: a One Hundred Year Renaissance''; 1995; ISBN 0-9649217-0-7</ref>

===Growth===

<!--[[Image:South San Jose.jpg|thumb|Recent development in San Jose.]]-->

[[A. P. Hamann]] (nicknamed "Dutch") became [[city manager]] in 1950. At the time, the city had a population of 95,280 and a total area of only 17 square miles. Hamann instituted an aggressive growth program by [[annex]]ation of adjacent areas, such as [[Alviso, California|Alviso]] and [[Cambrian Park, California|Cambrian Park]], and a program of dispersed urbanization, called [[urban sprawl]]. Hamann also spent significant time on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], selling San Jose as an ideal place for businesses to expand into. Hamann's efforts resulted in an annual population growth rate of over eight percent. When Hamann left office in 1969, San Jose had grown to 495,000 residents and 136 square miles.<ref name=PolHist/>

The costs of uncontrolled growth&mdash;high municipal debt load, deteriorating public services (including double sessions at public schools overtaxed fire and police services), and environmental degradation&mdash;triggered a populist revolt against Hamann's growth machine.  In the late 1960s, several anti-growth candidates were elected to the City Council.  Seeing the writing on the wall, Hamann retired.  In 1971, [[Norman Mineta]]--who had been appointed to fill a vacant City Council seat by pro-growth Mayor Ron James but who proved to be an independent&mdash;was elected Mayor.  During the early 1970s, a feminist-environmentalist electoral alliance consolidated a liberal, anti-growth majority on the City Council.  In a final coup against the growth machine, voters elected [[Janet Gray Hayes]] as mayor in 1974.  Since then, San Jose has been governed by a liberal-managerial regime focused on growth management, neighborhood services, and fiscal solvency.<ref name=PolHist/>

Subsequently, the city adopted a [[general plan]] that established an "urban service area"  (also known as "urban growth boundary") within existing city boundaries, limited development in the eastern foothills, and deferred growth in Coyote Valley to the south. To the west, communities such as [[Campbell, California|Campbell]] and [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] had incorporated as cities to avoid being annexed to San Jose, while expansion to the north was impossible because of [[San Francisco Bay]]. The city also adopted more rigorous planning practices and a "pay-as-you-grow" system of paying for new infrastructure.  However, San Jose's new policies did not stop or even significantly restrict growth; rather, they directed growth towards incorporated areas and mitigated the costs of growth. The city's housing stock and population steadily increased during subsequent decades.<ref name=PolHist/>

Indeed, continued growth has created enormous challenges for the city and region.  With the boom of the [[electronics]] industry, specifically [[personal computer]]s  and [[integrated circuit]]s, the population of San Jose and Silicon Valley continued to grow rapidly. By 1980, the city's population was 629,442; it reached 782,248 by 1990; and at which point Santa Clara County as a whole had grown to 1,682,585 residents.<ref>For complete statistics regarding the population growth of San Jose please refer to the [http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/DEMOGRAP/Histtext.htm Historical Census Populations of California State, Counties, Cities, Places, and Towns, 1850-2000]</ref>  Because of rapid job growth and in-migration, housing costs in San Jose and the rest of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] rose faster than the national average in the 1980s and 1990s; between 1976 and 2001, San Jose's housing costs increased by 936%, the fastest growth in the nation over that time. The average 2003 home price in Santa Clara County was approximately 330% of the national average.<ref name=Urban/>

In the early 1990s, San Jos<U+00E9> and Santa Clara valley had received a heavy dose of negative press as a poorly-planned and troubled suburban community, said the November 25, 1991 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' article: ''How gray is my valley'' part of the special issue on ''[[California]]: The Endangered Dream''. In response, the city has tried to direct growth inward and densify already urbanized areas.  In 1994, the city council approved another [[general plan]] with the original 1974 [[urban growth boundary|urban growth boundaries]]  intact.  In 1998, city voters rejected a ballot measure that would have eased development restrictions in the foothills.  Sixty percent of the housing built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting an orientation towards [[Smart Growth]] planning principles.<ref name=HsgConst/ http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/data/build_permit_hist/table1.asp> </ref>

{{see also|San Jos<U+00E9> City Council|List of Mayors of San Jose, California}}
San Jose is a charter city under California law, giving it the power to enact local ordinances that may conflict with state law, within the limits provided by the charter. The city has a [[council-manager government]] with a [[city manager]] nominated by the [[mayor]] and elected by the [[city council]].

The [[San Jos<U+00E9> City Council]] is made up of ten council members elected by districts, and a mayor elected in an at-large election. During city council meetings, the mayor presides, and all eleven members can vote on any issue. The mayor has no [[veto]] powers. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms; the even-numbered district council members beginning in 1994; the mayor and the odd-numbered district council members beginning in 1996. Council members and the mayor are limited to two successive terms in office, although a council member that has reached the term limit can be elected mayor, and vice versa. The council elects a vice-mayor from the members of the council at the second meeting of the year following a council election. This council member has the right to act as mayor during the temporary absence of the mayor, but does not have the right of succession to the mayor's office upon a vacancy.<ref name=Charter>[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/clerk/Charter.htm San Jose City Charter]</ref>

The City Manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, and must present an annual [[budget]] for approval by the city council. The council elects the manager for an indefinite term, and may at any time remove the manager, or the electorate may remove the manager through a [[recall election]]. Other city officers elected by the council are the city attorney, city auditor, and city clerk.<ref name=Charter/>

Like all California cities except San Francisco, both the levels and the boundaries of what the city government controls is determined by the local county Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).<ref>[http://www.santaclara.lafco.ca.gov Local Agency Formation Commission]</ref> The goal of a LAFCO is to try to avoid uncontrolled [[urban sprawl]]. The Santa Clara County LAFCO has set boundaries of San Jose's 'Sphere of Influence' (indicated by the blue line in the map near the top of the page) as a superset of the actual city limits (the yellow area in the map), plus parts of the surrounding unincorporated county land, where San Jose can, for example, prevent development of fringe areas to concentrate city growth closer to the city's core. The LAFCO also defines a subset of the Sphere as an 'Urban Service Area' (indicated by the red line in the map), effectively limiting development to areas where urban infrastructure (sewers, electrical service, etc.) already exists.

San Jose has consistently been ranked as one of the safest large cities in the United States. During the 1990s and 2000s, the crime rate has consistently fallen.<ref>[http://www.sjpd.org/CrimeStats.cfm San Jose Crime Statistics]</ref> From 2001 to 2005 the city was ranked as the safest American city with a population over 500,000 by the Morgan Quitno Awards.<ref name="Morgan_Quitno_06">a</ref> The designation is based on crime statistics reported to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in six categories: [[murder]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[aggravated assault]], [[burglary]], and [[auto theft]].<ref>[http://www.morganquitno.com/cit05pop.htm#25 City Crime Rankings by Population Group]</ref> <!-- note stats are released by the FBI ten months after a year ends, so 2004 news is about 2003 stats, etc. --> However, reports of [[police brutality]] have become more common.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/10/22/vietnamese.shooting.ap/ CNN.com Hearing held in police shooting of Vietnamese woman in Silicon Valley]</ref><ref>[http://www.kron4.com/Global/story.asp?S=2355136&nav=5D7lRMbK SJPD Shooting Raises Taser Questions]</ref><ref>[http://www.indybay.org/news/2004/10/1701805.php Commission Meets on Issue of Police Violence in San Jose]</ref>

[[Image:AlumRockViewSiliconValley w.jpg|400px|thumb|Looking west over northern San Jose (downtown is at far left) and other parts of Silicon Valley. See an up-to-the-minute view of San Jose from the Mount Hamilton web camera. http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/hamcam/]]

San Jose is located at {{coor dms|37|18|15|N|121|52|22|W|city}} (37.304051, &minus;121.872734)[[Geographic references|<U+00B9>]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 461.5 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (178.2 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]){{GR|1}}. 452.9 km<U+00B2> (174.9 mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and 8.6 km<U+00B2> (3.3 mi<U+00B2>) of it (1.86%) is water.

San Jose lies near the [[San Andreas Fault]]; a major source of [[earthquake]] activity in California. The most serious earthquake, in 1906, damaged many buildings in San Jose as described earlier. Earlier significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, 1868, and 1891. The [[Daly City]] Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. The [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] of 1989 also did some damage to parts of the city. The other faults near San Jose are the Monte Vista Fault, [[Hayward Fault Zone|South Hayward Fault]], Northern Calaveras Fault, and Central Calaveras Fault.

The [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]] runs from the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] (which separate the South Bay from the Pacific Coast) flowing north through San Jose, ending in the San Francisco Bay at [[Alviso, California|Alviso]]. Along the southern part of the river is the neighborhood of [[Almaden Valley]], originally named for the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] mines which produced mercury needed for [[gold]] extraction from [[quartz]] during the [[California Gold Rush]] as well as [[mercury fulminate]] blasting caps and detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945.

The lowest point in San Jose is at [[sea level]] at the San Francisco Bay in Alviso; the highest is 4,372 feet (1,333 m) at Copernicus Peak, [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], which is technically outside the city limit. Due to the proximity to [[Lick Observatory]] atop Mount Hamilton, San Jose has taken several steps to reduce [[light pollution]], including replacing all street lamps with [[low pressure sodium lamp]]s. To recognize the city's efforts, the [[asteroid]] 6216 San Jose was named after the city. Some residents object to the deep yellow color of the streetlights, saying they are distracting because they are the same shade of yellow as traffic lights and other illuminated traffic warnings.<ref>[http://www.baddesigns.com/strlt.html Bad Designs - Yellow street lights]</ref>

===Climate===
[[Image:MtHamilton wb.jpg|thumb|Mount Hamilton range showing summer's golden mantle. Dark green areas in hills are primarily scrub oak and other low-growing shrubs, with possibly a grass-fire burned area on the far right.]]
[[Image:MtHamiltonWinter wbelfP1310021.jpg|thumb|Mount Hamilton range in January, with morning fog clearing away.]]
San Jose, like most of the Bay Area, has a [[Mediterranean climate]] tempered by the presence of the San Francisco Bay. Unlike [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], which is exposed to the ocean or Bay on three sides and whose temperature therefore varies relatively little year-round and overnight, San Jose lies more inland, protected on three sides by mountains. This shelters the city from rain and makes it more of a [[semiarid]], near-desert area, with a mean annual rainfall of only 14.4 inches (366 mm), compared to some other parts of the Bay Area, which can get up to four times that amount. It also avoids San Francisco's omnipresent fog most of the year.

However, temperatures are generally moderate. January's average high is 59 <U+00B0>F (15 <U+00B0>C) and average low is 42 <U+00B0>F (6 <U+00B0>C), with overnight freezes several nights each year; July's average high is 84 <U+00B0>F (29 <U+00B0>C) and average low is 58 <U+00B0>F (14 <U+00B0>C), with heat exceeding 100 <U+00B0>F (38 <U+00B0>C) several days each year. The highest temperature ever recorded in San Jose was 109 <U+00B0>F (42.8 <U+00B0>C) on June 14, 2000; the lowest was 17 <U+00B0>F (-8.3 <U+00B0>C) on January 9, 1920 and January 10, 1920. Temperatures between night and day can vary by 30 or 40 <U+00B0>F (17 to 22 <U+00B0>C). 

With the light rainfall, San Jose experiences over 300 days a year of full or significant sunshine. Rain occurs primarily in the months from October through April or May, with hardly any rainfall from June through September. During the winter, hillsides and fields turn green with grasses and vegetation, although [[deciduous]] trees are bare; with the coming of the annual summer dry period, the vegetation dies and dries, giving the hills a golden cover, which some find beautiful but which also provides fuel for frequent [[grass fire]]s.

The [[snow]] level drops as low as 2,000 ft (610 m) above sea level, or lower, occasionally each winter, coating nearby [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], and less frequently the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], with snow that normally lasts a few days. This sometimes snarls traffic traveling on [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]] towards [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. Snow occasionally falls in San Jose, but until recently, the most recent snow to remain on the ground was in February of 1976 when many residents around the city saw as much as 3 inches on car and roof tops. However, in March of 2006, a smaller amount, up to one inch of snow fell in downtown San Jose as well as other areas around the city at elevations of only 90 feet to 200 feet above sea level. 

Again, like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is made up of dozens of [[microclimate]]s. Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only 10 miles (16 km)  distant, experiences more rainfall and slightly more extreme temperatures.

==Economy==
[[Image:Adobe HQ.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Adobe Systems headquarters]]
The large concentration of high-technology engineering, computer, and microprocessor companies around San Jose has led the area to be known as [[Silicon Valley]].  As the largest city in the valley, San Jose has billed itself "the capital of Silicon Valley."  Area schools such as [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]], [[Santa Clara University]], and [[Stanford University]] pump thousands of engineering and computer science graduates into the local economy every year.

High economic growth during the [[Dot-com bubble|tech bubble]] caused employment, housing prices, and traffic congestion to peak in the late 1990s. As the economy slowed in the early 2000s, employment and traffic congestion diminished somewhat.  In the mid-2000s, traffic along major highways again began to worsen as the economy improved.  San Jose had 405,000 jobs within its city limits in 2006, and an unemployment rate of 4.6%. In 2000, San Jose residents had the highest median household income [[Highest income places in the United States|of any city]] with a population over 300,000, and currently has the highest median income of any city with over 225,000 people.

San Jose lists 25 companies with 1,000 employees or more, including the headquarters of [[Adobe Systems]], [[BEA Systems]], [[Cisco Systems, Inc.|Cisco]], and [[eBay]], as well as major facilities for [[Flextronics]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and [[Lockheed Martin]]. Sizable government employers include the city government, [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], and [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]]. <!--Broken link<ref>[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/factsheet/employment.html]</ref>-->

The [[cost of living]] in San Jose and the surrounding areas is among the highest in California and the nation.[http://www.fedc.com/ACCRACostofLivingIndex2ndQuarter2004.htm] Housing costs are the primary reason for the high cost of living, although the costs in all areas tracked by [http://www.accra.org/ ACCRA] are above the national average. Despite the high cost of living in San Jose, households in city limits have the highest [[disposable income]] of any city in the U.S. with over 500,000 residents.

San Jose residents produce more U.S. [[patent]]s than any other city.<ref>[http://www.mostlivable.org/cities/sanjose/home_accolades.html America's most livable:San Jose, California]</ref>  Thirty-five percent of all [[venture capital]] funds in the U.S. are invested in San Jose and Silicon Valley companies.<ref>[http://www.mostlivable.org/cities/sanjose/home_accolades.html America's most livable:San Jose, California]</ref>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Asian sj1.gif|thumb|250px|right|This thematic map shows the large [[Asian American]] population in [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], and the [[North Valley (San Jose)|North Valley]].]]
{{seealso|Maps of San Jose, California}}
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 894,943 people (although CA State figures currently put that number closer to 954,000), 276,598 households, and 203,576 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 1,976.1/km<U+00B2> (5,117.9/mi<U+00B2>). There were 281,841 housing units at an average density of 622.3/km<U+00B2> (1,611.8/mi<U+00B2>). The racial makeup of the city was 47.49% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 3.50% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 26.86% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.40% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 15.94% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 5.04% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 30.17% of the population.

There were 276,598 households out of which 38.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.4% were non-families. 18.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 3.62.

[[Image:San Jose Age Distribution Census 2000.png|thumb|left||250px|Age distribution]]

In the city the population was spread out with 26.4% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 35.4% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was the highest in the US for any city with more than a quarter million residents with $70,243 annually. The median income for a family was $74,813. Males had a median income of $49,347 versus $36,936 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $26,697. About 6.0% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 10.3% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over.

The San Francisco Bay Area has a very diverse religious life with thousands of [[church]]es, [[mosque]]s, [[temple]]s, and religious centers.  The Bay Area is home to [[Buddhist]], [[Sikh]]s from [[India]], many [[Christian]] (including large [[Mormon]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]]) churches), [[Jewish]], [[Hindu]], [[Muslim]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and numerous other religious communities. San Jos<U+00E9> has had a large active [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] lifestyle community for over two decades, mostly centered in the downtown sections. 

When it comes to social issues by such a diverse demographic, San Jos<U+00E9> is more affluent than most of the US, has an easy situation on race relations and a high percentage of foreign-born live in the city, including many high-tech workers from [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]]n countries settled in the city and across the Santa Clara Valley in the last three decades. Many [[Central American]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an immigrants live in San Jose since the late 1970s/early 1980s. A large Chinese American/ Japanese district thrives in downtown on Guadalupe and Almaden streets, a large multi-generational Hispanic [[barrio]] on Autumn Street district added recent waves of Mexican and other Latino immigrants, and the mostly black middle-class Burbank district by the I-680/state route 17 intersection.

==Arts and architecture==
[[Image:San Jose Plumed Serpent.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Plumed Serpent]] statue in [[Plaza de Cesar Chavez|Plaza de C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez]]]]

San Jose's downtown architecture is noted more for its limited height than for any particular buildings. Because the downtown area is in the flight path to nearby [[Mineta San Jose International Airport]], there is a permanent height limit for all buildings. There has been broad criticism, both in the past and present, of the city's architecture. It has been said that San Jose's buildings are, in fact, rather lacking in ornamentation, or aesthetically pleasing architectural style. The thorough re-development of the downtown area in the 1960s to the present, in which whole blocks of buildings were razed, has often been blamed for this.  

Municipal building projects have experimented more with architectural styles than have most private enterprises. The Children's Discovery Museum, Tech Museum of Innovation, and the San Jose Repertory Theater building have experimented with bold colors and unusual exteriors. The new City Hall, designed by Richard Meier & Partners opened in 2005 and is a notable addition to the growing collection of municipal building projects.

Public art is an evolving attraction in the city. The City was one of the first to adopt a public art ordinance at 2% of capital improvement building project budgets, and the results of this commitment are beginning to have an impact on the visual landscape of the City. There is a considerable amount throughout the downtown area, and a growing collection in the City's neighborhood newer civic locations including libraries, parks, and fire stations. Of particular note, the Mineta Airport expansion will incorporate a program of Art & Technology into its development. 

Within the early efforts at public art, there are notable controversies. Two examples, include the statue of [[Quetzalcoatl]] (the plumed serpent) in downtown which was controversial in its planning because some religious groups felt that it was pagan, and controversial in its implementation because many felt that the final statue by [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] did not closely resemble a winged serpent, and was more noted for its expense than its aesthetics. Locals have been known to jokingly call the statue the "Fecal Penis" or "Squatsaloadal" referring to its shape.<ref>[http://sanjoseinside.com/sji/blog/entries/fixing_a_philanthropic_hole/ ''San Jose Inside'']</ref> 

The statue of [[Thomas Fallon]] also met strong resistance from those who felt that people like him were largely responsible for the decimation of early native populations and [[Chicano]]/[[Latino]] activists protested he captured San Jos<U+00E9> by violent force in the [[Mexican-American war]] ([[1846]]) as well "repressed" historic documents of Fallon ordered the expulsion of most of the city's [[Californio]] (early Spanish or Mexican) residents. In October [[1991]] after protests in part of [[Columbus Day]] and [[Dia de La Raza]] celebrations, the Fallon statue plan was scrapped and the statue was stored in a warehouse in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] for more than a decade. The statue was returned to public display in 2002, albeit in a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular patched formed by the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2002/09/16/daily78.html ''San Jose Business Journal'']</ref>

<!--This image may be usable in some other section[[Image:Sunrise San Jose.JPG|thumb|300px|left|San Jose Skyline at Sunrise]]-->In 2001, the city sponsored SharkByte, an exhibit of decorated [[shark]]s, based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled after [[Chicago]]'s display of decorated cows.<ref>[http://www.chicagotraveler.com/cows_on_parade.htm Chicago cows on parade exhibit]</ref> Large models of sharks were decorated in a variety of clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists and were then displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. Many displays were removed early because of vandalism. After the exhibition, the sharks were auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity. The sharks can still be found in their new owners' homes and businesses.

In 2006, [[Adobe Systems]] in commissioned a kinetic art installation titled [http://www.sanjosesemaphore.com San Jose Semaphore] by Ben Rubin, which resides at the top of its headquarters building. Semaphore is comprised of four lighted discs which "rotate" to transmit a message. The content of the San Jose Semaphore<U+2019>s message is a mystery; cracking the encryption technique and deciphering the message is posed as a challenge for the public. The visual art installation is supplemented with an audio track, transmitted from the building on a low-power AM station. The audio track provides clues to decode the message being transmitted.

The city is home to many performance arts, including [[Opera San Jose]], Symphony Silicon Valley, [[Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley]], [[Children's Musical Theater of San Jose]]  (recognized as the largest and most talented youth theatre company in the nation), the [[San Jose Repertory Theatre]], and [http://www.amtsj.org/index.html American Musical Theatre of San Jose]. San Jose also is home to the San Jose Museum of Art,<ref>[http://www.sanjosemuseumofart.org San Jose Museum of Art]</ref> one of the nation's premiere Modern Art museums. In addition, the annual [[Cinequest Film Festival]] in downtown has grown to over 60,000 attendees per year, becoming an important [[film festival|festival]] for [[independent film]]s.

The [[HP Pavilion]] is one of the most active venues for events in the world. According to [[Billboard Magazine]] and Pollstar, the arena sold the most tickets to non-sporting events of any venue in the United States, and third in the world after the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]], and the [[Bell Centre]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]], for the period from [[January 1]] &ndash; [[September 30]], [[2004]]. <!--Broken link<ref>[http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/mercurynews/news/columnists/leigh_weimers/10045287.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp]</ref>--> Including sporting events, the HP Pavilion averages 184 events a year, or roughly one event for every two days, which is significantly higher than the average for NHL arenas. <!--Broken link<ref>[http://www.sjredevelopment.org/101204/5-1DowntownTheaterUpdate.pdf]</ref>-->

An expansion [[Major League Soccer]] team granted to San Jos<U+00E9> will begin play in 2008. San Jos<U+00E9> has had previous attempts to draw teams from [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] by offering stadium deals or attracting relocating sports teams. In [[1991]] the [[San Francisco Giants]] baseball team nearly closed the deal to play in San Jos<U+00E9>. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} In [[1997]] the [[Golden State Warriors]] basketball team after playing some games in the HP Pavilion nearly moved to San Jos<U+00E9>. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Neighboring [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] recently announced ([[2006]]) a new stadium deal will break ground and be completed by 2009, as the new home of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] football team. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  San Jose may also soon house the practice facilities for the Oakland Raiders.

[[Image:HP Pavilion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[HP Pavilion]]]]
Previously, San Jose was home to the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] (1974-1984), [[Western Soccer League|Western Soccer Alliance]] (1985-1988), and [[Major League Soccer]] (1996-2005), the San Jose Rhinos of [[Roller Hockey International]] (1994-1997;1999),
the [[San Jose Grizzlies]] (1993-1995) of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, the [[San Jose Golddiggers]] (1987-1989) of Major League Volleyball (women's), the [[San Jose Jammers]] (1989-1991) of the Continental Basketball Association, the [[San Jose State University Spartans]], the [[San Jose Lasers]] of the [[American Basketball League 1996-98|American Basketball League]], the [[Golden State Warriors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (while Oakland Arena was being renovated, 1996-1997), the [[San Jose CyberRays]] of the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (2001-2002), and the San Jose Ballers of the [[International Basketball League (2005-)]], now the [[Tri City Ballers]].

In addition to professional teams, San Jose hosts several sporting events. The [[SAP Open]] (formerly the Sybase Open) is an annual men's [[tennis]] tournament held at the HP Pavilion. San Jose was the host of [[ArenaBowl XVI]] on [[August 18]], [[2002]] in which the [[San Jose SaberCats]] defeated the [[Arizona Rattlers]], 52-14. The [[San Jose Grand Prix]], first held in July 2005, brings [[Champ Car]] racing on a temporary [[road racing|road course]] on Downtown streets. The city is also one of five host cities for the inaugural [[Dew Action Sports Tour]] season; the San Jose event was held in September 2005.

In college sports, the San Jos<U+00E9> State ''Spartans'' are the local college team, however, many residents support the [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]] ''Golden Bears'' or the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ''Cardinal''; local sports news coverage tends to focus more on these two schools.  The [[Pacific Ten Conference|Pac-10]] Women's [[Basketball]] Championship is held at the [[HP Pavilion]] as well as either the men's or women's West Regional tournament during the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s ''[[March Madness]]''.

In 2004, the San Jose Sports Authority hosted the [[United States Olympic Committee|U.S. Olympic team]] trials for [[judo]], [[taekwondo]], [[trampolining]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]] at the [[San Jose State Event Center]]. In August 2004, the Authority hosted the USA All-Star [[Rugby Sevens|7-Aside Rugby]] Championships at Watson Bowl, east of Downtown. San Jose is also home to the [[St Joseph's Hurling Club]].

== Transportation==
[[Image:Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mineta San Jose International Airport - International Arrivals]]
[[Image:Jet over San Jose CA 2.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A passenger jet flying over Downtown on its approach to Mineta San Jose International]]
The San Jose area has a well-developed freeway system, including three [[Interstate highway]]s&mdash;[[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]], [[Interstate 880|I-880]], and [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]]&mdash;in addition to several federal and state highways, [[U.S. Highway 101 in California|US 101]], [[California State Route 85|CA-85]], [[California State Route 87|CA-87]], [[California State Highway 17|CA-17]], and [[California State Route 237|CA-237]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary, "two-digit" interstate. Additionally, San Jose contains many [[expressway]]s of the [[Santa Clara County Expressway System]], including the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].

Rail service to and within San Jose is provided by [[Amtrak]] (the Sacramento-San Jose [[Capitol Corridor]] and the Seattle-Los Angeles [[Coast Starlight]]), [[Caltrain]] (commuter rail service between [[San Francisco]] and [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]), [[Altamont Commuter Express|ACE]] (commuter rail service to [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]), and a local light-rail system connecting downtown to [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], and [[Almaden Valley, San Jose, California|Almaden Valley]], operated by the [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA). Historic [[streetcar]]s from the San Jose History Museum operate on the light rail lines in downtown during holidays.  Long-term plans call for [[BART]] to be expanded into the San Jose area via the East Bay.  [[Diridon Station]] (formerly Cahill Depot, 65 Cahill Street) is the meeting point of all regional commuter rail service in the area. It was built in 1935 by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], and was refurnished in 1994.

[[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] also operates many [[bus]] routes in San Jose and the surrounding communities, as well as offering [[paratransit]] services to local residents.  Additionally, the [[Highway 17 Express]] bus line connects central San Jose with [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].

San Jose is served by [[San Jose International Airport|Norman Y. Mineta San Jos<U+00E9> International Airport]], two miles (3 km) northwest of downtown, and by [[Reid-Hillview Airport|Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County]]. San Jose residents also use [[San Francisco International Airport]], a major international hub located 35 miles (56 km) to the northwest, and [[Oakland International Airport]], another medium-sized airport located 35 miles (56 km) to the north. Some large [[airlines]] that fly into San Jose are [[American Airlines]], [[Southwest Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Jet Blue Airways]], [[Northwest Airlines]], [[America West Airlines]], [[Alaska Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Frontier Airlines]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]], and [[Mexicana Airlines]].

==Utilities==
Potable [[water]] is provided primarily by the private-sector San Jose Water Company, with some by the Great Oaks Water Company, and ten percent by the public-sector San Jose Municipal Water System. Great Oaks provides exclusively well water, while the other two provide water from multiple sources, including well water, and surface water from the Los Gatos Creek watershed, Santa Clara Valley Water District, and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's [[Hetch Hetchy]] reservoir.

[[Waste|Garbage]], wastewater treatment, and [[recycling]] services are overseen by the city of San Jose's Environmental Services Department. The no-sorting convenience and unusually long list of recyclable items has resulted in San Jose being one of very few cities that can boast that it recycles 64% of its waste. The list includes all plastic categories 1 through 7; aerosol cans and paint cans; [[polystyrene]] including "[[foam peanut|packing peanut]]s" and hard foam packing, such as in [[electronics|electronic]] and computer products' boxes; [[aluminum]] furniture; small metal appliances; metal pots and pans (including [[cast iron]]); and clean cotton, linen, polyester, rayon, and wool fabrics (for example, blankets, clothes, cloth diapers, rags, and sheets).

Wastewater treatment happens at the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant, which treats and cleans the wastewater of the more than 1,500,000 people that live and work in the 300 square mile (780 km<U+00B2>) area encompassing San Jose, [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], Milpitas, Campbell, Cupertino, [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]], [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], and [[Monte Sereno, California|Monte Sereno]].

About ten percent of the treated wastewater is sold for irrigation ("water recycling") in San Jose, Santa Clara, and Milpitas, through local water providers San Jose Municipal Water System, City of Milpitas Municipal Services, City of Santa Clara Water & Sewer Utility, Santa Clara Valley Water District, San Jose Water Company, and Great Oaks Water Company.

[[Natural gas]] and electricity are provided by [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]]. Telephone service is provided primarily by [[AT&T]]. [[Cable television]] is provided by [[Comcast]].

==Education==
[[Image:Tower Hall and MDA.JPG|thumb|300px|Tower Hall, San Jose State]]

===Colleges and universities===
San Jose is home to several [[college]]s and [[university|universities]]. The largest and most well known is [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]], which was founded by the California Legislature in 1862 as the California State Normal School and is the original campus of the [[California State University]] system. Located in downtown San Jose since 1870, the university's 30,000 students in bachelor's and master's degree programs are primarily commuters from many areas in the South Bay. [[National Hispanic University]], with an enrollment of 600, offers associate and bachelor's degrees and teaching credentials to its students, focusing on Hispanic students. [[Lincoln Law School of San Jose]] offers law degrees, catering to working professionals. The San Jose campus of [[Golden Gate University]] offers business bachelor and [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degrees. San Jose's [[community college]]s, [[San Jose City College]] and [[Evergreen Valley College]], offer associate degrees, general education units to transfer to CSU and UC schools, and adult and continuing education programs.

The [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] operates [[Lick Observatory]] atop [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]]. In addition, San Jose residents attend several other area universities, including [[Santa Clara University]], [[De Anza College]] in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Carnegie Mellon West]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

===Primary and secondary education===
Most San Jose students go to schools in the [[San Jose Unified School District]]. Prior to 1954, California law required cities and [[school district]]s to have the same boundaries. When San Jose began expanding, rural school districts became one of the major opponents, as their territory and tax base was taken by the city. The city's legislators pushed a bill through the [[California Legislature]], removing that requirement, and ending much of the opposition. The result is a patchwork of local school districts in the areas annexed after 1954.<ref name=PolHist/> Public education in the city is provided by four [[high school]] districts, fourteen [[elementary education|elementary]] districts, and four [[unified school district]]s (which provide both elementary and high schools).

In addition to the main San Jose Unified School District, the unified school districts are [[Milpitas Unified School District]], [[Morgan Hill Unified School District]], and [[Santa Clara Unified School District]].

The following districts use the "feeder" system:
*[[Campbell Union High School District]] receives students from:
**[[Cambrian School District|Cambrian]]
**[[Campbell Union School District|Campbell Union]]
**[[Luther Burbank School District|Luther Burbank]]
**[[Moreland School District|Moreland]]
**[[Union School District, San Jose|Union School District]].
*[[East Side Union High School District]] receives students from:
**[[Alum Rock Union School District|Alum Rock Union]]
**[[Berryessa Union School District|Berryessa Union]]
**[[Evergreen Elementary School District|Evergreen Elementary]]
**[[Franklin-McKinley School District|Franklin-McKinley]]
**[[Mount Pleasant Elementary School District|Mount Pleasant Elementary]]
**[[Oak Grove School District|Oak Grove]]
**[[Orchard Elementary School District|Orchard Elementary]]
*[[Fremont Union High School District]] receives students from:
**[[Cupertino Union School District]].
*[[Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District]] receives students from
**[[Los Gatos Union School District]].

Private schools in San Jose are primarily run by religious groups. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California|Catholic Diocese of San Jose]] has the second largest student population in the Santa Clara County, behind only SJUSD; the diocese and its parishes operate several schools in the city, including four high schools: [[Archbishop Mitty High School]], [[Bellarmine College Preparatory]], [[Notre Dame High School, San Jose, California|Notre Dame High School]], and [[Presentation High School]] [http://www.dsj.org/educate/schools_results.asp]. There are two [[Baptist]] high schools, [[Private schools in San Jose, California|Liberty Baptist School]] and [[Private schools in San Jose, California|White Road Baptist Academy]]. [http://www.city-data.com/city/San-Jose-California.html] [[Private schools in San Jose, California|Valley Christian High School]] is a [[Protestant]] high school in the North Valley neighborhood. There is also the nonsectarian K-12 [[The Harker School|Harker School]].

===San Jose library system===
[[Image:San Jose Martin Luther King Jr Library.jpg|right|thumb|Martin Luther King, Jr. Library]]
The San Jose City [[Library]] system is unique in that the [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library]] combines the collections of the city's system with the San Jose State main library. The library is the largest (built all at once) west of the [[Mississippi River]], with a 1.5 million item collection. 

The city has 20 neighborhood branches including the [[Biblioteca Latinoamericana]] which specializes in [[Spanish language]] works. The [[East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library]], a [[Carnegie library]] opened in 1908, is the last Carnegie library in Santa Clara County still operating as a public library and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Calabazas Branch has four primary language-specific collections: [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].
