'''Egardus''' (or '''Engardus''' or '''Johannes Echgaerd''') was a European composer of [[Medieval music|music]] in the [[Ars nova|late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries]]. Almost no information survives about his life, and only three of his works are known. A certain "Johannes Ecghaerd", who held [[chaplain]]cies in [[Bruges]] and [[Diksmuide]], may be a possible match for Egardus. The extant works<U+2014>a canon and two [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Glorias]]<U+2014>appear to be less complex than music by mid-century composers, possibly because they date from either very early or very late in Egardus' career.

==Biography==
[[File:St Donatian Cathedral Bruges.jpg|thumb|220 px|A 1735 engraving of [[St Donatian's Cathedral]] in Bruges as it appeared about 270 years after Johannes Ecghaerd was appointed [[succentor]] in 1370]]
Little is known with certainty about his life.  The enigma of his biography stems from a difficulty in knowing whether he was [[Flanders|Flemish]] or Italian.  A Northern origin is suggested by his name, a copy of one of his works in a Flemish manuscript, and a possible citation of his music by [[Thomas Fabri]].  But with only one other exception, all of his works are found in Northern [[Music of the trecento|Italian]] manuscripts, and that exception, a Polish manuscript, has strong Italian connections.<ref>Cuthbert, pp. 170<U+2013>71.</ref>  The most important biographical research on the composer was conducted by [[Reinhard Strohm]], who notes that it was more common for Northern works (and composers) to travel to Italy than the opposite.<ref name="Strohm, p. 43">Strohm, p. 43</ref>

Strohm identifies a "Magister Johannes Ecghaerd" appointed as [[succentor]] of [[St Donatian's Cathedral|St. Donatian]] (''Sint-Donaaskathedraal'') in [[Bruges]] in 1370 as a possible match for the composer.  This appointment suggests to Strohm that Echgaerd would have been born by or before 1340.<ref>Strohm, pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref>  Strohm also finds connections to a work by [[Thomas Fabri]], a Dutch composer, in the text of ''Furnos reliquisti'', an unlikely coincidence if they were not working in close proximity to each other.<ref name="Strohm, p. 43"/>  Johannes Egardus held [[chaplain]]cies in [[Diksmuide]] and Bruges.<ref>''Acta Capitularia Sint-Donaas'', Bisschoppelijk Archief Brugge, Reeks A no. 48: 26.3.1371; 21.5.1371; 22.5.1387; A no. 49 (1394-) f. 1r; cited in Strohm, p. 45</ref>  The number of his pieces in [[Padua]]n manuscripts suggested to Strohm that he may have been resident there.<ref>Strohm, p. 44</ref> [[Nino Pirrotta]] had suggested that he may have been one of the musicians in the [[papal court]] of [[Bologna]] c.1410.<ref>Pirrotta, Nino, p. 43.</ref>  However, Pirrotta's evidence was based on the position of Egardus's works within the manuscript Mod A<U+2014>a connection between manuscript and court now considered more tenuous,<ref>Stone, Anne.</ref> and not from the lists of singers in the Italian [[pope|papal]] chapels: lists from which Egardus is absent.<ref>Di Bacco and N<U+00E1>das, foldout 1.</ref>

==Works==
Only three works by Egardus survive.  A canon, ''Furnos reliquisti quare; Equum est et salutare'' is found in a single source, Mod A (Modena, Biblioteca Estense e Universitaria alpha.M.5.24).  His other two works have a somewhat wider distribution.  The [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] with the [[Trope (music)|trope]] "Spiritus et Alme" appears in three sources, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Universiteitsbibliotheek 1846 (''olim'' 37, independently discovered by Schmid and Strohm) and two sources from Padua, Biblioteca Universitaria: MSS Ba 2.2.a (formerly 1225, part of Pad D) and 1475 (part of Pad A).  Both of the Paduan sources originally come from the Paduan [[Abbey]] of [[Justina of Padua|Santa Giustina]].  An untroped Gloria appears in five independent sources: [[Warsaw]], Biblioteka Narodowa, MS III.8054 (''olim'' Biblioteka Krasi<U+0144>ski 52, commonly called Kras.) f. 204v-205r, Mod A f. 21v-22r, a collection of sources in [[Grottaferrata]] and at [[Dartmouth College]] (f. Dv-4r), Padua Ba 2.2.a (1225), f. 1v, and, recently identified, in [[Udine]], Archivio di Stato framm. 22 recto (part of [[Cividale]] A).<ref>Cuthbert, p. 253. N.B. the source list in Nosow contains several errors in addition to the omission of the source in Udine.</ref>  In the Warsaw source, the work is labeled "Opus Egardi."  In Mod A, "Egardus" is used.  In no other source of this work is there an attribution.  Strohm notes that Egardus's music is less complex than other mid-century composers, but this lack of complexity can either be attributed to an early date for its composition (contemporaneous with [[Philippe de Vitry]]) or a far later date (just prior to [[Johannes Ciconia]]).
