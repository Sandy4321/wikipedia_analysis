An '''assault weapons ban''' is a form of [[gun control]] in the United States that restricts firearms based largely on cosmetic appearances.<ref name="Staff2014">{{cite book|last=Staff|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|title=Britannica Book of the Year 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LccRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA335|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=978-1-62513-171-3|page=335|quote=The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban placed limits on the sale of semiautomatic weapons from any source.

The [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994]] (AWB 1994) expired in 2004 and is now defunct. 

The 1994 federal ban and first state ban, in California, were prompted by the [[Cleveland Elementary School shooting (Stockton)|Cleveland Elementary School shooting]] in Stockton, California, in January 1989. Existing and proposed weapon bans come under scrutiny in the wake of [[mass shooting]]s, most recently after the December 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in Newtown, Connecticut.

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly called the federal [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] (AWB and AWB 1994), was enacted in September 1994. The ban, including a ban on high-capacity magazines, became defunct (expired) in September 2004 per a 10-year [[sunset provision]].

Three U.S. states passed assault weapons bans before Congress passed the federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994: California in 1989, New Jersey in 1990, and Connecticut in 1993. Four others passed assault weapons bans before AWB 1994 expired in 2004: Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York.

Although it is commonly referred to as an assault weapons ban, New Jersey's law actually uses the term "assault firearm" to define banned and regulated guns. Some New Jersey gun advocates have called its laws "draconian." Attorney Evan Nappen, author of several books on New Jersey gun laws, says the term is "misapplied and carries with it a pejorative meaning."<ref name=Record120721/>
