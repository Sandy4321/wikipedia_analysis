==Early life and origin==

Sher Shah was born as ''Farid Khan'' in the present day district of [[Mahendragarh]] in south [[Haryana]], earlier part of [[Hisar district]] of combined Punjab in India. His grand father Ibrahim Khan Sur was a land lord (Jagirdar) in [[Narnaul]] area and represented Delhi rulers of that period. Mazar of Ibrahim Khan Sur still stands as a monument in [[Narnaul]]. ''Tarikh-i Khan Jahan Lodi'' (MS. p.&nbsp;151).<ref name="Sarwani"/> also confirm this fact. However, the online [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] states that he was born in Sasaram (Bihar), in the [[Rohtas district]].<ref name="Britannica"/> He was one of about eight sons of Mian Hassan Khan Sur, a prominent figure in the government of [[Bahlul Khan Lodi]]. Sher Khan belonged to the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[Sur (Pashtun)|Sur]] tribe (the Pashtuns are known as ''[[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]'' in historical [[Persian language]] sources).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Politics of social transformation in Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan |last1=Weiner |first1=Myron |authorlink=|coauthors=Ali Banuazizi|volume=|year=1994|publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=|isbn=0-8156-2608-8, 9780815626084 |pages=488|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC |accessdate=7 June 2006}}</ref> His grandfather, Ibrahim Khan Sur, was a noble adventurer who was recruited much earlier by Sultan Bahlul Lodi of Delhi during his long contest with the [[Jaunpur Sultanate]]. {{quote|''"It was at the time of this bounty of [[Bahlul Khan Lodi|Sult<U+00E1>n Bahlol]], that the grandfather of Sher Sh<U+00E1>h, by name Ibr<U+00E1>h<U+00ED>m Kh<U+00E1>n S<U+00FA>ri,*<small>[The [[Suri (Pashtun)|S<U+00FA>r]] represent themselves as descendants of Muhammad S<U+00FA>ri, one of the princes of the [[Ghurid Dynasty|house of the Ghorian]], who left his native country, and married a daughter of one of the Afgh<U+00E1>n chiefs of Roh.]</small> with his son Hasan Kh<U+00E1>n, the father of Sher Sh<U+00E1>h, came to [[Hindustan|Hindu-st<U+00E1>n]] from [[Name of Afghanistan|Afgh<U+00E1>nist<U+00E1>n]], from a place which is called in the [[Pashto language|Afgh<U+00E1>n tongue]] <U+201C>Shargar<U+00ED>,<U+201D>* but in the Mult<U+00E1>n tongue <U+201C>Rohr<U+00ED>.<U+201D> It is a ridge, a spur of the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaim<U+00E1>n Mountains]], about six or seven kos in length, situated on the banks of the [[Gomal River|Gumal]].

During his early age, Farid was given a village in Fargana, Delhi(comprising present day districts of Bhojpur, Buxar, Bhabhua of Bihar) by Omar Khan, the [[counsel]]or and [[courtier]] of Bahlul Khan Lodi. Farid Khan and his father, who had several wives, did not get along for a while so he decided to run away from home. When his father discovered that he fled to serve Jamal Khan, the governor of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh]], he wrote Jamal Khan a letter that stated:{{quote|''"Far<U+00ED>d Kh<U+00E1>n, being an<U+00AD>noyed with me, has gone to you without sufficient cause.

Farid replied in a letter:{{quote|''"If my father wants me back to instruct me in learning, there are in this city many learned men: I will study here."''<ref name="Sarwari-79"/>}}

==Conquering Bihar and Bengal==
Farid Khan started his service under Bahar Khan Lohani, the Mughal Governor of [[Bihar]].<ref name=bpedia/><ref name=Britannica/> Because of his valor, Bahar Khan rewarded him the title ''Sher Khan'' (''Tiger Lord''). After the death of Bahar Khan, Sher Khan became the regent ruler of the minor Sultan, Jalal Khan. Later sensing the growth Sher Shah's power in Bihar, Jalal sought assistance of [[Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah]], the independent Sultan of [[Bengal]]. Ghiyasuddin sent an army under General Ibrahim Khan. But, Sher Khan defeated the force at the battle of Surajgarh in 1534. Thus he achieved complete control of Bihar.<ref name=bpedia/> 

In 1538, Sher Khan attacked Bengal and defeated Ghiyashuddin Shah.<ref name=bpedia/> But he could not capture the kingdom because of sudden expedition of [[Humayun|Emperor Humayun]].<ref name=bpedia/> In 1539, Sher Khan faced Humayun in the battle of Chausa. He forced Humayun out of India. Assuming the title ''Sher Shah'', he ascended the throne of Delhi.<ref name=Britannica/>

==Battle of Sammel==

In 1543, Sher Shah Suri set out against [[Rajputana]] with a huge force of 80,000 cavalry. With an army of 50,000 cavalry, [[Maldeo Rathore]] advanced to face Sher Shah's army. Instead of marching to the enemy's capital Sher Shah halted in the village of Sammel in the pargana of Jaitaran, ninety kilometers east of Jodhpur. After one month, Sher Shah's position became critical owing to the difficulties of food supplies for his huge army. To resolve this situation, Sher Shah resorted to a cunning ploy. One evening, he dropped forged letters near the Maldeo's camp in such a way that they were sure to be intercepted. These letters indicated, falsely, that some of Maldeo's army commanders were promising assistance to Sher Shah. This caused great consternation to Maldeo, who immediately (and wrongly) suspected his commanders of disloyalty. Maldeo left for Jodhpur with his own men, abandoning his commanders to their fate.

After that Maldeo's innocent generals Jaita and Kunpa fought with the just 20,000 men against an enemy force of 80,000 men. In the ensuing battle of Sammel (also known as battle of Giri Sumel), Sher Shah emerged victorious, but several of his generals lost their lives and his army suffered heavy losses. Sher Shah is said to have commented that "for a few grains of bajra (millet, which is the main crop of barren Marwar) I almost lost the entire kingdom of Hindustan."

After this victory, Sher Shah's general Khavass Khan took possession of Jodhpur and occupied the territory of Marwar from Ajmer to Mount Abu in 1544. But by July, Maldeo reoccupied his lost territories.

==Government and administration==

The system of tri-metalism which came to characterize Mughal coinage was introduced by Sher Shah. While the term ''r<U+016B>pya'' had previously been used as a generic term for any [[silver]] coin, during his rule the term ''r<U+016B>piya'' came to be used as the name for a silver coin of a standard weight of 178 grains, which was the precursor of the modern [[rupee]].<ref name="RBI">{{Cite web |url=http://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-mogul.html|title=Mughal Coinage|work=|publisher=[[Reserve Bank of India]] RBI Monetary Museum|date=|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref> ''Rupee'' is today used as the national currency in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Maldives]], [[Seychelles]] among other countries. [[Gold coin]]s called the ''[[Mohur]]'' weighing 169 grains and [[copper]] [[coin]]s called ''[[Dam (Indian coin)|Dam]]'' were also minted by his government.<ref name="RBI"/><ref>[[s:1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica/rupee|Rupee]] {{1911}}.</ref>

Sher Shah built monuments including [[Rohtas Fort]] (now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Pakistan]]), many structures in the [[Rohtasgarh Fort]] in [[Bihar]], [[Sher Shah Suri Masjid]], in [[Patna]], built in 1540<U+2013>1545 to commemorate his reign.

[[Purana_Qila,_Delhi#Qila-i-Kuhna_Mosque|Qila-i-Kuhna mosque]], built by Sher Shah in 1541, at [[Purana Qila, Delhi]], a Humayun citadel started in 1533, and later extended by him, along with the construction of [[Purana_Qila,_Delhi#Sher_Mandal|Sher Mandal]], an octagonal building inside the Purana Qila complex, which later served as the library of Humayun.

''[[Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi]]'' (''History of Sher Shah''), written by Abbas Khan Sarwani, a ''waqia-navis'' under later Mughal Emperor, [[Akbar]] around 1580, provides a detailed documentation about Sher Shah's administration.

==Death and succession==
{{Further|Sher Shah Suri Tomb}}
[[File:Sher Shah Suri Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sher Shah Suri Tomb]] at [[Sasaram]]]]
Sher Shah is believed to have died from a gunpowder explosion during the siege of [[Kalinjar fort]] on 22 May 1545, while fighting against the Chandel Rajputs. His death has also been claimed to have been caused by a fire in his store room.

Sher Shah Suri was succeeded by his son, Jalal Khan who took the title of [[Islam Shah Suri]]. His mausoleum, the [[Sher Shah Suri Tomb]] (122&nbsp;ft high) stands in the middle of an artificial lake at [[Sasaram]], a town that stands on the [[Grand Trunk Road]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Artibus Asiae |author= Catherine B.

==Legacy==

===Grand Trunk Road===
[[File:GTRoad Ambala.jpg|thumb|right|For centuries, the [[Grand Trunk Road]] has served as the main artery from travel across [[northern India]]. A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the [[British Raj]].]]

Mughals extended [[Grand Trunk Road]] westwards: at one time, it extended to [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]], crossing the [[Khyber Pass]].  The road was later improved by the [[United Kingdom|British]] rulers of [[British Raj|colonial India]]. It was extended to run from [[Calcutta]] to [[Peshawar]] (present-day Pakistan). Over the centuries, the road acted as a major [[trade route]]s in the region and facilitated both travel and postal communication. Since the era of Sher Shah, the road was dotted with ''[[caravansarai]]''s (highway inns) at regular intervals, and trees were planted on both sides of the road to give shade to the travellers and merchants. Sher Shah made many road for tax free trade.The Grand Trunk Road is still used for transportation in present day India & Pakistan.

===Shersabadia community===
Some soldiers were left behind by Sher Shah Suri as he escaped from [[Bengal]], avoiding the [[Humayun]] invasion. These people are known as Shersabadia. They made a colony named Shershahabad which is no more due to a course change of [[Ganges]]. Today the people of this community are found in parts of [[Malda District|Malda]], [[Murshidabad District|Murshidabad]], [[Chapai Nawabganj]] and a few other parts of and to be believed some parts not in India[[Bengal]].

===Karachi===
[[Sher Shah (Karachi)|Sher Shah neighbourhood]] and [[Sher Shah Bridge]] in [[Kiamari Town]] of [[Karachi]] and Sher Shah Park in [[Wah Cantonment|Wah Cantt]], [[Pakistan]], are named in the honour of Sher Shah Suri.
