In March 2010 Mexican [[professional wrestling]] promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) held three [[CMLL Super Viernes]] shows, all of which took place [[Arena M<U+00E9>xico]] on Friday nights. On Friday March 19, CMLL held a [[Pay-Per-View]] (PPV) instead, replacing the regular Super Viernes show. Some of the matches from Super Viernes are taped for CMLL's weekly shows that air in Mexico the week following the Super Viernes show. Super Viernes often features [[narrative thread|storyline]] feud between two wrestlers or group of wrestlers that develop from week to week, often coming to a conclusion at a major CMLL event or in a match on Friday nights between the individuals. In total Super Viernes featured 18 matches and 67 wrestlers appeared in matches during March, including six women and six ''[[Lucha libre#Mini-Estrellas|Mini-Estrellas]]''. CMLL only held one match featuring the women's division, two featuring the ''Mini-Etrellas'' and four ''Lightning'' matches. [[El Felino]], [[Negro Casas]], [[Volador, Jr.]], [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]] and [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]] are the only wrestlers to appear on all three Super Vierens shows in March.

The featured storyline through out march centered around the build-up to the maine vent of the ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2010)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' that took place on March 19, 2010 and involved [[M<U+00ED>stico]] and El Felino going against La Sombra and Volador, Jr. with their mask on the line. The main events of both shows leading up to the event saw M<U+00ED>stico team with El Felino and [[[Negro Casas]] to take on Volador, Jr., La Sombra and either [[Mascara Dorada]] or [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La M<U+00E1>scara]]. Mascara Dorada was injured during the March 5, 2010 Super Luchas and had to be replaced by La M<U+00E1>scara in the following week. The storyline between the foud did not conclude right after ''Dos Leyendas'' as the now unmasked Felino was cheered by the crowd during his first unmasked match while La Sombra, who won the mask from Felino, was more or less ignored by the crowd. 

Super Viernes also focused on a feud between ''[[Lucha libre#Mini-Estrellas|Mini-Estrellas]]'' [[Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior]] and [[Bracito de Oro]]. The storyline had started in January and continued through March without a clear resolution. Not all the events of March were scripted, especially the firing of ''Mini-Estrella'' [[Mascarita Dorada]] who was fired by CMLL for on working a tour of Europe that CMLL did not approve off.<ref name=DoradaFired>{{cite web | url=http://www.fuegoenelring.com/articles_noticias_full.php?articles_id=648 | title= Mascarita Dorada fuera del CMLL | date= March 10, 2010 | accessdate= March 10, 2010 | publisher= Fuego en el Ring | language=Spanish}}</ref> By the end of March the name appeared on the CMLL booking sheet for the April 2, 2010 Super Viernes, leading to speculation that CMLL may have given the name and outfit to another wrestler. It turned out to be the original Mascarita Dorada who may have mended fenses with CMLL.

The main event of the March 5, 2010 Super Viernes was a repeat of the main event from the previous week as [[Volador, Jr.]], [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]] and [[Mascara Dorada]] faced [[M<U+00ED>stico]] and ''La Peste Negra'' ([[El Felino]] and [[Negro Casas]]), building to the main event of the 2010 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2010)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'', a match between Volador, Jr., La Sombra, M<U+00ED>stico and El Felino where two of the wrestlers will put their mask on the line.<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880>{{cite news | author = Rosas, Arturo Plata | title = Sobre M<U+00ED>stico! | url = http://mianoticias.com.mx/miaeditorial/ovaciones/06032010/pdf/06032010.pdf#page=23 | work =Ovaciones | publisher = Editorial Ovaciones, S.

During the entrance of Volador, Jr., La Sombra and Mascara Dorada the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|Rudo]]'' (villain) team attakced them with M<U+00ED>stico and Volador, Jr. fighting on the ramp. The first fall ended when El Felino was disqualified for kicking El Felino in the groin. Following the disqualification El Felino tore La Sombra's mask off so that he had to go back to the locker rooms and get a new mask before the second fall could start.<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880/><ref name=FuegoMarch5/> In the second fall the ''rudo'' team dominated early on but Volador and his team fought back, regaining control through their teamwork. At one point M<U+00ED>stico and Volador, Jr. fought outside the ring with the crowd being split in their support for Volador, Jr. and M<U+00ED>stico. During the second fall Mascara Dorada ended up hurting himself as he lept from the ring and was on the floor for the remaineder of the fall. The ''tecnico'' team gained the victory when Volador, Jr. and La Sombra double-teamed M<U+00ED>stico with a [[Moonsault#Moonsault slam|Spanish Fly]] (A move where the two wrestlers throw their opponent off the top rope) and a pinfall, winning the match two falls to none.<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880/><ref name=FuegoMarch5/> After the match Mascara Dorada was removed from ringside on a stretcher.<ref name=Ovaciones21880/>

In the semi-main event the building storyline between [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]] and [[Jon Andersen|Jon Strongman]] continued as ''[[Los Guerreros del Infierno|Los Guerreros del Atl<U+00E1>ntida]]'' (Guerrero, [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[Rey Bucanero]]) took on Strongman, [[Jos<U+00E9> Luis Jair Soria|Shocker]] and [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La M<U+00E1>scara]] in a traditional [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Best two out of three falls Six-man tag team match]]. The first fall saw Strongman pin Atlantis while Shocker forced both Guerrero and Bucanero to submit in 3 minutes and 56 seconds. When Strongman was in the ring he dominated the opposition due to his sheer size, only giving ''Los Guerreros'' an advantage when his partners were in the ring. The second fall came after 4 minutes and 19 seconds when Los Guerreros applied a "Triple [[Boston Crab|Crab]] on Shocker and La M<U+00E1>scara to force the submission, tying the score one to one. The final fall saw ''Los Guerreros'' all team up to overcome Strongman, applying a powerbomb that took all three wrestlers to execute, followed by a pinfall victory for ''Los Guerreros.''<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880/><ref name=FuegoMarch5/>

The undercard saw ''Los Hijos del Averno'' ([[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]] and [[Ephesto]]) and [[Vangelis (wrestler)|Vangelis]] defate the team of [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]], [[Stuka, Jr.]] and [[Metro (wrestler)|Metro]] as ''Los Hijos'' and Vangelis won the first and the third fall.<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880/><ref name=FuegoMarch5/> In the ''Lighting match'' veteran [[Raziel (wrestler)|Raziel]] defeated CMLL rookie [[Diamante (wrestler)|Diamante]], needing less than six minutes of the 10 minute time limit.<ref name=LuchasMarch5/><ref name=Ovaciones21880/><ref name=FuegoMarch5/>

The main event of the March 12, 2010 Super Viernes was originally scheduled to be [[Volador, Jr.]], [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]] and [[Mascara Dorada]] facing [[M<U+00ED>stico]] and ''La Peste Negra'' ([[El Felino]] and [[Negro Casas]]) for the third week in a row. In the days before the event it was announced that [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La M<U+00E1>scara]] would replace Mascara Dorada in the match, due to the injure he suffered during the previous week's show.<ref name=Ovaciones21880/> The show was the last Super Viernes show before the 2010 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2010)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' and the main event built directly to the main event of ''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas''. While there was an underlying storyline between Negro Casas and La M<U+00E1>scara (who had teamed up for the ''Nacional Parejas Incredibles'' tournament) the main focus was naturally the storyline between M<U+00ED>stico, Volador, Jr, El Felino and La Sombra. The match quickly ran out of control of the referee as M<U+00ED>stico and Volador, Jr. fought outside the ring through out the entire first fall. At one point M<U+00ED>stico threw a glass of beer at Volador, Jr. and later on [[powerbomb]]ed him on the commentator's table, a tactic that's more unusual in Mexico than in the US. The first fall ended when La M<U+00E1>scara forced Negro Casas to submit and Volador, Jr. pinned El Felino. During the second fall La Sombra began limping due to an injury he had suffered the previous week, something El Felino took full advantage off and pinned La Sombra after an elbow off the top rope. Negro Casas clinched the second fall for his team by forcing Volador, Jr. to submit to a [[Boston Crab]] submission hold. M<U+00ED>stico's team got the third and deciding pinfall after 8:31 of action, the first ''Super Viernes'' victory for M<U+00ED>stico since he turned ''Rudo'' in late January. The victory came at a price though, while M<U+00ED>stico was gloating about knocking Volador, Jr. down with a move El Felino snug in behind his partner's back and pinned Volador, Jr. for the victory. While El Felino and Negro Casas celebrated their victory a frustrated M<U+00ED>stico left the arena without even acknowledging the victory.<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12>{{cite web | url= http://www.fuegoenelring.com/articles_luchas_full.php?articles_id=656 | title= M<U+00ED>stico, nuevamente contra Felino | date= March 13, 2010 | accessdate= March 18, 2010 | publisher= Fuego en el Ring | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=ESTOMarch12>{{cite web | url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n1555967.htm | title= M<U+00ED>stico y Felino, en problemas | date= March 14, 2010 | accessdate= March 18, 2010 | publisher= ESTO: OEM Enlina | language=Spanish}}</ref>

The semi-main event featured [[Blue Panther]], [[Brazo de Plata]] and [[H<U+00E9>ctor Garza]] taking on the team of [[Mr. Niebla]] and ''[[Los Guerreros del Infierno|Los Guerreros del Atl<U+00E1>ntida]]'' ([[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]]). The interaction between Mr. Niebla and Brazo the Plata, who is the father of Niebla's [[tag team]] partner [[Maximo (wrestler)|M<U+00E1>ximo]] was one of the key storylines in the match, but in the end it came down to <U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero pretending that H<U+00E9>ctor Garza had landed a low blow and convinced the referee to disqualify the team of Garza, Brazo de Plata and Blue Panther.<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12/> Following the match Garza complained that the referee always seemed to side with Guerrero in these matters.<ref name=ESTOMarch12/>

The ''Lighing match'' saw the rivalry of [[Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior]] and [[Bracito de Oro]] build even further. During the match Bracito de Oro dove out of the ring and ended up cutting his arm on something, leaving him bleeding and favoring the hurt arm. The injury forced the two to cut the match short as Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior abruptly pulled Bracito de Oro's mask off to force a disqualification.<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12/><ref name=ESTOMarch12/> After the match Bracito de Oro received medical attention but was fortunately not injured too severely as he wrestled again only a few days later March 15, 2010.

In other matches: The [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship|CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions]] [[Flash (wrestler)|Fuego]] and [[Stuka, Jr.]] teamed up with newcomer [[Rush (wrestler)|Rush]] to defeat ''Los Cancerberos del Infierno'' ([[Virus (wrestler)|Virus]], [[Euforia (wrestler)|Euforia]] and [[P<U+00F3>lvora]]).<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12/><ref name=ESTOMarch12/> ''Los Cancerberos'' have been constant rivals for the Coliseo Tag Team champions and want to challenge Stuka, Jr., [[Mascara Dorada]] and [[Metro (wrestler)|Metro]] for the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] at some point. The experienced ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|Rudo]]'' (villain) team ''[[Guerreros Tuareg]]'' ([[Doctor X (wrestler)|Doctor X]], [[Hooligan (wrestler)|Hooligan]] and [[Nitro (wrestler)|Nitro]] defeated the rookie team of [[Delta (wrestler)|Delta]], [[Diamante (wrestler)|Diamante]] and [[Guerrero Maya, Jr.]] in the ''segunda'' (second match) of the night.<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12/><ref name=ESTOMarch12/> In the opening match rookie [[M<U+00E9>talico (wrestler)|M<U+00E9>talico]] teamed up with the veteran [[Tigre Blanco]] to defeat [[Camorra (wrestler)|Camora]] and [[Zayco]] in what was Camorra and Zayco's first ''Super Viernes'' match of 2010.<ref name=LuchasMarch12/><ref name=FuegoMarch12/><ref name=ESTOMarch12/>

The March 26, 2010 Super Viernes was the first wrestling apperance of [[El Felino]] after losing his mask to [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]] the previous Friday at the 2010 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2010)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]''. The main event of the show featured Sombra teaming with [[Volador, Jr.]] and [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] against ''La Peste Negra'' ([[Negro Casas]] and El Felino) and [[<U+00DA>ltimo Guerrero]]. While Felino was on the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' (bad guy) side of the match he was the clear crowd favorite, being called a "Rudo idol" by ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine.<ref name=LuchasMarch26/> The match saw Sombra, Volador, Jr. and Shocker win two falls to one when El Felino fouled La Sombra in clear view of the referee for the disqualification, which was only a background to Felino being cheered and La Sombra being mostly ignored by the crowd.<ref name=LuchasMarch26/><ref name=FuegoMarch26>{{cite web | url=http://www.fuegoenelring.com/articles_luchas_full.php?articles_id=691 | title= Como una Simple Sombra | author= Mejia, Juan | date= March 27, 2010 | accessdate= March 31, 2010 | publisher= Fuego en el Ring | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=Ovaciones21901>{{cite news | author = Rosas, Arturo Plata | title = Despert<U+00F3> una Fiera! | url = http://mianoticias.com.mx/miaeditorial/ovaciones/27032010/pdf/27032010.pdf#page=22 | work =Ovaciones | publisher = Editorial Ovaciones, S.

In the semi-main event [[El Texano, Jr.]] and [[El Terrible]] had to put their storyline feud with the Japanese ''La Ola Amarilla'' ("The Yellow Wave") to the side as they teamed up with ''Ola Amarilla'' member [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] to take on the makeshift team of [[Blue Panther]], [[H<U+00E9>ctor Garza]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Alvarado Nieves|Brazo de Plata]]. [[Maximo (wrestler)|M<U+00E1>ximo]] was originally scheduled to team with his father, but was replaced by [[Blue Panther]] at the night of the show without an explanation. Texano, Jr. was able to gain the third and deciding fall over Garza after a miscommunication between Garza and Brazo de Plata. Following the match the two argued over the outcome of the match as Texano, Jr., Terrible and Taichi celebrated their victory.<ref name=LuchasMarch26/><ref name=FuegoMarch26/><ref name=Ovaciones21901/>

The storyline between [[Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior]] and [[Bracito de Oro]] continued in the second match of the night, a ''[[Lucha libre#Mini-Estrellas|Mini-Estrella]]'' [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Best two out of three falls Six-man tag team match]] where Bracito de Oro teamed up with [[Electrico (wrestler)|El<U+00E9>ctrico]] and [[Astral (wrestler)|Astral]] to defeate Peque<U+00F1>o Warrior, [[Peque<U+00F1>o Violencia]] and [[Pierrothito]] when Bracito de Oro pinned Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior for the final fall.<ref name=LuchasMarch26/><ref name=FuegoMarch26/><ref name=Ovaciones21901/> In the week following this match both Bracito de Oro and Peque<U+00F1>o Black Warrior visited the CMLL headquarters, presumably to discuss terms for a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuesta]]'', or mask vs. mask match between the two. 

The opening match saw the third generation Casas family, [[Puma King]] and [[Tiger Kid]] take on and defeat [[Robin (wrestler)|Robin]], himself a third generation wrestler himself as part of the [[Jos<U+00E9> Alvarado Nieves#The Brazo Family|Alvarado Nieves]] family (son of [[Brazo Cibernetico]]) and [[Bengala]] who uses a similar tiger inspired ring character. This was the first Super Viernes in 2010 for all four wrestlers.<ref name=LuchasMarch26/><ref name=FuegoMarch26/><ref name=Ovaciones21901/>
