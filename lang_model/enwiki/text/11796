'''William Wilberforce''' ([[August 24]] [[1759]] &ndash; [[July 29]] [[1833]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[politician]] and [[philanthropist]]. A native of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Yorkshire]], he began his political career in 1780 and became the independent [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] (1784<U+2013>1812). A close friend of [[Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], in 1785 he underwent a [[Religious conversion|conversion]] experience and became an [[evangelical Christian]]. In 1787 he came into contact with [[Thomas Clarkson]] and a group of [[abolitionist|anti-slave trade]] activists, including [[Granville Sharp]], [[Beilby Porteus]], [[Hannah More]] and [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Lord Middleton]].

At their suggestion, Wilberforce was persuaded to take on the cause; he became one of the leading English [[abolitionists]], heading the [[parliamentary]] campaign against the British [[slave trade]], which he saw through to the eventual passage of the [[Slave Trade Act]] in 1807.

Wilberforce also championed many other causes and campaigns, including the [[Society for Suppression of Vice]], [[Charity school]]s, the introduction of [[Christianity]] to [[India]], the foundation of the [[Church Mission Society]] and the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. His underlying conservatism also led him to support politically and socially repressive legislation and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices suffered at home while, at the same time, campaigning for the enslaved in the [[West Indies]].

In later years Wilberforce supported the campaign for complete abolition, which eventually led to the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] in 1833; this Act paved the way for the complete abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]].  A tireless campaigner for the abolition of [[slavery]], Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through [[British parliament|Parliament]] was secure. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], close to his friend William Pitt.

==Early life==
William Wilberforce was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] on [[24 August]] [[1759]], the only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728&ndash;1768), a wealthy merchant and his wife Elizabeth. His grandfather William (1690&ndash;1776) had made the family fortune through the [[Eastland Company|Baltic]] trade and had been elected mayor of Hull on two occasions.<ref>Pollock, p.3</ref> The Wilberforces were an old Yorkshire family, the name deriving from the village of [[Wilberfoss]], eight miles east of [[York]].<ref name=DNB>{{Citation

In 1768, with his mother struggling to cope, Wilberforce was sent to live with a prosperous uncle and aunt in St James' Place, [[London]] and in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], at that time a village to the south-west of London. He attended an "indifferent" boarding school in [[Putney]] for two years, spending his holidays in Wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives<ref>Hague, pp.6<U+2013>8</ref> and was influenced towards [[evangelical Christianity]] by his aunt Hannah, the sister of [[John Thornton (philanthropist)|John Thornton]] and a supporter of [[George Whitefield]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Citation

His mother and grandfather, concerned at these [[nonconformist]] influences and the young Wilberforce's leanings towards [[Methodism]] and evangelicalism, brought him back to Hull in 1771 &ndash; he was heartbroken by the separation.<ref>Hague, pp.14<U+2013>15</ref> His family opposing a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist, Wilberforce continued his education at nearby [[Pocklington School]] between 1771 and 1776.<ref>Pollock, pp.5<U+2013>6</ref><ref>Hague, p.15</ref> He succeeded especially in [[English poetry]] and was known as a fine singer.<ref>Pollock, pp.6,8</ref> Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life but with his religious fervour diminishing, he embraced theatre-going, attending balls and playing cards.<ref>Hague, pp.18<U+2013>19</ref>

==Early parliamentary career==
With little interest in being involved in the family business, Wilberforce, still at university, began to consider entering politics and seeking election to Parliament. He renewed his friendship with future [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the younger]] and during the winter of 1779<U+2013>80 they frequently watched debates in the chamber of the House of Commons from the gallery. It was at this time that Pitt, already set on a political career, encouraged Wilberforce to join him as soon as they were both able to obtain seats.<ref name =H24> Hague pp.24<U+2013>25</ref><ref>Pollock, p.9</ref> In September 1780, at the age of twenty-one and still a student at Cambridge, he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for Kingston upon Hull,<ref name=ODNB/> spending over <U+00A3>8,000 on ensuring he received the necessary votes, as was the custom of the time.<ref>Pollock, p.11</ref><ref> Hochschild (2005), p.125</ref>  Wilberforce sat as an independent, resolving to be "no party man".<ref name =H24/> His first recorded speeches were in 1781, when he took part in debates regarding [[smuggling]] and naval [[shipbuilding]].<ref name= ODNB/>  Wilberforce attended Parliament regularly, but he also maintained his lively social life, becoming a regular attender at [[gentlemen's club|gentlemen's gambling clubs]] such as Goostree's in [[Pall Mall]]. He was an excellent mimic and singer &ndash; the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] reportedly said that he would go anywhere to hear Wilberforce sing, and he used his mesmerizing speaking voice to great effect in political speeches.<ref>Hochschild, pp.125<U+2013>6</ref> [[James Boswell]] witnessed Wilberforce's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted: 
"I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; but as I listened, he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale."<ref name="titleSickly shrimp of a man who sank the slave ships - Times Online">{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article1563804.ece |title=Sickly shrimp of a man who sank the slave ships|accessdate=2007-11-27 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2005-03-25 |format= |work= |publisher= The Sunday Times }}</ref>
During the political upheaval of 1781&ndash;1784, Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates,<ref>Hague, pp.44<U+2013>52</ref> and in autumn 1783 Pitt, Wilberforce and [[Edward James Eliot|Edward Eliot]], Pitt's brother-in-law, travelled to [[France]].<ref name= ODNB/> After a difficult start in [[Rheims]], where their presence initially aroused police suspicion that they were English spies, they travelled to [[Paris]], where they met [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], [[Marie Antoinette]] and [[Louis XVI]], and joined the French court at [[Fontainebleau]].<ref>Pollock, p.23</ref><ref>Hague, pp.53<U+2013>55</ref> 

Pitt became prime minister in December 1783 and Wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government.<ref>Pollock, pp.23<U+2013>24</ref> Despite their close friendship, there is no record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce's wish to remain an independent MP.  Alternatively, Wilberforce's frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as his chronic eye problems, may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material.<ref>Hague, pp.52<U+2013>53, 59</ref> When Parliament was dissolved in spring 1784, Wilberforce decided to run as a candidate for the county of [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]], and was soon recognised as a compromise Pittite candidate in the [[British general election, 1784|1784 General Election]].<ref name= ODNB/> On 6 April, when the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] were defeated, he was returned as MP at the age of twenty-four.<ref>Pollock, p.31</ref>

==Conversion==
In October 1784 Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would change his life and ultimately his whole future career. He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of [[Isaac Milner]], the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster, who had been [[Fellow]] of [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]], Cambridge in the year that Wilberforce first went up. They went to the [[French Riviera]], enjoying the usual pastimes of dinners, cards and gambling.<ref>Hague, pp.70<U+2013>2</ref>  However, in February 1785 Wilberforce returned temporarily to United Kingdom in order to support Pitt<U+2019>s proposals for parliamentary reforms, later rejoining the party in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], and continuing the tour to [[Switzerland]].  Milner accompanied him to England, and on the journey they read [[Philip Doddridge]]'s ''Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul'' together.<ref>Hague, pp.72<U+2013>4</ref> 

This is thought to have been the beginning of Wilberforce<U+2019>s spiritual journey, and he began to rise early to read the [[Bible]] and pray, as well as to keep a personal private journal.<ref>Pollock, p.37</ref> He underwent an evangelical [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]], regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God.<ref name= ODNB/> He sought guidance from [[John Newton]], a leading evangelical [[Anglican]] clergyman of the day and Rector of [[St Mary Woolnoth]] in the [[City of London]].<ref>Pollock, p.38</ref> Both Newton and Pitt counselled him to remain in politics, and he resolved to do so "with increased diligence and conscientiousness."<ref name= ODNB/> His conversion changed some of his habits but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, urging others towards his new faith but never imposing it.<ref>Hague, pp.99<U+2013>102</ref> Inwardly, he became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his failures in spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.<ref>Hague, pp.207<U+2013>10</ref>

In 1786 Wilberforce began his forays into societal improvement by introducing the Registration Bill, a parliamentary reform measure, which would have required voters to be registered in advance, and for polls to be held in various locations on the same day, rather than over several days in the county town.<ref name= ODNB/><ref>Hague, p.97</ref> He also brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the [[dissection]] after [[execution]] of those convicted of murder to further include other criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves, and to reduce the sentences on women convicted of [[treason]] (at this time in English Common Law treason referred to the murder of a woman's husband, rather than an act against the government) from [[execution by burning]] to [[hanging]]. Both were passed by the Commons but defeated in the Lords.<ref>Hague, pp.97<U+2013>9</ref><ref>Pollock, pp.40<U+2013>2</ref>

==Abolition of the slave trade==
===Initial decision ===
In 1783 Wilberforce, while dining with his old [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] friend, Gerard Edwards, at his home in [[Curzon Street]], [[London]],<ref>Pollock, p.50</ref> had met a former ship's surgeon [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|Rev. James Ramsay,]] who had become a clergyman on the island of St. Christopher (later [[St. Kitts]]) and medical supervisor of the [[plantation economy|plantations]] there. What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions of the [[slaves]] both at sea and on the plantations horrified him and, returning to England fifteen years later, he accepted the living of [[Teston, Kent]] <U+2013> where in 1786 he met with [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Sir Charles Middleton]], Lady Middleton, [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Hannah More]] and others to campaign against the slave trade, a group later to become known as the Testonites.<ref name= H138>Hague, pp.138<U+2013>9</ref>

[[Image:William Wilberforce01.jpg|thumb|220px|left|William Wilberforce engraving after [[George Richmond]] ]]
Inspired by his new faith, Wilberforce was showing an increasing interest in humanitarian reform, and in November 1786 Wilberforce received a letter from Sir Charles Middleton which was to re-ignite his interest in the subject of the slave trade.<ref>Pollock, p.48</ref><ref>Tomkins, p.55</ref>  At the urging of Lady Middleton, Sir Charles suggested that Wilberforce should bring forward the cause of the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament. Wilberforce's response that "he felt the great importance of the subject, and thought himself unequal to the task allotted to him, but yet would not positively decline it". <ref>Hague, p.140</ref>  He continued to read widely, and met with the Testonites at Middleton<U+2019>s home at Barham Court in Teston in the early winter of 1787.<ref>Pollock, p.53</ref>

In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson, a fellow graduate of St. John's, Cambridge, who had become convinced of the need to end the slave trade after writing an essay on the subject,<ref name = H138/> called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a copy of his work.<ref name=Metaxas>{{cite book

The [[Quaker]] members of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] also recognised their need for influence within Parliament and urged Clarkson to secure an immediate commitment from Wilberforce that he would bring forward the case for abolition in the House of Commons.<ref>Hochschild, p.122</ref> 

It was arranged that Bennet Langton, a [[Lincolnshire]] landowner and mutual acquaintance of Wilberforce and Clarkson, would organise a dinner party in order to ask Wilberforce to formally agree to lead the cause in Parliament.<ref>Pollock, p.56</ref> The dinner took place on [[13 March]], [[1787]], other guests including Charles Middleton, [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[William Windham]], MP, James Boswell and [[Isaac Hawkins Browne (coalowner)|Isaac Hawkins Browne]], MP. By the end of the evening they had elicited the response that they sought, and Wilberforce agreed in general terms that he would be willing to bring the measure forward in Parliament, "provided that no person more proper could be found".<ref>Hochschild, pp.122<U+2013>4</ref>

The same spring, on [[12 May]] [[1787]], the still hesitant Wilberforce held a conversation with William Pitt and future Prime Minister [[William Grenville]], as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt's estate in Kent.<ref name =ODNB/> Under what came to be known as the 'Wilberforce Oak' at [[Holwood House|Holwood]], Pitt challenged his friend: "Wilberforce, why don<U+2019>t you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you. Do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another."<ref>Tomkins, p.57</ref> This meeting was critical in Wilberforce<U+2019>s decision to take up the cause, and, although his response is not recorded, he later declared in old age that he could "distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville."<ref>Pollock, p.58, quoting Harford, p.139</ref>

===Early parliamentary action===
Following highly successful efforts to raise public awareness and support by the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, Wilberforce planned to move a motion giving notice that he would be bringing forward a bill for the [[Abolition of the Slave Trade]] during the 1789 parliamentary session.  However, in January 1788 he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, thought to be [[ulcerative colitis]].<ref>Pollock, pp.78<U+2013>9</ref><ref>Hague, pp.149<U+2013>57</ref> It was some months before he was able to resume work, and he spent some time convalescing at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastro-intestinal illnesses precipitated his regular use of moderate quantities of [[opium]], which proved effective in alleviating his condition,<ref>Hochschild, p.139</ref> and which he continued to use for the rest of his life.<ref>Pollock, pp.79<U+2013>81</ref>

During Wilberforce's absence, Pitt, long supportive of the cause, introduced the preparatory motion himself, and ordered a [[Privy Council]] investigation into the slave trade, followed by a House of Commons review.<ref>Pollock, p.82</ref><ref>Hague, p.159</ref>  

With the publication of the Privy Council report in April [[1789]], Wilberforce finally commenced his parliamentary campaign.<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0202305226}}</ref> After months of planning, on [[12 May]] [[1789]] he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the House of Commons, in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice. Drawing on Thomas Clarkson's evidence, he described in detail the appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from Africa in the [[middle passage]], and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the [[West Indies]]. He moved twelve resolutions condemning the slave trade, but made no reference to the abolition of slavery itself, instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished.<ref>Hague, pp.178<U+2013>83</ref><ref>Hochschild, p.160</ref> With the tide running against them, the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the House of Commons hear its own evidence, and Wilberforce, in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging the slave trade, reluctantly agreed.<ref>Hague, pp.185<U+2013>6</ref><ref>Hochschild, pp.161<U+2013>2</ref> The hearings were not completed by the end of the parliamentary session, and were deferred until the following year.<ref>Hague, p.187</ref>

In January 1790, Wilberforce succeeded in speeding up the hearings by gaining approval for a smaller Parliamentary [[select committee]] to consider the vast quantity of evidence.<ref>Hague, pp.189<U+2013>90</ref> Wilberforce's house in Old Palace Yard now became a centre for the abolitionists' campaign, and a focus for many of the principal strategy meetings.<ref name=ODNB/> Petitioners for other causes also besieged him there, his ante-room thronged from an early hour, like "Noah's Ark, full of beasts clean and unclean," according to Hannah More.<ref>Hochschild, p.188</ref><ref>Hague, pp.201<U+2013>2</ref><ref name =Life>{{Citation | last = Wilberforce| first = Robert Isaac |  | author-link = Robert Wilberforce

Interrupted by a general election in June 1790,<ref>Hague, p.193</ref> the committee finally finished hearing witnesses, and in April 1791 Wilberforce introduced the first [[Bill (proposed law)|Parliamentary Bill]] to abolish the slave trade with a closely-reasoned speech which lasted four hours.<ref>Pollock, pp.105<U+2013>8</ref> However, after two evenings of debate, the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88, the political climate having swung in a conservative direction in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], increasing radicalism and the slave revolts.<ref>Hague, pp.196<U+2013>8</ref> Such was the public hysteria of the time that Wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] agitator.<ref>{{cite book

This was the beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce's commitment never wavered, despite frustration and hostility. He was supported in his work by fellow members of the so-called [[Clapham Sect]], among whom were his best friend and cousin [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]] and Edward Eliot.<ref>Pollock, p.218</ref> Holding [[Evangelical Christian]] convictions, and consequently dubbed "the Saints", the group lived in large adjoining houses in [[Clapham]], then a village outside London.

On [[2 April]] [[1792]] Wilberforce again brought a bill calling for abolition. The memorable debate that followed brought contributions from the greatest orators in the house, William Pitt and [[Charles James Fox|Charles Fox]], as well as Wilberforce himself.<ref>Pollock, p.114</ref> [[Henry Dundas]], as [[home secretary]], proposed a compromise solution of so-called 'gradual abolition' over a number of years. This was passed by 230 to 85 votes, but the compromise was little more than a clever ploy, with the intention of ensuring that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely.<ref>Pollock, p.115</ref>

===War with France=== 
The outbreak of [[First Coalition|war with France]] in [[February]] [[1793]] effectively prevented further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis and the threat of invasion.  On [[26 February]] [[1793]], a vote to abolish the slave trade was narrowly defeated by only eight votes.<ref>Pollock, pp.122<U+2013>3</ref> Later the same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before parliament instead a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying foreign colonies with slaves.<ref>Hague, p. 242</ref>  Wilberforce was greatly concerned at the war he opposed, and tried to persuade Pitt to make greater efforts to end hostilities.<ref>Pollock, pp.121<U+2013>2</ref> Growing increasingly alarmed, on [[31 December]] [[1794]] he moved a motion urging the government to attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution with France, creating a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.<ref>Hague, pp.247<U+2013>9</ref> Abolition became associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with the radical societies in the United Kingdom.<ref>Hague, pp.237<U+2013>9</ref> Despite the increasing conservatism and the decreased public interest and support of abolition, Wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.<ref>Hochschild, p.252</ref><ref>Hague, p. 511</ref> 
The early years of the nineteenth century once again saw increased public interest in abolition. In 1804 Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade had successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons by June. However, it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support Wilberforce.<ref>Hague, pp.313<U+2013>20</ref> On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was at times held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous, nature and his deferential attitude towards those in power.<ref>Hague, p.511</ref>

===Final phase of the campaign===
With the death of Pitt in February 1806, Wilberforce began to collaborate more with the Whigs, especially the abolitionists in that party. He gave general support to the [[Ministry of All the Talents|Grenville-Fox administration]], which brought more abolitionists into the Cabinet;<ref>Hague, pp. 328<U+2013>30</ref> Wilberforce and Charles James Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons, while Lord Grenville advocated the cause in the House of Lords. A radical change of tactics, which involved the introduction of a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the [[French colonies]], was suggested by maritime lawyer [[James Stephen]].<ref>Pollock, p.201</ref> It was a smart move, as the majority of ships were, in fact, now flying American flags, though manned by British crews and sailing out of [[Liverpool]], and supplying foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war.<ref>Hague, p. 332<U+2013>4</ref>  A bill was introduced and approved by the Cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-restrained silence, so as not to draw attention to the effect of the bill.<ref>Hague, pp.335<U+2013>6</ref> The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed.<ref name = P11> Pollock, p.211</ref>   The new legislation effectively prohibited two-thirds of the British slave trade. This was in part enabled by [[Lord Nelson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], which had given Britain the sea power to ensure that any ban could be enforced.<ref name = BBC>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_wilberforce.shtml BBC Radio 4, In Our Time <U+2014> profile of William Wilberforce, [[22 February]] [[2007]]] accessed [[2007-09-13]]</ref>

Wilberforce and Clarkson had collected a large volume of evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent the latter part of 1806 writing ''A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade'', which was a comprehensive restatement of the evidence. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow to the abolitionists, and was followed quickly by a [[United Kingdom general election, 1806|general election in the autumn of 1806]].<ref>Hague, pp.342<U+2013>4, </ref>  Wilberforce was re-elected for Yorkshire,<ref name=H348>Hague, p. 348</ref> after which he returned to finishing and publishing his "letter", in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.<ref>Hague, p.351</ref> 

Lord Grenville, the Prime Minister, determined to introduce an Abolition Bill in the House of Lords rather than the House of Commons, taking it through its greatest challenge first.<ref name=H348/> When a final vote was taken the bill was passed in the House of Lords by a large margin.<ref>Tomkins, pp.166-8</ref> Sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated, [[Charles Grey]] (now Viscount Howick) moved for a second reading in the Commons on [[23 February]]. As tributes were made to Wilberforce, whose face streamed with tears, the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16.<ref name = P11/><ref> Hague, p. 354</ref>  The [[Slave Trade Act]] received the [[Royal assent]] on [[25 March]] [[1807]].<ref>Pollock, p.214</ref>

===Emancipation of enslaved Africans===

The hopes of the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither with the end of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living conditions of the enslaved improve. The trade continued with other countries not following suit with abolition, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries.<ref>Tomkins, pp.182-3</ref><ref name=hind/> 
[[Image:Wilberforce House.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A statue of William Wilberforce can be seen outside [[Wilberforce House]] in Hull, where Wilberforce was born.]] 
Wishing to be more involved with his family, in 1808 Wilberforce moved his family from Clapham to a sizeable mansion with a large garden in [[Kensington Gore]], closer to the Houses of Parliament. In ill-health, and after considerable reflection, Wilberforce [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned his Yorkshire seat]], and became Member for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Bramber]] in [[Sussex]], a seat with little or no constituency obligations,<ref>Hague, pp.377<U+2013>9, 401<U+2013>6</ref> although he continued to be deeply involved in parliamentary matters, including the emancipation of enslaved Africans.  By 1820, after a further period of poor health and with his eyesight failing, he took a decision to limit his public activities. Aware that the cause would need younger men to continue the work, in 1821 he asked fellow MP [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]] to take over leadership of the campaign in the Commons.<ref>Pollock, p.279</ref>

The year 1823 saw the founding of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]), <ref>Pollock, p.286</ref> and the publication of Wilberforce's 56-page ''Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies''.<ref>Pollock, p.285</ref>  In his treatise, Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was not only morally and ethically required, but also a matter of national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually free slaves. Parliamentarians did not quickly agree, and Wilberforce's call for abolition was stymied by government opposition in March 1823.<ref>Hague, pp.477<U+2013>9, 481</ref> On [[15 May]] [[1823]], Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation.<ref>Tomkins, p.203</ref> Subsequent debates followed on [[16 March]] and [[11 June]] [[1824]] in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons, and which again saw the abolitionists out-manoeuvred by the government.<ref>Pollock, p.289</ref><ref>Hague, p.480</ref>

Wilberforce's health was gradually failing. After further illness in 1824 and 1825 he resigned his seat in Parliament, leaving the campaign in the hands of others.<ref name=t207>Tomkins, p.207</ref>  Thomas Clarkson continued to travel, visiting anti-slavery groups all around Britain, and acting as an ambassador for the anti-slavery cause to other countries,<ref name=ODNBc/> and Buxton continued the fight for the reforms in Parliament.<ref name=Buxton>{{Citation

Public opinion was changing and a wave of popular agitation began the final push forward in spring 1833.<ref>Pollock, p.306</ref> On 26 July the Whig government made major concessions during the passage through the Commons of the  [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Bill for the Abolition of Slavery]] ensuring it would pass and that slaves in the colonies of the British Empire would be freed from August 1834. The news was rushed to the failing Wilberforce, who was in London. Three days later he died.<ref>Hague, pp.502<U+2013>3</ref> One month later, Parliament passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] which gave most enslaved people in the British Empire their freedom.<ref>For the definitive copy of the Act, see [http://www.justis.com/document.aspx?doc=aYuJmZaZn3WYuuf0iXGZmZmYnZmsmJaZi4uto&relpos=0 Slavery Abolition Act 1833] in the Justis.com Statute Law Database (subscription required), retrieved [[2007-11-02]], however an accurate transcript is available at http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm, retrieved [[2007-11-02]]</ref>

==Marriage and family==
Wilberforce had shown little interest in women, but, in his late thirties, twenty-year-old [[Barbara Spooner|Barbara Ann Spooner]] (1777&ndash;1847) was recommended as a potential bride.<ref>Hochschild, p.251</ref> He met her two days after, on [[15 April]] [[1797]], and was immediately smitten.<ref name =ODNB/> Following a whirlwind romance Wilberforce proposed eight days later.<ref>Pollock p.157</ref> Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple were married in Bath, Somerset on [[30 May]] [[1797]].<ref name =ODNB/><ref name=BBC/> The couple were devoted to each other, and though Barbara showed little interest in Wilberforce's political activities and tended to narrow-minded possessiveness, she was very attentive and supportive in his increasing ill-health.<ref name =ODNB/>  They had six children in less than ten years: William, (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), [[Robert Isaac Wilberforce]] (b. 1802), [[Samuel Wilberforce]] (b. 1805) and [[Henry William Wilberforce]] (b. 1807).<ref name =ODNB/>  Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play.<ref>Hague, p. 294<U+2013>5</ref>

==Other concerns==
===Evangelical Christianity===
A supporter of the Evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance would lead to a harmonious and moral society.<ref name=hind>{{cite journal

This was an exposition of [[New Testament]] doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, as a response to the moral decline of the nation. It was an influential work and illustrated his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him in his life's work.<ref>Pollock, pp.146<U+2013>53</ref>

Wilberforce believed in the importance of missionary activity, and was a founding member of the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]] (since renamed the Church Mission Society).<ref>Pollock, p.176</ref>  In 1793 Wilberforce used the renewal of the [[British East India Company]]'s charter to propose the addition of clauses requiring the company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to the "religious improvement" of Indians. This plan was unsuccessful due to the lobbying by the directors of the company, who feared their commercial interests would be damaged should the proposed legislation result in religious confrontations.<ref>Tomkins, pp.115<U+2013>6</ref>  Wilberforce tried again in 1813 when the charter next came up for renewal. Using public petitions and meetings, lobbying and letter writing, he successfully campaigned for changes to the charter.<ref name=hind/><ref name=T187/>  Speaking in favour of the [[British East India Company#Charter Act 1813|Charter Act 1813]] he condemned aspects of Hinduism including the caste system, infanticide, polygamy and suttee.

===Moral reform===
Greatly concerned by what he perceived as the degeneracy of British society, Wilberforce was also concerned with matters of moral reform.<ref name=T187/> He wrote in his personal journal, "God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners"<ref>{{cite book

At the suggestion of Wilberforce, together with [[Beilby Porteus|Bishop Porteus]]<ref>Pollock, p.60</ref> and other churchmen, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] requested [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to issue his ''Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice'' in 1787,<ref>Pollock, p.61</ref> which they saw as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality and vice.  The proclamation led to the creation of the [[Society for Suppression of Vice]] in 1802.<ref>Pollock, p.66</ref> This and other societies of which Wilberforce was a prime mover, such as the Proclamation Society, mobilised support for the prosecution of those who had allegedly broken relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornography or seditious material, and those who did not respect the sabbath.<ref name=hind/>  These societies were not very successful in terms of membership and support, but their activities did lead to the imprisonment of the publisher of [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]''.<ref>Hochschild, p.252</ref>  Wilberforce attempted to carry through Parliament measures against adultery and Sunday newspapers, but did not succeed.<ref name=hind/>  

Wilberforce was also keenly involved in other societies, including anti-slavery societies, which had no punitive functions; these were more successful, his inspiration encouraging others to show leadership in the reformation of British morals and manners, as well as social responsibility and resistance to secularisation. These societies were innovative in that they brought different social groups together for a common purpose, pioneering grassroots extra-parliamentary campaigning, and for the substantial involvement of women.<ref name=hind/><ref>Hochschild, p.6</ref>

===Political and social reform===
Wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order.  He promoted change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, and feared and opposed radical causes or revolution.<ref>Hague, p.446</ref>  To this end he supported suspension of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in 1795 and in 1817, and when war and a poor harvest led to public demonstrations, voted for Pitt's "Gagging Bills", which banned meetings of more than 50 people, allowed speakers to be arrested and imposed harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution.<ref>Hague, pp.250, 254<U+2013>6</ref><ref name=hind/> 

Wilberforce was opposed to workers' rights to organise for better pay, conditions and working hours and in 1799 he spoke in favour of the [[Combination Act]], which suppressed trade union activity throughout the United Kingdom, calling unions "a general disease in our society."<ref>Hague, p.286</ref><ref name=hind/>  He opposed an inquiry into the [[Peterloo Massacre]] in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform.<ref>Hague, pp.441<U+2013>2 </ref>
  
Amongst others, [[William Cobbett]] the radical writer, attacked what he saw as the hypocrisy of Wilberforce in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while British workers lived in terrible conditions at home.<ref>Hague, pp.440<U+2013>1</ref> "Never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country," he wrote.<ref>{{Citation | last = Cobbett | first = William | author-link = William Cobbett | title = Cobbett's Political Register | publisher = Cox and Baylis | year = 1823| url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=ci1bAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA518&dq=Never+have+you+done+one+single+act,+in+favour+of+the+labourers+of+this+country}}</ref>  The essayist [[William Hazlitt]] also criticised Wilberforce, describing him as  one "who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states."<ref>{{Citation | last = Hazlitt | first = William | author-link = William Hazlitt | title = The spirit of the age| place = London  | publisher = C.

Wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for [[Catholic emancipation]] which would have allowed Catholics to become MPs, hold public office and serve in the army,<ref>Tomkins, pp.172<U+2013>3</ref> but by 1813 had changed his views, and spoke in favour of such a bill.<ref>Hague, pp.406<U+2013>7</ref>

More progressively, from the late 1780s onward Wilberforce was an campaigner for parliamentary reform including the abolition of rotten boroughs and redistribution of the House of Commons seats to growing towns and cities, though by the time similar measures were passed in 1832 he was concerned they went too far.<ref>Hague pp.74, 498</ref><ref name=hind/>    Wilberforce advocated legislation to improve the working conditions for chimney-sweeps and textile workers, engaged in [[prison reform]], supported campaigns to restrict [[capital punishment]] and the severe punishments meted out under the Game Laws.<ref>Hague, p.447</ref>  With others, Wilberforce founded the first animal welfare organisation in the world, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (later the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]).<ref>Tomkins, p.207</ref> He was opposed to [[duelling]], which he described as the "disgrace of a Christian society" and was appalled when his friend Pitt engaged in a duel in 1798, particularly as it occurred on a Sunday, the Christian day of rest.<ref>Hague, pp.287<U+2013>8</ref><ref>Hochschild, p.299</ref> 

Wilberforce was personally generous with his time and money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to the needy. Yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their [[parishes]].  He paid off the debts of others, supported [[education]] and [[Mission (Christian)|missions]], and in a year of food shortages gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and could not bear to fire any of his servants.  As a result his home was full of old and disabled servants kept on in charity. Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions, and "livings" for clergymen, or having death sentences reprieved. He answered numerous letters with requests for help or advice, though was often months behind in his correspondence since he aimed to answer all of them personally.<ref>Hochschild, p.315</ref><ref>Hague, pp.211<U+2013>2, 295, 300</ref>

==Last years==
[[Image:Westminster Wilberforce Memorial.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Wilberforce was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] next to Pitt. This memorial statue was erected in 1840 in the north choir aisle.]]
In 1826, following his resignation, Wilberforce moved from his large house in Kensington Gore to a smaller house in the countryside of [[Mill Hill]], north of London,<ref name=t207/> where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had had a series of unsuccessful attempts at education and careers, and a venture into farming led to huge losses in 1830, which his father repaid in full despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting families and friends.<ref>Hague, p.494</ref>  He also continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.<ref>Tomkins, p.213</ref>

By 1833 his health had begun to decline; he suffered a severe attack of [[influenza]] and never fully recovered.<ref name=ODNB/> On [[26 July]] [[1833]] he heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery.<ref>Hague, p.502</ref>  On the following day he grew much weaker, and died early on the morning of [[29 July]].<ref>Pollock, p.308</ref> 

===Funeral===
William Wilberforce had left instructions that he was to be buried with his sister and daughter at [[Stoke Newington]]. However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial at [[Westminster Abbey]].  The family agreed and on [[3 August]] [[1833]] Wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend William Pitt.<ref>Hague, p.304</ref> The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament, as well as members of the public. The pall bearers included [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham, Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]].<ref>Pollock, pp.308<U+2013>9</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Wilberforce Monument Hull.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Wilberforce Monument, [[Queen's Gardens, Hull]]]]
Five years after his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce published a five-volume biography about their father in 1838, and a collection of his letters in 1840.  The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important role of Thomas Clarkson in the early days of the movement.  Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement to write a book in reply, and the sons eventually made a private apology to him.<ref> Hague, pp.153<U+2013>4</ref><ref>Hochschild, pp.350-1</ref>  However, for a century Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Subsequent historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship of Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.<ref> Hague, pp.154<U+2013>5, 509</ref><ref>Hochschild, pp.351<U+2013>2</ref><ref name=ODNBc>{{Citation

==Memorials==
Wilberforce's life and work has been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  In Wilberforce's home town of Hull, a public subscription in 1834 funded the Wilberforce Monument, a 102 foot (31 metre) [[Greek Doric]] column, topped by a statue of Wilberforce.<ref>{{cite news

Various churches within the [[Anglican Communion]] commemorate Wilberforce in their liturgical calendars including the [[Calendar of saints (Anglican Church of Canada)#July|Anglican Church of Canada]] and the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)#July|Episcopal Church in the United States of America]].
[[Wilberforce University]], located in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]], [[United States]], is named after William Wilberforce. The university was the first owned by [[African-American]] people, and is historically a black college ([[HBCU]]). 

''[[Amazing Grace (2006 film)|Amazing Grace]]'', a film about Wilberforce and the struggle against slavery and directed by [[Michael Apted]], with [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as William Wilberforce, was released in 2007 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the date on which [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] voted to ban the transport of slaves by British subjects.
