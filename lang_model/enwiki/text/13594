[[Fuaed Abdo Ahmed]] was a 20-year-old man who on August 13, 2013, took two women and a man hostage at the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank. He killed two of the hostages after releasing the third. He was an [[Arab]] of [[Yemen]]i descent and indicated an interest in militant [[Islam]] as he had been interviewed by the Homeland Security posing with an AK-47 assault rifle on a trip to Yemen. Many [[counterjihad]] pundits speculated on his motives, and complained that his ties to Islamist extremism had been "whitewashed".<ref>[ http://www.debbieschlussel.com/65229/your-day-in-whitewashed-muslim-bank-robbers-hostage-takers-hey-another-outstanding-dreamer-amnesty-candidate/ Your Day in Whitewashed Muslim Bank Robbers & Hostage Takers August 14, 2013]</ref> A subsequent police investigation officially concluded that whatever his motives, Ahmed suffered from mental issues such as hearing voices and paranoid schizophrenia, and acted alone as a [[lone gunman]] and was not involved in an act of [[terrorism]] against the United States.<ref name=policereport/>  Ahmed was apparently concerned that he was a [[targeted individual]] of electronic harassment as he accused the family of his ex-girlfriend of placing a "microphone device" of some kind in his head. Ahmed left note which in which he claimed to have ended ties to Islam, his family, and Middle Eastern culture and heritage. Instead he extolled his American citizenship and said that he had become a "born again Christian.", but also stated his wishes that neither whites nor non-Muslims could attend his funeral.

==Details==

On August 13, 2013, Ahmed entered the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank, armed with both a [[handgun]] and an [[assault rifle]]. His duffel bag was packed with items that he planned to use to torture his hostages.<ref name=newsstar/> He held three people hostage: '''Charles Henry "Jay" Warbington, Jr.''' (1964-2013) of [[Wisner, Louisiana|Wisner]] in [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula Parish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetowntalk/obituary.aspx?n=charles-warbington-jay&pid=166444309|title=Charles "Jay" Warbington|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]''|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> '''Patricia White''', and '''Tamara LaDean Hopkins McDaniel''' (1955-2013),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listenupyall.com/index.php/lifestyle/obituaries/august-2013/tamara-ladean-deannie-mcdaniel/|title=Tamara LaDean "Deannie" McDaniel|publisher=listenupyall.com|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> all employees of the bank for more than twenty years. During negotiations, state police superintendent, Colonel [[Mike Edmonson]], located a friend of Ahmed's in [[Alaska]], who talked him into releasing one of the hostages, Patricia White. According to Edmondson, Ahmed was "mad at people that he said were mean to him. He had voices in his head."<ref name=hostages/> Authorities said that Ahmed believed that the family of his ex-girlfriend in [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]] had caused their breakup and had placed a "microphone device" of some kind in his head.<ref name=policereport/><ref name=hostagedies/>

Eventually, Ahmed shot the remaining two hostages, killing Charles Warbington and critically wounding LaDean McDaniel, who died two days later at Rapides Regional Medical Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]].<ref name=hostagedies>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20130815/NEWS01/130815016/Tensas-bank-hostage-dies-Alexandria-hospital|title=Tensas bank hostage dies at Alexandria hospital, August 15, 2013|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref> In the standoff, the [[Louisiana State Police]] broke into the bank and fatally shot Ahmed.<ref name=newsstar>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20130814/NEWS01/308140057/St-Joseph-mourns-tragedy-bank?nclick_check=1|title=Cole Avery, St. Joseph mourns tragedy in bank, August 14, 2013|publisher=''[[The News-Star|Monroe News-Star]]''|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name=hostages/> It did not appear that Ahmed knew the hostages,<ref name=newsstar/> but the hostages recognized him.<ref name=policereport/>

==The perpetrator==

Ahmed's family owned a Trak service station located across the street from the bank. His parents, the father is deceased, were from Yemen, but Ahmed stated on [[Facebook]] that he was born in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], and was a "fan" of comedian [[Jerry Seinfield]] and [[rapper]] [[Eminem]], and Islam.<ref name=hostages>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20130814/NEWS01/130814001/Police-kill-St-Joseph-bank-hostage-taker-1-hostage-dies|title=Police kill St. Joseph bank hostage taker; 1 hostage dies, Surviving hostage being treated at Alexandria hospital|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>

Ahmed had been a football player at the private [[Briarfield Academy]] in Lake Providence in [[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll Parish]] in far northeastern Louisiana. His coach, Ben Durham, said that Ahmed had 2,700 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns in his senior year. Durham described Ahmed as never displaying aggressive behavior when playing football, "He was a normal good kid. It's not like he ever had any fits of rage. Ever." Sometime later, Durham said that he had a ''Facebook'' conversation with Ahmed and noticed the emergence of [[paranoia|paranoid]] tendencies in the young man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20130815/NEWS01/308150018/Tensas-bank-suspect-blamed-ex-girlfriend-s-family-wanted-leave-country|title=Tensas bank suspect blamed ex-girlfriend's family, wanted to leave country, August 15, 2013|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

Some three hundred St. Joseph residents came together on the evening of August 20 to reflect on the week-long tragedy. Ronny McDaniel, whose wife died of gunshot wounds two days after the attack, told the gathering that he is relying on his faith: I know in my heart it was meant to be. It was God's will to take them home. If they could come back right now, they wouldn't come back. I just believe they're in a better place."<ref name=aftermath/> Robby White, husband of Patricia White, the hostage who was released, explained the loss to the community:<blockquote>
This tragedy wasn't on the scale of [[9/11]], but it had the same effect on this community. There's no way to describe the feelings that each of us felt when we discovered the situation had turned so very wrong. We became stunned, shocked and so damn angry.<ref name=aftermath>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20130820/NEWS01/308200046/St-Joseph-community-gathers-remember-slain-bank-employees?nclick_check=1|title=Cole Avery, Joseph community gathers to remember slain bank employees, August 20, 2013|publisher=''Monroe News-Star''|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

Colonel Edmonson addressed the gathering and announced a thorough investigation would be undertaken to determine why Ahmed attacked the bank and its employees. Edmonson said that a final report since released would attempt to reveal Ahmed's state of mind to help perhaps prevent future attacks of this kind.<ref name=aftermath/> On August 23, 2013, it was disclosed that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] had interviewed Ahmed in April while he was visiting in Yemen; his family reported him missing or possibly [[kidnapping|kidnapped]].

Ahmed told the agents that he had not been kidnapped and was hearing voices in his head and at times felt [[suicide|suicidal]] but claimed he would not injure others. Ahmed was also interviewed in June by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], when he returned to the United States from [[Yemen]]. Agents asked him about a Facebook photo posted of himself holding an [[AK-47]] rifle in Yemen. During this interview, DHS said that Ahmed denied any criminal activity or inclination toward [[terrorism]]. Authorities in Los Angeles conducted their own evaluation of Ahmed and placed him a medical facility for several days of mental evaluation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130824/NEWS01/308240021/FBI-questioned-St-Joseph-bank-gunman-April-|title=FBI questioned St. Joseph bank gunman in April|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

On March 12, 2014, state police confirmed after a months-long investigation that Ahmed had been treated at a California hospital several weeks prior to the deadly rampage for [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. His brother, Yasser, told police that Ahmed had employed [[yoga]] for six hours a day in a vain attempt to "cure himself", rather than taking medication prescribed by doctors.<ref name=mentalillness/> Police found in Ahmed's room a bottle of [[Risperidone]], a drug used to treat schizophrenia; only three of the sixty pills were missing.<ref name=policereport/> Yasser confirmed too that Ahmed had used [[narcotics]] and bath salts before he left [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge, where he had been a short-term student. A four-member SWAT team fired twelve shots and struck Ahmed eight times. The investigation found the police actions justifiable. In a letter in the vehicle that he drove to the bank, Ahmed claimed to have ended ties to Islam, his family, and Middle Eastern culture and heritage. Instead he extoleld his American citizenship and said that he had become a "[[Born again (Christianity)|born again Christian]]."<ref name=mentalillness>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20140312/NEWS01/140312017/Gunman-Tensas-Parish-bank-standoff-treated-mental-illness|title=Gunman in Tensas Parish bank standoff was treated for mental illness|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> Even with those claims, 
Ahmed contradicted himself when he wrote in the letter, seen by officials as a last [[will and testament]], that neither whites nor non-Muslims could attend his funeral.<ref name=policereport>{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/8612131-125/la-bank-hostages-killer-had-no|title=Jim Mustian,  Man who killed hostages in north Louisiana bank had mental illness, March 12|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref>
