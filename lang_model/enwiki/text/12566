== Personal life ==
Higginbotham was born on [[February 25]] [[1928]] in [[Ewing Township, New Jersey|Ewing]], a suburb of [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref name=inmemoriam>In Memoriam: A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.; 1928-1998, The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, January 21, 1999</ref><ref name=oralhistory>Interview with The Honorable A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., for the Historical Society of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, at pg. 4, ln. 14-15</ref>  His mother, Emma Lee Higginbotham, was a maid, and his father, Aloyisus Leon Higginbotham, Sr., was a factory worker.<ref name=inmemoriam/>  Higginbotham was raised in a largely African American neighborhood, and attended a [[segregation|segregated]] grammar school.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 4, ln. 14-15</ref>  Higginbotham attended Lincoln School, a segregated high school in Trenton.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 5, ln. 12-13</ref>  Prior to Higginbotham, no black student had been put on the academic track (which was a significant step towards attending college), because [[Latin]], a requirement for the program, was not taught at the black elementary schools.<ref name=NYTimes>Black Judge's Success Story Begins in Cold Attic, Neil Lewis, The New York Times, July 19, 1991</ref>  Higginbotham's mother convinced the principal at the junior high school to enroll him in a second-year Latin course, even though he had never studied first year Latin.<ref name=NYTimes/>  To ensure that he was able to pass the required classes, the junior high Latin teacher offered to tutor him at her home during the summer.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 7, ln 1-8</ref>  Higginbotham's family was of modest economic means, so he worked while attending school, moving lawns, shoveling snow, and working as a bus boy at the Stacy Trent hotel.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 8 ln. 18-25, pg. 9, ln. 17-24</ref>  While in high school, Higginbotham manipulated his birth certificate in order to get working papers at 15, a year before the law allowed, so that he could work in a pottery factory shoveling clay.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 10, ln. 15-24</ref>

At 16 Higginbotham enrolled in [[Purdue University]], in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref name=inmemoriam/> He chose Purdue because it admitted black students, was cheaper, at that time, than [[Rutgers University]], and offered [[tuition]] discounts for good academic performance.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 11, 25-26</ref>   Higginbotham was also interested in Purdue because he wanted to be an [[engineer]], and Purdue was known as an engineering school.<ref name=LBJinterview>Transcript, A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. Oral History Interview I, 10/7/76, by Joe B. Frantz, Internet Copy, LBJ Library</ref> 

Higginbotham entered Purdue as a freshman in [[1944]].<ref name=LBJinterview/>  At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students.<ref name=inmemoriam/>  Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted to live in the dormitories.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Higginbotham and the other 11 black students living in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 12, ln. 7-10</ref>  The students slept in the attic, which was unheated.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 12, ln 12.</ref>  Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Elliot's response was purportedly "[t]he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories.  The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You take it or leave it."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 13, ln. 13-16</ref>  Higginbotham would later identify this encounter as the event that caused him to pursue a career in the law, saying:

{{cquote|And then, even though I had been doing very well there, I decided that engineering would not make any difference in America.  The most which a black person could do as an engineer is to make a better gadget, but a gadget which not significantly do anything with the oppression.  SO I guess on that trip back to the segregated house, International House, I decided that I wanted to go into law and to challenge the system.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 13-14, ln. 25-29, 1-3</ref>}}

Higginbotham transferred to [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] in [[1945]].<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 16, ln. 10-11</ref><ref name=inmemoriam/>  On the day that Higginbotham entered Antioch, one other black student was also admitted, [[Coretta Scott King|Coretta Scott]], who would later become Coretta Scott King after marrying [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].  Higginbotham earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1949, and subsequently entered [[Yale Law School]].  As he had in grade school, he worked, this time as a butcher, to help support himself while at Yale.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 15-23</ref> He was a member of the [[moot court]] team and the Barrister's Union (a mock trial organization).<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 22-23, ln. 28-29, 1</ref>  Higginbotham advanced to the finals of the first year moot court competition.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 25-26, ln. 25-29, 1-8</ref>  He argued in front of a panel that included [[Tom C. Clark|Justice Clark]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and [[John W. Davis]], who would later argue against [[Thurgood Marshall]] on behalf of the [[Topeka, Kansas]] Board of Education in [[Brown v. Board of Education]].<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 25-26, ln. 25-29, 1-8</ref>  In 1951, Higginbotham competed on a moot court team with [[Richard N. Gardner]], who would later be the [[United States Ambassador to Spain]] and the [[United States Ambassador to Italy]].  Higginbotham's team argued against a team from [[Temple University Beasley School of Law|Temple University Law School]], against his future law partner and judicial colleague, [[Clifford Scott Green]].  

As a first year student, Higginbotham worked as a research assistant to a professor, who arraigned for him to attend the oral arguments in [[Sweatt v. Painter]], which dealt with the admission of blacks to the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 31, ln. 14-20</ref>  [[Thurgood Marshall]] argued the case on behalf of Herman Sweatt, who had been denied admission to the University's Law School.<ref name=BlackIssues>Breaking Thurgood Marshall's promise - declining minority enrollment in higher education, A. Leon Higginbotham, Black Issues in Higher Education,  Feb 5, 1998</ref>  Higginbotham would later describe the experience of seeing Marshall arguing, writing "[w]ith controlled outrage, Marshall eloquently asserted the constitutional promise of equality for Sweatt, for all African Americans and, it seemed, for me personally."<ref name=BlackIssues/>  When the Supreme Court ruled in Sweatt's favor, Higginbotham later wrote that felt that he had "witnessed the birth of racial justice in the Supreme court."<ref name=BlackIssues/>  Higginbotham received his [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] from Yale in 1952.<ref name=FJCbio/>

==Legal career==

After graduation, Higginbotham initially sought employment with law firms in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], however, he was unable to find work at any of the major firms as a result of his race.<ref name=inmemoriam/><ref name=oralhistory>pg. 34-35</ref>  He began his career as a [[law clerk]] for Judge Curtis Bok of the [[Court of Common Pleas|Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas]].<ref name=FJCbio/> In 1953 he was hired by then District Attorney [[Richardson Dilworth]] as an assistant district attorney.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 40, ln. 7</ref>  Prior to Dilworth's arrival, no black lawyer had ever argued on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the Courts of Common Pleas.<ref name=oralhistory>pg.40, ln. 24-27</ref>  Higginbotham was given the opportunity to argue both in front of the Court of Common Pleas, and the [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 42, ln. 6-17</ref>

In 1954 Higginbotham went into private practice as a member of the first African American law firm in Philadelphia, ''Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, and Higginbotham''.<ref name=FJCbio/>  In addition to Higginbotham, three of the other named partners went on to become judges; Harvey Schmidt and Doris Harris would later serve as judges on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and [[Clifford Scott Green]] was appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 38, ln. 11-17</ref>  Higginbotham stayed in private practice until 1962.  While at the firm, Higginbotham practiced criminal defense and personal injury law.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 44, ln. 4-10</ref>  From 1960 to 1962 he was President of the Philadelphia chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]].<ref>A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., Federal Judge, Is Dead at 70.  The New York Times, December 15, 1998</ref>

==Public service==

While still in private practice, Higginbotham simultaneously served in several government positions; he was a special Deputy State Attorney General from 1956 to 1962, a special hearing officer for conscientious objections for the United States Department of Justice from 1960 to 1962, and a Commissioner on the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission from 1961 to 1962.<ref name=FJCbio/> 
[[Image:HigginbothamRecevingCommission.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Judge Higginbotham receiving his commission from President Johnson]]
In 1960 Higginbotham, as a delegate at the National NAACP convention, supported [[Hubert Humphrey]] over [[John F. Kennedy]] for the organization's endorsement for President.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 48, ln 23</ref>  Nevertheless, Kennedy appointed Higginbotham to be a commissioner on the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in 1962, the first African American appointed as a commissioner on any regulatory commission.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 18, ln 3-7</ref><ref name=FJCbio/>  [[Byron White|Justice White]] administered the oath of office.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 17, ln 28</ref>  Higginbotham ultimately became a strong supporter of President Kennedy, and began attending functions on behalf of the administration.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 53, ln 17-18</ref>  He was also a guest at White House functions, including a state dinner for the King and Queen of Afghanistan that took place several weeks before Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Robert Kennedy]], who had come to know Higginbotham through his work on the FTC,<ref name=oralhistory>pg 54, ln 21-29</ref> recommended that President Kennedy nominate him to be a judge on the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which Kennedy did in 1963.<ref name=oralhistory>pg 57, ln. 3-7</ref>

Higginbotham's nomination was held up by [[Mississippi]] [[James Eastland|Senator James Eastland]], the chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] and a committed [[racial segregation|segregationist]].<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|death of President Kennedy]], and the beginning of a new congressional term.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  He was ultimately appointed to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] as a [[recess appointment]] on [[January 6]], [[1964]], and was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] later that year.<ref name=FJCbio/>  At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old.

===Adviser to President Johnson===
[[Image:JohnsonCivilRightsMeeting.jpg|thumb|300px|right|President Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders following the assassination of Martin Luther King.  Judge Higginbotham is seated two seats to the right of Vice President Humphrey]]
Following his appointment to the District Court, Higginbotham developed a relationship with President Johnson, attending various White House functions and conferences in the mid-1960s.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  The day after [[Martin Luther King]] was [[assassinated]], Higginbotham was called to the [[White House]] to take part in a series of meetings to advise the President on how to respond to King's death.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Other notable figures at the meeting were [[Hubert Humphrey|Vice President Humphrey]], [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]], [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Whitney Young]], [[Andrew Brimmer]], [[Clarence Mitchell]], [[Clifford Alexander]], and [[Bayard Rustin]].  Higginbotham stayed the night at the White House, attended a service at the [[Washington National Cathedral]], and continued to advise the President into the next days.<ref name=LBJinterview/>

In 1967 Higginbotham arraigned for President Johnson to visit [[North Philadelphia]], to tour a community revitalization effort.<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Higginbotham would later describe Johnson's reaction to seeing the efforts of a small community to restore a dilapidated police station, saying "I think he was elated, absolutely exhilarated, because he saw results.  It wasn't phony, and it wasn't something on which an extraordinary amount money had been spent."<ref name=LBJinterview/>  A year later, following the [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of Robert Kennedy]], President Johnson called on Higginbotham again, appointing him as a member of the newly created [[U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence|Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence]].<ref name=LBJinterview/>  In 1968 he served as Vice Chairman of President Johnson's [[Kerner Commission]].<ref>Kerner Commission Report, available at http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1119/Kerner_Commission_report_finished</ref>

Higginbotham attended the opening of Johnson's Presidential library, where Johnson referred to Higginbotham as "one of my closest advisers, sound, reliable, responsible."<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Higginbotham would later say that he was thankful for the comment, but "had the impression that there were probably a few hundred other people there who got that accolade."<ref name=LBJinterview/>  Higginbotham met with Johnson two weeks before his death in 1973, along with then newly elected [[Barbara Jordan|Congresswoman Barbara Jordan]], to discuss Jordan's career in the House.<ref name=LBJinterview/>

==Judicial career==

Higginbotham spent 13 years as a District Court judge.  His chambers were at the Federal Courthouse at 9th and Market Streets, in Philadelphia (the building was later named in honor of [[Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.]], the first African American member of Pennsylvania's congressional delegation).<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 63, ln. 11-18</ref>  As a new judge, Higginbotham still encountered racism.  On his first day on the district court, he parked his car in the area reserved for judges, and was yelled at by a guard "Hey, boy!"<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 6</ref>  Higginbotham asked whether the guard was speaking to him, and the guard responded that only judges were permitted to park in the area.<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 12-15</ref>  Higginbotham responded by saying "I understand, and that's why I parked there."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 12-15</ref>  The guard said "Oh, you're Judge Higginbotham. Welcome to the Court."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 12-15</ref>  Higginbotham would later remember the incident as "typical of a lot of things which have happened to both minorities and to women."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 18-20</ref>  

Higginbotham did not experience any such behavior from his fellow judges on the district court, although, as the youngest person ever appointed to the Eastern District (Higginbotham was younger than some of his colleagues children<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 66, ln. 6</ref>), he would later recall that "the most difficult problem [in terms of human relations] was the phenomenon of age."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 65, ln. 27-29</ref>
[[Image:US Eastern Pennsylvania District Court.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Judge Higginbotham's chambers on the Third Circuit were in the [[James A. Byrne]] Courthouse in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]]]
Higginbotham's first law clerk was [[Eleanor Holmes Norton|Eleanor Holmes]], who would later become Eleanor Holmes Norton, the [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 64, ln. 24-26</ref>

In 1977 [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] elevated Higginbotham to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].<ref name=FJCbio/>  Higgibotham's elevation coincided with the opening of a new federal courthouse in Philadelphia, so his chambers moved from the Nix building to what is now called the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse at 6th and Market.<ref name=oralhistory/>  Higginbotham would later describe his judicial philosophy on the appellate bench as being in line with [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]], rejecting the [[strict constructism|strict constructionist]] concept, in favor of "an evolutionary concept in terms of what is fair and just in a society."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 86, ln. 3-6</ref>  He attacked strict constructionists as being inconsistent, "want[ing] an original intent for what are their conservative positions, and an evolutionary [position], in order to protect their conservative positions..."<ref name=oralhistory>pg. 87, ln. 20-25</ref>  He was Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals from 1990 to 1991, and assumed [[senior status]] in 1991.  He retired from the bench in 1993.<ref name=FJCbio/>

==Post-judicial career==
[[Image:HigginbothamMedalofFreedom.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Judge Higginbotham with [[Hillary Clinton]]  and [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] at the Medal of Freedom presentation]]
After leaving the bench, Higginbotham joined the firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison]], and accepted a position at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] as a professor.<ref name=FJCbio/>  He held both positions for the remainder of his life.
[[Image:PresMedalFreedom.jpg|thumb|85px|left|Higginbotham was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995]]
Higginbotham also continued to work in the public arena, serving as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in [[South Africa]] in 1994, and helping South Africa's newly elected government draft a new constitution.<ref name=Leary>Judge Higginbotham to be honored by White House, Robin Leary, The Philadelphia Inquirer, September 15, 1995</ref><ref name=ClintonStatement>Statement on the Death of A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., President Clinton, The White House, December 15, 1998</ref>  He served as counsel to the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in a series of voting rights cases before the Supreme Court.<ref name=Leary/>  President Clinton awarded him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1995. In 1996, the NAACP award him its highest honor, the [[Spingarn Medal]].<ref name=inmemoriam/>  [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law|The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law]] named its annual A. Leon Higginbotham Corporate Leadership Award after Judge Higgenbotham.<ref>[http://www.lawyerscomm.org/2005website/features/higginbottam06/higgawarddin.html Lawyers Committee Website on the Higginbotham Award]</ref>

In 1998, several months before his death, Judge Higginbotham wrote an "An open letter to Justice Clarence Thomas from a federal judicial colleague," published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.  In his letter, Judge Higginbotham expressed his "concern and sorrow that Justice Thomas would turn his back on a century of [racial] struggle."<ref>Colin S. Diver, A Tribute, available at http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0399/higginbotham.html </ref>

==Death==

Higginbotham died on [[December 14]] [[1998]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], after suffering from a series of [[stroke|strokes]].  [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] described him as "one of our nation's most passionate and steadfast advocates for civil rights."<ref name=ClintonStatement/>  [[Jesse Jackson]] said of Higginbotham, "[w]hat Thurgood Marshall and [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] were to the first half of this century, Judge Higginbotham was to the second half."<ref name=LosAngelesSentinel>Judge A. Leon Higginbotham:A Lawyer's Lawyer, Judge's Judge and Advocate's Advocate Passes, Los Angeles Sentinel, December 30, 1998</ref>  [[Kweisi Mfume]] said "[t]he world has lost one of its finest, most pre-eminent jurists of our times.  His work is a reflection of both his deep passion for civil rights and his legendary pursuit of justice and equality for all Americans." <ref name=LosAngelesSentinel/>
