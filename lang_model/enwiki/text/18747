The '''Xerox murders''' was a [[mass murder]] in which a [[Xerox]] service technician, Byran Koji Uyesugi (born [[1959]]), in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] killed seven of his co-workers on [[November 2]], [[1999]]. This was the worst mass murder case in the history of [[Hawaii]].  The case also heightened awareness of [[workplace violence]] in Hawaii and elsewhere. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Uyesugi's Early life==
Born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], Uyesugi lived in the [[Nuuanu]] neighborhood of Honolulu.  While attending [[President Theodore Roosevelt High School|Roosevelt High School]], Uyesugi was a member of the school's Army [[JROTC]] chapter and was a member of the school's riflery team.  Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble.  According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in [[1977]] coming home from a graduation party and was never the same [http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/09/news/story1.html].

Uyesugi had been employed by [[Xerox]] as a technician since [[1984]].  Among his hobbies was raising and breeding [[goldfish]] and ''[[koi]]'', which he would sell to local pet stores.  He also had an extensive collection of firearms, and at the time of the murder had as many as 25 guns registered in his name dating back to [[1982]].  Police also recovered 11 handguns, 5 rifles and 2 shotguns from Uyesugi's father.

==Build up to shooting (trouble at work)==
According to testimony from Uyesugi's father, Hiroyuki, Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984.  Then when Hiroyuki's wife (Byran's mother) died in 1988, Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head [http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/2000/May/26/localnews14.html]. 

Uyesugi's troubles apparently began soon after he was transferred to another workgroup. He began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen, who had great difficulty placating his anger.  Former co-workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him, making him feel isolated and withdrawn.  His anger was such that he reportedly made threats against other co-workers' lives. In [[1993]], he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door for which he was arrested.  Uyesugi was arrested for third degree criminal property damage.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/welner/5.html Crime Library article on Byran Uyesugi]</ref>    
[http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/09/news/story1.html]. Coworkers told Dr. [[Michael Welner]], a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly speaking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he ever to be fired. 

The psychiatrist who examined him at the time of this arrest found that Uyesugi suffered from a [[delusional disorder]] and [[paranoia]], but found him not to be dangerous. Byran Uyesugi reported experiencing auditory (voices in his head) and visual (a black shadow following him) hallucinations. Byran alleged that there was a conspiracy, and that his home was bugged with listening devices. He felt that his co-workers were engaged in patterns of harassment, back stabbing behavior, and spreading of rumors.  
  
In 1993, Uyesugi told his brother that a shadow pinned him down.  The family had their house blessed by a [[Shingon]] priest  in [[1997]] hoping to help him, but even the minister suspected Uyesugi had a mental illness.  Later that year, Uyesugi's father suggested that he see a psychiatrist.[http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/09/news/story1.html] Uyesugi did not.

In the period leading up to the shooting, [[Xerox]] management increasingly committed to phasing out the copier that Uyesugi had been servicing. He resisted learning the new machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi<U+2019>s manager insisted on November 1, 1999 that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with forensic psychiatrist [[Michael Welner]], M.D., who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense, Uyesugi reasoned that because he would refuse to undertake the training, management would then fire him. As he told Dr. [[Michael Welner]], <U+201C>I decided to give them a reason to fire me.<U+201D> <ref>[http://www.forensicpanel.com/Courtroom_Summary.ppt Trial testimony of Dr. Michael Welner]</ref>

==The day of the shooting==
On the morning of [[November 2]], [[1999]], Uyesugi reported to work at the Xerox building and opened fire with a 9mm [[Glock]], killing his supervisor and six co-workers and firing in the direction of another co-worker who fled the building.  After the shooting, Uyesugi fled in a company van.  Police closed down several streets in downtown Honolulu as they investigated the crime scene.  By mid-morning, the police had Uyesugi cornered in the mountains above downtown Honolulu.  After a nearly five-hour standoff, Uyesugi surrendered to police shortly before 3 p.m.

==Victims==
* Christopher Balatico, 33
* Ford Kanehira, 41
* Ronald Kataoka, 50
* Ronald Kawamae, 54
* Melvin Lee, 58
* Peter Mark, 46
* John Sakamoto, 36

==Trial and incarceration==

Forty-year-old Byran Uyesugi's month long trial began on [[May 15]], [[2000]]. He pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. [[Park Dietz]] and Dr. [[Daryll Matthews]] testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Dr. [[Michael Welner]] testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a [[schizophrenic]], he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong. <ref> [http://starbulletin.com/2000/06/02/news/story2.html Expert witness testimony in the trial of Bryan Uyesugi] </ref>

The [[jury]] found him sane and guilty of seven murders and one attempted murder. He received a sentence of life without chance of parole.  Hawaii does not have the [[death penalty]].

He appealed his conviction[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Jul/01/ln/ln04a.html].  In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi's conviction[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Dec/27/ln/ln05a.html].  As of 2004 Uyesugi is considering fighting his conviction based on [[Rule 40]], inadequate representation by his lawyers in his first trial [http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Aug/21/ln/ln03a.html]. 

In [[2005]], Xerox and the hospital that examined Uyesugi settled a lawsuit brought by the families of the shooting victims, who felt that both had ignored clear signs of Uyesugi's mental instability.

Uyesugi is now being held in Tallahatchie County Correctional facility in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]].  This is due to overcrowding and inadequate facilities to house a prisoner in isolation at Halawa Correctional Facility.[http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/08/news/story5.html]

==Aftermath==
Xerox vacated the premises at 1200 N. Nimitz Highway after the shooting, and they stood idle until 2004, when the producers of the TV show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' built a [[sound stage]] there to film indoor scenes<ref>{{cite news|last=Veitch|first=Kristin|title=Lost Secrets Found!|url=http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2004/041016.html|publisher=[[E!
