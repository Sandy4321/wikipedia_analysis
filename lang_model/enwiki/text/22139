'''Vallur Thermal Power Station''' is a power plant located in [[Athipattu]] village, [[Vallur]] in [[Thiruvallur district]], [[Chennai|North Chennai]], [[India]]. The power plant is operated by NTPC Tamil Nadu Energy Company Limited, a joint venture between [[NTPC Limited]] and [[Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation | TANGEDCO]] and has three units with 500&nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] each.

In January 2014, the units in the power plant achieved a record generation of 24.09 million units of electricity.<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 30-Mar-2014}}</ref> The project adds nearly 24 million units a day to the grid. [[Tamil Nadu]] is the major beneficiary of power generated from this facility (about 750&nbsp;MW), while some of it is supplied to [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Puducherry]].<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/>

The plant will consume 4.62&nbsp;mt of coal a year. Coal for the plant will be brought from [[Orissa]] through ship to [[Ennore Port]], from where it will be transported by road.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/>

==Location==
The power plant is located on a triangular tract of land between [[Ennore creek]] and [[Athipattu Pudhunagar railway station]], southwest of [[Ennore Port]].

==Construction==
The plant was established under the mega power project policy.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/> The erstwhile Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) and the NTPC, in a joint venture, formed the NTPC Tamil Nadu Energy Company Limited. The foundation stone for the Vallur thermal plant was laid on 5 September 2007, with an estimated cost of {{INR}}80 billion (<U+20AC>100 million),<ref name="Hindu_VallurProjectToStartByOctober"/> and the {{INR}}19,900-million main plant package to supply steam generators and turbine for stage I was awarded to [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]] (BHEL), a state-run power equipments manufacturer, on 13 August 2007.<ref name="Hindu_VallurPlantProgressing"/><ref>{{cite news

Initially expected to be operational by 2010, the project was delayed due to the late implementation of the coal-handling facility established by the BHEL.<ref name="Hindu_VallurProjectToStartByOctober"/> Erection of the boiler column began on 5 January 2009.<ref name="Hindu_VallurPlantProgressing">{{cite news

In September 2009, the {{INR}}130 million contract to supply units for Vallur was given to BHEL, which supplied and installed steam generator and steam turbine packages. BHEL was responsible for the design, engineering manufacture, supply, erection and commissioning of the steam generators, turbine generators, electrostatic precipitators and associated auxiliaries, and controls and instrumentation systems in the plant.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/>

The 216-tonne boiler drum of Unit I was erected in June 2010. Unit I was commissioned in March 2012 but operating at full capacity was delayed further due to problems with coal-handling facilities. Independent works on phase II began in 2010.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/>

The first, second and third units were synchronised with the grid on 9 March 2012, 26 February 2013 and 28 February 2014, respectively.<ref name="TANGEDCO_VallurProject"/> The total cost of the project without IDC was {{INR}}91,930 million.<ref name="TANGEDCO_VallurProject"/> The plant commenced its commercial operation on 29 November 2012, with the operation of its first unit. The second unit commenced its commercial operations on 25 August 2013,<ref name="TANGEDCO_VallurProject"/> while that of the third unit was commenced on 28 February 2014.<ref name="MoneyControl_NTPC_VallurUnitIII"/>

==Cost and finance==
The cost of phase I was {{INR}}54 billion ($1.15 billion) and that of phase II was {{INR}}30 billion ($639 million). The debt equity ratio of the project is 7:3. The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) sanctioned {{INR}}38 billion ($809 million) to meet the entire debt portion of the project. REC advanced a loan of {{INR}}21 billion ($447 million) for the second phase in April 2010.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant">{{cite web

==Technology and operations==
The boiler systems at the plant consists of single- or two-pass type, with front/rear/side mill layout, which can have single/bi-drum arrangement with natural or controlled circulation. There is constant or sliding pressure operation, and hot or cold primary air systems. Steam turbine operates at a speeds of 3,000&nbsp;rpm. The main steam is at 130<U+2013>250 bar at 500<U+2013>540<U+00B0>C. Steam reheat is at 30<U+2013>70 and 500<U+2013>600<U+00B0>C. The back pressure is between 20 and 300&nbsp;mbar.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/>

The plant has six induced draft cooling towers (IDCTs), which have a capacity of 30,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/hr with nine cells of 21 X 14&nbsp;m each.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/> The IDCTs use seawater, which is drawn from the intake channel of [[North Chennai Thermal Power Station]], and fresh water requirement is met from a desalination plant. The plant has adopted closed cycle re-circulating type cooling water system for its operations.<ref name="PowerTechnology_VallurPlant"/><ref>{{cite web
