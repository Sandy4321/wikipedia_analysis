The '''1997 Benton, Arkansas tornado outbreak''' was a major [[tornado]] [[tornado outbreak|outbreak]] that struck portions of the central and southern [[United States]] mostly on March 1, 1997 with initial activity on February 28. Affecting areas mostly from [[Arkansas]] to [[Kentucky]], the two-day outbreak produced 39 tornadoes and killed at least 27 people including 25 in Arkansas alone with one death in each [[Mississippi]] and [[Tennessee]].<ref>[http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms NCDC Storm Events-Select State<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This was Arkansas' deadliest tornado outbreak since May 15, 1968, where 34 were killed in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]].<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wmar01ap.htm</ref> Over 400 others were injured during this event which was about 45% of the yearly average of tornado-related injuries in the United States.<ref>[http://www.ardemgaz.com/prev/torn397/Abstorm01.html Tornado warning systems improve<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Meteorological synopsis==

On March 1, 1997, very unstable air invaded much of the affected area while much warmer temperatures were recorded. Temperatures across most of Arkansas which normally at that time are below {{convert|60|F|C|0}} reached the mid to upper 70s <U+00B0>F (24 <U+00B0>C). A cold front was approaching from the Midwestern Plains and was associated with a strong low further north. Strong temperatures contrasts were observed on either side of the front. In addition, wind near the ground and aloft were very strong and significant shear was noted before given additional ingredients for extreme severe weather across the [[Mississippi Valley|Mississippi]] and [[Tennessee Valley]]s on March 1, 1997. On February 28, 1997, the Storm Prediction Center had issued a Day 2 moderate risk of severe weather for much of Arkansas and a tornado watch was issued for the western and central part of the state during the morning hours of March 1.<ref name=ark61/><ref>[http://www.srh.weather.gov/lzk/html/tormar1a.htm National Weather Service - Little Rock, Arkansas...Tornadoes on 03/01/1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Tornado and flood event==
Initial activity ahead of the main outbreak started on February 28, where a few tornadoes touched down in Mississippi with intermittent activity throughout the overnight hours including in Tennessee before a lull during the morning. One Mississippi tornado killed one person in [[Pontotoc County, Mississippi|Pontotoc County]] while a long-tracked F3 storm from a single supercell touched down west of [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]. Other strong tornadoes also touched down in Tennessee during the early morning hours. Activity resumed ahead of the front at around noon with the first significant tornadoes hitting Arkansas by 2:00 PM CDT while a line of thunderstorms developed just to the west of the supercells along the cold front. 

According to the National Weather Service Office in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], at least 15 significant tornadoes touchdown across most of Arkansas and it issued 57 weather warnings including 34 for tornadoes.<ref name=ark61/> The most significant and deadliest tornado recorded in the state and for the entire outbreak was an F4 that affected areas of [[Saline County, Arkansas|Saline]] and [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski]] Counties south of Little Rock where 10 people were killed by this tornado along the path which included portions of [[Benton, Arkansas|Benton]], [[Bauxite, Arkansas|Bauxite]], [[Bryant, Arkansas|Bryant]] and [[Vimy Ridge, Arkansas|Vimy Ridge]]. It then struck southern and eastern portions of the Little Rock suburbs killing 5 and injuring nearly 200 others before it lifted near [[Little Rock National Airport|Adams Field Airport]] in [[College Station, Arkansas|College Station]] after affecting areas in and around [[Sweet Home, Arkansas|Sweet Home]], [[Ward, Arkansas|Ward]] and [[Shannon Hills, Arkansas]]. The storm traveled for about {{convert|27|mi|km|0}} and a width of {{convert|.8|mi|km|1}} wide.<ref name="ark61"/> It was accompanied during portions of its path by satellite tornadoes which caused additional damage in the Vimy Ridge and College Station areas but did not caused any additional fatalities.<ref>[http://www.srh.weather.gov/lzk/html/track2.htm National Weather Service - Little Rock, Arkansas...Tornadoes on 03/01/1997 (Track 2)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Prior to the Benton tornado, another F4 in [[Clark County, Arkansas|Clark County]] affected the town of [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]] killing 6 and injuring at least 100. The tornado track was at least {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} long and also caused extensive damage in parts of [[Hot Spring County, Arkansas|Hot Spring County]] particularly in Donaldson<ref>[http://www.srh.weather.gov/lzk/html/track1.htm National Weather Service - Little Rock, Arkansas...Tornadoes on 03/01/1997 (Track 1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The two F4 deadly tornadoes were produced by the same supercell thunderstorm that traveled through most of the state. The supercell alone killed 21 and injured several hundreds others and causing several millions of dollars worth of damage in southern and central Arkansas. Near the Tennessee border and across the [[Mississippi River]], the same supercell produced an additional F4 that crossed near the [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] area in [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer County]] killing one.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/meg/svrwx_march1_summary.html NWS Memphis, Severe Weather Summary of March 1st Tornadoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another supercell north of the main storm produced several tornadoes north of Little Rock and [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]] including a long-tracked F3 that caused the other 4 fatalities across the state. Among the towns affected included [[Marmaduke, Arkansas|Markamaduke]] which was affected by an even stronger tornado during the [[April 2, 2006 Tornado Outbreak]]. Areas affected by the deadly tornadoes had tornado warnings with lead time estimated at between 9 and 28 minutes. Overall across the state of Arkansas 1 200 homes were damaged or destroyed including close to 400 in Arkadelphia.<ref name=ark61/><ref>[http://www.srh.weather.gov/lzk/html/track5.htm National Weather Service - Little Rock, Arkansas...Tornadoes on 03/01/1997 (Track 5)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/1997/3/1 Tornado History Project - Tornado Map<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Weaker tornadoes touched down across Kentucky with no additional fatalities.

Eleven counties across Arkansas were declared federal [[disaster area]]s by then-[[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] for tornadoes while two others in were for flooding. Seven other counties in Tennessee were also declared disaster areas due to tornadoes. It was considered the worst tornado outbreak since the [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1994]] which killed 42 across [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Severe flooding across the [[Ohio Valley|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee Valley]]s also resulted in 16 [[Ohio]] counties and 44 [[Kentucky]] counties to be declared a disaster area. The [[flash flood]]s and damaging wind elsewhere caused 34 deaths across six states including 19 in Kentucky, five in Ohio, five in Tennessee, two in [[Texas]] and three in [[West Virginia]]. Damage estimates in Kentucky alone were at about $250 million while 75,000 homes were damaged. Then-[[Governor of Kentucky|governor]] [[Paul E. Patton]] had initially declared 120 counties a state of emergency and deployed about 1100 [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] Troops to the flood stricken-regions. In Indiana, the [[Ohio River]] overflow its banks due to record rains . All 13 counties along the river between [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] were also declared disaster areas. In West Virginia, then-[[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Cecil Underwood]] declared [[state of emergency|state of emergencies]] for 14 counties and 16 were later declared disaster areas as over 4 000 homes and other structures were damaged by the flooding.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wmar01us.htm</ref><ref>http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wmar01ey.htm</ref>

Several areas that were hit by the tornadoes did not had any [[tornado siren]]s.  After the outbreak several million dollars were invested to improve the siren system throughout the state for future tornado outbreaks<ref>[http://www.ardemgaz.com/prev/torn397/warn030198.html Good news: More sirens, better radar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> including the [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak]], a similar but much deadlier and more widespread outbreak. Fourteen people in Arkansas were killed by that outbreak on February 5, 2008 and nearly 60 in total were killed across the Mid-South regions of the US.
