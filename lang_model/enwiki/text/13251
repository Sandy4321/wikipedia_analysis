'''Sesto Pals''', pen name of '''Simion''' (or '''Semion''') '''<U+0218>estopali''' (born ''<U+0428><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C>'', also rendered as ''S(h)estopal'', ''Sestopaly'', or ''Sestopali''; ca. 1912 <U+2013> October 27, 2002), was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-born [[Romania]]n and [[Israel]]i writer. Primarily a poet-philosopher, he also earned recognition as a graphic artist. He first became known in his teenage years, when, as a friend and associate of [[Gherasim Luca]], he put out the review ''Alge''. Its [[avant-garde]] aesthetics and its testing of censorship resulted in their prosecution. While Luca endured as a public intellectual and a founder of the Romanian [[Surrealism|surrealist]] cell, Pals became a recluse. 

Forgotten by the general public, exposed to antisemitic and later communist persecution, he continued to write for himself and an intimate circle of friends. He had a successful career in civil and railway engineering, but political nonconformity resulted in his marginalization for part of the 1960s. 

Moving to [[Haifa]] in 1970, Pals was rediscovered by later generations of Romanian and Israeli readers, known to them for the moderate surrealism of his poetry and prose, and, to a lesser degree, for his take on [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]]. His editorial debut came well into his 80s, when Pals was already bedridden and contemplating death.

Sharing a school-desk, the two became close friends.<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/><ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="pcsubter"/> They also associated with [[Aurel Baranga]], who was in the same school, but slightly younger.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> Their circle also included female colleagues and admirers, among them Henriette Iacobsohn, future wife of the cartoonist [[Saul Steinberg]], and [[Amelia Pavel]], later an essayist and art historian. Pavel, who vacationed with Simion at [[Sovata]] in summer 1930, remembered him as a "nice and well-behaved youth".<ref name="apanii30">{{ro icon}} [[Amelia Pavel]], [http://www.romlit.ro/prieteni_din_anii_30 "Prieteni din anii '30"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 30/2003</ref> 

Nevertheless, all three young men made a habit of deriding cultural conventions: Pals was almost expelled from school when he burst out laughing during a lecture on poet-laureate [[Vasile Alecsandri]].<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> In 1930, having kept up with the Western European and Romanian avant-garde, Luca founded the radical youth magazine ''Alge'' ("Algae"), with collaborations from <U+0218>estopali (the nominal "chief editor"),<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> Baranga, and [[Jules Perahim]]; they were later joined by [[Paul P<U+0103>un]]. <U+0218>estopali experimented with literary pseudonyms, sometimes signing his work for ''Alge'' as ''D. Amprent''<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/><ref name="ipciudat41">Pop, p. 41</ref> and then, for the first time ever, ''Sesto Pals''. A quasi-anagram of his Romanian name-and-initial, it was sometimes corrected to ''<U+0218>esto Pals'' in later reference, but the poet always signed his work ''sans'' diacritic.<ref name="mftransc2">{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Poezia-este-traire-transcendentala-%28II%29*articleID_26105-articles_details.html "Poezia este tr<U+0103>ire transcendental<U+0103> (II)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 599, November 2011</ref> The family name probably originated in a Russian moniker for "six fingers" or "six toes", and <U+0218>estopali bragged that he himself had inherited an [[Polydactyly|extra toe]].<ref name="apanii30"/>

===Obscenity scandal===
Underfunded, ''Alge'' only put out six or seven issues in this 1930 edition.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> By February 1932, Pals had established his own single-issue magazine, titled ''Muci'' ("Snot"), and distributed free of charge at one of Perahim's art shows.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="lsrepere"/> Like P<U+0103>un and the other ''Alge'' men, he was also co-opted by ''[[unu]]'', the more established avant-garde sheet, but had a tense encounter with its editor, [[Sa<U+0219>a Pan<U+0103>]].<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> Nonetheless, ''unu'' hosted some of Pals' prose poems, including one which mockingly advertised Perahim's art as a "horrid crime" against the state.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> In addition to writing poetry, he was interested in hard science, taking his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate]] with honors in physics.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> He barely passed the overall examination, after having again slammed Alecsandri's work in his Romanian literature paper.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/>  

In 1933, Luca reissued ''Alge'' in a more licentious edition, and challenged the cultural establishment by sending a copy to [[Nicolae Iorga]], the nationalist historian and political figure. A clampdown on their activities followed: all known contributors were caught in a police investigation, and Pals' home was searched for incriminating proof. Despite no longer being a contributor (and feeling alienated by P<U+0103>un and Baranga's leftist militancy), Pals was implicated by his nominal editorial contribution.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> He was eventually arrested and sent to [[V<U+0103>c<U+0103>re<U+0219>ti prison]], where his colleagues were also rounded up. Pals later recalled being subjected to a thorough interrogation by the [[examining magistrate]], and sharing a cell with a known communist. Taking his instructions from Iorga, the coroner alleged that the <U+0218>estopalis were themselves communists, sent in from the [[Soviet Union]] to subvert Romanian society.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> The family was threatened with expulsion.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/>

The writers' parents eventually obtained their release,<ref name="lsrepere"/> with Emanoil pleading with his son that he amend his ways.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> The court ruled against the ''Alge'' group, and issued two-year suspended sentences against them. This tarnished their judicial record, leaving Pals exposed to persecution.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> Pals was traumatized by the whole experience, and no longer bothered with his college admission,<ref name="lsrepere"/> although his grades qualified him for enlistment at the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|Bucharest Polytechnic]].<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/>

In 1934, when he and his family were [[Romanian nationality law|naturalized Romanian]],<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> Pals finally matriculated with the Polytechnic, where he majored in [[mining engineering]] and [[metallurgy]].<ref name="lsrepere"/> He kept out of literary life. When, in 1939, Luca returned from Paris a committed [[Surrealism|surrealist]], Pals was invited to attend the sessions of his Bucharest surrealist circle. He did so on occasion, meeting with new recruits such as [[Dolfi Trost]] and [[Gellu Naum]], but, as Pals biographer Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal notes, "chain smoked [and] kept himself dead silent."<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/> Pals himself later asserted: "I never did 'fade' out of sight, I have always been out of sight."<ref name="mftransc2"/><ref name="mftransc1">{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Poezia-este-traire-transcendentala-%28I%29*articleID_26040-articles_details.html "Poezia este tr<U+0103>ire transcendental<U+0103> (I)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011</ref>

===Antisemitic persecution and communist oppression===
Pals graduated in 1940, just as the [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship had [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|barred Jews from employment]] in most fields, including technical.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/><ref name="pcsubter"/> Pushed out of literary life, Pals discovered philosophy, and became an avid reader of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> Finkenthal notes that his "rather obsessive preoccupation" was "to quantify qualitative values", a "strange mixture of [[Hegelianism]] and abstract arithmetic".<ref name="mfdialoguri"/> 

At the height of World War II, the <U+0218>estopalis came to be persecuted under new racial laws. Pals' brother Fima escaped to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]].<ref name="mfteoret">Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, "Gherasim Luca, teoretician al suprarealismului?", in ''Mozaicul'', Nr. 11-12/2013, pp. 7-8</ref> Pals was singled out for compulsory labor, and sent to work as a "Jewish engineer" for the [[C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne|State Railways]].<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/><ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/><ref name="mfteoret"/> Making occasional returns to Bucharest,<ref name="mfteoret"/> he had an amorous affair with Lucia "Lucy" Metsch, a Paris-trained painter of [[Bukovina Jews|Bukovina Jewish]] extraction. She had narrowly escaped the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', and was working at [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|The Bara<U+0219>eum]].<ref name="mfdialoguri"/>

Pals sought full employment after the [[King Michael's Coup|antifascist coup of 1944]], and, in 1945, was dispatched to oversee the construction of railway tunnels in [[Cluj County]].<ref name="lsrepere"/> Later that year, he returned to Bucharest, joining the City Planning Institute as founder and president of its [[geotechnical engineering]] section.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="pcsubter"/> In 1946, engineer <U+0218>estopali parted with Lucy and married Valentina Berman. This created controversy: Valentina was Pals' first cousin and his junior by 15 years.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="pcsubter"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> She was also [[Holocaust in Romania|Holocaust survivor]], having just returned from the concentration camp in [[Berezivka]], [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]].<ref name="mfdialoguri"/><ref name="ovsc(94)135">[[Ovid Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu]], ''Amintiri deghizate'', [[Editura Nemira]], Bucharest, 1994, p. 135.  ISBN 973-9144-49-7</ref> Although he still refrained from an open affiliation, Pals continued to visit Luca and the surrealists, introducing his wife to them.<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/> His half-sister-in-law, Mura Vlad, was a published novelist and translator from Russian.<ref name="mslacrim6"/>

The marriage soon crumbled: Pals was an absentee husband, and Valentina found it hard to cope with the rigors of life in [[Communist Romania]].<ref name="mfdialoguri"/> Working as a typist, she met the poet [[Ion Caraion]], becoming his admirer, muse, and lover.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/><ref name="ovsc(94)135"/><ref name="mslacrim6"/><ref name="rvsecretele">{{ro icon}} [[R<U+0103>zvan Voncu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/sesto_pals_i_secretele_avangardei "Sesto Pals <U+0219>i secretele avangardei"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 26/2014</ref> Pals accepted the informal separation, resuming his love affair with Lucy Metsch,<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="rvsecretele"/> who now worked as a scenic painter for [[Sahia Film]].<ref name="lsrepere"/> He was increasingly withdrawn and troubled, dedicating himself to writing down a whole corpus of literary and philosophical works that he would not publish.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="rvsecretele"/> 

During that decade, the <U+0218>estopalis came into conflict with the communist regime. In 1957, an investigation began into Caraion's [[samizdat]] poetry, which was highly critical of the regime, and which Valentina had helped circulate. At the risk of incriminating himself, Pals returned to his conjugal home and protected his estranged wife.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="rvsecretele"/> In mid 1958, Valentina was arrested by the [[Securitate]], then implicated in Caraion's trial for sedition. She dismissed the option to denounce Caraion in exchange for freedom,<ref name="ovsc(94)135"/> and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="mslacrim6">Sipo<U+0219>, p. 6</ref><ref name="dc-enegru">{{ro icon}} [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ion_cel_negru "Ion cel Negru"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 2/2007</ref> 

In 1962, Pals applied for an exit visa and [[Aliyah|emigration to Israel]], a rebellious gesture which saw his demotion with reduced pay and his relocation to the remote town of [[Dej]].<ref name="lsrepere"/> Valentina, released from prison under a general amnesty, divorced him in 1963, and later married Caraion.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> Pals also married Lucy in 1965, and, starting 1967, retook his position at the Bucharest Planning Institute.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="mfdialoguri"/> He earned respect in the engineers' community, and had several professional awards to his name,<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="pcsubter"/> while privately working on a set of essays which sought to reconcile Hegelianism with [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].<ref name="rvsecretele"/>

===Emigration===
By his own account, Pals lived a quiet and exceptionally fulfilling life down to 1970: caught up in his work during daytime, he turned to writing literature at night, and reconnected with his avant-garde friends.<ref name="lsrepere"/> He still refrained from going public, although two of his close friends, former avant-garde writers Baranga and [[Geo Bogza]], were well regarded by the regime and could arrange him a publishing deal.<ref name="mf1958i"/> He was more preoccupied with discovering (as he put it) "the mystery of existence through one's own existence".<ref name="lsrepere"/> That interval came to an end in 1970, when he and his wife were allowed to emigrate. They were seen to their plane by Bogza, the dissenting communist.<ref name="mfalgi<U+0219>tii"/> Pals was forced by the authorities to leave his voluminous manuscripts behind in Romania; he split them into fascicles, which he hid in various places.<ref name="lsrepere"/> Ion and Valentina Caraion, together with their daughter Marta, were themselves allowed to leave in 1981, moving to [[Lausanne]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Intersectie-europeana*articleID_16441-articles_details.html "Intersec<U+021B>ie european<U+0103>"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 345, November 2006</ref> Caraion, who had agreed to collaborate with the Securitate in return for his freedom, was repeatedly blackmailed by his former supervisors.<ref name="dc-enegru"/><ref>Sipo<U+0219>, pp. 6, 7</ref>

Pals resumed his professional career in [[Haifa]], where he oversaw the digging of [[utility tunnel]]s.<ref name="pcsubter"/> He traveled outside the country to meet Luca, who was living in Paris.<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/> However, his health declined abruptly, and he was forced to take retirement in 1982.<ref name="lsrepere"/> He suffered from [[gastrointestinal cancer]], and was treated at the [[Rabin Medical Center]].<ref name="generousrmc">[http://hospitals.clalit.co.il/Hospitals/Rabin/en-us/News/News-Year-2007/Pages/News-014.aspx ''A Generous Step Toward Prevention''], [[Rabin Medical Center]] Spokesman Department, November 25, 2007; retrieved December 29, 2014</ref>

Working from his home, a small apartment in [[Bnei Brak]],<ref name="mf1958i"/> Pals focused entirely on philosophical essays, which he composed in French,<ref>{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-Note-de-drum*articleID_16700-articles_details.html "Note de drum"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 351, December 2006</ref> and a new set of [[visual poetry]] pieces. He reluctantly agreed to have samples of these works published in [[Romanian diaspora]] magazines<U+2014>including Caraion's ''Don Quijote'' and Alexandru Lungu's ''Argo''.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="pcsubter"/><ref name="mftransc2"/><ref name="mftransc1"/> In 1985, the [[Honolulu]] exile [[<U+0218>tefan Baciu]] dedicated him a special issue of his ''MELE'', a poetry newsletter. It included homage pieces by his old friends P<U+0103>un and Bogza.<ref name="lsrepere"/><ref name="pcsubter"/><ref name="mftransc2"/><ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu (2001), pp. 172, 200</ref> Interviewed about his work by journalist Solo Har-Herescu in 1993, Pals was oblique: "I am not fit to answer, as my head is filled with those snake-like questions, poisoning my replies, eating them up as they [...] bite into their own tails, making it hard to know where tails begin and heads end." His only reason for writing was "an inner urging", as "so much better poems" already existed, which were still "of no use to the reading public".<ref name="mftransc1"/>

===Final years and death===
Sesto Pals the poet was rediscovered in Romania only after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]: in 1998, [[Nicolae Tzone]] published a book of his poetry with [[Editura Vinea]], as ''Omul ciudat'' ("The Bizarre Man"). It was only at this time that Pals' former colleagues in the Bucharest Planning Institute discovered that he was the same as the avant-garde poet, as one of them confessed in a letter to the editors.<ref name="mf1958i"/> ''Omul ciudat'' had a small circulation and, according to critic [[R<U+0103>zvan Voncu]], was only popular among the "connoisseurs of the avant-garde".<ref name="rvsecretele"/> The book earned Pals the [[Benjamin Fondane]] Award, granted by the Association of Romanian Writers in Israel.<ref name="lsrepere"/> Pals' heath condition was declining to such a degree that he had to be carried to that ceremony; by 1999, he was bedridden and [[Feeding tube|tube-fed]], but fully conscious and perfecting poems that were supposed to convey his final message to the world.<ref name="lsrepere"/> He was still working on this on October 17, 2002, when he had to be taken to hospital.<ref name="lsrepere"/> 

Pals died in [[Tel Aviv]], on October 27, 2002.<ref name="ipciudat41"/><ref name="mfepistol<U+0103>">{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=312 "Epistol<U+0103> despre trup"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 5-6/2006</ref> Just days before this happened, the Romanian review ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' hosted three of his final poems.<ref name="lsrepere"/> Pals' last work saw print a month later, in ''Ultima Or<U+0103>'', the Tel Aviv Romanian-Jewish newspaper.<ref name="lsrepere"/> A revised edition of ''Omul ciudat'' came out at [[Editura Paideia]], with illustrations by Mariana Macri, daughter of Pals' friend [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Ionathan X. Uranus]].<ref name="pcsubter"/>

Much of Pals' sizable fortune was bequeathed to the Rabin Medical Center, founding a research unit "for early detection and prevention of gastrointestinal cancer".<ref name="generousrmc"/> Pals was survived by Lucy, who died in 2006, and by Valentina Caraion, both of whom participated in the effort to recover and edit his work.<ref name="mf1958i"/> Although most of Pals' texts remained unpublished and under-researched, a follow-up to ''Omul ciudat'', titled ''<U+00CE>ntuneric <U+0219>i lumin<U+0103>'' ("Darkness and Light") was put out in Romania in 2007.<ref name="ipciudat41"/><ref name="rvsecretele"/> 

His 2013 centennial was celebrated in Romania under the auspices of the [[Museum of Romanian Literature]]<ref name="mflagrani<U+021B>ele"/> and [[Gaudeamus Book Fair]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/targul-international-gaudeamus-programul-zilei-de-sambata-23-noiembrie-i-de-ziarul-de-duminica-11677108 "T<U+00E2>rgul Interna<U+021B>ional Gaudeamus.

==Work==

Various exegetes have reached the conclusion that Pals' ''Alge'' poetry is ahead of its time and context, one of the more notable contribution to the second-wave avant-garde in Romania. [[Paul Cernat]] describes a clash of visions between the "prophetic" ambitions of ''Alge'' and Pals' character, that of a "vulnerable introvert, terrorized by the precariousness of the human condition".<ref name="pcsubter"/> According to [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], some of these poems stand out among the "purely awkward exercises" of youth, as "unhinged" [[Expressionism|expressionist]] pieces in succession to those of [[Adrian Maniu]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].<ref>Pop, pp. 41, 43</ref> Other, tamer, pieces were directly inspired by the [[Hermeticism (poetry)|hermetic]] [[Ion Barbu]]<ref name="ipciudat41"/> and the mainstream modernist [[Tudor Arghezi]].<ref name="pcsubter"/> Several poems are singled out by Crohm<U+0103>lnicanu for being biblical-themed and distinctly apocalyptic, while yet others are "socially-inspired", "unanimistic" and "fraternal", addressed to "those people I meet on the tram".<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu (2001), pp. 171-172</ref>

By the mid 1950s, when he settled for a format of [[blank verse]] and [[haiku]]s, Pals was prone to philosophical meditation, and explored much deeper into lyrical themes. As argued by Finkenthal, this change was prompted by his separation from Valentina: "From now on, the poet finds himself locked in a world where things happen, things change, where there is no longer room for any refuge into love or wisdom."<ref>{{ro icon}} Mich<U+00E4>el Finkenthal, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=142 "Sesto Pals <U+00EE>n anul de gra<U+021B>ie 1958 (II)"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 12/2006</ref> According to Voncu, there was another cultural layer: like [[Gellu Naum]] and other late arrivals on the avant-garde scene, Pals was moving away from the sheer negativity of ''Alge'', and attempting to construct instead a post-philosophical [[surrealism]].<ref name="rvsecretele"/> Cernat sees Pals' surrealism as having "a familiar face", with classical-format [[quatrain]]s like those of [[Tristan Tzara]], [[H. Bonciu]], and [[Jacques Pr<U+00E9>vert]].<ref name="pcsubter"/>

Some of Pals' poems, tentatively dated to 1958, seemingly allude to Valentina's arrest by the communists and the whole wave of political repression.<ref name="mf1958i"/><ref name="rvsecretele"/> Such dark and brooding works are held by both Finkenthal and Voncu as proof that Caraion and Pals influenced each other directly, despite their erotic rivalry.<ref name="rvsecretele"/> One fragment depicts silent struggles between the scheming fishermen and their catch, implying that fish still have a dying hope:

<poem>
But at night, the moon being left in its dimness,
The waves swelling over the shore,
The wind and the darkness colliding,
Fishermen will sense that great soul of the sea
Rising up from the depths...
Right then, sea creatures will beacon them down under,
Pull them into scores of movable chasms,
And woe unto whoever goes down, pulled into the chasm of the sea...
</poem>

In 1960s prose poems which display influences from [[Franz Kafka]] or [[Urmuz]],<ref name="mfdialoguri"/> Pals amplified his sense of bafflement about the human condition. Nonetheless, Finkenthal writes, his very series of lyrical verse hints at "truths that are inaccessible to common mortals".<ref name="mfepistol<U+0103>"/> He reconciled himself with the idea of time by denying its concreteness, but drew a line between general time and "the time of creation". The latter allowed for a future, and therefore provided room for "affirmation and oblivion".<ref name="mftransc1"/> This meant that, "once he puts himself on the line, an artist will have to fade into his own affirmation."<ref name="mftransc2"/> The moribund Pals sketched out a quaint prophecy:
