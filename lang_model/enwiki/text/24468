The '''Symmes Mission Chapel''' was a historic [[church (building)|church building]] in the city of [[Fairfield, Ohio|Fairfield]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  A simple structure constructed in the 1840s, it was named a [[historic site]] in the 1980s.

==History==
One of the leading members of the congregation that built the Symmes Mission Chapel was Benjamin Symmes,<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 1.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 105.</ref> who along with Abram Huston and John Mesler helped to found the [[Old School<U+2013>New School Controversy|Old School Presbyterian]] congregation in the late 1830s.  Most of the members were drawn from Presbyterian churches in [[Hamilton, Ohio|Hamilton]], [[Springdale, Ohio|Springdale]], and [[Ross, Ohio|Ross]], so the congregation was founded in the locality known as Symmes Corners in order to be convenient for all of the members.  Shortly after the organization of the congregation,<ref name=history>''A History and Biographical Cyclopaedia of Butler County, Ohio: With Illustrations and Sketches of Its Representative Men and Pioneers''.  [[Cincinnati]]: Western Biographical, 1882475.</ref> seemingly in 1843,<ref name=nris /> the original church building was constructed at a cost of $1,180 on land donated by Benjamin Symmes.  It was the primary home of the eighty-member congregation for some years, but by the 1850s the majority of the members lived southward in far northern [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], so a new building was constructed near [[Pleasant Run, Ohio|Pleasant Run]], and the old building was ultimately abandoned by the congregation.<ref name=history />  However, it remained in use by others in the community until 1968, either as a church or as a school, and it had come into the possession of Fairfield's [[historical society]] by 1980.<ref name=dohp />

==Architecture==
A simple [[clapboard (architecture)|weatherboarded]] building, the chapel was two [[storey|stories]] tall with a shallow [[gable]]d roof.  A doorway was placed in the middle of the front, with one window above and to each side, while the sides of the building, much longer than the front, were pierced with a few windows in the middle and rear.<ref>[http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/ohpo/nr/details.aspx?refnum=80002946 Symmes Mission Chapel], [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2013-12-26.</ref>  Built without a [[basement]], the building rested on a [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of [[ashlar]], while the roof was ultimately covered with [[asphalt]] shingles.  Inside, a stairway in the rear (near the pulpit) permitted access to the upper floor.  The sanctuary was decorated with ornamental [[woodworking|woodwork]], including [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]] designs, while much of the interior was covered with [[tongue and groove]] panelling.<ref name=ohi>Gibbs, Kenneth T.  ''[http://lanepl.org/OHI/BUT147712.pdf Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Symmes Chapel]''.  [[Ohio Historical Society]], 1986-06.</ref>  A small [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] building, it lacked other significant elements, such as [[Church architecture|traditional ecclesiastical architecture]] and virtually all ornamentation traditionally applied to churches.<ref name=dohp />

==Historic site==
In 1980, the church was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.<ref name=nris />  Far from qualifying for grand architecture, it qualified because of its simple design: it represented what was once a common country church design, free of ornament and built for functional purposes.  By that time, it was one of very few pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] buildings remaining in Fairfield, which was quickly becoming more and more of an [[commuter town|exurb]] in the [[Cincinnati metropolitan area]].<ref name=dohp />  Six years later, the church was recorded by personnel from [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler County's]] Citizens for Historic and Preservation Services as part of a [[historic preservation]] survey, the Ohio Historic Inventory.  Noting the church's place among contemporary commercial development, the surveyor observed deterioration in both interior and exterior, and by that time the building was seemingly close to collapse.<ref name=ohi />  Today, the building is gone, with an empty lot occupying its place, although the historical society still owned the empty lot as of the end of 2013.<ref>[http://propertysearch.butlercountyohio.org/butler/maps/mapadv.aspx Property Search Website: Parcel A0700057000010], Butler County Auditor, 2013-12-25.
