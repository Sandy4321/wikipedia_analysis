'''Volc<U+00E1>n San Crist<U+00F3>bal''' is the highest volcano in [[Nicaragua]] at {{Convert|1745|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Located near to the northwest corner of the country, it forms a majestic backdrop to the town of [[Chichigalpa]], [[Chinandega]]. It is also among the most active volcanos in Nicaragua, erupting frequently (if gently).

San Crist<U+00F3>bal is part of a 5-member volcanic complex that bears the same name. [[El Chonco]] lies 4&nbsp;km to the west, and [[Moyotepe]] 4&nbsp;km to the north east. Joined to the volcano's eastern flank is [[Volc<U+00E1>n Casita]], which buried a village with a catastrophic landslide in 1998. The scars from said landslide are still visible today. Finally, [[La Pelona volcano|La Pelona]] is located on the eastern end of the complex.<ref name=gvp/>

==Physical features==
San Crist<U+00F3>bal is the youngest volcano in its complex. It is a nearly symmetrical [[stratovolcano]], rising in a distinctive cone shape. The SW slope is the longest, and the crater rim on that side rises 140&nbsp;m above the NE end due to prevailing trade winds that distribute tephra to the SW.<ref name=gvp/>

The crater is 500x600&nbsp;m in size. While the volcano was at one point covered in tropical forests, the large quantities of gas and smoke that it emits constantly have killed off much of the vegetation.<ref>INETER San Cristobal description http://www.ineter.gob.ni/geofisica/vol/cristobal/descr.html</ref>

==Eruptive history==
* 1685: Erupted strongly enough to merit preservation in historical accounts.
* August 1919: Produced loud noises and light tremors that were felt in surrounding areas.
* May 1971: Produced bangs and explosions.
* March 1976: Produced a high, continuous column of smoke, several light tremors, and explosions that occurred every three minutes.
* c. December 1986: Marked expulsion of gases
* c. January 1987: Expelled large quantities of gas.
* May 1997: Entered into a new eruptive period, expelling gases, ash, and sand, and also producing light tremors.
* December 1999: Expelled gas, ash, and sand.
* May, August 2001: Reactivated.
* April 2006: Moderate [[phreatic eruption]].
* July  2008: Rumbled with a series of small explosions, and expelled gas.

==Current activity==
San Crist<U+00F3>bal remains quite active, continuously expelling copious amounts of gas and smoke. As recent as September 2009, it was reported that ash was falling in nearby towns <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bnonews.com/jdug|title=Eruption underway at Nicaragua's San Cristobal volcano|publisher=BNO News|date=September 2009|accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref>
