'''Murrayfield Stadium''' (usually just known as '''Murrayfield''') is a sports [[stadium]] located in the west end of [[Edinburgh]], the capital of [[Scotland]]. Its all-seater capacity was recently reduced from 67,800 to 67,130 to incorporate the largest permanent 'big screen' in the country though it still remains the largest stadium in Scotland and one of the largest in the United Kingdom overall.
The stadium is the home of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] (SRU), and is primarily used as a venue for [[rugby union]] and hosts most of [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland's]] home test matches, as well as the [[Edinburgh Sevens]], the ''Scottish Hydro Electric Cup'' final, as well as [[Magners League]] and [[Heineken Cup]] matches. The stadium is considered an icon of Scottish rugby.

Although mainly a rugby union stadium, Murrayfield has in the past hosted [[Scottish Claymores|American football]], [[Challenge Cup|rugby league]] and [[association football]] matches. In addition, it has in the past been a venue for music concerts, the most notable of these being the [[Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push]] concert as part of [[Live 8]].

==Location==
[[Image:Rugby Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby union.]]
Murrayfield is located right next door to the [[Murrayfield Ice Rink]], and close to the [[Edinburgh Zoo]]. It is named after the area of Edinburgh it is located in, [[Murrayfield]].

It has good public transport links, being particularly well-served by bus links along the Corstorphine Road. Despite the line running adjacent to the stadium, its nearest railway station is [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]], which is a 1 mile walk from the stadium.

==History==
The SFU bought some land and built the first Murrayfield which was opened on 21 March 1925. Previously internationals had been played at [[Inverleith]]. The first visitors were {{nrut|England}}, whom {{nrut|Scotland}} beat to win their first [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]].

During the [[Second World War]] the ground at Murrayfield was offered to the nation and was taken over by the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] and used as a supply depot. During the war years the [[British armed forces|armed forces]] sports authorities managed to arrange two Scotland v. England services internationals each year, on a home-and-away basis. Scotland's home matches were played at Inverleith for the first two years with a return to Murrayfield in 1944 after that ground's derequisition. In 1994 Murrayfield completed a 50 million pound renovation where floodlights were installed for the first time in its history.

==Present==

Currently Murrayfield is used for most [[Scotland|Scottish]] international [[rugby union]] matches, with all Scotland's [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] home games being played here. The stadium also hosts [[Edinburgh Rugby]], one of Scotland's two professional sides in the [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Magners League]] that also features teams from [[Rugby union in Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Rugby union in Wales|Wales]]. (For Magners League matches, only the lower tier of the West Stand is typically used.) Since [[2006-07 IRB Sevens World Series|2007]], Murrayfield has hosted the [[Edinburgh Sevens|Edinburgh 7s]], the final event in the annual [[IRB Sevens World Series]] in [[rugby sevens]]. Murrayfield also hosted select matches from the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. The stadium also hosted the [[Heineken Cup]] Final in [[2004-05 Heineken Cup|2005]], when [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] beat [[Stade Fran<U+00E7>ais]] by 18 points to 12, and again in [[2008-09 Heineken Cup|2009]], with Leinster defeating Leicester by 19 points to 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8057916.stm |title=Leicester 16-19 Leinster |publisher=European Rugby Cup |date=2008-05-19 |accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>

Murrayfield also hosts [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. The first football match played on Murrayfield was played between the local [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] (Hearts) and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Sporting Braga]] in September 2004.  In 2006, Hearts selected Murrayfield as their ''home'' venue for their European campaign in the 2006/2007 season, as [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] did not meet the [[UEFA]] criteria for hosting European football matches. This has seen clubs such as [[Ferencvaros]], [[Schalke 04]] and [[AEK Athens]] playing at Murrayfield. Additionally, Hearts hosted a preseason friendly on July 28, 2007 against [[FC Barcelona]] in front of a crowd of nearly 58,000.

Although a union stadium, Murrayfield hosted the [[rugby league]] [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] finals in 2000 and 2002 and''' 2003'''. The stadium will host rugby league's [[Super League]] [[Magic Weekend]] as of 2009, taking over from the Millennium Stadium.

Murrayfield has also played host to [[American football]] and was one of two home venues for the now defunct [[Scottish Claymores]] in the [[NFL Europa]] between 1995 and 2004, the other being [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]]. Additionally, it hosted [[World Bowl IV]] on 23 June 1996. 

The [[stadium]] has also seen performances from artists such as [[Tina Turner]], [[Celine Dion]], [[David Bowie]], [[U2]], [[R.E.M.]] & [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers]].

In July 2005, Murrayfield hosted the final [[Live 8]] concert, [[Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push]], with performances from the likes of [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[Texas (band)|Texas]] & [[The Proclaimers]]. 

British rock group [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]  played a sold-out show on the 17th of June 2009 as part of their world tour. This was the last time they would play a gig in Scotland and the second time they had played the stadium, the first being on their [[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Tour]] in 2000.

It has a 100m running track by the main stand.

The [[Bill McLaren]] Press Gallery is located at Murrayfield Stadium and the [[Bill McLaren Foundation]] was launched there on 4th March 2010.

The seats incorporate the letters "[[SRU]]" as well as a tartan pattern. This tartan is the official tartan of the [[SRU]].
