The '''Far<U+00F8> Bridges''' ([[Danish language|Danish]], Far<U+00F8>broerne) are two [[road bridge]]s that connect the islands of [[Falster]] and [[Zealand]] (Sj<U+00E6>lland) in [[Denmark]].

The two bridges meet upon the small island of Far<U+00F8> which is approximately mid-way across the sound. Faro has area 0.93 km<U+00B2>, with a recorded population of 3 in 2004. A smaller bridge from Far<U+00F8> provides access to [[Bog<U+00F8>]] and thence to the island of [[M<U+00F8>n]]. The Bridges carry the combined E47 route to Lolland and E55 route to Falster, from [[Copenhagen]] and [[Elsinore|Helsing<U+00F8>r]], both of which continue to mainland Europe by ferry. A further bridge from Lolland, the [[Fehmarn Belt bridge]] is planned to carry the E47 route to [[Germany]], replacing the ferry.

The Far<U+00F8> Bridges were opened by [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] on [[June 4]], [[1985]]. They were built because of the increasing congestion problems on the old [[Storstr<U+00F8>m Bridge]] from [[1937]].

The high (south) bridge crosses [[Storstr<U+00F8>mmen]] between Falster and [[Far<U+00F8>]]. It is a [[cable-stayed bridge]]. The bridge is 1726 metres long, the longest span is 290 metres, and the maximum clearance to the sea is 26 metres strung up on 95.14 meters high suspension towers, which was finished in 1984. It was the first cable-stayed bridge in [[Scandinavia]]. The two towers supporting the span are of 'diamond' shape construction, rising from a single point to either side of the roadway, then combining to one point above the centre of the bridge. There is only one row of suspension cables, along the centre of the roadway.

The low (north) bridge crosses [[Kalv<U+00F8> Str<U+00F8>m]] between Far<U+00F8> and Zealand. It is a [[beam bridge]]. The bridge is 1596 metres long, the longest span is 40 metres, and the maximum clearance to the sea is 20 metres.
