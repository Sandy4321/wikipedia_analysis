'''Fern<U+00E1>ndo Norzagaray y Escudero''' was a Spanish soldier and colonial governor. Of Basque descent, he was a lieutenant general before becoming the 104th [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] and the 78th [[Spanish Governor - Captain General of the Philippines|Governor of the Philippines]] under [[Spain|Spanish colonial rule]].  He also had a political career in Spain.  In 1840 he was briefly Minister of War.  On his return to Spain in 1860 he was made a senator, but he died the same year.<ref name="Senate">{{cite web | url=http://www.senado.es/cgi-bin/BRSCGI?CMD=VERDOC&BASE=HISE&DOCN=000002029 | title=NORZAGARAY Y ESCUDERO, Fernando: File of the Life Senator | publisher=Spanish Senate | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Puerto Rico==
He did extensive infrastructure work in Puerto Rico. One example was the bridge known as General Norzagaray's Grand Bridge, which crossed the Los Frailes stream. Arsenals were constructed, and a cavalry was created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=08121201|title=Chronology of the Governors of the 19th century|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-28 | format=}}</ref>

==Philippines==
Norzagaray authorized establishments of houses of foreign currency exchange on June 18, 1857, just two months after his ascendancy to [[Spanish Governor - Captain General of the Philippines|governor]]. He ordered local administration reforms in September 1858 and reorganized the infantry in September 1859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zamboanga.com/html/Spanish_governors_of_the_philippines.htm|title=Governors of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period|date=1997-2002|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-27 }}</ref> In April 1859, ten Jesuit priests arrived in the Philippines, after being allowed again in the archipelago, to persuade Norzagaray to grant a Jesuit school be made. They were given the Escuela Municipal, which is the only primary school in Manila, on October 1, 1859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/ht/ht009269.htm|title=THE  ATENEO  AT 150|date=2009-12-17|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-27 }}</ref> In 1858 he established a [[botanical garden]], the ''Jard<U+00ED>n Bot<U+00E1>nico'', on the site now known as [[Mehan Garden]].<ref name="Midmorning">{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=85914 | title=JARDIN BOTANICO | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpinoys.net/first.htm|title=First in the Philippines|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-27 }}</ref>

==[[Cochinchina Campaign]]==
He sent Philippine troops to [[Cochinchina]], southern Vietnam, in 1858 in a joint campaign with the French.  Both Spain and France claimed to be defending Catholicism in Vietman, with Spain reacting to the execution of bishop Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a D<U+00ED>az Sanjurjo at [[Nam Dinh]], northern Vietnam, on July 20, 1857.  The expedition raised hopes of increasing Philippine trade in Asia, however, Spain and its colony gained little long-term benefit from the four-year campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.florentinorodao.com/scholarly/sch08a.htm#_The_Colonial_Opportunity_%281840-1868|title=Spain in the Philippines and East Asia in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|date=|publisher=Universidad Complutense de Madrid|accessdate=2011-10-27 | format=}}</ref>

At the [[Siege of Tourane]], the Spanish navy was represented by the armed despatch vessel ''El Cano'', only one of the initial 13 warships used during the campaign.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu<U+00EA>te'', 33</ref> The transport included a marine artillery battery and 1,000 troops drawn from the Spanish garrison of the Philippines, mostly Tagalogs and Visayans. It was put under the command of the French Admiral [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]]. The combined Franco-Spanish force was forced to evacuate Tourane, giving way to the Vietnamese.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu<U+00EA>te'', 29<U+2013>31 and 38<U+2013>41; ''Histoire militaire'', 24<U+2013>5 and 26<U+2013>7</ref> The same force was used in the [[Siege of Saigon]], which was put under the same French admiral, and garnered a victory for the combined Franco-Spanish force.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu<U+00EA>te'', 35-36</ref>

In 1860, most of the Spanish forces under the command of Admiral Bernardo Ruiz de Lanzarote were withdrawn on French request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigelgooding.co.uk/Spanish/Cochinchina/cochinchina.htm |title=Filipino Involvement in the French-Spanish Campaign in Indochina |date=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-27 }}</ref>  France went on to develop a colony in Vietnam.

==Legacy==
The town of [[Norzagaray]], which was formerly known as Casay, was named in his honor. During his term, he separated Casay from Angat and made the former a distinct town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/norzagaray/history.php|title=Municipality of Norzagaray|year=2007|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-27 | format=}}</ref>
