'''''Blind Illusion''''' was a highly technical [[progressive metal|progressive]] [[thrash metal]] band from [[San Francisco, California]]. Formed in [[1979]] by [[lead guitar]]ist and chief [[songwriter]] [[Marc Biedermann]]. The band had an extremely unstable lineup (Biedermann being the only constant member) and even went through a few stylistic changes in their time. They are perhaps best known for being the launching pad for the now famous [[alternative metal]] band [[Primus (band)|Primus]] (bassist [[Les Claypool]] and guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]] played on B.I.'s only album, ''[[The Sane Asylum]]'').

==History==
Blind Illusion was formed in 1979 by-then-high-school student [[Mark Biedermann]] along with many other unspecified members including [[keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] [[Ben Hevoroh]] and drummer [[Bret Hern]]. They were originally a [[progressive rock]] band.

Around the early 80's the lineup for Blind Illusion had completely changed except for Biedermann. The band now featured vocalist [[David Godfrey]], guitarist [[Pat Woods]], bassist [[Geno Side]] and drummer [[Mike Miner]] (formerly of local [[speed metal]] band [[Blizzard (band)|Blizzard]]. The band had also made a stylistic change to [[thrash metal]], becoming major players on the local [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene, but retained much of their [[progressive rock]] influence. This lineup recorded many demos and largely put Blind Illusion on the map.

In the mid 80's David Godfrey left to join another local thrash band called [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]]. Guitarist Pat Woods briefly took over vocal duties before he himself left Blind Illusion. Mark Biedermann took over vocal duties. Then [[Metallica]] hopeful bassist [[Les Claypool]] replaced Geno Side on bass, adding a new [[funk]] influence into the band's bass lines. They released a demo that was produced by [[Kirk Hammett]]. The band also added second guitarist [[John Marshall]], later of [[Metal Church]], who was replaced by former [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]]. 

Around [[1987]] the band finally got a record deal with [[Combat Records]], with whom the band recorded their only official release, ''[[The Sane Asylum]]''. The album was considered a thrash classic, featuring now famous tracks such as "Kamikaze" and "Smash The Crystal". The band went on a successful tour for the album but then began to fall apart around [[1988]]. Claypool left towards the end of the tour to reform his old band [[Primus (band)|Primus]]. LaLonde followed out the door to join Claypool and Miner left at an unspecified time. Biedermann put together a new lineup featuring guitarist [[Mark Strausberg]], bassist [[Vern McElroy]], and drummer [[Wes Anderson]]. The lineup began working on a new album ''[[The Medicine Show]]'' but imploded before the album was released.

Mark Biedermann went on to briefly play bass for [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]] on their ''[[Victims of Deception]]'' album and contributed guitar leads to a [[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult]] album. Meanwhile Claypool and LaLonde went on to near mainstream success with Primus. Currently Biedermann is apparently trying to get ''Medicine Show'' released as well as working on a new Blind Illusion album and re-releasing ''Sane Asylum'' (which has become an extremely rare collectors item)

It had been confirmed that on September 10th, Metal Mind Productions (who reissued Heathen's Victims of Deception) will be reissuing The Sane Asylum in a limited edition 2000 copy release.
