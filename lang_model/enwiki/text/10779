Tablighi Jamaat came forth as an offshoot of the [[Deobandi|Deobandi movement]]. Its inception is believed to be a response to [[Hindu reform movements]], which were considered a threat to vulnerable and non-practicing Muslims.<ref name=bmppp/> It gradually expanded from local to national to a transnational movement and now has followers in over 150&nbsp;countries.<ref name=fred/>

Tabligh Jamaat maintains a non-affiliating stature in matters of politics and ''[[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence) so as to eschew the controversies that would otherwise accompany such affiliations.<ref name=p135>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ayoob|2007|p=135}}</ref> Although, Tabligh Jamaat emerged out of the Deobandi sub-school in the [[Hanafi|Hanafi fiqh]], no particular [[Madh'hab|interpretation of Islam]] has been endorsed since the beginning of movement.<ref name=p135/><ref name=jenkins>{{Cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=God's continent |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|year=2007|edition=illustrated, annotated|page=340|isbn=019531395X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=94rZKHMilp0C&dq=tablighi|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Tabligh Jamaat has largely avoided electronic media and has emphasized a personal communication for proselytizing. The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are mainly rudimentary and the Six&nbsp;Principles put forward by Muhammad Ilyas influence most of their teachings. 

Despite its pacifist stance, Tabligh Jamaat has appeared on the fringes of numerous terrorism investigations. Tablighi Jamaat's role as a springboard to terrorist organizations has been questioned several times but  there is no evidence that the Tabligh Jamaat deliberately act as a recruiting arm for [[Islamic extremism|Islamic militant organizations]].<ref name=fred/><ref name=Mangalorean>{{cite news

|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>  Tabligh Jamaat attracted significant public and media attention when it announced plans for the largest [[mosque]] in Europe to be built in London, United Kingdom.

==History==
{{Deobandi}}
The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat represented the intensification of individual reformation aspect of the original Deobandi movement. It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapsed Muslim political power and the consolidation of the British rule in India in the mid-nineteenth century. This emergence also coincides with the rise of various Hindu proselytizing movements which launched massive efforts in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had previously converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name="Ballard 1994 64">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref> Notable among these Hindu revivalist movements were Shuddhi (purification) and Sangathan (consolidation) movements. The Tabligh movement aimed to reaffirm Muslim religiocultural identity of these borderline Muslims who still carried customs and religious practices from Hindu past. Unlike common proselytizing movements, TJ never strove to convert non-Muslims to Islam, rather it exclusively focused on making Muslims 'better and purer'.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=511}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=104}}</ref>

===Origin===
{{Main|Tabligh movement in Mewat}}
Tablighi Jamaat originated in 1926 in [[Mewat]], in [[north India]], which was inhabited by [[Rajput]] tribes known as [[Meo]]s. At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders feared that Muslims were losing their religious identity to the majority [[Hindu]] culture. The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas used to call it ''Tahrik-i Imaan''.<ref name="k261"/><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Roy|2007|p=342}}</ref>

There is evidence that several Meos [[Religious conversion|converted to Islam]], followed by re-conversion to Hinduism when Muslim political power declined in the region. The Meos were generally benighted Muslims before the emergence of Tabligh Jamaat, and lacked the necessary acumen required to resist the cultural and religious influence of Hindus.<ref name="Ballard 1994 64"/>

Muhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tabligh Jamaat, wanted to set forth a movement that would exemplify the [[Qur'an]]ic decree of 'enjoining good and forbidding evil'.<ref name="Quran">{{cite quran|3|104|s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> The inspiration for devoting his life to Islam came to Ilyas during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to the [[Hejaz]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite document | last = Agwani | first = Mohammad Shafi | title = Islamic Fundamentalism in India 1986 | publisher = Twenty First Century Indian Society | year = 1986 | page = 41 | ref = harv | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> He initially strove to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about correct Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious&nbsp;functionaries but not preachers.<ref name=p152>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=152}}</ref>

He abandoned his teaching profession at Madrasah Mazharul Ulum in [[Saharanpur]] and started on his life as a missionary. He relocated to [[Nizamuddin West|Nizamuddin]] near [[Delhi]], where this movement was formally launched in 1926.<ref name=p152/> When setting the guidelines for the movement, he sought inspiration from the practices adopted by Muhammad at the dawn of Islam.<ref name=p65>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ballard|1994|p=65}}</ref> Muhammad&nbsp;Ilyas put forward the slogan, {{nowrap|{{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|"!<U+0627><U+FBAE> <U+0645><U+0633><U+0644><U+0645><U+0627><U+0646><U+0648>! <U+0645><U+0633><U+0644><U+0645><U+0627><U+0646> <U+0628><U+0646><U+0648>"}}}}}}, "O Muslims! Become Muslims". This expressed the central focus of Tablighi Jamat; their aim to renew Muslim society by uniting them in embracing the lifestyle of Muhammad. The movement gained a phenomenal following in a relatively short period and nearly 25,000 people attended the annual conference in November 1941.<ref name=p152/>

===Expansion===
[[File:Biswa Ijtema Dhaka Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|200px| Bishwa Dhaka Ijtema in Bangladesh]]
The group began to expand its activities in 1946, and within two decades the group reached [[Western Asia|Southwest Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]].<ref name=p514/> Tabligh Jamaat's aversion to politics helped it enter and operate in societies where politically active religious groups faced severe restrictions.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=524}}</ref> Initially it expanded its reach to [[Arab diaspora|South Asian diaspora]] communities, firstly in [[Arab people|Arab]]ic countries, and then in Southeast Asia. The first foreign missions were sent to Hejaz and Britain in 1946.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=127}}</ref> Before entering Europe, the movement first established itself in the United States. It established a large presence in Europe during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=k261>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kepel|2004|p=261}}</ref>  The construction of the [[Markazi Masjid]] in [[Dewsbury]], England commenced in 1978 which subsequently became the European headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat. This centre holds one major gathering annually, generally in Dewsbury itself. It has also constructed a busy [[madrasah]], called the Institute of Islamic Education.<ref name=Norfolk/>

==Beliefs and objectives==
Following the fundamentals of [[Sunni Islam]], every member is allowed to follow his own fiqh as long as it does not deviate from Sunni&nbsp;Islam.<ref name=p135/><ref name=Eva/> Tablighi Jamaat defines its objective with reference to the concept of ''[[Dawah]]'' which literally means 'to call' and connotes to an invitation to act. In religious context, it implies to a call towards Islam and not prayers which may also refer to a 'mission' if used in reference with religious prophets and people who were assigned such mission. Tabligh Jamaat interprets ''Dawah'' as [[Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong|''enjoining good and forbidding evil'']] only and defines its objective within the framework of two particular Qur'anic verses which refer to this mission.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=xxi}}</ref> Those two verses are:<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=xxii}}</ref>
 
{{Quote|Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to [[Allah]], works righteousness, and says, "I am of those who bow in Islam"? |Qur'an, [[sura]] 41 ([[Surat Fussilat|Fussilat]]), [[ayah]] 33<ref>{{cite quran|41|33|s=ns}}</ref>}}
{{Quote|Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity.|Qur'an sura 3 ([[Al-i-Imran]]), ayah 104<ref name="Quran"/>}}

Tabligh Jamaat encourages everyone to fulfill the Islamic requirement of ''da'wa'' even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly [[ulama]]-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious erudites. Tabligh Jamaat also negated the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were pre-requisites for proselytizing; and promoted ''da'wa'' as a mechanism of self-reform.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=515}}</ref>

The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in most [[Khutbah|sermons]], is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. They encourage Muslims to spend time out of their daily routine in the tablighi activities so that the rest of routine could be harmonized with Tablighi lifestyle. They insist that the best way of learning is teaching and encouraging others.<ref name=bmppp/>

Tablighi ethic discourages social enmeshments in  customary and ceremonial rituals which are usually extravagantly followed in South Asia. For example, in such annual congregations and other similar mass meetings, marriages are performed by dozens sans the costly celebrations.<ref name=womenbm/>

===Six Principles===
The method adopted by Muhammad Ilyas was simple. It was to organize units (called ''jamaats'', {{lang-ar|''' <U+062C><U+0645><U+0627><U+0639><U+062A><U+0650> '''}} meaning ''Assembly'') of at least ten persons and send them to various villages. This unit ''jamaat'', would visit a village, invite the local Muslims only to assemble in the mosque and present their message in the form of Six Principles.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=513}}</ref> Muhammad Ilyas articulated six demands in the form of Six Principles which are quintessential to Tabligh Jamaat's teachings. These six principles are:

#''[[Kalimah|Kalmah]]'': An article of faith in which the tablighi accepts that there is no god but Allah and the Prophet Muhammad is His Last messenger". This Kalima is for all Muslims and is not restricted to Tablighis only.
#''[[Salah]]'': "Five daily prayers that are essential to spiritual elevation, piety, and a life free from the ills of the material world"
#''[[Ilm (Arabic)|Ilm]] and [[Dhikr|Zikr]]'': "The knowledge and remembrance of Allah conducted in sessions in which the congregation listens to preaching by the emir, performs prayers, recites the Quran and reads ''[[Hadith]]''.  The congregation will also use these sessions to eat meals together, thus fostering a sense of community and identity"
#''[[Akhlaq|Ikraam-e-Muslim]]'': "The treatment of fellow Muslims with honor and deference"
#''Tas'hih-i-Niyyat'': "Reforming one<U+2019>s life in supplication to Allah by performing every human action for the sake of Allah and toward the goal of self-transformation"
#''Dawt'o' Tableegh''([[Dawah]]): "The sparing of time to live a life based on faith and learning its virtues, following in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad, and taking His message door-to-door for the sake of faith"<ref name=Eva/>

==Organization==
[[File:Kakrail Mosque, Dhaka.jpg|thumb| [[Kakrail Mosque]], [[Dhaka]]. The Tablighi Jamaat movement in [[Bangladesh]] is mostly based here.]]
Tablighi Jamaat follows an informal organizational structure and keeps an introvert institutional profile. It keeps its distance from [[mass media]] and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly to avoid the disputes which would accompany these endorsements.<ref name=mef>{{cite news|first = Alex|last = Alexiev|title=Tablighi Jamaat: Jihad's Stealthy Legions|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/686|date=Winter 2005|publisher=[[Middle East Quarterly]]|accessdate=2007-02-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/12-tableeghi-jamaat-leaders-denounce-gunpoint-sharia--bi-12 | title= Tableeghi Jamaat leaders denounce gunpoint Sharia |accessdate=2009-04-29 | date=2009-04-27 | publisher=DawnNews }}</ref> As an organization, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is largely funded by its senior members. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=154}}</ref> The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts. Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by [[Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi|Zakariya Kandahalwi]], the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.<ref name=bmppp>{{cite web|url=http://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/metcalf.htm|title=Traditionalist" Islamic Activism: Deoband, Tablighis, and Talibs|last=Barbara|first=Metcalf|date=|publisher=Social Science Research Council|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref><ref name=p516>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=516}}</ref> A collection of books, usually referred as ''Tablighi&nbsp;Nisaab'' (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (''[[Hayatus Sahabah]]'', ''[[Fazail-e-Amaal]]'', ''[[Fazail-e-Sadqaat]]'' and ''[[Muntakhab-e-Ahadis]]'').<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=82}}</ref>

The organization's activities are coordinated through centers and headquarters called ''Markaz''. Tablighi Jamaat maintains its international headquarters, called ''[[Nizamuddin Markaz Masjeed|Nizamuddin Markaz]]'', in the Nizamuddin West district of [[South Delhi]], India, from where it originally started. It also has country headquarters in over 213 countries to coordinate its activities. These headquarters organize volunteer, self-funding people in groups (called ''jamaats''), averaging ten to twelve people, for reminding Muslims to remain steadfast on path of God.<ref name=sameer/> These ''jamaats'' and preaching missions are self funded by their respective members.

===Leadership===
[[Emir|Ameer]] is the title of leadership in the Tabligh Jamaat and the attribute largely sought is the quality of faith, rather than the worldly rank.<ref name=womenbm/> The ameer of Tabligh Jamaat is appointed for life by central consultative council (''shoora'') and elders of Tabligh Jamaat.<ref name="p516"/><ref name=p156>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=156}}</ref> First ''ameer'', also the founder, was Muhammad Ilyas, second was his son [[Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi]] and the third was [[Inaam ul Hasan]].<ref name=p514>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=514}}</ref> At present, there is a council of two people <U+2014> Zubair ul Hasan and Saad Kandhalawi <U+2014> acting as ameer.<ref name=sameer/>

==Activities and traditions==

The activism of Tabligh Jamaat can be characterized by the last of the Six Principles. This principle, ''Tafrigh-i-Waqt'' (English: sparing of time) justifies the withdrawal from world, though temporarily, for travelling. Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organization. They describe the purpose of this retreat as to patch the damages caused by the worldly indulgence and occasionally use the dry-dock parable to explain this.<ref name=p166>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=166}}</ref>

These individual ''jamaats'', each led by an ''ameer'', are sent from each markaz across the city or country to remind people to persist on the path of God. The duration of the work depends on the discretion of each ''jamaat''. A trip can take an evening, a couple of days or a prolonged duration.<ref name=fred/><ref name=womenbm/>

===''Khur<U+016B>j'' - proselytizing tour===
Tabligh Jamaat encourages its followers to follow the pattern of spending "one night a week, one weekend a month, 40&nbsp;continuous days a year, and ultimately 120&nbsp;days at least once in their lives engaged in tabligh missions". During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs.<ref name=womenbm/> These members use mosques as their base during this travel but  particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighi activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organization. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighborhood members.<ref name="bmppp"/>

During their stay in mosques, these ''jamaats'' conduct a daily ''gasht'', which involves visiting local neighborhoods, preferably with the help of a guide.<ref name=Eva/> They invite people to attend the ''[[Maghrib]]'' prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=27}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Masud|2000|p=28}}</ref> Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc are also carried out in the mosques.

Generally, the assumed role of these ''jamaat'' members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as ''khidmat'' which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements.<ref name=womenbm/> The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's ''mashwara''. The markaz keeps records of each ''jamaat'' and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual ''jamaats'' that voluntarily undertake preaching missions.<ref name=fred/><ref name=sameer/> Members of a ''jamaat'', ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.<ref name=womenbm>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-1/text/metcalf.html|title=Islam and women: The case of the Tablighi Jama`at|last=Barbara|first=Metcalf|date=February 27, 1996|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref>

===''Ijtema'' - annual gathering===
An annual gathering of followers, called ''ijtema'', is summoned at headquarters of the respective countries.  A typical ''ijtema'' continues for three days and ends with an exceptionally long prayer.<ref name=daily/> These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2&nbsp;million in some countries.<ref name=bmppp/> The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It attract people from all over World. Almost 2 Million people gather the this annual Gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings are held in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Women were encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected on the participation of women but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighborhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women to go to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>

In many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tabligh Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioral model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement<ref name=daily/> but they may assume roles of leadership in the their own gatherings.<ref name=womenbm/>

==Controversies==
===Abbey Mills Mosque===
{{Main|Abbey Mills Mosque}}
[[Image:New abbey mills pumping station.jpg|right|thumb|The new [[Abbey Mills pumping station]], which is adjacent to the proposed site of the Mosque]]
Tablighi Jamaat gained much media and public attention in Europe, particularly in United Kingdom, when it announced the plans for an {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} mosque near&nbsp; [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] in east London. This mosque was to have a capacity in excess of 70,000&nbsp;people making it the largest religious building in United Kingdom and the largest mosque in Europe. The scope of project raised much criticism and concern among the general public.<ref name=fred/> However, the mosque was downsized in its revised project plans for a capacity of 12,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=downsized>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6490000/newsid_6499900/6499935.stm?bw=nb&mp=wm&news=1&ms3=6&ms_javascript=true&bbcws=2|title=Mosque Plans Downsized|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-26 | date=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The plan sparked controversy for various reasons including its initially reported size, the possible chemical contamination risk associated with the site, the uncertainty as to the sources of funding that will be used by Tabligh Jamaat, and alleged links between Tabligh Jamaat and [[Islamic terrorism]].<ref name = "CT">{{cite web

===Allegations of terrorism===

Although Tabligh Jamaat has claimed a pacific stance since its inception, after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]&nbsp;attacks in the USA, concerns have risen about its role as a springboard to terrorist organizations. It was cited on the cases of [[John Walker Lindh]],<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rabasa|2004|p=448}}</ref> and dozens of the captives the USA holds in [[extrajudicial detention]] in its [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]], had their continued detention justified in part through their alleged association with the Tabligh Jamaat.

A December&nbsp;2001&nbsp;article by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' cited Indian security concerns branches of the jamaat were related to [[al-Qaeda]]. Yet "shoe-bomber" [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] apparently did not remain with the group because they were not violent enough.,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/96824546.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Dec+26%2C+2001&author=Robin+Washington+and+Anna+McCart&pub=Boston+Herald&edition=&startpage=005&desc=Tabliq+a+thorn+in+sides+of+several+governments|title=Tabliq a thorn in sides of several governments|last=Washington|first=Robin|coauthors=Anna McCart|date=26 December 2001|publisher=Boston Herald|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> passed into Bangladesh under the guise of members of Tabligh Jamaat.<ref name=APPENDIX-ONE-MUSLIM-FUNDAMENTALIST-ORGANIZATIONS-IN-NORTH-EAST-INDIA>[http://acdis.illinois.edu/assets/docs/257/TerrorsansFrontiersIslamicMilitancyinNorthEastIndia.pdf Appendix One - Muslim Fundamentalist Organizations in North East India<U+2014>A Compendium] Terror Sans Frontiers: Islamic Militancy in North East India, Jaideep Saikia</ref>  "We have a significant presence of Tablighi Jamaat in the United States," the deputy chief of the FBI's international terrorism section said in 2003, "and we have found that al-Qaeda used them for recruiting now and in the past."<ref name = "NYT2003">{{cite news  |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E5D7163CF937A25754C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all  |title= A Muslim Missionary Group Draws New Scrutiny in U.S.  |accessdate= 2008-01-14  |last= Sachs  |first= Susan  |date= 14 July 2003  |work= U.S.  |publisher= The New York Times}}</ref>

A report by [[International Crisis Group]] titled ''Islamist terrorism in the Sahel: Fact or Fiction?"'' described Tabligh Jamaat as "strictly non-political, and has never been linked directly to violence." and further explained that no interviewed source could identify an instance where Tabligh Jamaat members broke the law or engaged in specifically political activity in Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania.<ref name=icgroup>{{Cite news | url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/caocl/Africa/Pan-Sahel/Readings/Islamist%20Terrorism%20in%20the%20Sahel--Fact%20or%20Fiction.pdf | title=Islamist terrorism in the Sahel: Fact or Fiction? | page=page 12 | publisher=[[International Crisis Group]] | date=March 31, 2005 | accessdate=2007-12-25 |format=PDF}}</ref>

Also, some notable people hold opinions contrary to terrorism allegations.

===Criticism===
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Due to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticized for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe completest [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women "strictly subservient and second string".<ref name=daily/>

Tablighi Jamaat has also been criticized within the Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against Tabligh Jamaat are that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tabligh Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility to Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>

Many critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticize Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamic forces, during their decisive conflicts with un-Islamic forces, could have gained reinforcement from the Tabligh Jamaat followers. They criticize the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral attitude towards crucial issues like the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969<U+2013>1971), communal riots in India in 1970s and 1980s, the [[Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat|Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement]] (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name="Marty 1994 518">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=518}}</ref> Tabligh Jamaat, in contrary, asserts that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tabligh Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in the difficult times, such as of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975<U+2013>77), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced the restrictions.<ref name="Marty 1994 518"/>

The difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between Tabligh Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of a pristine Islamic society, the Tabligh Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organization of the Islamic social order.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of Tabligh Jamaat's attention is the individual and it believes the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective if it is through education and reform of individuals. They insist that the nations and social systems exist by the virtue of individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at grassroots with the individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marty|1994|p=517}}</ref>

==Notable members==
The Tablighi Jamaat has no membership lists or formal procedures for membership which makes it is difficult quantify and verify affiliations.

Notable members include former [[President of Pakistan|presidents of Pakistan]], [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]] and [[Farooq Leghari]]. Former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Nawaz Sharif]] lives in the town of Raiwind and has attended Tabligh Jamaat's activities on occasions. The first [[President of Bangladesh]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was strong supporter of tablighi. He gave land near Turag river when he was in power. Former President of Bangladesh [[Ziaur Rahman]] has been a supporter and member, and popularized Tabligh Jamaat in Bangladesh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.
Former chief minister of Punjab [[Pervaiz Elahi]] is also a strong supporter of tablighi jamaat. in 2011 he gave 75 kanal land for Mosque of tablighi jamaat in [[Raiwind Markaz]].<ref>http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Lahore/28-Nov-2011/Pervaiz-invited-to-attend-BD-congregation</ref>
Former singer and pop star [[Junaid Jamshed]] has close links with Tabligh Jamaat, and his departure from professional singing career is attributed to his inclination towards this movement. Famed singers, actors and models, including [[Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi|Attaullah Essa Khailwi]],<ref name=briefs>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=4830|title=Top Stories|date=December 18, 2006|publisher=The News|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> [[Gulzar Alam]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=158072 | title= Entertainment industry of Frontier hangs in the balance | publisher=TheNews | accessdate=2009-04-29 | date=2009-01-20}}</ref> Shahensha Bacha, [[Alamzeb Mujahid]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=157567 | title= Popular comedian quits showbiz | publisher=TheNews | accessdate=2009-04-29 | date=2009-01-17}}</ref> and stage performers like [[Javed Kodu]], [[Jawad Waseem]] and [[Moin Akhter]], are also affiliated with the movement.
