'''Cyclone Elita''' was an unusual [[tropical cyclone]] that made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Madagascar]] three times. The fifth named storm of the [[2003-04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|2003&ndash;04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season]], Elita developed on [[January 24]] in the [[Mozambique Channel]]. It strengthened to become a [[tropical cyclone scales|tropical cyclone]] before striking northwestern Madagascar on [[January 28]]. Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest [[Indian Ocean]] it turned to the west and moved ashore for a second time on [[January 31]] in eastern Madagascar. After crossing the island, the cyclone intensified again after reaching the Mozambique Channel, and Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on [[February 3]] along southwestern Madagascar. By [[February 5]] it underwent [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]], and the remnants of Elita moved erratically before dissipating on [[February 13]].

Elita dropped heavy rainfall of over 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000&nbsp;people were left homeless, primarily in [[Mahajanga Province|Mahajanga]] and [[Toliara Province|Toliara]] provinces. Flooding from the storm damaged or destroyed more than 450&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (170&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused at least 33&nbsp;deaths, with its impact further compounded by [[Cyclone Gafilo]] about two months later. Elsewhere, the cyclone brought rainfall and damage to [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]], while its outer circulation produced rough seas and strong winds in [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[R<U+00E9>union]].

The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it tracked westward across Madagascar, and late on [[January 31]] it emerged into the Mozambique Channel. Deep convection increased as it reached open waters, with [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] improving. A strengthening ridge to its north caused Elita to decelerate before turning to the east-southeast. Late on [[February 2]], the JTWC assessed Elita with peak winds of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;km/h), and shortly thereafter MFR reported the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 110&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph). Early on [[February 3]], Elita moved ashore near [[Morondava]] at peak intensity. Weakening rapidly while crossing the island for a third time, the cyclone emerged into the southwest Indian Ocean as a tropical depression by 0000&nbsp;UTC on [[February 4]]. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed under the influence of a strong upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. By [[February 5]], it had transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and its motion had halted due to weak steering currents.<ref name="gp"/> For about a week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar before dissipating on [[February 13]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Elita's crossing of Madagascar three times is unusual, but not unprecedented; Cyclone Felicie in January 1970 and Storm Justine in March 1982 accomplished the same feat.<ref name="wmo"/>

The storm brought rough seas, gusty winds, and some precipitation to the southwestern islands in [[Seychelles]].<ref name="wmo"/>

Upon making its first landfall on [[Madagascar]], Elita dropped heavy rainfall along its path, including a 24&nbsp;hour total of 222&nbsp;mm (8.74&nbsp;in) in [[Antsohihy]].
