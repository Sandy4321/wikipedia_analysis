'''Lee Harvey Oswald''' (October 18, 1939 <U+2013> November 24, 1963) was, according to four government investigations,<ref group="n">These were investigations by: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (1963), the [[Warren Commission]] (1964), the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (1979), and the Dallas Police Department.</ref> the sniper who [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] [[John F. Kennedy]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th President of the United States]],  in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on November 22, 1963.

A former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] who had briefly (October 1959 <U+2013> June 1962) defected to the [[Soviet Union]], Oswald was initially arrested for the shooting murder of police officer [[J. D. Tippit]], on a Dallas street approximately 40 minutes after Kennedy was shot. Suspected in the assassination of Kennedy as well, Oswald denied involvement in either of the killings. Two days later, while being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner [[Jack Ruby]] in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.

In 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, firing three shots, a conclusion also reached by prior investigations carried out by the [[FBI]] and [[Dallas Police Department (Texas)|Dallas Police Department]].  In 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] concluded that Oswald fired the shots which killed Kennedy, but differed from previous investigations in concluding he 'probably' did not act alone.  The [[Dictabelt evidence relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy|evidence used]] to base this conclusion has since been widely disputed.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Oswald was born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939,<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 799, CE 1963, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0415b.htm Schedule showing known addresses of Lee Harvey Oswald from the time of his birth].</ref> to Robert Edward Lee Oswald, Sr. (New Orleans, Louisiana, March 4, 1896 <U+2013> New Orleans, August 19, 1939) and Marguerite Frances Claverie (New Orleans, Louisiana, July 19, 1907 <U+2013> Fort Worth, Texas, January 17, 1981). Oswald had two older siblings <U+2013> brother Robert Edward Lee Oswald, Jr. and half-brother John Edward Pic.<ref name="Wbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html |title=Warren Commission Report, Appendix 13: Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, pages 670<U+2013>682 |publisher=Archives.gov |date=1964}}</ref>

Oswald's father died prior to Oswald's birth, and Marguerite raised her sons alone.
When Oswald was two, his mother placed her sons at the Bethlehem Children's Home orphanage in New Orleans for thirteen months, as she was unable to support them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}<!-- cite was http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/parnell/chrono.htm The Interactive Timeline of the Life of Lee Harvey Oswald but a non-web source is needed --> On May 7, 1945, his mother married Edwin Albert Ekdahl (1895<U+2013>1953) in Fort Worth, Texas; he engaged in numerous extra-marital affairs and filed for divorce in 1948.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}<!-- again, need a non-web source -->

As a child, Oswald was withdrawn and temperamental.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html |title=Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7, page 378 |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> In August 1952, while living with half-brother John Pic, at the time a U.S. Coast Guardsman stationed in New York City, Oswald and Marguerite were asked to leave after Oswald allegedly threatened Pic's wife with a knife and struck their mother, Marguerite.<ref name=Wbio/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Warren Commission Hearings |url=http://www.jfk-assassination.de/warren/wch/vol11/page38.php |title=Testimony of John Edward Pic}}</ref><ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 687, CE 1382, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0359a.htm Interview with Mrs. John Edward Pic].</ref>

Charges of truancy, in the Bronx (NYC), led to psychiatric assessment<ref name=Wbio/> at a juvenile reformatory, the psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, describing Oswald's "vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which he tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations." Finding a "personality pattern disturbance with [[schizoid]] features and [[passive-aggressive]] tendencies," Dr. Hartogs recommended continued treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/JA/DR/.dr16.html |title=Report of Renatus Hartogs, May 1, 1953 |publisher=Acorn.net |date=1953-05-01 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref>
However, in January 1954, Oswald's mother Marguerite returned with him to New Orleans.<ref name=Wbio/><ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, p. 123, CE 2223, Big Brothers of New York, Inc., [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0077a.htm Case file of Lee Harvey Oswald].</ref> At the time, there was a question pending before a New York judge as to whether Oswald should be removed from the care of his mother to finish his schooling,<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/2_12_64_AM.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].</ref>

Though he had trouble spelling<ref name=Wbio/> and writing coherently<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html#return Warren Commission Report, Chapt. 7, p. 383].</ref> he read voraciously, and by age 15 claimed to be a Marxist, writing in his diary, "I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries." At 16 he wrote to the [[Socialist Party of America]] for information on their [[Young People's Socialist League]], saying he had been studying socialist principles for "well over fifteen months."<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, CE 2240, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0085b.htm FBI transcript of letter from Lee Oswald to the Socialist Party of America, October 3, 1956].</ref>
However, Edward Voebel, "whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans...said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying Communism' were a 'lot of baloney.' " Voebel said that "Oswald commonly read 'paperback trash.'"<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_4_Oswald.pdf Oswald, [[David Ferrie]] and the Civil Air Patrol], [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]], vol. 9, 4, p. 107.</ref><ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0009b.htm Testimony of Edward Voebel], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 10, 12.</ref>

A teenaged Oswald attended [[Civil Air Patrol]] meetings in New Orleans, in 1955. Other cadets recall him attending "three or four" times, or "10 or 12 times" over a one- or two-month period.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0058a.htm Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 4, pp. 107-115.</ref><ref>[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

===Marine Corps===
[[File:CE2894.jpg|thumb|upright|Oswald when he served in the US Marine Corps]]
Oswald enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, just after his seventeenth birthday. He idolized his older brother Robert and a photograph, after his arrest by Dallas police, shows Lee wearing his brother's Marines ring.<ref>Bob Goodman, Triangle of Fire (Laquerian Publishing Co., 1993).</ref> One witness testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald's enlistment may also have been an escape from his overbearing mother.<ref>Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7, p. 384, Lee Harvey Oswald: Background and Possible Motives, [http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html#return Return to New Orleans and Joining the Marine Corps].</ref>

Oswald's primary training was as a radar operator, a position requiring a security clearance. A May 1957 document states that he was "granted final clearance to handle classified matter up to and including CONFIDENTIAL after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data."<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 665, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0342a.htm Administrative Remarks].</ref> In the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course he finished seventh in a class of thirty. The course "...included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar."<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0353b.htm Marines] Warren Commission Report, Appendix 13, page 682<U+2013>683.</ref> He was assigned first to [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] in July 1957,<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0338b.htm Marine Corps service record of Lee Harvey Oswald].</ref> then to [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]] in Japan in September as part of [[Marine Air Control Squadron 1]].

Like all Marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting, scoring 212 in December 1956<ref name="Saturday"/> (slightly above the minimum for qualification as a [[Weapons Qualification Badge|''sharpshooter'']]) but in May 1959 scoring only 191<ref name="Saturday"/> (barely earning the lower designation of [[Weapons Qualification Badge|''marksman'']]).<ref>Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: The Assassin, [http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#marine Oswald's Marine Training]</ref>

Oswald was court-martialed after accidentally shooting himself in the elbow with an unauthorized handgun, then court-martialed again for fighting with a sergeant he thought responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was demoted from [[private first class]] to [[Private (rank)|private]] and briefly imprisoned. He was later punished for a third incident: while on night-time sentry duty in the Philippines, he inexplicably fired his rifle into the jungle.<ref>Posner,Gerald "Case Closed" Random House, New York, 1993 pg. 28</ref>

Slightly built, Oswald was nicknamed ''[[Ozzie Rabbit]]'' after the cartoon character, or sometimes ''Oswaldskovich'' because of his pro-Soviet sentiments. In December 1958 he transferred back to El Toro,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/oswald.htm |title=Lee Harvey Oswald<U+2014>Lone Assassin or Patsy? |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> where his unit's function "...was to serveil [sic] for aircraft, but basically to train both enlisted men and officers for later assignment overseas." An officer there said that Oswald was a "very competent" crew chief.<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/html/WC_Vol8_0149b.htm Testimony of John E. Donovan], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 290, 298.</ref>

While in the Marines, Oswald made an effort to teach himself rudimentary Russian. Although an unusual accomplishment, in February 1959 he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His effort at the time was rated "poor".<ref>[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), pp. 94, 99. ISBN 1-56924-739-0</ref>

==Adult life and early crimes==
===Defection to the Soviet Union===
In October 1959, just before turning 20, Oswald traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], the trip planned well in advance. On September 11, 1959, he received a hardship discharge from active service, claiming his mother needed care, and was put on reserve.<ref name="Saturday"/><ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 85, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0373b.htm Request for Dependency Discharge].

Along with his self-taught Russian, he had saved $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary,<ref group="n">Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 705, CE 1385, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0366a.htm Notes of interview of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by Aline Mosby in Moscow in November 1959]. Oswald: "When I was working in the middle of the night on guard duty, I would think how long it would be and how much money I would have to save. It would be like being out of prison. I saved about $1500." During Oswald's 2 years and 10 months of service in the Marine Corps he received $3,452.20, after all taxes, allotments and other deductions as well as his GED.

Oswald spent two days with his mother in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], then embarked by ship from New Orleans on September 20 to [[Le Havre]], France, then immediately proceeded to England.  Arriving in [[Southampton]] on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland.  But on the same day, he flew to [[Helsinki]], where he was issued a Soviet visa on October 14.  Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at [[Vainikkala]], and arrived in Moscow on October 16.<ref>Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/journey.htm The Journey From USA to USSR] at ''Russian Books''</ref>

Almost immediately, Oswald told his [[Intourist]] guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen,<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 94, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0059b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary"], entry of October 16, 1959.</ref> but was told on October 21 that his application had been refused.

On October 31, Oswald appeared at the [[United States embassy in Moscow]], declaring a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.<ref>Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/moscow1.htm Moscow Part 1] at ''Russian Books''</ref><ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 108, CE 912, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0061b.htm Declaration of Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 3, 1959, requesting that his U.S. citizenship be revoked].</ref> Oswald told the interviewing officer at the U.S. embassy, Richard Snyder, "...that he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed.

[[File:CE2595.jpg|thumb|upright|Marina Prusakova, Minsk 1959]]
Though Oswald had wanted to attend [[Moscow University]], he was sent to Minsk to work as a lathe operator at the [[Gorizont (factory)|Gorizont (Horizon) Electronics Factory]], a facility producing radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. He also received a subsidized,{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay<U+2014>all in all, an idyllic existence by Soviet working-class standards,<ref>Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk3.htm Minsk Part 3] at ''Russian Books''</ref> although he was under constant surveillance.<ref>Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk2.htm Minsk Part 2] at ''Russian Books''</ref>

But Oswald grew bored in Minsk.<ref>Warren Commission Report, [http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html#defection Chapter 7<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He wrote in his diary in January 1961: "I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying.

In March 1961, Oswald met [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova]], a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married less than six weeks later in April.<ref group="n">Though later reports described her uncle, with whom she was living, as a colonel in the [[KGB]], he was actually a lumber industry expert in the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) with a bureaucratic rank of ''Polkovnik''.

===Dallas===
The Oswalds soon settled in the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas/Fort Worth]] area, where his mother and brother Robert lived, and Oswald began a [[memoir]] on Soviet life.

In March 1963, Oswald purchased a 6.5&nbsp;mm caliber [[Carcano]] rifle (commonly but improperly called [[Mannlicher-Carcano]]) by mail-order, using the alias ''A.

The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald fired at Walker through a window, from less than 100 feet (30 m) away, as Walker sat at a desk in his home; the bullet struck the window-frame and Walker's only injury was bullet fragments to the forearm. Marina testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald told her that he had shot at Walker.<ref name="Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald"/> (The [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] stated that the "evidence strongly suggested" that Oswald carried out the shooting.)<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0046a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations], HSCA Final Report, p. 61.</ref>

[[George De Mohrenschildt]], friend of the Oswalds when they were in Dallas, told the [[Warren Commission]] that he strongly suspected that Oswald took a 'pot shot' at General Walker, because the following weekend, on the night of Easter Sunday, April 14, 1963, George and Jeanne De Morhenschildt brought an Easter bunny to baby June Oswald, and when Marina was showing Jeanne their new apartment, Oswald's dug-up rifle appeared in a closet.  Jeanne exclaimed to George that Lee had a rifle, and George joked to Lee, "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?"  At this point Lee and Marina both became stunned for an uncomfortable moment of silence, and then George broke the ice by laughing, and they all laughed.  George De Mohrenschildt testified that this was the last time he ever saw Oswald, and that he had a strong feeling that Oswald was guilty of the shooting at General Walker.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

On August 5 and 6, according to anti-Castro militant [[Carlos Bringuier]], Oswald visited him at a store he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans delegate for the [[Student Revolutionary Directorate]] (DRE), an anti-Castro organization. Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald's visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 34<U+2013>37, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh10/html/WC_Vol10_0021b.htm Testimony of Carlos Bringuier].</ref> On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out pro-Castro leaflets.

In the late-1970s, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) investigated the possible relationship of Oswald to Banister's office. While the committee was unable to interview [[Guy Banister]] (who died in 1964), the committee did interview his brother Ross Banister. Ross "...told the committee that his brother had mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba literature on one occasion.

Guy Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told author [[Anthony Summers]] that she saw Oswald at Banister's office, and that he filled out one of Banister's "agent" application forms. She said, "Oswald came back a number of times. He seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with the office."<ref>[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

Instead, on October 3, 1963, Oswald left by bus for Dallas. According to the Warren Commission, on October 14, a neighbor told Ruth Paine that there was a job opening at the [[Texas School Book Depository]], an opening reported by her son Wesley Buell Frazier, who had a job there. Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the Depository and was hired there on October 16.<ref>The Warren Report, Chapter 1, pp. 14<U+2013>15, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0019b.htm Summary and Conclusions]</ref> Oswald's supervisor [[Roy Truly]], said that Oswald "did a good day's work" and was an above average employee.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 216, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0112b.htm Testimony of Roy Sansom Truly].</ref> During the week, Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming house (under the name ''O.H.

Oswald did not drive, but commuted to and from Dallas on Mondays and Fridays with Wesley Frazier. On October 20, the Oswalds' second daughter was born.

FBI agents twice visited the Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, looking for information on Marina, whom they suspected of being a Soviet agent.<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html Warren Commission Report, p. 739].</ref> Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 7 to 10 days before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent [[James Hosty]]; told Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don<U+2019>t stop bothering my wife. Signed<U+2014>Lee Harvey Oswald." <!-- did he really write the word "signed"? --> The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts varied widely as to whether Oswald threatened to "blow up the FBI" or merely "report this to higher authorities".<ref>http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note</ref> Hosty testified that the note said, "If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." Agent Hosty reported he destroyed the note after Oswald was named the suspect in the JFK assassination, as he was ordered to do by his superiors.

In the days before Kennedy's arrival, several newspapers described the route of the presidential motorcade as passing the Book Depository.<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/dmntue.gif Dallas Morning News], November 19, 1963.

The next morning (Friday) he returned to Dallas with Frazier; he left behind $170 and his wedding ring,<ref>[http://www.jfk-assassination.de/warren/wch/vol1/page72.php Warren Commission Hearings, vol.

An FBI report from November 26, 1963 said that Depository employee Carolyn Arnold, as she left the building to watch the motorcade, thought she caught a fleeting glimpse of Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building, a few minutes before 12:15 pm. In 1978, she told author Anthony Summers that the FBI report misquoted her, and that she "clearly" saw Oswald sitting in the second floor lunchroom at 12:15 pm or slightly after. In either case, no other Depository employee reported seeing Oswald on the first or second floors between 12 noon and 12:30 pm (e.g., [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0351b.htm Mrs. Pauline Sanders], who left the second floor lunchroom at "approximately 12:20 pm," did not see Oswald at all that day). The two employees with whom Oswald said he ate lunch on the first floor both denied it.</ref> However, another co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams testified that he went to the sixth floor of the Depository to eat his lunch at about 12:05 p.m. and was there until at least 12:10 p.m.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 173, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0091a.htm Testimony of Bonnie Ray Williams].</ref> He said that during that time he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 169, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0089a.htm Testimony of Bonnie Ray Williams].</ref>

==Shootings of Kennedy and Tippit==

{{Main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Lone gunman theory}}
According to several government investigations, including the [[Warren Commission]], as Kennedy's motorcade passed through Dallas's Dealey Plaza about 12:30 p.m. on November 22, Oswald fired three rifle shots from the sixth-floor, southeast corner window of the Book Depository,<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0071a.htm</ref><ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0071a.htm The Shots from the Texas School Book Depository], Warren Commission Report, chapter 3, p. 117.</ref> killing the President and seriously wounding Texas Governor [[John Connally]]. Bystander [[James Tague]] received a minor facial injury. [[File:LHO14.jpg|thumb|upright|Dallas PD color mugshot November 23, 1963]]  According to the investigations, immediately after firing, Oswald hid the rifle behind some boxes and descended using the rear stairwell. About ninety seconds after the shooting, in the second-floor lunchroom, he encountered police officer Marrion Baker accompanied by Oswald's supervisor Roy Truly; Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 263, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0136a.htm Testimony of Marrion L. Baker].</ref> Oswald descended using the front staircase, and left the Depository through the front entrance just before police sealed it off. Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly, later pointed out to officers that Oswald was the only employee that he was certain was missing.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0119b.htm Testimony of Roy Sansom Truly].</ref><ref>Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0107b.htm Testimony of J.W. Fritz]</ref>

At about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a city bus but (probably due to heavy traffic) he requested a transfer from the driver and got off two blocks later.<ref>[http://www.jfkassassination.net/transfer.gif Bus transfer (.gif)] at ''Kennedy Assassination Home Page''</ref> He took a taxicab to his rooming house, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, arriving at about 1:00 p.m. He entered through the front door and, according to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, immediately went to his room, "walking pretty fast".<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, pp. 438<U+2013>439, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0225a.htm Testimony of Earlene Roberts].</ref> Mrs. Roberts testified that Oswald left "a very few minutes" later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier, and that she last saw Oswald standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus stop in front of the house.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 439, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0224a.htm Affidavit of Earlene Roberts].</ref>

Oswald was next witnessed near the corner of East 10th Street and North Patton Avenue, about nine-tenths of a mile (1.4&nbsp;km) southeast of his rooming house<U+2014>a distance that the Warren Commission said, "Oswald could have easily walked".<ref>The Warren Report, Appendix 12, p. 648, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0336b.htm Oswald's Movements Between 12:33 and 1:15 PM]</ref> According to the Warren Commission, it was here that Patrolman [[J.

Shoe store manager Johnny Brewer testified that minutes later he saw Oswald "ducking into" the entrance alcove of his store. Suspicious of this activity, Brewer watched Oswald continue up the street and slip into the nearby [[Texas Theater]] without paying.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0006a.htm Testimony of Johnny Calvin Brewer], 7 H 3<U+2013>5.</ref> He alerted the theater's ticket clerk, who telephoned police<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0010a.htm Testimony of Julia Postal], 7 H 11.</ref> at about 1:40 pm.

At about 2 p.m., Oswald arrived at the Police Department building, where he was questioned by Detective [[Jim Leavelle]] about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W.

Oswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes, denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment, and denied carrying a long heavy package to work the morning of the assassination. The Warren Commission also noted that Oswald denied knowing an ''A. J.

==Death==
{{See also|Jack Ruby}}

On Sunday, November 24, Oswald was being led through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters preparatory to his transfer to the county jail when, at 11:21 a.m., Dallas nightclub operator  [[Jack Ruby]] stepped from the crowd and shot Oswald in the abdomen.
Oswald died at 1:07 p.m. at  [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]]<U+2014>the same hospital where Kennedy had died two days earlier.<ref name="Saturday2"/>

A network television camera, there to cover the transfer, was broadcasting live at the time, and millions thereby witnessed the shooting as it happened.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Laurence Bergreen |last=Bergreen |first=Laurence |year=1980 |title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday and Company |isbn=978-0451619662}}</ref>
The event was also captured in a well-known photograph ''(see right)''.
Ruby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was "...saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial."<ref name="history-matters.com">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198<U+2013>200.</ref> Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy.<ref>[[G. Robert Blakey]], chief council for the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] from 1977 to 1979, said, "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."

==FBI agent James Hosty destroys Oswald's note==

According to FBI Agent [[James Hosty]], two days after the assassination, Dallas FBI Special Agent-in-Charge [[J. Gordon Shanklin]] ordered Hosty to destroy a note that Oswald had left with a receptionist at the Dallas FBI office about seven to ten days before the assassination. The note allegedly contained some sort of threat. In testimony before the Warren Commission, Shanklin denied ordering Hosty to destroy Oswald's note, and denied having any knowledge of the note. The FBI acknowledged that Hosty's and Shanklin's accounts contradicted each other, but said that it would not investigate the matter further.<ref>{{cite web

==Official investigations==
===Warren Commission===
The [[Warren Commission]], created by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to investigate the assassination, concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy (this view is known as the [[lone gunman theory]]).  The Commission could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:

{{quote|It is apparent, however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment. He does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people. He was perpetually discontented with the world around him. Long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest against it. Oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start. He sought for himself a place in history <U+2014> a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times. His commitment to Marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation. He also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment. Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald there emerged a man capable of assassinating President Kennedy.<ref>
[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html#conclusions Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7: Unanswered Questions].</ref>}}
The proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret, and about 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.<ref group="n">"Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing...Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and ''all'' of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission." (Bugliosi, p. 332)</ref>

===Ramsey Clark Panel===
In 1968, the [[Ramsey Clark]] Panel{{explain}} examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence, concluding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/clark.txt 1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John E Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas] (.txt) at ''Kennedy Assassination Home Page''</ref>

===House Select Committee===
{{Main|United States House Select Committee on Assassinations}}
{{See|Dictabelt evidence relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy}}

In 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations was preparing to issue{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy. However, late in the Committee's proceedings a [[Dictabelt]] was introduced,{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired. After submitting the Dictabelt to acoustic analysis, the Committee revised its findings to assert a "high probability that two gunmen fired" at Kennedy and that Kennedy "was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy."  Although the Committee was "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy," it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0005a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] HSCA Final Report, pp. 3.</ref>

The Dictabelt evidence has been questioned, some believing it is not a recording of the assassination at all.<ref>Holland, Max. [http://hnn.us/articles/21289.html The JFK Lawyers' Conspiracy] Published in ''The Nation'' on unknown date, reposted by George Mason University's History News Network, February 6, 2006</ref> The staff director and chief counsel for the Committee, [[G. Robert Blakey]], told ABC News in 2003 that at least 20 persons heard a shot from the [[grassy knoll]], and that a conspiracy was established by both the witness testimony and acoustic evidence, but in 2004 he expressed less confidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKblakey.htm |title=G.

In 1982, a group of twelve scientists appointed by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), led by [[Norman Ramsey]], concluded that the acoustic evidence submitted  to the HSCA was "seriously flawed."{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Subsequently, a 2001 article in ''Science and Justice'', the journal of Britain's Forensic Science Society, said that the NAS investigation was itself flawed and concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.<ref>Donald B.

{{Main|Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}} <!-- if this section remains "other investigations and dissenting theories", isn't there a slight overspecialization in this link <U+2013> in other words, are all dissenting theories "conspiracy" theories?

[[File:Lho-133A.jpg|thumb|right|Image CE-133A, one of three known "backyard photos," the same image sent by Oswald (as a first-generation copy) to [[George de Mohrenschildt]] in April, 1963, dated and signed on the back.

Critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed a number of other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed.
<!--a good summary of dissenting theories is needed here, though note there is a separate article ("see also") to carry most of that load -->

In October 1981, with Marina's support, Oswald's grave was opened to test a theory propounded by writer Michael Eddowes: that during Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union he was replaced with a Soviet double; that it was this double, not Oswald, who killed Kennedy and who is buried in Oswald's grave; and that the exhumed remains would therefore not exhibit a surgical scar Oswald was known to carry. However, dental records positively identified the exhumed corpse as Oswald's, and the scar was present.<ref group="n">W. Tracy Parnell, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/parnell/xindex.htm The Exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswald].

===Fictional trials===<!-- I feel like this belongs elsewhere in the article -->
Several films<ref>''The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald'' (1964); ''The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald'' (1977, unrelated<!-- ?? --> to the first film); ''On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald'' (1986)</ref> have fictionalized a trial of Oswald.

These photos were labelled CE 133-A and CE 133-B. CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newsletters in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B.
