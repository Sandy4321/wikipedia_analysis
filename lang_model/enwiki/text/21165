They were located living in isolated stretches of [[Longleaf Pine|longleaf pine]]s and [[Taxodium|cypress]] [[swamp]]s in the [[Southeastern United States]]. They are [[dog]]s of medium size, with a [[fawn (colour)|fawn]] coat and frequently a [[melanistic mask]].

==Discovery==
[[Image:Carolinadogpuppies20020401a.jpg|thumb|left|Carolina Dog puppies]]Dr. [[I. Lehr Brisbin Jr.]], a Senior Research [[ecology|Ecologist]] at the [[University of Georgia]]'s [[Savannah River Ecology Laboratory|Savannah River Ecology Lab]], first came across a Carolina Dog while working at the [[Savannah River]] site. Horace, a stray white dog with brown markings, was wandering the site's boundary when he caught Brisbin<U+2019>s attention. Brisbin, who had seen many rural dogs chained to the back of porches and [[doghouse]]s, assumed this was just a normal stray. Many of these dogs roamed the woods and would turn up in humane traps, and Brisbin began to wonder how many more of these were in the wild. On a hunch, he went to the pound and was surprised by the resemblance the dog had to [[dingo]]es.<ref name="NGN">

==Evidence of ancient roots==
===Physical===
[[File:Carolina Dog 1.jpg|thumb|Carolina Dog / American Dingo]]
Some ancient paintings and rock art of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] depict dogs that have physical traits similar to those of Carolina Dogs. Carolina Dogs also have a ginger-colored coat that is found on other wild dogs, including Australian Dingoes and Korea<U+2019>s native dog, the [[Korea Jindo Dog|Jindo]].<ref>

Experts have said that Carolina Dogs are seemingly indistinguishable from the Jindo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Also, [[fossil]]s of the dogs of Native Americans exhibit similar bone structures to Carolina Dogs. Brisbin found a resemblance between 2,000-year-old skulls and those of the Carolina Dogs, but concluded that there was too large a difference to prove any connection.<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=[[Scott Weidensaul|Weidensaul]] |title=Tracking America<U+2019>s First Dogs |url= http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/1999/march/dogs.php |work=Smithsonian Magazine | publisher= |pages= |page= |date=1999-03-01 |accessdate=2006-10-11 }}</ref> Along with this, DNA testing has pointed to a link.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Height:  17-24&nbsp;inches (45<U+2013>61&nbsp;cm.)
Weight:  30-44 pounds (15<U+2013>20&nbsp;kg.)

===Behavior===
[[Image:DixieDingo 0019.jpg|thumb|right|Carolina Dog / American "Dixie" Dingo]]
In the 1980s, most Carolina Dogs were removed to captivity for study.

Female dogs had three [[Estrous cycle|estrus cycles]] in quick succession, which settled into seasonal reproductive cycles when there was an abundance of puppies.<ref name="NGN" /> Brisbin noted that this was most likely to ensure quick breeding before diseases, like [[heartworm]], take their toll. Some pregnant dogs also dug [[dens]] in which to give birth. After they gave birth or while pregnant, the dog would carefully push sand with her snout to cover her excrement. The dogs also dug <U+201C>snout pits<U+201D>, or hundreds of tiny holes in the dirt that perfectly fit their muzzles during this time. More female dogs dug them than males.<ref>

The pack dynamic was unique. When hunting, Carolina Dogs used an effective pack formation. They used a [[whip]]-like motion when hunting [[snake]]s.

In the wild, Carolina dogs live in swampy, sparsely settled land instead of the highly populated areas stray dogs commonly occupied.

===DNA testing===
The preliminary [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA testing]] may provide a link between primitive dogs and Carolina Dogs. Brisbin stated, <U+201C>We grabbed them out of the woods based on what they look like, and if they were just dogs their DNA patterns should be well distributed throughout the canine family tree. But they aren't. They're all at the base of the tree, where you would find very primitive dogs.<U+201D> This wasn<U+2019>t conclusive, but it did spark interest into more extensive DNA testing.<ref name="NGN" />

ARBA includes the breed in its "Spitz and Primitive Group", which includes primitives such as the [[dingo]] and [[Canaan Dog]]. The UKC has classified them as a [[pariah dog]], a class which includes other primitive breeds such as the [[Basenji]] of Africa and the [[Thai Ridgeback]].

The word '''''[[wikt:pariah|pariah]]''''' is derived from a Tamil word first used in English in 1613, to refer to the lowest level of the [[Caste system in India|traditional Indian caste system]]; in English, it is used to mean "a social outcast".<ref>

}}</ref> The Indian feral dog was considered an outcast as well. The term "pariah" when referring to feral or wild dogs of the Indian feral dog type is sometimes replaced with '''''[[primitive]]''''', in the sense of "relating to an earliest or original stage or state" or "being little evolved from an early ancestral type".<ref>

It is assumed that dogs placed in "pariah" or "primitive" groups are of an older type than other modern [[dog breeds]]. Future genetic testing may show the actual heredity of these breeds or types. 

Since domestication, this breed has been kept by many dog owners as house dogs. But due in part to the Carolina dogs' feral ancestry, these dogs demand a lot of attention as they are not yet completely domesticated and still carry traces of wild dog behaviours thus having high expectations from their alphas (in this case the owners) in the pack. <ref>http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/caralinadog.htm</ref>
