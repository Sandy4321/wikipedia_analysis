The '''Inner Loop''' is an expressway that encloses downtown [[Rochester, New York]], [[United States]]. Although the expressway is a continuous loop, only the portion of the loop north of [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;490]] is signed as the "Inner Loop". The official western terminus of the Inner Loop is at I-490 exit&nbsp;13 in the shadow of [[Frontier Field]] west of downtown. The eastern terminus is at I-490 exits&nbsp;15 and&nbsp;16 directly south of downtown on the east bank of the [[Genesee River]]. North of I-490, the loop is designated '''New York State Route&nbsp;940T''', an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]]. This segment, however, is visibly signed with unique orange trapezoidal shields with the words "Inner Loop" in white.

Over the past decade, traffic volume has remained constant on the roadway in some areas; however, overall usage from its completion in 1965 to today has declined as jobs and residents continue to migrate away from the inner city.

Aside from its primary purpose as an expressway, the Inner Loop creates a division, both physically and mentally, between downtown and the rest of the city, defining a definite center for Rochester.

==Route description==
The Inner Loop encircles [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], beginning, from west to east, at exit&nbsp;13 on [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;490]]. The Loop then passes [[Frontier Field]], the home of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Rochester Red Wings]], as it runs parallel to the [[CSX Transportation]] [[Rochester Subdivision]] mainline for roughly {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} to the [[Genesee River]]. It then crosses the river just south of [[High Falls]] before separating from the railroad at the [[Amtrak]] station on Central Avenue. This is also the location of the first exit on the Loop heading east and is the beginning of the [[frontage road]]s that run parallel to the loop along its length. The Inner Loop then continues east and south to where it rejoins I-490 at exits&nbsp;15 (eastbound) and&nbsp;16 (westbound). The loop is then closed and connected by I-490, creating a continuous [[beltway]] of [[limited-access highway]]s around downtown Rochester. However, the I-490 portion of the Loop is signed only as I-490.

Due to its proximity to downtown, the Inner Loop creates a division, both physically and mentally, between downtown Rochester and the remainder of the city.<ref name="const" /> The only areas where it is possible to traverse the Inner Loop is where roadways cross the Loop via bridges over or under the highway.

==History==
The idea for a [[beltway]] around [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] was conceived in the 1950s. At the time, the population of Rochester was roughly 332,000, which translated into poor traffic conditions within downtown. Despite some political obstacles, construction on the highway began in the early 1950s. Many structures were demolished to make way for the route, which was constructed in a [[cut (earthmoving)|cut]] through the densely populated neighborhoods that surrounded downtown. In 1965, an opening ceremony headlined by then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] officially opened the Inner Loop to traffic. The final price tag on the loop's construction was $34&nbsp;million<ref name="const">{{cite news |url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=81362 |title=The Inner Loop: Do We Need It? |author=Evan Axelbank |work=RochesterHomepage.net ([[WROC-TV|WROC]] and [[WUHF]]) |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2009}}</ref> (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|34000000|1965|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}} The southern part of the Loop was incorporated into the newly-constructed [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;490]] by 1968<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1968 |edition=1969<U+2013>70 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> while the rest is designated as NY&nbsp;940T, an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]].<ref name="2007tdr" />

In the time since the Loop's construction, the population of Rochester has dropped to 219,773 as of the 2000 census<U+2014>a reduction of a full one-third.{{GR|2}} As a result, traffic on the Inner Loop has declined accordingly. While traffic volume on the I-490 and northwestern portions of the loop have remained relatively high, the section east of the [[Genesee River]] has seen sharp declines in recent years.<ref name="2007tdr" /><ref name="const" /> Proposals to alter this section of the Inner Loop have been presented, but none have been acted upon. One proposal in 2006, which had mounted merit for federal monetary aid, would have reduced the number of lanes on the loop between Clinton Avenue and Main Street to make room for additional shops and businesses on the streets adjacent to the Inner Loop.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.13wham.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=6AF21728-2C3C-48AF-9F17-C2AE8BDC2B50 |title=New Road Ahead For Inner Loop |work=[[WHAM-TV|13WHAM News]] |accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> Another in 2009, which is currently undergoing studies, calls for the portion of the Loop from Main Street to Monroe Avenue ([[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]]) to be completely filled in. The estimated cost of this project is $25&nbsp;million. The findings of the studies will be released in August 2009; however, no action, if any, is expected to be taken in the near future.<ref name="const" />

==Exit list==
Exits are listed in a [[clockwise]] (CW) direction, which is west to east along the north side of the loop. This list includes the portion of the Loop routed on I-490 and not officially part of NY 940T.
