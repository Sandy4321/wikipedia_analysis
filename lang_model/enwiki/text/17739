==Biography==

===Early life===
Samantha grew up in [[Willenhall]], in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] with her younger brother and parents. Samantha was [[home-schooled]].

Since the age of 2, Samantha has been dancing and performing at numerous dance and acting schools in the West Midlands area, which led to her dancing in pantomimes at both [[Wolverhampton Grand Theatre]] & [[Stafford Garrick Theatre]] as well as performing in many amateur dramatic productions at several locations, including Wolverhampton Grand Theatre, The [[Old Rep Theatre]], Birmingham and [[The Dormston Centre]] in Sedgley.

In 2007, Samantha won the [[High School Musical]] You're The Star! Competition on Disney Channel UK, after being voted by viewers. The prize for this was to have an all-expenses paid trip to [[London]] to record a music video. This video resulted in her appearing on her regional [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] news programme, [[Central Tonight]]. Her exceptional performance resulted in her being hand picked to audition for a role as presenter of the 2008 competition, [[My High School Musical]], which had a slightly different format. She was picked and presented the programme alongside [[Brad Kavanagh]].

In September 2009, Samantha successfully auditioned for the part of Wendy in the pantomime Peter Pan which was performed at the brand new [[Theatre Severn]] in Shrewsbury, Shropshire from December 2009 into January 2010. She performed alongside [[Emmerdale]] star [[Matt Healy]] who played Mr Darling and Captain Hook.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pan will fly as theatre stages first panto|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/latest/2009/12/08/pan-will-fly-as-theatre-stages-first-panto/|accessdate=4 March 2012|newspaper=Shropshire Star|date=8 December 2009}}</ref>

Sam got her dream job as a West End leading lady, when she was transferred to London's Playhouse Theatre and then later in the year to The Wyndham's Theatre, where she carried on playing Laura in [[Dreamboats and Petticoats]].

During 2013 Sam has been busy writing music for a couple of projects, including one of her own, a pilot children's TV programme which she has co written, produced and directed with her leading man from [[Dreamboats and Petticoats]] [[David Ribi]]. They also present the show.
