The '''Former Geological Survey of Canada Building''' ({{lang-fr|Ancien <U+00E9>difice de la Commission g<U+00E9>ologique du Canada}}) is a three-storey, stone building located at the intersection of [[Sussex Drive]] and George Street in the [[Byward Market]] area of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  It is named for its former occupant, the [[Geological Survey of Canada]].  The building was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1955 as it is one of the oldest remaining buildings in Ottawa, and over the years it has served as home to various public and cultural institutions.<ref name="NHSC">{{CRHP|1142|Former Geological Survey of Canada Building National Historic Site|1 November 2013}}</ref>

==History==

The oldest part of the building was constructed in 1863 by [[James Skead]], a local businessman, and was occupied by the Clarendon Hotel upon completion.  After a short stint being leased to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]] for use as military barracks from 1864 to 1871, the building was returned to a hotel use in 1874.  The [[Government of Canada|federal government]] purchased the property in 1879 and has owned it ever since.

Upon its purchase by the government in 1879, the building hosted the inaugural exhibit of the Canadian Academy of Arts, with the works from this exhibit later forming the initial collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].  Later that year, the building was retrofited to serve as the offices and museum of what was then called the Geological and Natural History Survey of Canada. The museum and its collections, which attracted 9,549 visitors in its first year, would later become the genesis of [[National museums of Canada|Canada<U+2019>s national museums]].<ref name="NHSC"/><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Canadian Museum of Civilization|url=http://www.civilization.ca/about-us/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum-of-civilization#|work=About Us|publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]|accessdate=1 November 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KoAnwDqj|archivedate=1 November 2013}}</ref> 

The Sussex Drive section was rebuilt in 1881 on its original footprint.   The Geological Survey of Canada remained in the building until 1911 when it moved to the [[Canadian Museum of Nature|Victoria Memorial Museum]].  The building was renovated again, this time to accommodate the federal [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Mines]], and a new laboratory was added to the George Street wing in 1917.<ref name="NHSC"/>
