The '''Ackertklippe''' is a rock formation in [[K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte (Elbingerode)|K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte]] in the district of [[Landkreis Harz|Harz]] in the Harz mountains of Germany. It is composed mainly of [[granite]]. A nearby road is named after the crag.

The crag can be climbed by a footpath. A refuge hut was built on the summit at the beginning of the 20th century. From the crag there is a comprehensive view of the village, the river [[Bode]] and the surrounding Harz mountains as far as the  [[Wurmberg]] and the [[Brocken]]. The Ackertklippe rock formation also lends its name to the pub and boarding house ''Am Felsen'', which is located below the crag on the Bode.
