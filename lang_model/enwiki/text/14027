== About ==

'''Net-SNMP''' is a suite of software for using and deploying the [[SNMP]] protocol (v1, v2c and v3 and the [[AgentX]] subagent protocol).  It supports [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]], [[IPX]], [[AAL5]], Unix Sockets and other transports.  It contains a generic client library, a suite of command line applications, a highly extensible SNMP agent, perl modules and python modules.

The [http://www.net-snmp.org Net-SNMP home page] has more information about the project.

=== Distribution ===

Net-SNMP is housed on [[SourceForge]] and is usually in the top 100 projects in the sourceforge ranking system, which is odd given the obscurity of the SNMP protocol.  It was the March 2005 [http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2005-04.php SourceForge Project of the Month].

=== Distribution ===

It is very widely distributed and comes included with many operating systems including most distributions of [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[Solaris]], Mac [[OSX]], ...  It is also, of course, available from the Net-SNMP web site.

=== History ===

The roots of the Net-SNMP project are long and a full description can be found on the [http://www.net-snmp.org/about/history.html Net-SNMP history] page.

A quick summary is that Steve Waldbusser [[CMU]] started a freely available SNMP tool kit in 1992.  The package was later abandoned by CMU and Wes Hardaker at UCDavis renamed it to UCD-SNMP and extended it to meet the network management needs of the Electrical Engineering department there.  Eventually Mr. Hardaker left the university and realized that the project was now network wide and thus renamed it to Net-SNMP to reflect it's distributed development.
