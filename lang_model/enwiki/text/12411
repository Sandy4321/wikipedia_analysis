'''Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tikhonov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0439> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0422><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>}}; [[Kharkiv]], {{OldStyleDate|14 May|1905|1 May}} <U+2013> [[Moscow]], 1 June 1997) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[Ukrainians in Russia|Russian-Ukrainian]] statesman from the start to the end of the [[Cold War]]. He served as [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] from 1980 to 1985, and as a [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy]] of the Council of Ministers, or vice-premier, from 1976 to 1980. Tikhonov was responsible for the cultural and economic administration of the Soviet Union during the late [[Era of Stagnation]]. He was replaced as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1985 by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]]. The same year he lost his seat in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo), but he retained his seat in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC) until 1989.

Tikhonov was born in the city of [[Kharkiv]] in 1905 to a Russian-Ukrainian [[working class]] family. He graduated in the 1920s and started working in the 1930s. As many like him Tikhonov started his political career in local industry, and worked his way up hierarchies of the Soviet industrial ministries. Tikhonov was appointed to Deputy Chairman of the [[Gosplan]] in 1963. After [[Alexei Kosygin]]'s departure Tikhonov was voted into office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In this position, he refrained from taking effective measures to reform the [[Soviet economy]], a need which became very evident by the early to mid-1980s. He retired from active politics in 1989 and became a [[pensioner]]. Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997.

==Early life and career==
Tikhonov was born in the Ukrainian city of [[Kharkiv]] on {{OldStyleDate|14 May|1905|1 May}} to a [[Russian people|Russian]]-[[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] [[working class]] family. He graduated from the [[Dnepropetrovsk Institute of Communications|St. Catherine Institute of Communications]] in 1924. Tikhonov worked as an assistant engineer from 1924 to 1926. Four years later, in 1930, Tikhonov graduated, and earned a degree as an [[engineer]], from the [[Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute]]. From 1930 to 1941, Tikhonov worked as an engineer at the Lenin Metallurgical Plant in [[Dnepropetrovsk]], but was appointed as the plant's Chief Engineer in January 1941.<ref name="reallyshortbio"/>

It was during his stay in Dnepropetrovsk that he met [[Leonid Brezhnev]], a future [[leader of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=119}} Tikhonov joined the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] in 1940, and by the end of the decade, Tikhonov had landed a job as a plant director.<ref name="shortbio"/> As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his organisational skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for the workers in the aftermath of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].<ref name="reallyshortbio"/> Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the [[Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy]] in the 1950s. In 1955 Tikhonov had become a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy. Tikhonov became a member, and later Chairman of the [[Scientific Council]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]], and later a Deputy Chairman of the [[Gosplan|State Planning Committee]] in 1960.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=70}} At the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Party Congress]] Tikhonov was elected to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC) as a non-voting member.<ref name="reallyshortbio"/> At the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|23rd party congress]] in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member Central Committee.<ref name="reallyshortbio"/> Tikhonov was awarded the highest the [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] award for his first time.<ref name="shortbio"/>

When [[Alexei Kosygin]], the then current Premier, was on sick leave in 1976 Brezhnev took advantage of his illness by appointing Tikhonov to the office of [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]]. As First Deputy Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby figure.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=119}} Tikhonov was however one of the few who got along with both Brezhnev and Kosygin, both of them liked his candor and honesty.<ref name="Kommersant"/> In 1978 Tikhonov was [[List of members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1970s|elected candidate member of the Political Bureau]] (Politburo), and in 1979, Tikhonov was made a voting member of the Politburo.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Archie Brown|Brown, Archie]] | title = The Gorbachev factor | location = | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1997 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=aH7BPTrwNXUC&dq | isbn = 0192880527 | page = 332 }}</ref> Tikhonov was not informed of the decision to [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|intervene in Afghanistan]]; the reason being his bad relationship with [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]] at the time.<ref name="Kommersant"/>

===Appointment and the 26th Congress===
When [[Alexei Kosygin]] resigned in 1980 Tikhonov, at the age of 75, was elected the new [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Ploss, Sidney | title = The roots of perestroika: the Soviet breakdown in historical context | location = | publisher = [[McFarland & Company]] | year = 2010 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6BzucnMoWfQC&dq | isbn = 078644486X | page = 132 }}</ref> During his five-year term as premier Tikhonov refrained from reforming the [[Soviet economy]], even if all statistics from that time period showed the [[Era of Stagnation|economy was stagnating]].<ref name="reallyshortbio"/> Tikhonov presented the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (1981<U+2013>85) at the [[26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|26th Party Congress]], and told the delegates that the state would allocate nine million [[Soviet rubles|rubles]] for [[mother]]s who were seeking [[parental leave]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Lahusen, Thomas; Solomon, Peter H. | title = What is Soviet now?: identities, legacies, memories | location = | publisher = LIT Verlag M<U+00FC>nster | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&dq | isbn = 3825806405 | page = 206 }}</ref> In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that [[Soviet agriculture]] was not producing enough [[grain]].<ref name="eagle"/> Tikhonov called for an improvement in [[Soviet<U+2013>US relations]], but dismissed all speculations that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis.<ref name="eagle">{{cite web | author = | title = Tikhonov Bids for U.S. Trade | location = | work = [[Reading Eagle]] | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=090hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=66AFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2515,4061259&dq=nikolai-tikhonov&hl=en | date = 27 February 1981 }}</ref> However, Tikhonov admitted to the economic "shortcomings" and acknowledged the ongoing "food problem".

===Andropov and Chernenko===
[[File:Konstantin Chernenko1.jpg|thumb|right|Tikhonov acted as the unofficial leader of the Soviet Union during most of Chernenko's reign{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=146}}]]
[[Leonid Brezhnev]] awarded Tikhonov the [[Hero of Socialist Labour]], after being advised to do so by [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Upon Brezhnev's death in 1982, Tikhonov supported Chernenko's candidacy for the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretaryship]]. Chernenko lost the vote, and [[Yuri Andropov]] became General Secretary.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=131}} It has been suggested that Andropov had plans of replacing Tikhonov with [[Heydar Aliyev]]. Historian William A. Clark noted how Aliyev, a former head of the Azerbaijani [[KGB]], was appointed to the [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputyship]] of the Council of Ministers without Tikhonov's consent. However, Andropov's death in 1984 left Tikhonov secure in his office.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Clark, William A. | title = Crime and punishment in Soviet officialdom: combating corruption in the political elite, 1965-1990 | location = | publisher = [[M. E. Sharpe]] | year = 1993 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0VinP2hZRUEC&dq | isbn = 1563240556 | page = 157 }}</ref> Some Western analysts speculated that the appointment of [[Andrei Gromyko]] to the First Deputyship, again without Tikhonov's consent, was a sign that his position within the Soviet hierarchy was weakened. Tikhonov was on a state visit to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] when Gromyko was appointment to the First Deputyship.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = Gromyko's promotion may be premier's loss | location = | work = [[Deseret News]] | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Nd4qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GYMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5478,3796597&dq=nikolai-tikhonov&hl=en | date = 25 March 1983 }}</ref>

With his health decaying, Andropov used his spare times to write speeches to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC). In one of these speeches Andropov told the Central Committee that [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and not Chernenko, would succeed him upon his death. His speech was not read out to the Central Committee plenum because of an anti-Gorbachev Troika consisting of Chernenko, [[Dmitriy Ustinov]] and Tikhonov. During Andropov's last days, Tikhonov presided over the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo) sessions, headed the 1984 Soviet delegation to the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA) conference in [[East Berlin]], conducted [[bilateral relations]] with the [[Eastern Bloc]] states and hosted the [[Prime Minister of Finland]] when he visited the Soviet Union. In short, in between Andropov's last days and Chernenko's rise to power, Tikhonov was the dominant driving figure of the Soviet Union. However, Tikhonov peacefully stepped away, and supported Chernenko's candidacy for General Secretary.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=146}} When Chernenko died in 1985, Tikhonov tried, but failed, too find a contender to Gorbachev's candidacy to the General Secretaryship.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Archie Brown|Brown, Archie]] | title = The Rise & Fall of Communism | location = | publisher = [[Bodley Head]] | year = 2009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yWQpAQAAIAAJ&q | isbn = 978-1-845-95076-5 | page = 482<U+2013>83 }}</ref>

===Gorbachev and resignation===
Upon Gorbachev's ascension to power, Tikhonov was elected Chairman of the newly established [[Commission on Improvements of the Management System]]. The title of chairman was largely honorary, and its ''[[de facto]]'' head was it's deputy chairman, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Yegor Gaidar|Gaidar, Yegor]] | title = Days of defeat and victory | location = | publisher = [[University of Washington Press]] | year = 1999 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=AsODNXgkkCQC&dq | isbn = 0295978236 | page = 26 }}</ref> On 23 May 1985 Tikhonov presented his development plan for 1985 to 1990 and until 2000, the plan was criticised by co-workers, and Gorbachev told his colleagues that Tikhonov was "ill-equipped" for the Premiership. Tikhonov planned estimated a growth of 20 to 22 percent growth in Soviet national income, an increase of 21-24 percent in industrial growth and doubling [[Soviet agriculture]] output by 2000.<ref name="shortbio"/> As part of Gorbachev's plan of removing, and replacing, the most [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|conservative]] members<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Archie Brown|Brown, Archie]] | title = The Rise & Fall of Communism | location = | publisher = [[Bodley Head]] | year = 2009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yWQpAQAAIAAJ&q | isbn = 978-1-845-95076-5 | page = 488 }}</ref> of the Politburo, Tikhonov was compelled to retire.<ref name="ryzhkov"/> Ryzhkov suceeded Tikhonov in office on 27 September 1985.<ref name="ryzhkov">{{Cite book | author = [[Robert Service (historian)|Service, Robert]] | title = History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century | location = | publisher = [[Penguin Books Ltd]] | year = 2009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=o8Z1QAAACAAJ&dq | isbn = 0141037970 | page = 439 }}</ref> His [[resignation]] was made official at a Central Committee plenum in September 1985.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Haghayeghi ,Mehrdad | title = Islam and Politics in Central Asia | location = | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 1996 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NmP04VU0N2cC&dq | isbn = 0312164882 | page = 46 }}</ref> It is noteworthy that by the time of his resignation, Tikhonov was the oldest member of the [[Soviet leadership]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Zwass, Adam | title = The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: the thorny path from political to economic integration | location = | publisher = [[M.

==Later life and death==
After his forced [[resignation]] from active politics in 1989, Tikhonov wrote a letter to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] which stated that he regretted supporting his election to the General Secretaryship.<ref name="shortbio"/> This view was strengthened when the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) was banned in the USSR. After his retirement, he lived the rest of his life in [[seclusion]] at his [[dacha]]. As one of his friends noted, he lived as "a [[hermit]]" and never showed himself in public.<ref name="shortbio"/> He noted that Tikhonov's later life was very difficult seeing that he had not [[children]] and that his wife had passed away.<ref name="shortbio">{{cite web | author = | title = <U+0422><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0439> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> | language = Russian | publisher = proekt-wms.narod.ru | url = http://proekt-wms.narod.ru/states/tihonov-na.htm | accessdate = 5 November 2010 | date = }}</ref> Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Tikhonov worked as a [[State Advisor to the Supreme Soviet]].<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = <U+0411><U+0438><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0444><U+0438><U+0438> | language = Russian | publisher = [[Forbes|Forbes.ru]]| url = http://www.forbes.ru/article/11904-biografii | accessdate = 21 November 2010 | date = 24 September 2009 }}</ref> Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997 and was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web | author =  | title = <U+0422><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0439> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?id=3244 | accessdate = 5 November 2010 | date = }}</ref>
