'''''Beyond Good & Evil''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] and released in late {{vgy|2003}} for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[Personal computer|PC]]), [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox]] [[video game console|platforms]]. The game focuses on [[Jade (Beyond Good & Evil)|Jade]], a female [[investigative reporter]] and [[martial artist]], who reveals a planet-wide [[alien conspiracy]] with the help of several agents and the "IRIS Network" [[resistance movement]].

Designed by [[Michel Ancel]], the creator of the [[Rayman (series)|''Rayman'' series]], ''Beyond Good & Evil'' was envisioned as the first of a trilogy, but was a [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] due to its ill-timed release and lack of popularity. However, it received critical acclaim and honors, including a nomination for Game of the Year at the 2004 [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. A sequel, ''[[Beyond Good & Evil 2]]'', is currently in development.

Game information such as lives displayed and a picture of the woman are displayed in the upper left and right corners of the screen, floating above the other elements.]]
''Beyond Good & Evil'' is an [[action-adventure game]] with elements of [[puzzle video game|puzzle-solving]] and [[stealth game|stealth-based]] games.<ref name="gspot-pc review"/> Players control the protagonist, [[Jade (Beyond Good & Evil)|Jade]], from a third-person perspective. Jade can run, move stealthily, jump over obstacles and pits, climb ladders, push or bash in doors and objects, and flatten herself against a wall.<ref name="movement-pc manual">{{cite book|year=2003|title=Beyond Good & Evil Instruction Manual (PC version)|publisher=Ubisoft|pages=7<U+2013>8}}</ref> As Jade, players investigate installations in search of the truth about war with an alien threat.<ref name="gspot-pc review"/>

In the game's interior spaces players solve puzzles and make their way past enemies in order to reach areas containing photographic evidence.<ref name="gspot-pc review"/> Jade's main tools are her [[Da<U+00EF>-jo]] combat staff, a [[melee weapon]], discs for attacking at range, and a camera.<ref name="ign-pc review"/> Jade has a set amount of health, which is decreased when attacked and can be restored by the fictional food items "Starkos" and "K-Bups". At times, it is only possible to advance in the game with the help of other characters; the characters are [[artificial intelligence|computer-controlled]] and players direct them via contextual commands.<ref name="gspot-pc review"/> For example, in combat the player can order them to perform a "super attack", either pounding the ground to bounce enemies into the air, allowing the player to hit them from long distances, or knocking them off balance, making them vulnerable to attack.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Good & Evil Manual (Gamecube)|publisher=Ubisoft|page=16|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> These allies also possess a health bar and are incapacitated if their health is depleted.

In addition to obtaining evidence and completing assignments, players can use Jade's camera to take pictures of animal species in exchange for currency and instantly scan objects to reveal more information about the environment.<ref name="ign-pc review"/> When upgraded with the "Gyrodisk Glove", Jade can attack enemies or activate devices from a distance using the camera interface.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Good & Evil Manual (Gamecube)|publisher=Ubisoft|page=19|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref>

Traveling around the world is accomplished via a [[hovercraft]], also used for races and other [[minigame]]s, and, later, a spaceship, the Beluga, which can store the hovercraft on board. Both of these vehicles can be upgraded to reach new areas and progress through the game by collecting pearls to pay the mechanics at Mammago Garage. The main city serves as a hub, allowing the player access to the various areas that must be explored in order to expose the conspiracy. Both vehicles have a boost ability and, if damaged by an enemy, can be repaired using a "Repair Pod".

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===
''Beyond Good & Evil'' takes place in the year [[25th century|2435]] on the mining planet of Hillys, located in Sector Four, a remote section of the galaxy.<ref name="GS Preview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/beyondgoodevil/news.html?sid=6078963&mode=previews|title= Beyond Good and Evil Updated Preview|last=Torres|first=Ricardo|date=2003-11-06|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref> The architecture of the city around which the game takes place was designed with a rustic European style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as [[e-mail]] and [[credit card]]s, with those of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], such as [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals coexisting with humans.<ref name="Edge">{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/time-extend-beyond-good-evil?page=0,0|title=Time Extend: Beyond Good & Evil|first=Edge Staff|date=2009-10-05|publisher=Edge Online|accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref> The once-peaceful planet is under siege by aliens called the DomZ that abduct beings and either drain their life force for power, or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves.<ref name="GS Preview"/> A [[military dictatorship]] called the Alpha Sections takes power, promising to defend the populace.<ref name="ign-pc review"/> However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite their public assurances.

''Beyond Good & Evil'''s main protagonist, Jade (voiced by [[Jodie Forrest]]), is a young reporter. She resides in an island lighthouse that doubles as a home for children orphaned by DomZ attacks. Pey'j (voiced by [[David Gasman]]), a boar-like creature, is Jade's "uncle" and guardian figure.<ref name="ign-pc review"/> Double H, a heavily-built human IRIS operative, assists Jade during missions. He wears a military-issue suit of armor at all times. Secundo, an artificial intelligence built into Jade's storage SAC, <!--What does SAC stand for? Please add the full meaning and put "SAC" in parentheses if you wish. --> offers advice and "digitizes" items. The main antagonists are the DomZ High Priest, who is the chief architect of the invasion, and Alpha Sections leader General Kehck, who uses propaganda to gain the Hillyans' trust, even as he abducts citizens to sustain the DomZ.

===Plot===
Jade and Pey'j are looking after children of Hillys orphaned by the DomZ. When Jade runs out of money to run the shield that protects them she finds a photography job, cataloging all the species on Hillys for a [[science museum]]. She is recruited by the IRIS Network, which suspects that the Alpha Sections are behind planet-wide disappearances. Jade's first target of investigation is an Alpha Sections factory, where she discovers evidence of [[human trafficking]] being orchestrated by the DomZ under the Alpha Sections' authority. Along the way she rescues Double H, who was kidnapped by the DomZ and subjected to torture. Pey'j is abducted by the DomZ and taken to a slaughterhouse to be launched to a lunar base. After failing to extract Pey'j from the slaughterhouse in time, Jade learns that Pey'j was, in fact, the secret chief of the IRIS Network.

It becomes clear that the Alpha Sections are being possessed and manipulated by the DomZ. Using Beluga, the ship Pey'j used to travel to Hillys, Jade and Double H go on a mission to the DomZ lunar base. After rescuing Pey'j, transmitting her final report, and sparking a revolution, Jade confronts the DomZ High Priest. She learns that her human form is the latest container to hide a power stolen from the DomZ centuries ago. Using that power, she is able to defeat the DomZ High Priest, and rescues those that have been abducted.

==Development==
[[File:Michel Ancel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michel Ancel]], designer and writer of ''Beyond Good & Evil''.]]
''Beyond Good & Evil'' was developed by [[Michel Ancel]], the creator of the ''[[Rayman]]'' video game, at [[Ubisoft]]'s Montpellier studios in France. A group of 30 employees comprised the development team.<ref name="ign-2002 interview"/> After years working on ''Rayman'', Ancel wanted to move on to something different.<ref name="gamespy-ancel interview">{{cite web|author=Turner, Benjamin|date=2003-09-17|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/september03/ancel/index.shtml|title=Michel Ancel: Beyond Rayman |publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> He recalled that the goal of ''Beyond Good & Evil'' was to "pack a whole universe onto a single CD<U+2014>mountains, planets, towns. The idea was to make the player feel like an explorer, with a sense of absolute freedom."<ref name="ign-2002 interview">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2002-05-24|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/360/360766p1.html|title=E3 2002: Project BG&E Interview|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> 

The second goal behind ''Beyond Good & Evil''{{'}}s design was to create a meaningful story amid player freedom. In an interview, Ancel said that the linear nature of the gameplay was necessary to convey the story; player freedom was an experience between parts of the plot.<ref name="gamespy-ancel interview"/> The game drew on many influences and inspirations, including the [[Styles and themes of Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki universe]], politics and the media, and the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="eurogamer-out of touch">{{cite web|author=Purchese, Robert|date=2009-04-03|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ancel-thinks-zelda-is-out-of-touch|title=BG&E2 inspired by September 11|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>

The game was first shown publicly at the 2002 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], where it received negative reception. Originally more "artistically ambitious" and resembling games like ''[[Ico]]'', the game was substantially changed in order to make it more commercially appealing. Jade, originally a teenage girl, was redesigned to be more powerful and fitting of her job. The game was also shortened by removing long periods of exploration due to Ancel's dislike of this aspect of gameplay in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. The development team was "demoralized" by the changes, with Ancel commenting that the finished game resembled a sequel more than a reworking.<ref name="Edge"/> Prior to release, playable previews of the game were offered in movie theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542187/20061002/story.jhtml|title=GameFile: Peter Jackson's Mission; Big-Screen 'Gears Of War' And More|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=2006-10-03|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref>

===Audio===
The soundtrack of ''Beyond Good & Evil'' was composed by Christophe H<U+00E9>ral. H<U+00E9>ral was hired by Ancel to compose the soundtrack of ''Beyond Good & Evil'' due to his background in film. Hubert Chevillard, a [[film director|director]] that Ancel had worked with, had also worked with H<U+00E9>ral on a [[television special]], ''The Pantin Pirouette'', and referred him to Ancel. H<U+00E9>ral was assisted by Laetitia Pansanel, who [[orchestration|orchestrated]] the pieces, and his brother Patrice H<U+00E9>ral, who performed some of the sound effects and singing.<ref name=Heralinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgemyth.net/?page=plus_d_infos/creation_du_jeu/interview_christophe_heral/interview_christophe_heral.php|title=Christophe H<U+00E9>ral Interview|publisher=Beyond Good & Evil Myth|language=French|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

The soundtrack incorporates a wide variety of languages and instruments from around the world. Mainly [[Bulgaria]]n lyrics were chosen for the song "Propaganda", which plays in the game's Akuda Bar, to allude to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda of the [[Cold War]]. It uses a recording of a [[telephone]] conversation by H<U+00E9>ral with a female Bulgarian friend to represent the government's control of the [[media (communication)|media]]. It also incorporates Arabic string instruments and Indian percussion. A song called "Funky Mullah" was originally planned to be used in the Akuda Bar, but it was replaced by "Propaganda" because H<U+00E9>ral decided that its [[muezzin]] vocals, recorded on September 8, 2001, would have been in bad taste in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. "Fun and Mini-games", a song that plays during hovercraft races and other [[mini-game]]s, includes Spanish lyrics. The lyrics for DomZ music were created from a fictional language with prominent [[alveolar trill|rolling "r"]] sounds. The crashing metal sound effects of "[[Metal Gear]] DomZ", music played during a boss fight, were recorded from the son of H<U+00E9>ral's neighbor playing with [[scrap metal]]. The voices in the city of Hyllis were also recorded by H<U+00E9>ral himself.<ref name=Heralinterview/>

The music has never been published as an album, though it has been released in its entirety as a free download by Ubisoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/b/beyondgood.shtml|title=Beyond Good & Evil Soundtrack|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> The soundtrack is featured in the [[Video Games Live]] international concert tour.<ref name="VGL">{{cite web|url=http://www.videogameslive.com/index.php?s=info|title=Video Games Live|publisher=[[Video Games Live]]|accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref> ''Beyond Good & Evil'' was nominated for the "Audio of the Year", "Music of the Year", "Best Interactive Score", and "Best Sound Design" awards at the second annual Game Audio Network Guild awards.<ref name="GANGawards">{{cite web|url=http://www.music4games.net/n_gang_awards_2003_nominees.html|title=Game Audio Network Guild Announces 2nd Annual G.A.N.G Awards/Nominees |publisher=Music4Games|accessdate=2010-03-23 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051217011555/http://www.music4games.net/n_gang_awards_2003_nominees.html| archivedate=2005-12-17}}</ref> It was similarly nominated for the "Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition" and "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design" awards at the [[Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences]]'s 2004 [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s.<ref name="AIAS"/>

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' commended the game for its storytelling and design, but criticized its plot as unable to "match Jade's initial appeal", becoming "fairly mundane" without "the darkness and moral ambiguity suggested by the title", and Jade's [[everyman]] appeal being undermined by the revelation of her "mysterious hidden identity". Dan Toose of ''[[Icon Magazine]]'' called the game's setting "dark, baroque and earthy, a far cry from the squeaky-clean action of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games", describing the game as "a very European take on the role-playing genre" and "one of the best adventure games in years".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/05/1070351782307.html|title=Die Hard|last=Toose|first=Dan|date=2003-12-06|publisher=Icon|accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref> Star Dingo of ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the game was a "[[jack of all trades, master of none]]" that "never really lives up to its title", adding that its vision could have been more focused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/31690/beyond-good-and-evil/|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Dingo|first=Star|date=2003-11-12|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref>

Among complaints with the game were control issues and a lack of gameplay depth.

''Beyond Good & Evil'' was not a commercial success.
