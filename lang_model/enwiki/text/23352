'''''Ed, Edd n Eddy''''' is an original [[animated television series]] on [[Cartoon Network]] created by [[Danny Antonucci]] and produced by Canadian-based [[a.k.a. Cartoon]]. ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is one of Cartoon Network's longest running and is considered one of its most successful franchises<ref name="variety.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991652.html?categoryId=1050&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=WildBrain pacts with Antonucci | first=Michael | last=Schneider}}</ref><ref>[http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/6990 CN/D3 Unleash New Ed, Edd n Eddy Game | Animation Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the longest-running of the channel's original [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. The series revolves around three [[Adolescence|adolescent]] boys collectively known as "the Eds," who hang around in a [[suburb]]an [[cul-de-sac]]. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers, in order to purchase their favorite [[confectionery]]: [[jawbreakers]]. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.

The series ended its 10 year run on [[Cartoon Network]] with the series finale movie "Ed Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show" on November 8, 2009, but reruns currently air on [[Cartoon Network]].

==Plot==
===Premise===
The show revolves solely around the Eds, the other [[cul-de-sac]] children, and the Kanker sisters.<ref name="animationbymistake1"/> Subtle hints throughout the series pointed to where the cartoon took place, as it was revealed that the cul-de-sac is in a town called Peach Creek. As similar to the [[Peanuts]] series, no adults are seen, as well as the seeming lack of any other inhabitants and any other possible relations; besides Sarah being Ed's little sister and a the running gag of Rolf and his mysterious family relations.

=== Episode Format ===
{{Main|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes}}
[[Image:EdTouchables.jpg|thumb|left|The pilot episode title card: "The Ed-Touchables"]]

The show frequently makes [[meta-reference]]s and often breaks the [[fourth wall]]. Almost every episode contains references to [[pop culture]], especially movies. All the episode tittles, except for the holiday specials, are popular sayings with a word replaced with the word ''Ed'' (for example, "Stop, Look, and Ed": Stop, Look, and Listen.) Some are also parodies of movie titles. In addition, the letters ''AKA'', the abbreviation for the name of the company that produces the show (''a.k.a. Cartoon''), frequently appear in the show on license plates.<ref name="variety.com"/> The kids have multi-colored tongues, because, as Danny Antonucci stated, kids are almost always eating something that turn their tongues different colors.<ref name="animationbymistake1"/> Most of the episodes begin with something completely unrelated to the storyline of the episode; this is to emphasize the spontaneity of childhood.<ref name="animationbymistake1"/> The number of characters in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is fixed at twelve. Until the debut of the movie "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show" -where Eddy's adult brother was shown for the very first time -no other characters besides the main cast were ever seen. There is no given timeline for the show; Danny Antonucci has stated that he wanted the show to appeal to any generation.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184111/trivia "Ed, Edd, 'n' Eddy" (1999) - Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' was animated wholly using new [[cel animation]] up until its fifth season. Though the show is still entirely hand-drawn, all cels are colored digitally as are most other series. The cels are shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at a.k.a. To give the impression of movement, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' uses shimmering character outlines similar to [[Squigglevision]]. The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', but are still visible.<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"/> Danny Antonucci calls it a "wobble", and likens it to cartoons of the 1930s where the film tended to be unstable and cause a similar effect.<ref name="animationbymistake1">{{cite web|url=http://animationbymistake.fateback.com/abm/dannytalk.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302131130/http://animationbymistake.fateback.com/abm/dannytalk.html|archivedate=2008-03-02|title=Animation By Mistake: Chatting with Danny Antonucci|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>

=== Characters ===
{{Main|List of characters in Ed, Edd n Eddy}}
According to an interview with Danny Antonucci (a special feature on the Season 1 DVD set), the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons. The Eds also held personality traits of [[The Three Stooges]], who were a comedy trio who's various characters they portrayed in each short subject film often try to create money-making schemes, but their plans end up backfiring them near the end of their films. The cul-de-sac kids were based on kids he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank to the show, stating that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.<ref>Season 1 DVD: Interview with the Creator</ref> He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.<ref name="animationbymistake1"/> In a Cartoon Network podcast interview, Antonucci hinted at the Kanker sisters being based on someone from his personal life, as well.

== Critical reaction ==
The reaction to ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is varied. Terrence Briggs of ''[[Animation World Network|Animation World Magazine]]'' argued that every second of the show is "filler" and that the main characters are drawn as "products from the school of acid-trip caricature."<ref name='Briggs'>{{cite news|first=Terence|last=Briggs|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Caught in a Circle|date=February 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.11/3.11pages/tveddy.php3|work=Animation World Magazine|accessdate = 2008-07-31}}</ref>
After the review was published, support letters of the show started to pile up at ''Animation World Magazine's'' website. This caused the magazine to write a more positive review of ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', calling it a "smelly show with very different approaches."<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2">{{cite news|first=Shumway|last=Matt|coauthors=Lamont Wayne|title= Ed, Edd n Eddy: A Unique Approach|date=June 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.03/4.03pages/SCAD_EEE.php3|work=Animation World Magazine|accessdate = 2008-07-31}}</ref>

[[Film critic]] Maryann Johanson found the show a successful experiment in style but surprisingly infantile in content, opining: "Visually, Cartoon Network's kiddie entry ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is delightfully gonzo, its inventive animation style and garish colors reflecting the adolescent confusion of its identically named boy heroes. But their goofy misadventures hold little appeal for grownup cartoon fans -- this one is pretty much strictly for the kiddies."<ref name="flickfilosopher">{{cite web|last=Johanson|first=Maryann|url=http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2005/05/ed_edd_n_eddy_volume_1_edifyin.html |title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Volume 1: Edifying Edventures (review)|work=Flickfilosopher.com|date=2005-05-25|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> <!-- Can't use this, find the article before uncommenting this: Robin Oliver of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' thought that ''Ed, Edd n Eddy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s admittedly surreal and far-fetched plots worked in its favor, saying,"... It's not the best of plans but then that's what makes this show work so well."  -->David Cornelius considered the Eds adolescent equivalents of the [[Three Stooges]],<ref name="DVDTalk"/> believing: "The series revels in the sort of frantic, often [[Toilet humor|gross humor]] kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily."<ref name="DVDTalk"/> Cornelius also concurred that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated."<ref name='DVDTalk'>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28046/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-complete-second-season/ |title=DVD Talk Review: Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy&nbsp;<U+2014> The Complete Second Season |accessdate=2008-07-31 |last=Cornelius |first=David |date=2007-04-24 |work=DVDTalk.com}}</ref>

== Additional works ==
[[Image:The main characters from Ed, Edd n Eddy and Dexter's Laboratory Make a cameo, Foster's style.jpg|thumb|right|Ed, Edd and Eddy look-alikes in the ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends'' episode "Eddie Monster".]]
There have been other produced works in which the Eds would appear apart from their regular series airings. They have appeared in a ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' episode using ''Foster's'' styled animation, and made a short [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door''. Also, they appeared in a small crossover poster during the credits of "The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door" entitled ''Ed, Edd n Mandy''.

=== Shorts ===
Cartoon Network has also produced shorts, some involving the Eds during commercial breaks. For a short while, Cartoon Network made a series of roughly 2-minute shorts called ''Ed, Eddy, Eduardo'' in which Eduardo from ''Foster's'' appeared in an ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' episode.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These shorts began airing on July 11, 2006 on Cartoon Network. There was also a short music video with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day" (aka "I'm Not Coming in Anymore" as listed on the Season 2 DVD), which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video Sarah uses a [[potion]] to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her [[dollhouse]], with predictable results. Plank starred in a similar video called "My Best Friend Plank," which aired in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

=== Special events ===
There have been many specials in which Cartoon Network would run all day marathons for either a promotion or just a special airing for one of their shows. A [[Marathon (television)|marathon]] called '''The Best Day Edder''' aired from April 27 to April 28, 2007, in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ending with the previously unaired last episode of Season 5.

A special episode of ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' aired on May 11, 2007 in the Cartoon Network event, [[Cartoon Network Invaded|Invaded]], in which aliens invade Rolf's house. This alien invasion is in adjunct with the other Cartoon Network series ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', and ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]''. The episode is part a mini-series that aired all 5 specials on May 28, 2007.

At the San Diego Comic Con in July 2007 the show's creators announced that there will not be a sixth season of the series at this time since they were working on making a movie to conclude the series instead. The plot focuses on the Eds searching for Eddy's brother. The elusive character finally appears in the concluding segment of the film. The movie was complete on December 18, 2008. The movie finally aired in the [[United States]] on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.
