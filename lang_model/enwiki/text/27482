'''Christopher Emmanuel Paul''' (born May 6, 1985) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] [[point guard]] for the [[New Orleans Hornets]].

Paul was born and raised in [[North Carolina]]. Despite only playing two varsity basketball seasons in high school, he was a [[McDonald's All-American]] and accepted a  scholarship with nearby [[Wake Forest University]]. After his sophomore year with the [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Demon Deacons]], he declared for the draft. Since being selected 4th overall in the [[2005 NBA Draft]] by New Orleans, Paul has been a [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]] (2006), a three-time [[All-Star]], and an [[All-NBA]] and [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive team]] honoree. He led the Hornets to the second round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]]. He has also won an [[Olympic Gold Medal]] with the [[United States national basketball team]].

Off the court, Paul is a notable [[Ten-pin bowling|ten-pin bowler]] and a sponsored spokesperson for the [[United States Bowling Congress]] (USBC). He has participated in numerous celebrity and youth bowling events as the head of the CP3 Foundation to benefit programs in [[Louisiana]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]], and charities in Winston-Salem.

==Early years==
Chris Paul was born in Lewisville, North Carolina as the second son of Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones after Charles "C.J." Paul. Growing up, Chris and C.J. took summer to work at their grandfather's gas station.

===High school===
Paul played at [[West Forsyth High School (North Carolina)|West Forsyth High School]] in [[Clemmons, North Carolina]], where he was a 2003 [[McDonald's All-American]] and was named North Carolina's Mr. Basketball for 2003 by ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]''. Paul averaged 30.8 points, 9.5 assists, 5.9 rebounds, and 6.0 steals per game as a senior in leading his team to a 27<U+2013>3 record and the Class 4A Eastern Regional finals. That same year, at the beginning of the season, Paul scored 61 points in honor of his grandfather, Nathaniel Jones, who, days before, had been beaten to death. Paul scored one point for every year his grandfather lived. When Paul reached the 61-point mark, he intentionally missed a free throw, then took himself out of the game even though the state high school scoring record of 66 points was well within reach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=CP3Book-091007|title=No tall tales in CP3's children's book|last=Clemmons|first=Anna Katherine|date=October 7, 2009|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Summer circuit==
Though he did not win a state championship while in high school, Paul did take the Winston-Salem-based '''Kappa Magic''' (alongside future [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] rival [[Reyshawn Terry]]), to the 2002 National U-17 AAU Championship over an All-Ohio team led by 2003 McDonald's All-American [[Drew Lavender]], taking home the tournament's MVP award in the process.<ref>[http://wakeforestsports.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/paul_chris00.html Player Bio: Chris Paul]</ref>

==College career==
Paul attended [[Wake Forest University]] in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He played there for two years leading the [[Demon Deacons]] to two NCAA Tournaments, and one [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] appearance. In his freshman year he was named the ACC Rookie of the Year, and National Freshman of the Year by several publications. Paul also earned ACC All-Defensive Team honors during his time at Wake and was among the Consensus First Team All-Americans in his sophomore year. By the time he declared for the [[2005 NBA Draft]] as a sophomore, he had finished near the top of almost every offensive category at Wake Forest.

==NBA career==
===2005<U+2013>2006: Rookie stardom===
Paul was selected fourth overall by the [[New Orleans Hornets]] in the first round of the [[2005 NBA Draft]]. Due to the devastation of [[Hurricane Katrina]] that summer to the city of New Orleans, Paul did not play his first full season in New Orleans. Instead, the team played in various arenas and relocated to [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. The Hornets only played three games in [[New Orleans Arena]].

Paul led all rookies in points, assists, steals, and minutes, earning him the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2006]] [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Paul was a near-unanimous winner for the award, but one voter ([[Ron Boone]], television analyst for the Utah Jazz) gave [[Deron Williams]] his vote instead of Paul. This, along with the fact that both were taken back to back in the draft and play the same position, has led to an on-court rivalry between Paul and Williams.<ref name="ESPNMag">{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}</ref> Their rivalry began on December 1, 2004 when Paul led his No. 1-ranked Wake Forest into Champaign to face Williams' Illini.  Illinois thrashed the Demon Deacons 91<U+2013>73 and took the top spot from there into their run to the 2005 NCAA Championship Game.  Williams had 8 points and 11 assists while Paul was held to 10 points.

Paul finished the 2005<U+2013>06 season averaging 16.1 points, 7.8 assists, and 5.1 rebounds. He was also the only unanimous selection to the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06]] NBA All Rookie First Team and was named [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Rookie of the Month every month in the 2005<U+2013>06 season. After the season, Paul won the [[ESPY Awards|ESPY Award]] for Best Breakthrough Athlete. He recorded his first [[triple-double]] on April 2, 2006 against the [[Toronto Raptors]] with 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists.

===2006<U+2013>07 season===
Still playing in Oklahoma City, Paul followed up his impressive rookie campaign with a solid sophomore season. He improved his scoring average to 17.3 points, and improved his assists average with 8.9 per game. He averaged 4.4 rebounds per game. Paul's season was riddled with injuries though, as he was limited to playing in only 64 games.

Paul was not named an All-Star in 2007, but he was named to replace [[Steve Nash]] in the 2007 [[PlayStation]] Skills Challenge during All-Star Weekend. He played in the [[T-Mobile]] [[Rookie Challenge]] and dished out 17 [[assist (basketball)|assist]]s and had 9 [[steal (basketball)|steal]]s, both T-Mobile Rookie Challenge records. When interviewed during the Rookie Challenge, Paul vowed that he would be an All-Star next season, as the All-Star Game would be held in New Orleans.

===2007<U+2013>08 season===
[[File:Chris paul hornets v celtics.jpg|thumb|right|Paul in a game against Boston]]
The [[2007<U+2013>08 NBA season|2007<U+2013>08 season]] brought the full return of the Hornets to the city of New Orleans.  Emerging as a true superstar, Paul averaged 21.1 points and 4 rebounds,<ref name="yahoogamelog">[http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/3930/gamelog;_ylt=AmPXwuR1UfeVHDmoKq_.fmWkvLYF Yahoo.com Chris Paul 2007-08 Game Log]</ref> and led the NBA in steals with 2.71 per game and assists with 11.6 per game.<ref name="ESPNstats">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/statistics?season=2008&seasontype=2 NBA Stats: 2007-2008 Regular Season]</ref> He was selected by NBA coaches to play in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game]] which was hosted by the city of New Orleans, thereby fulfilling his vow from the previous season. Paul's teammate [[David West (basketball)|David West]] was named as an All-Star reserve and Hornets coach [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] coached the Western Conference All-Stars.
During [[NBA All-Star Weekend|All-Star Weekend]], Paul participated again in the 2008 All-Star PlayStation Skills Challenge winning the first round but losing in the final round to [[Deron Williams]]. Paul sparked a 4th quarter comeback for the Western Conference in the All-Star Game, but the East held on to win 134<U+2013>128. He finished the game with 16 points, 14 assists and 5 steals.

Paul continued his stellar play following the All Star game, leading the New Orleans Hornets to one of the best records in the West. After a 37 point, 13 assist, and 3 steal performance by Paul against the Chicago Bulls on March 17, 2008, Paul led a 4th quarter comeback win,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280317003 Chicago vs. New Orleans - Recap - March 17, 2008], ESPN.com</ref> the Hornets ascended to the top of the standings in the Western Conference.  On April 4, 2008, Chris Paul helped the Hornets clinch a playoff spot for the first time since the [[2003<U+2013>04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04 season]]. The Hornets ultimately finished the season with a 56<U+2013>26 record, the best record in team history, and finished #2 overall in the NBA Western Conference standings. Paul ended the season leading the NBA with 11.6 assists and 2.71 steals per game,<ref name="ESPNstats" /> and registered a steal in all 80 games he played in.

In Paul's first NBA playoff game against the [[Dallas Mavericks]], he scored 35 points, with 24 coming in the second half,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280419003 Paul, Hornets climb back from deficit to take Game 1 from Mavs]</ref> along with 10 assists and 4 steals.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=280419003 Mavericks 10, Hornets 204 - boxscore]</ref> In Game 2, he scored 32 points and set a franchise playoff-record 17 assists, leading the Hornets to a 127<U+2013>103 victory to go 2<U+2013>0 against Dallas.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280422003 Paul dissects Mavs' D, dishes out 17 assists as Hornets go up 2-0]</ref> After splitting Games 3 and 4 in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], the Hornets eliminated the Mavericks, 4<U+2013>1, in Game 5 for their first ever playoff series victory behind a 24 point, 11 rebound, and 15 assist performance from Paul.<ref name="eliminatemavs">[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280429003 Paul, Hornets finish off Mavericks in five to move on to second round] In the second round, they lost in 7 games to the San Antonio Spurs.</ref>

He finished second in MVP voting, behind [[Kobe Bryant]], who beat him with a margin of 306 votes.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/news/kobe_mvp_080506.html Kobe Bryant Wins Most Valuable Player Award]</ref>  He was selected for the All-NBA First Team, 3 votes shy of a unanimous choice.

Paul has reportedly reached an agreement on a three-year extension with the Hornets with a player option with a fourth year, with a total value of $68 million.<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/8303924</ref>

===2008<U+2013>09 season===
[[File:Chris Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Paul guarded by [[Javaris Crittenton]] in a March 2009 game.]]
For the second season in a row Paul finished the season as the league leader in assists and steals. He also scored a career best 22.8 points per game on a career best percentage of 50.3%. Paul participated in his second NBA All Star Game starting for the Western Conference All Stars.
On December 17, 2008, against the [[San Antonio Spurs]], Paul broke [[Alvin Robertson]]'s 22-year-old NBA record by registering at least one steal in 106 consecutive games.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=281217003 Paul has steal in 106th straight game as Hornets win]</ref> The new record reached 108 consecutive games before ending on Christmas Day against the [[Orlando Magic]].

After the season, Paul was selected to the [[NBA All-Defensive Team]] first team, and the [[All-NBA]] second team. He was also fifth in the 2009 MVP voting, receiving two first place votes and a total of 192 points.<ref name="2009 MVP Voting Results">{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/basketball/nba/05/04/lebron.mvp.ap/index.html |title=2009 MVP Voting Results |accessdate=2009-05-17 |publisher=SportsIllustrated | date=2009-05-04}}</ref>

===2009<U+2013>10 season===
After a 3<U+2013>6 start to the season, the New Orleans Hornets fired Scott on November 12 and replaced him with general manager [[Jeff Bower (basketball)|Jeff Bower]], who has been involved with the franchise since 1995.<ref>

==Personal life==
Paul is an official member of the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Team [[Air Jordan|Jordan brand]]. He was one of only three athletes ([[Derek Jeter]] and [[Carmelo Anthony]] being the others) to have had his own shoe made with the brand.<ref>[http://www.nicekicks.com/air-jordan-cp3-chris-paul-signature-shoe/ Air Jordan CP3 - Chris Paul Signature Shoe - NiceKicks.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Paul was the cover athlete for the video game ''[[NBA2K#NBA 2K8|NBA 2K8]]''.<ref>[http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/806/806421p1.html Chris Paul Gets NBA 2K8 Cover]</ref>

Paul and [[New Orleans Saints]] [[running back]] [[Reggie Bush]] are close friends and live in the same complex in the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. They also share a personal chef.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3264267 "Debutante Baller"], ''ESPN The Magazine''</ref>

Chris Paul and [[LeBron James]], are best-friends. Paul stated that "He's like my brother" <ref>[http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2008/10/chris_paul_welcomes_friend_leb.html]</ref>

Chris Paul and [[Utah Jazz]] [[Point guard]] [[Deron Williams]], are close friends.

During the second season of ESPN's ''It's the Shoes'', Paul revealed to [[Bobbito Garcia]] that the "CP3" nickname comes from family tradition. The combination of his initials and jersey number is strictly a coincidence. His father (Charles Paul) and older brother (C.J. Paul) are nicknamed CP1 and CP2, respectively. Paul also notes that all three men's initials are CEP."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKa0GiyJ8Ig YouTube - Chris Paul on Bobbito's It's the Shoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Whenever Chris scores during a Hornets home game the PA Announcer will simply say "CP3!" and then play a sound byte of legendary pro wrestler [[Ric Flair]]'s famous "Wooooo!" quote. Flair, who is an avid Hornets fan and whose loyalty stuck with the team even after they relocated from his hometown Charlotte to New Orleans, attended every Hornets home game in their 2008 Western Conference Semi-Final Series against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and introduced the starting lineups at a home game against the [[Golden State Warriors]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/Ask_Chris_Paul_2008_Offseason-281025-31.html]</ref>

In 2008, Paul appeared on the [[National Public Radio|NPR]] news quiz show "[[Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!]]," where he went three-for-three in the "Not My Job" game.

Chris Paul was named the best point guard in the NBA by [[Gary Payton]].<ref>http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/One-on-One-Gary-Payton-talks-television-Sonics;_ylt=ApVOmNewdCUbWlCaQMwJQOC8vLYF?urn=nba,126975</ref>
