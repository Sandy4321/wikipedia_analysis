"'''The F Word'''" is the twelfth episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 193rd overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 4, 2009. In the episode, the boys attempt to change the official definition of the word "[[Faggot (slang)|fag]]" from an [[homophobia|anti-homosexual]] slur to a term describing loud and obnoxious [[Harley-Davidson|Harley]] bikers.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. "The F Word" argues language is ever-changing and that [[taboo]] words only carry a stigma if society allows them to, and attempts to reclaim and disempower the word "fag". Although [[gay community|LGBT activist]]s acknowledged good intentions behind the episode, the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] objected to the episode, claiming it still advocated use of the term as a slur and that it could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community.

"The F Word" received generally mixed reviews, with commentators differing on the success behind the episode's underlying message. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], "The F Word" was seen by 1.99 million households among viewers aged between 18 and 49, making it the highest rated episode of the season, and surpassing the viewership of the [[NBC]] primetime comedy talk show, ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''.

== Plot ==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] enjoy a nice day outside with the weather being warm until a large group of [[Harley-Davidson|Harley]] [[Outlaw motorcycle club|riders]] disturb them. The citizens of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like "[[faggot (slang)|fag]]s" and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Surround sound|Surround sound system]]). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various [[musical instruments]]. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] and [[Token Black|Token]] devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. Once [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan [[spray painting|spray paint]] "FAGS GET OUT" on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the [[graffiti]] alarms [[List of recurring South Park characters#Big Gay Al|Big Gay Al]] and [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Mr. Slave|Mr. Slave]] because they interpret it as [[homophobia]].

The boys readily admit to the spray painting, and explain to the city council that the word "fag" is not intended as an insult to [[homosexuality|homosexual]]s, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle, or "an inconsiderate douchebag", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community, results in a town ordinance declaring a change in the word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity from the rest of the nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as "fags" (one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times). They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant "an unpleasant old woman" and [[fasces|a bundle of sticks]].

Upset by the national attention, [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels]] wants to resolve the situation, and the boys suggest getting the official dictionary definition updated. The town invites the English Dictionary Officiates, led by [[Emmanuel Lewis]], to review the proposal and consider making the definition change official. As the town celebrates the arrival of Lewis and the Officiates, the bikers suddenly crash the event and begin to [[riot]]. After inflicting damage to the town and scaring off the citizens, they corner the boys in an alley. The bikers demand they stop being called "fags", but the boys refuse to do so, asserting their behavior further justifies the application of the term. Butters steps between them and comes to the defense of the riders by expressing his admiration for the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. Confronted by gun-wielding residents led by Big Gay Al, the riders ultimately accept their new label, and Lewis (who was roughed up during the riot) is happy to declare the definition officially changed. The town rejoices and celebrates, and the episode cuts to an ending title card with an updated definition:

{{quotation|Fag (f<U+0103>g) n.
<p>
1. An extremely annoying, inconsiderate person most commonly associated with Harley riders.
<p>
2. A loud and obnoxious person who owns or frequently rides a Harley.}}

Although LGBT activists acknowledged the noble intentions behind the episode, the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] objected to "The F Word", stating the episode still uses the word in a very derogatory context, even though it is directed against bikers instead of homosexuals. As a result, GLAAD said "The F Word" still reinforced the usage of the word "fag" as a means of insulting others, and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community.<ref name="Itzkoff1106" /><ref name="Jones0106" /> GLAAD officials called it a "slur-filled episode" and demanded an apology from ''South Park'' creators Trey Parker and [[Matt Stone]].<ref name="Itzkoff1106" /> Comedy Central declined to respond to the comments.<ref name="Hibberd" />

"The F Word" makes prominent use of Harley-Davidson, the largest motorcycle manufacturing company in the United States. Also featured in the episode is [[Emmanuel Lewis]], an actor who is portrayed as the head editor of the dictionary.

"The F Word" was considered particularly controversial, even by ''South Park'' standards.<ref name="Hibberd" /><ref name="Seidman" /> The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of ''iF'' magazine said "The F Word" marks a return of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said "The F Word" served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not.<ref name="delgado" /> Ramsey Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' compared "The F Word" to "[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]", an [[South Park (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode that made prominent use of the word "[[nigger]]". However, Isler said "The F Word" was not as skillfully crafted as the "Jesse Jackson" episode and, although some moments were entertaining, the episode "had a habit of running some gags into the ground".<ref name="IGN" /> James Hibberd, of ''The Live Feed'', said he found the episode "well-intended and funny", and that it forced readers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, "This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does".<ref name="Hibberd" /> Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said the word "fag" has not lost its associations with homosexuals, so she did not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode "preachy", and said, "It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs."<ref name="AVClub" />

In one scene, the Harley Riders ride past the town church, where Father Maxi is standing outside, holding a sign saying "God Hates Fags". This is believed to be reference to the radical [[Westboro Baptist Church]], "God Hates Fags" being a common sign at the church's protests.<ref>{{cite web|title=The F Word/Trivia|url=http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/The_F_Word/Trivia|work=http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/The_F_Word/Trivia}}</ref> Westboro Baptist Church posted an angry story on their website godhatesthemedia.com expressing their displeasure for episode.
