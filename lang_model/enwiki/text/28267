'''''StarCraft''''' is a [[military science fiction]] [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and  released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 31 March 1998.<ref name="releasedate"/> The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first game of the [[StarCraft (series)|''StarCraft'' series]]. A [[Mac OS]] version was released in March 1999, and a [[Nintendo 64]] adaptation co-developed with [[THQ|Mass Media Interactive Entertainment]] was released on 13 June 2000.<ref name="64release"/> Work on the game started shortly after ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]''{{'}}s release in 1995. ''StarCraft'' debuted at the 1996 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], where it was unfavourably compared to ''Warcraft II''; as a result, the project was entirely overhauled and then showcased to public in early 1997, receiving a far more positive response. 

Set in the 26th century, the game revolves around three species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy known as the [[Koprulu Sector]]: the [[Races of StarCraft#Terrans|Terrans]], humans exiled from Earth skilled at adapting to any situation; the [[Races of StarCraft#Zerg|Zerg]], a race of [[wikt:insectoid|insectoid]] aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection, obsessed with assimilating other races; and the [[Races of StarCraft#Protoss|Protoss]], a [[humanoid]] species with advanced technology and [[psionics|psionic abilities]], attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophical way of living from the Zerg.

Many of the industry's journalists have praised ''StarCraft'' as one of the best<ref name="Edge"/> and most important<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/|title=The 52 Most Important Video Games|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2008-05-21|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913085022/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/|archivedate=2008-09-13}}</ref> video games of all time, and for having raised the bar for developing real-time strategy games.<ref name="GspotAward"/> With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide as of February 2009, Starcraft is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling games]] for the [[personal computer]].<ref name="bestselling">{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/blizzard-confirms-one-frontline-release-09 |title=Blizzard Confirms One "Frontline Release" for '09 |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2009-05-12 |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |author=Kris Graft}}</ref>  The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in real-time strategy gameplay<ref name="ignr"/> and for a compelling story.<ref name="GSpot"/> ''StarCraft''{{'}}s [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] is particularly popular in [[South Korea]], where players and teams participate in [[StarCraft: Brood War professional competition|professional competitions]], earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments.<ref name="pop"/> ''StarCraft'' has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels, the [[expansion pack]] ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' and two authorized add-ons.

[[File:Zerg colony (StarCraft).png|thumb|left|A Protoss force attacks a Zerg colony, shown from ''StarCraft''{{'}}s [[isometric projection|isometric perspective]]]]

Blizzard Entertainment's use of three distinct races in ''StarCraft'' is widely credited with revolutionizing the [[real-time strategy]] genre.<ref name="GspotAward"/> All units are unique to their respective races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the [[technology tree]], every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed. 

The enigmatic [[Races of StarCraft#Protoss|Protoss]] have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as [[energy shield]]s and localized [[Faster-than-light|warp]] capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy of the quality of their units over the quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/protoss_units.html|title=''StarCraft'' Strategy Guide: The Protoss Conclave - Units and Structures|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> The insectoid [[Races of StarCraft#Zerg|Zerg]] possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/zerg_units.html|title=''StarCraft'' Strategy Guide: The Zerg Swarm - Units and Structures|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> The [[Races of StarCraft#Terrans|Terrans]] provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/race_overview.html|title=''StarCraft'' Strategy Guide: The Terran Dominion - Units and Structures|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> 

Although each race is unique in its composition, no race has an innate advantage over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=21149|title=Blizzard Support: ''StarCraft''|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=2008-01-16|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

''StarCraft'' features [[artificial intelligence]] which scales in difficulty, although the player cannot change the difficulty level in the single-player campaigns. Each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy AI modes, scaling through the course of the campaign to the hardest AI modes. In the [[level editor]] provided with the game, a designer has access to four levels of AI difficulties: "easy", "medium", "hard" and "insane", each setting differing in the units and technologies allowed to an AI faction and the extent of the AI's tactical and strategic planning.<ref name="StarEdit">{{cite web|url=http://www.creepcolony.com/staredit1.shtml|title=''StarCraft'' - StarEdit Tutorial|date=2007-06-24|publisher=CreepColony.com|accessdate=2008-04-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010707132841/http://www.creepcolony.com/staredit1.shtml|archivedate=2001-07-07}}</ref> The single-player campaign consists of thirty missions, split into ten for each race.

=== Resource management ===
Each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by building a refinery on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/scc/GS/res.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030194233/http://www.battle.net/scc/GS/res.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-30|title=General Strategy: Resources|work=[[Battle.net]]|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races<U+2014>Terrans use physical supplies held in depots,<ref name="Tbasic">{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/scc/terran/basic.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011010924/http://www.battle.net/scc/terran/basic.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=Terran Basics|work=[[Battle.net]]|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> Protoss use a psionic power <!-- This refers to the generic term "nexus", not the in-game building.

=== Base construction ===
Protoss and Zerg building construction is limited to specific locations: Protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid<ref name="Pbasic"/> while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called "creep", that is produced by certain structures.<ref name="Zbasic"/> Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary base structures possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location.<ref name="Tbasic"/> Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed.  Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action, though this can be prevented by repairs performed by a worker unit.  The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit to begin the process of transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings' shields (but not their structure) are regenerative.  The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself.

=== Multiplayer ===

Multiplayer on  ''StarCraft'' is powered through Blizzard Entertainment's [[Battle.net]] Internet service. Through this, a maximum of eight players can compete in a variety of game modes, including simply destroying all other players on a level (which may be competitive, as in Ladder play, or non-ranked, as in melee play), to [[king of the hill (game)|king of the hill]] and [[capture the flag]] objective-based games. In addition, the game incorporates a variety of specialized scenarios for different types of game, such as simulating a [[American football|football]] game, using the Terran hoverbike unit to conduct a bike race, or hosting a Zerg hunting competition.<ref name="StarEdit"/> ''StarCraft'' is also one of the few games that include a [[spawn installation]], which allows for limited multiplayer. It must be installed from a disc, and requires a [[product key]] to work just as the full version does. However, one product key can support up to eight spawned installations with access to Battle.net. Limitations of a spawned installation include the inability to play single-player missions, create multiplayer games or use the campaign editor.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Multiplayer Games: Spawned Games|page=11|author=Underwood, Peter|coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey|title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|year=1999}}</ref>

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
{{see also|Races of StarCraft}}

''StarCraft'' takes place in a science fiction universe created by [[Chris Metzen]] and James Phinney for Blizzard Entertainment. According to the story presented in the game's manual, the overpopulation of [[Earth]] in the early 21st century has caused the [[United Earth Directorate|international government]] to exile undesirable elements of the [[Terran (StarCraft)|human]] race, such as criminals, the [[cybernetics|cybernetically enhanced]] and [[mutant (fictional)|genetic mutants]] to colonize the far reaches of the galaxy.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Terran: History|pages=26<U+2013>28|author=Underwood, Peter|coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey|title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|year=1998}}</ref> An attempt to colonize a nearby solar system goes wrong, resulting in humanity's arrival in the Koprulu Sector.  In the distant [[Koprulu Sector]] of the galaxy, the exiles form several governments, but quickly fall into conflict with each other. One government, the [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Confederacy of Man]], eventually emerges as the strongest faction, but its oppressive nature and brutal methods of suppressing dissidents stir up major rebel opposition in the form of a terrorist group called the [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Sons of Korhal]]. Just prior to the beginning of the game, in December 2499, an alien race possessing advanced technology and psionic power, the [[Races of StarCraft#Protoss|Protoss]], makes [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with humanity by destroying a Confederate colony world without any prior warning. Soon after this, the Terrans discover that a second alien race, the insectoid [[Races of StarCraft#Zerg|Zerg]], has been stealthily infesting the surface of several of the Terran colonies, and that the Protoss are destroying the planets to prevent the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy threatened by two alien races and internal rebellion, it begins to crumble.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Terran: History|pages=30<U+2013>33|author=Underwood, Peter|coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey|title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|year=1998}}</ref>

=== Characters ===
{{main|Characters of StarCraft}}

The player assumes the role of three nameless characters over the course of the game. In the first act, the player acts as the Confederate magistrate of an outlying colony world of [[Koprulu Sector#Mar Sara|Mar Sara]], threatened by both the Zerg and the Protoss, and is forced through events to join the rebel Sons of Korhal under its leader [[Characters of StarCraft#Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk]]. Mengsk's campaign is accompanied by [[Jim Raynor]], a [[morality|morally conscious]] law enforcement officer from Mar Sara, and [[Sarah Kerrigan]], a [[ghost agent|psychic assassin]] and Mengsk's second-in-command. The second episode of the game sees the player as a [[cerebrate]], a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is ruled over by the [[Characters of StarCraft#The Overmind|Zerg Overmind]], the manifestation of the collective consciousness of the Swarm and the game's primary antagonist, and is given advice from other cerebrates of higher rank and status while accomplishing the objectives of the Swarm. In the final part of ''StarCraft'', the player is a newly appointed officer (called Executor) within the Protoss military, reporting to Aldaris, a representative of the [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Protoss government]]. Aldaris is at odds with the former occupant of the player's position, [[Characters of StarCraft#Tassadar|Tassadar]], over his association with [[Zeratul]], a member of the [[dark templar]], a group considered heretical by the Protoss government.<ref name="Story1">{{cite web|url=http://eu.starcraft2.com/features/storysofar.xml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071123100044/http://eu.starcraft2.com/features/storysofar.xml|archivedate=2007-11-23|title=The Story So Far: Part 1: ''StarCraft''|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

<!-- Please keep it short. No mission-by-mission history, just an outline! -->
[[File:Briefing room (StarCraft).png|right|thumb|Plot exposition often takes place in menued screens with only the characters' faces shown and their captioned voices heard.]]
The story of ''StarCraft'' is presented through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, along with the use of cinematic [[cutscenes]] at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and [[Jim Raynor]] are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara in the wake of the Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Confederacy]] arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal.<ref name="ep1m3">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 3: "Desperate Alliance"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e1_3 Transcript]</ref> Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals.<ref name="ep1m7">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 7: "The Trump Card"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e1_7 Transcript]</ref> After forcing Confederate general [[Characters of StarCraft#Edmund Duke|Edmund Duke]] to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, [[Sarah Kerrigan]], to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital [[Koprulu Sector#Tarsonis|Tarsonis]].<ref name="ep1m9">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 9: "New Gettsyburg"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e1_5 Transcript]</ref> Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Terran Dominion]], crowning himself as emperor.<ref name="ep1m10">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode I, mission 10: "The Hammer Falls"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e1_10 Transcript]</ref>

The second campaign reveals that Kerrigan was not killed by the Zerg, but rather is captured and infested in an effort to incorporate her [[psionic]] traits into the Zerg [[gene pool]]. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered.<ref name="ep2m4">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 4: "Agent of the Swarm"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e2_4 Transcript]</ref> Meanwhile, the Protoss commander [[Characters of StarCraft#Tassadar|Tassadar]] discovers that the Zerg's [[cerebrate]]s cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical [[dark templar]]. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate [[Zeratul]], who assassinates [[Zasz]], one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on [[Koprulu Sector#Char|Char]].<ref name="ep2m7">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 7: "The Culling"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e2_7 Transcript]</ref> The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the [[Characters of StarCraft#The Overmind|Zerg Overmind]], allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld [[Koprulu Sector#Aiur|Aiur]], which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.<ref name="ep2m10">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode II, mission 10: "Full Circle"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e2_10 Transcript]</ref>

The final episode of the game sees [[Characters of StarCraft#Aldaris|Aldaris]] and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead.<ref name="ep3m5">{{cite video game | title = StarCraft | developer = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | year = 1998 | platform = PC | level = Episode III, mission 5: "Choosing Sides"}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20071020032934/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-story-17/#e3_5 Transcript]</ref> A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment.

== Development ==

[[Blizzard Entertainment]] began development on ''StarCraft'' in 1995, shortly after the release of highly successful ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/play-starcraft|title=Why We Play: StarCraft|first=Kat|last=Bailey|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> Using the ''Tides of Darkness'''s game engine as a base, ''StarCraft'' made its debut at [[E3 1996]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017043633/http://www.sclegacy.com/content/starcraft-encyclopedia-4/starcraft-evolution-12/|title=The Evolution of StarCraft|publisher=sclegacy.com|date=September 28, 2007. Archived from the original on October 17, 2007}}</ref> The version of the game displayed, assembled by the team's lead programmer Bob Fitch, received a rather weak response from the convention and was criticized by many for being "''[[Warcraft]]'' in space."<ref>{{cite web |last=Keighley|first=Geoff |title=Eye Of The Storm: Behind Closed Doors At Blizzard |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/blizzard/p3_01.html |accessdate=2006-08-19}}</ref> As a consequence the entire project was overhauled, bringing the focus onto creating three distinct species. [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]], one of the game's producers, stated this would be a major departure from the ''Warcraft'' approach, comparing its two equal sides to those of [[chess]] and stating that ''StarCraft'' would allow players to "develop very unique strategies based on which species [is being played], and will require [players] to think of different strategies to combat the other two species."<ref name="GameSpotPreview1">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/news.html?sid=2563222&mode=previews|title=''StarCraft'' Preview|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Ron|last=Dulin|date=1996-05-01|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> In early 1997, the new version of ''StarCraft'' was unveiled, receiving a far more positive response.

[[File:Alpha build (StarCraft).png|thumb|left|The Zerg in an early alpha build of ''StarCraft'']]
However, the game was still marred by technical difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the ''Warcraft II'' engine within two months to ensure that many of the features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to [[burrow]] and [[cloaking device|cloak]], could be implemented.<ref name="bobdev">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010210182346/http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/bob.shtml|title=Bob: ''StarCraft''!|work=10th Anniversary Celebration|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and backgrounds, constructed using [[3D Studio Max]].

Despite the progress, ''StarCraft'' was slow to emerge. The continual delays inspired a group of ''StarCraft'' fans on the official forums who labeled themselves "Operation: Can't Wait Any Longer" to write a series of fictional stories in which the members of Operation CWAL attempted to retrieve the [[Open beta|beta]] version of ''StarCraft'' from Blizzard's headquarters in [[Irvine, California]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Official CWAL FAQ| publisher=Operation CWAL |date = 2004-02-20| url = http://www.cwal.net/docs/faq.shtml| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}</ref> To pay homage to their presence on the forums and enthusiasm for the game, Blizzard Entertainment later incorporated the group's name into ''StarCraft'' as a cheat code to speed up the production of units<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/cheats.html|title=''StarCraft'' Strategy Guide: Cheat Codes - The Spoils of War|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> and gave the group thanks in the game's credits.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Credits|page=95|author=Underwood, Peter|coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey|title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|year=1998}}</ref> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] on 31 March 1998,<ref name="releasedate">{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/10-years-starcraft.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080402134120/http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/10-years-starcraft.html|archivedate=2008-04-02|title=''StarCraft''{{'}}s 10-Year Anniversary: A Retrospective|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> with the [[Mac OS]] version following a year later in March 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/mac/strategy/starcraft/index.html|title=''StarCraft'' for MAC|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> Development on a [[Nintendo 64]] version, ''StarCraft 64'', began in 1999, converted from PC by Mass Media Interactive Entertainment<U+2014>a subsidiary of [[THQ]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massmedia.com/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080114224835/http://www.massmedia.com/|archivedate=2008-01-14|title=Mass Media Interactive Entertainment official company site|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref><U+2014>and published by [[Nintendo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/starcraft64/news.html?sid=2545252|title=''StarCraft 64'' Preview|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1999-06-16|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> ''StarCraft 64'' was released on 13 June 2000 in the USA and on 16 June 2000 in Europe.<ref name="64release">{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign64.ign.com/objects/003/003894.html|title=''StarCraft 64''|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref>

=== Audio ===

The musical score to ''StarCraft'' was composed by Blizzard Entertainment's in-house composers. [[Derek Duke]] and [[Glenn Stafford]] composed the tracks in the menus and the in-game music, while [[Jason Hayes]] composed the music used in the cinematic [[cut scene]]s. [[Tracy W. Bush]] provided additional support in composing.<ref name="soundtrack1">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=71169|title=''StarCraft''|publisher=Soundtrack Collector|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> The musical score of the game was received well by reviewers, who have described it as "appropriately melodic and dark"<ref name="GSpot"/> and "impressive",<ref name="GameProN64"/> with one reviewer noting that some of the music owed much of its inspiration to [[Jerry Goldsmith|Jerry Goldsmith's]] score for the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.<ref name="GamePro"/> The first official game soundtrack, ''StarCraft: Game Music Vol. 1'', was released in 2000, comprising tracks from both ''StarCraft'' and ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]'', as well as a sizable portion of remix tracks and music inspired by ''StarCraft'', created by several [[South Korea]]n [[disc jockey]]s. The soundtrack was distributed by Net Vision Entertainment.<ref name="soundtrack2">{{cite web|url=http://www.game-ost.com/info.php?id=450|title=''StarCraft'': Game Music Vol. 1|publisher=Game OST|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> In September 2008, Blizzard Entertainment announced that a second soundtrack, ''StarCraft Original Soundtrack'', had been released on [[iTunes]].

Shortly before the release of ''StarCraft'', Blizzard Entertainment developed a [[shareware]] [[game demo]] campaign, entitled ''Loomings''. Comprising three missions and a tutorial, the campaign acts as a prequel to the events of ''StarCraft'', taking place on a [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Confederate]] colony in the process of being overrun by the [[Zerg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diablo3.no/starcraft/scdemo.shtml|title=''StarCraft'' - PC Demo|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://diablo3.no/starcraft/macscdemo.shtml|title=''StarCraft'' - Mac Demo|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> In October 1999, Blizzard Entertainment made the prequel available for the full game as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on [[Battle.net]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/scc/OS/precursor.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011013026/http://www.battle.net/scc/OS/precursor.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=Map Archives: Precursor Campaign|work=[[Battle.net]]|date=1999-10-13|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> In addition, the full release of ''StarCraft'' included a secondary campaign entitled ''Enslavers''. Consisting of five missions played as both the [[Races of StarCraft#Terrans|Terrans]] and the [[Races of StarCraft#Protoss|Protoss]], ''Enslavers'' is set in the second campaign in ''StarCraft'' and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg [[cerebrate]] and is pursued by both the Protoss and [[Races of StarCraft#Society|Terran Dominion]]. ''Enslavers'' acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game's [[level editor]], highlighting how to use the features of the program.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=The Campaign Editor|page=24|author=Underwood, Peter|coauthors=Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey|title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|year=1998}}</ref>

Before Insurrection, an unauthorized expansion pack, called Stellar Forces, was published by [[Micro Star]] but was recalled weeks later when Blizzard won the court case against it.

=== Nintendo 64 version ===

In 2000, ''StarCraft 64'' was released for the [[Nintendo 64]], co-developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and [[Mass Media Inc.]] The game featured all of the missions from both ''StarCraft'' and the expansion ''Brood War'', as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, ''Resurrection IV''.<ref name="GSpotN64"/> ''Resurrection IV'' is set after the conclusion of ''Brood War'', and follows [[Jim Raynor]] embarking on a mission to rescue the ''Brood War'' character [[Alexei Stukov]], a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The ''Brood War'' missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory [[Expansion Pak]] to run.<ref>{{cite web | title = ''StarCraft'' Needs Some Expansion| publisher=IGN |date = 1999-11-16| url = http://ign64.ign.com/articles/072/072204p1.html| accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref> In addition, ''StarCraft 64'' features a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative mode]], also requiring the expansion pak, allowing two players to control one force in-game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/123/123894p1.html|title=''StarCraft 64'' Preview|publisher=IGN|date=2000-06-08|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> ''StarCraft 64'' was not as popular as the PC version, and lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened.<ref name="GSpotN64"/> Despite this, the game maintained positive reviews. Blizzard Entertainment had previously considered a [[PlayStation]] port of the game, but it was decided that the game would instead be released on the Nintendo 64.<ref>{{cite web | title = ''StarCraft'' on PlayStation?| publisher=IGN|date = 1998-04-06| url = http://psx.ign.com/articles/064/064554p1.html| accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref>

The PAL version of this game is also noted amongst collectors as being one of the rarest games in the N64s library. Only being released in the PAL format in Australia and limited distribution add to its overall rarity.

Generally, ''StarCraft'' was received positively by critics, with many contemporary reviewers noting that while the game may not have deviated significantly from the status quo of most real-time strategy games, it was one of the best to have applied the formula.<ref name="GSpot"/><ref name="GamePro"/> In addition, ''StarCraft''{{'}}s pioneering use of three distinct, unique and balanced races over two equal sides was praised by critics,<ref name="ignr"/> with [[GameSpot]] commenting that this helped the game to "avoid the problem that has plagued every other game in the genre".<ref name="GSpot"/> Many critics also praised the strength of the story accompanying the game, with some reviewers being impressed by how well the story was folded into the gameplay.<ref name="ignr"/> The game's voice acting in particular was praised; GameSpot later hailed the voice work in the game as one of the ten best in the industry at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_voiceacting/page6.html|title=The Best Voice Acting in Games: ''StarCraft''|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=James|last=Cheung|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> Equally, the multiplayer aspects of the game were positively received.

Although at the time ''StarCraft''{{'}}s graphics and audio were praised by critics,<ref name="allgame"/> later reviews have noted that the graphics do not compare to more modern games.<ref name="ignr"/> The capacity for the game's [[artificial intelligence]] to navigate units to waypoints also faced some heavy criticism, with ''[[PC Zone]]'' stating that the inability for developers to make an effective pathfinding system was "the single most infuriating element of the real-time strategy genre".<ref name="PCZ"/> In addition, several reviewers expressed concern over some familiarities between the unit structures of each race, as well as over the potential imbalance of players using [[rush (computer and video games)|rushing tactics]] early in multiplayer games.<ref name="GameRev"/> Blizzard Entertainment has striven to balance rush tactics in later updates. The Nintendo 64 version of the game was not received as positively by reviewers, and was criticized for poor graphics in comparison to the PC version. However, critics did praise the game and [[THQ|Mass Media]] for using effective controls on the gamepad and maintaining the high quality audio.<ref name="GameProN64"/><ref name="GSpotN64"/><ref name="IGNN64"/>

''StarCraft'''s use of three distinct races is often credited for having revolutionized the real-time strategy genre. GameSpot described ''StarCraft'' as "the defining game of its genre.

The science fiction setting allowed students to focus on the battle tactics.
