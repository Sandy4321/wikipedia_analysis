'''[[Michael Jackson]]''' (August 29, 1958 <U+2013> June 25, 2009) was an American musician and entertainer who spent over forty years in the public eye, first as a child star with [[the Jackson 5]], and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s it became clear that Jackson's appearance was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his [[nose]], triggered widespread speculation of extensive [[Plastic surgery|cosmetic surgery]].<ref name="tara 434<U+2013>436">Taraborrelli, pp. 434<U+2013>436</ref> His skin tone also changed, becoming much lighter. Although Jackson was diagnosed with the skin disorder [[vitiligo]], it was also widely speculated that the change was due to [[Skin whitening|skin bleaching]].<ref name="tara 434<U+2013>436"/>

Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their [[Joseph Jackson (manager)|father]]. In 2003, his father admitted to whipping them as children.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8121599.stm Can Michael Jackson's demons be explained?], [[BBC News]], June 27, 2009.</ref> The experience deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he suffered from [[body dysmorphic disorder]].<ref name=Posner>Posner, Gerald.

At some point during the 1990s, it appeared that Jackson had become dependent on [[Pharmaceutical drug|prescription drugs]], mainly [[Analgesic|painkillers]] and strong [[sedative]]s. The drug use was later linked to [[Burn|second and third degree burns]] he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life he gradually became dependent on these drugs and his health deteriorated. He went into [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|in 1993]] with the help of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Elton John]].<ref name = "campbell (1995) 89-93"/>

While preparing for a series of [[This Is It (concerts)|comeback concerts]] scheduled to begin in July 2009, [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson died]] of acute [[propofol]] and [[benzodiazepine]] intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. [[Trial of Conrad Murray|His personal physician]] was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.

==Skin color==

[[File:Michael Jackson gives autograph - supercropped.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jackson in 1988, in the early stages of his skin transformation]]
Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color throughout his youth, but, starting in the mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew more pale through what was widely considered to be [[Skin whitening|skin bleaching]] and changing of his features to appear European. According to Jackson biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], Jackson began making his nose smaller around the same time his skin became very gradually lighter and that he was using the over-the-counter skin-bleaching cream called Porcelana to achieve the lighter skin.  Taraborrelli reported that Jackson's sister La Toya used Porcelana too, and that they had crates of this cream stored at their family home Hayvenhurst, "hoarding it as the most valuable beauty product ever produced."<ref>MICHAEL JACKSON: The Magic, the Madness, the Whole Story, 1958-2009 by J. Randy Taraborrelli, pg 351</ref> Jackson's physical changes gained widespread media coverage,<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"/> and provoked criticism from the public. African American psychologists  argued Jackson was "a lousy role model for black youth". Dr. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson gave "black youth a feeling that they can achieve", but also ''may encourage some people to think they've got to be esoteric and idiosyncratic'' to be successful. It was also presumed that Jackson bleached his skin just to boost his career. Dr. Halford Fairchild stated Jackson and other African American celebrities would try "to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television".<ref>Hodges, Sam. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-09-24/lifestyle/0150070155_1_janet-jackson-black-psychologists-michael-jackson], ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', September 24, 1987. Retrieved February 4, 2014</ref>

According to Taraborrelli, in 1986, Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]], which Tarraborrelli noted was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years.<ref name="tara 434<U+2013>436"/> However, skin bleaching is not the only suspected cause of vitiligo which is a rare non-contagious disease. The causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental causes are suspected. Between 1% and 2% of the worldwide population are considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches, and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.<ref>http://pearlgrimesmd.com/pigmentation-disorders</ref> While the disorder cannot be cured, the progression of the patches can be stopped.<ref>http://www.avrf.org/facts/facts.htm</ref>

New York plastic surgeon Dr. Pamela Lipkin, who has never treated Jackson or reviewed his medical records, said, "when you look at the other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger."<ref>{{cite web|author=Page 2 of 2 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Cosmetic/story?id=131910&page=2#.T2YcndmjSSo |title=Page 2: Surgeon: Michael Jackson A 'Nasal Cripple' - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2003-02-08 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

When producer [[Quincy Jones]] who worked closely with Jackson at the time Jackson's skin transformation began, was asked about Jackson's facial transformation he stated: "It's ridiculous, man! Chemical peels and all of it. And I don't understand it. But he obviously didn't want to be black...You see his kids?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordinier |first=Jeff |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/men-of-the-moment/200907/wiseguy-music-producer-quincy-jones-on-michael-jackson#ixzz2CbkQMBhJ |title=Wiseguy Music Producer Quincy Jones on Michael Jackson: Men of the Moment |publisher=Details |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

According to the affidavit of Sergeant Deborah Linden found by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reporter [[Maureen Orth]] in the [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]] courthouse complex, Jackson told his maid Blanca Francia "that he bleaches his skin because he does not like being black and he feels that blacks are not liked as much as people of other races." Orth was also informed that Jackson referred to blacks using unique names like "spabooks."<ref>{{cite web|last=Orth |first=Maureen |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2003/04/orth200304 |title=Losing His Grip |publisher=Vanity Fair |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

However, Jackson wrote a letter to photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [<U+2026>] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can<U+2019>t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/music-icons/michael-jackson-16.html |title=Michael Jackson handwritten letter regarding "Moonwalker" |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

In 1993, Jackson told [[Oprah Winfrey]] "there, as I know of, there is no such thing as skin bleaching.  I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." It was in this interview that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused, though he also said he used makeup to even out the uneven skin tone.  "It is something I cannot help," explained Jackson. "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that."<ref>http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprah-Reflects-on-Her-Interview-with-Michael-Jackson/3</ref>  Jackson had also publicly stated that he was proud to be black.<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-what-went-wrong-20090730</ref> Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62&nbsp;million Americans.<ref>{{cite news | title=Thriller for Diane Sawyer: Interview with Jackson Two |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/05/18/1995-05-18_thriller_for_diane_sawyer__i.html |date=May 18, 1995|work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=Jul 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16">Campbell (1995), pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref><ref name = "lewis 165-168">Lewis pp. 165<U+2013>168</ref><ref name="george pp. 45-46">George, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref><ref name = "brisbane on vitiligo">[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2007/12/18/1197740229199.html 'I'm a black man turning white on television'"], ''BrisbaneTimes'', December 18, 2007</ref>

Taraborrelli also stated that Jackson was diagnosed with [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin and the lupus was in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur.<ref name="tara 434<U+2013>436"/> Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus,  but it confirmed that he had vitiligo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/jackson,%20michael_report.pdf |title=Autopsy Report for Michael Jackson |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref> His skin was found to have a reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/michael-jackson-autopsy-report |title=Michael Jackson Autopsy Report |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

To treat these conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, [[Tretinoin]], and Benoquin.<ref name = "tara 434<U+2013>436"/> On June 29, 2009, multiple tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone were found in Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo get to the point where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale.<ref>Anthony McCartney,</ref> On the other hand getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult.<ref name="news.google.com">Rebecca Howard, Gadsden Times,Michael Jackson's skin condition destroys pigment, http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19930215&id=Xr4fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RtgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1295,1897473,February 15, 1993</ref> Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun.<ref>http://www.avrf.org/treatments/medical.htm</ref> Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract [[melanoma]].

I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him."<ref>{{cite news|journal=''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=13 September 2012|title=Michael Jackson Remembered: Stevie Nicks on the Ultimate Showman|date=9 July 2009|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-remembered-stevie-nicks-on-the-ultimate-showman-20090709}}</ref>
Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [[Remember the Time#Music video|Remember the Time]] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians.<ref>name="Bush">Bush, Michael. ''The King Of Style''. Insight Editions, 2012, p. 146.</ref> Jackson usually didn't wear patterned clothing in order to avoid attention to the disorder.<ref>name="Bush", p. 40.</ref>

Vitiligo occurs in three different patterns.

In 1996, during the Australian leg of the [[HIStory World Tour]], Jackson married his [[Dermatology|dermatologist]]'s nurse, [[Deborah Jeanne Rowe|Debbie Rowe]].<ref name="taraborrelli pp. 580-581">Taraborrelli, pp. 580<U+2013>581</ref><ref name="taraborrelli p. 597">Taraborrelli, p. 597</ref> The pair first met in the mid-1980s, when Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo.

==Cosmetic procedures and diet==
[[File:Michael Jackson Cannes.jpg|thumb|180px|Jackson at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Over time, Jackson's facial structure changed as well. Surgeons speculated he also had a [[rhinoplasty]], a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a [[Cleft chin|cleft]] put in his chin.<ref name="ABCNews">{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Cosmetic/story?id=131910&page=1 |title=Surgeon: Michael Jackson A 'Nasal Cripple' |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 8, 2003 |accessdate=Nov 11, 2006 }}</ref> Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures.<ref name="tara 434<U+2013>436"/> According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first [[rhinoplasty]] after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to [[Steven Hoefflin]], who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210">Taraborrelli, pp. 205<U+2013>210</ref> [[Katherine Jackson]], though, has said in a recent interview that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin.

In his book, Jackson attributed the changes in the structure of his face to [[puberty]], a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting.<ref name = "jackson 229-230"/> Jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes.<ref name="jackson p. 256">Jackson, p. 256</ref> By 1990, the full extent of Jackson's surgery was widely debated; those close to him estimated he had undergone ten operations on his face up to this point.<ref name = "tara 434<U+2013>436"/> In June 1992, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' ran a full front-page picture, allegedly of Jackson's face, which they described as "hideously disfigured" by plastic surgery. Jackson sued the tabloid, and, in 1998, they agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Jackson. At the High Court, the paper's former editor acknowledged that after meeting Jackson in person, he believed that Jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred at all. A ''Daily Mirror'' solicitor maintained that the publication did not tamper with the picture.<ref name="BBCNews">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/210759.stm|title=Mirror says sorry for Jackson libel |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 1998 |accessdate=Jul 29, 2008 }}</ref>

Media reports stated that Jackson's autopsy reported one scar beside each of his nostrils,  one scar behind each of his ears, and two scars on his neck, "probably" from cosmetic surgery,<ref>http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2009/10/ap_autopsy_shocker_michael_jac.html</ref> plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline).<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/6252204/Michael-Jackson-autopsy-reveals-tattooed-eyes-lips-and-scalp.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Michael Jackson autopsy reveals tattooed eyes, lips and scalp | date=October 1, 2009}}</ref>

In the unedited version of the documentary ''Living With Michael Jackson'', which was shown in court in 2005, Jackson said he had two procedures on his nose so that he could breathe better.<ref>Nick Madigan, The New York Times, http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4DC1030F931A25756C0A9639C8B63,May 12,2005,</ref> When he was asked about his cheeks, Jackson answered: "These cheekbones? No. My father has the same thing. We have Indian blood."<ref>Aphrodite Jones, Michael Jackson Conspiracy, 2007, p. 266</ref>

On the last day of the trial in 2005, the media used specific angles and lighting to accentuate Jackson's nose, as well as his cheeks and his skin tone.<ref>Aphrodite Jones, Michael Jackson Conspiracy , Edition 2007 p. 6</ref>

==Health concerns==
Over the years Jackson had various medical problems that were covered by the media. In early 1984, Jackson was treated for scalp burns; his hair had caught fire during a shooting for a commercial.<ref>The Evening standard, People Magazine, http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19840206&id=ebhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mVkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6185,1341121, February 6, 1984</ref>

Various concerts were cancelled owing to illness and a remaining tour was called off due to addiction. 
On March 12, 1988, Jackson cancelled a show in [[St. Louis]] which was rescheduled for March 14; on March 13, Jackson performed in St. Louis although he was fighting a cold.

Dr. Christopher Rogers testified in the trial against Dr. Conrad Murray that, in his opinion, Jackson "was healthier than the average person of his age." <ref>http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=8387361</ref> Rogers said the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual.<ref name="news.sky.com">http://news.sky.com/story/890744/jackson-trial-pathologist-death-was-homicide</ref>

===Childhood and mental health===
Another publicly discussed aspect of Jackson's private life is his childhood particularly his relationship with his father.
Jackson and [[Jackson family|some of his siblings]] stated that they were physically and mentally abused by their father [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]] from a young age, through incessant rehearsals, whippings and the use of derogatory names such as "big nose" for Michael; this abuse had affected Michael throughout his life.<ref name="MJ's secret childhood">{{cite web  |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=Jun 20, 2008}}</ref> In one altercation<U+2014>later recalled by [[Marlon Jackson]]<U+2014>Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and "pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks".<ref name = "tara 20-22">Taraborrelli, pp. 20<U+2013>22</ref> Joseph would often trip the boys or push them into walls.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/>

One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/> By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home."<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 206</ref>

Although it had been reported for a number of years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness.<ref name="campbell (1995) 14-16"/><ref name="lewis 165-168"/><ref name="george pp. 45-46"/> In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitate]]. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me... But I do love him."<ref name="taraborrelli p. 620">Taraborrelli, p. 620</ref> In Jackson's other high profile interview ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/>

Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad."<ref name="taraborreli p. 602">Taraborrelli, p. 602</ref> In 2003, the singer was accused of [[child sexual abuse]] and was [[People v. Jackson|acquitted two years later]]. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was examined by Stan Katz, a [[mental health]] professional, who spent several hours with the accuser as well. According to [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old.<ref name="taraborreli p. 648">Taraborrelli, p. 648</ref> Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that the singer also had [[body dysmorphic disorder]], a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.<ref name = "tara 434<U+2013>436"/>

===Weight and drug addiction===
The changes to his face were, in part, due to periods of significant weight loss.<ref name="taraborreli pp.138-144">Taraborrelli, pp. 138<U+2013>144</ref> Jackson became slimmer in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a dancer's body".<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210"/> By 1984, Jackson had lost {{Convert|20|lb|kg}}, bringing his weight to {{Convert|105|lb|kg}} on a 5-foot 9 (1.75 m) frame, the slimmest he had ever been as an adult.<ref name = "tara 312<U+2013>313">Taraborrelli, pp. 312<U+2013>313</ref> Witnesses reported that Jackson was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name = "tara 312<U+2013>313"/> Following [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|accusations of child molestation in 1993]], Jackson stopped eating, losing even more weight.<ref name = "tara 514-516">Taraborrelli, pp. 514<U+2013>516</ref>

In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident was caused by a stress-related [[panic attack]],<ref name="taraborreli pp. 576-577">Taraborrelli, pp. 576<U+2013>577</ref> while medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities.<ref name="Irregular heartbeat may  have caused Jackson's collapse">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9512/michael_jackson/12-08/index.html |title=v |publisher=CNN |date=Dec 8, 1995|accessdate=Feb 23, 2010}}</ref> In none of these hospitalizations, including this one, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system.<ref name="Rock Hill doctor helped saved Michael Jackson's life after 1995 rehearsal collapse ">{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/heraldonline/access/1779090271.html?dids=1779090271:1779090271&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+8%2C+2009&author=Anonymous&pub=Herald&edition=&startpage=n%2Fa&desc=Rock+Hill+doctor+helped+saved+Michael+Jackson%27s+life+after+1995+rehearsal+collapse |title=v |publisher=HeraldOnline |date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=Feb 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref name="Rock Hill doctor helped saved Michael Jackson's life after 1995 rehearsal collapse (free version)">{{cite web |url=http://prince.org/msg/8/313283?&pg=19 |title=v |publisher=HeraldOnline |date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=Feb 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[BBC]] reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss.<ref name="Michael Jackson health concerns">{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Davis |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4612897.stm |title=Michael Jackson health concerns |publisher=BBC |date=June 6, 2005|accessdate=Apr 14, 2008}}</ref>

A biographer states that in 1993, the entertainer admitted taking [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] to deal with the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him,<ref name = "tara 518<U+2013>520">Taraborrelli, pp. 518<U+2013>520</ref> while Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers actually were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984.<ref>http://"Michael Jackson Ends Tour, Citing Addiction", ''The New York Times'' November 14, 1993, www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/michael-jackson-ends-tour-citing-addiction.html, Retrieved on March 21, 2014</ref> A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately {{convert|10|lb|kg}} in weight and had stopped eating.<ref name="tara 514-516"/> In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with. It took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums.<ref name = "campbell 96-97">Campbell (1995), pp. 96<U+2013>97</ref>

Jackson also stated during the 1993 interview that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. In January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended to be part of one of many being filmed. He sustained [[second-degree burns]] to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first in order to deal with the intense pain.

On November 8, and November 10, 1993, Jackson was questioned about a copyright matter. According to the sworn declaration from the plaintiffs' lawyer, he had been told that Jackson "was taking painkillers because of recent oral surgery."

In November 1993, Jackson announced that he was addicted to painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. Jackson said due to the pressure caused by the child molestation allegations, and the energy he needed for the ''Dangerous Tour'' he was "physically and emotionally exhausted". He said he had "become increasingly more dependent on painkillers", and would seek treatment.<ref>Ernest Sander, Kentucky New Era, Dangerous Tour canceled by Jackson's drug addiction, http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tY5KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iYYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6690,3371887&dq=michael+jackson+tour+cancelled&hl=en, November 13, 1993</ref> His lawyers said, Jackson would be treated for addiction overseas for one and a half months to two months.<ref>Jessica Crosby & William Hamilton, The Washington Post, Jackson treated overseas for addiction, November 16, 1993</ref> In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States.<ref>William Hamilton, Michael Jackson back in U.S. to face charges, The Washington Post, http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8577853.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Dec+14%2C+1993&author=Hamilton%2C+William&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=C1&desc=Michael+Jackson+back+in+U.S.+to+face+charges, December 14, 1993</ref>

Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and flew with friends [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and her husband to London. When the singer arrived at the airport, he had to be held up by his two friends; he was then rushed to the home of [[Elton John]]'s manager and then to a clinic.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 89-93">Campbell (1995), pp. 89<U+2013>93</ref><ref name = "tara 524-528"/> He was searched for drugs on entry; vials of medicine were found in a suitcase.

In an interview with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated that he would have known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have [[insomnia]] and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.<ref>http://investigation.discovery.com/tv-shows/true-crime-with-aphrodite-jones/videos/true-crime-with-aphrodite-jones-michael-jacksons-drug-use.htm</ref><ref><iframe id="dit-video-embed" width="640" height="360" src="http://static.discoverymedia.com/videos/components/ids/de9ea24bcc600531739d9828199221e0ee43f615/snag-it-player.html?auto=no" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></ref>

Jackson was 5&nbsp;ft. 9in and weighed 136&nbsp;lbs, which would be within a normal weight range, although he was thin, Dr. Rogers testified in court.<ref name="news.sky.com"/> According to his costumer Michael Bush, Jackson lost so much weight during a concert due to loss of water that the costumes Jackson wore at the end of the show had to be smaller than those he wore at the beginning of the show; usually, he was a 28-inch waist.<ref>Sandy Cohen, Michael Jackson's longtime costumer unveils book, http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_21198453/michael-jacksons-longtime-costumer-unveils-book, july 31, 2012</ref> 
According to Dr. Nader Kamangar, a sleeping expert at UCLA drugs such as Demerol can cause insomnia. In the case of Jackson, insomnia could have been caused by "anxiety for performing" as well.<ref>Alan Duke, 'Perfect storm' of drugs killed Michael Jackson, sleep expert says, http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/13/justice/california-conrad-murray-trial, october 14, 2011</ref>

Following Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, stated that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases, such as "Omar Arnold," "Josephine Baker," "Fernand Diaz," "Paul Farance," "Peter Madonie," "Faheem Muhammad," "Roselyn Muhammad," "Blanca Nicholas," "Jimmy Nicholas," "Bryan Singleton," "Frank Tyson," and "Rob Kaufman" while prescribing medications for Jackson.

Due to an enquiry about a cancellation insurance for the upcoming tour, insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted. In February 2009, Jackson had an examination performed by Dr. David Slavit of New York. Later, the broker told an AEG senior vice president Jackson had only slight hay fever and had passed the exam "with flying colors". A second medical exam was supposed to take place on July 6, 2009.<ref>Witness: Michael Jackson passed medical exam 'with flying colors, Corina Knoll, http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-michael-jackson-medical-exam-20130522,0,2369606.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lanowblog+%28L.A.+Now%29 May 22, 2013</ref>

According to Lee, she received a frantic call on June 21, 2009 from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill.

After his death, the autopsy report revealed that Jackson had a strong heart and was a "fairly healthy" 50-year-old.
