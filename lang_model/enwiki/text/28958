The '''Wicked Witch of the East''' is a character in the fictional ''[[Land of Oz]]'' created by [[United States|American]] author [[L. Frank Baum]] in his ''Oz'' series of books.<ref>[[Jack Snow (writer)|Jack Snow]], ''Who's Who in Oz'', Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 236.</ref> The Witch was the ruler of [[Munchkin Country]], and the original owner of the magical silver shoes, before her death when she was crushed by Dorothy's falling house. For her political role, see [[Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Political interpretations of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'']]. 

==The classic books==
In ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (the first of many [[The Oz Books|Oz books]]), [[Dorothy Gale]] is blown into Oz by a tornado.  The young girl's house lands on top of The Witch.  The Witch, who had been ruling over the [[Munchkins]], is killed instantly with only her feet sticking out from under the house.  The Witch was wearing magical shoes (made of [[silver]]) at the time of her death.  Dorothy, on the advice of The [[Good Witch of the North]], takes the shoes. These shoes have the power to transport anyone anywhere, simply by knocking the heels together three times and giving them the command where to go. Not knowing this, Dorothy travels to see the famous ruler of the [[Emerald City]], [[Wizard (Oz)|The Wizard]], to ask for his help in trying to return to her [[Kansas]] farm. In the novel, The Wicked Witch of the East is also responsible for the creation of the [[Tin Woodman]] and, in flashbacks in ''[[The Tin Woodman of Oz]]'', the [[Captain Fyter|Tin Soldier]], who each had their blades enchanted to prevent them from marrying the Witch's maid.

==Modern works==
In [[Alexander Melentyevich Volkov]]'s ''[[The Wizard of the Emerald City]]'', The Witch's name is Gingema. Like in the 1939 movie, the two Wicked Witches are sisters.  In Magic Land, she is summoning a magical hurricane to destroy all humanity. However,  the Good Witch of the North  learns of her schemes, and changes the spell to only affect one house and drop it on Gingema's head. Unlike in Baum's books, while being the formal ruler of the Munchkins, she interfered little in their lives, and only demanded that people collect food for her. Since her food was snakes, leeches, spiders, and other similarly disgusting creatures which the Munchkins were afraid of, that was nevertheless a heavy burden for them.

In the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]], ''[[The Wiz]]'', The Wicked Witch of the East is named Evvamene ("Ever mean") and terrorizes the Munchkins.

In the more recent novel, ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' by author [[Gregory Maguire]], The Wicked Witch of the East is known as [[Nessarose]] and is born unable to walk and without arms <U+2014> she is later able to walk however, by the use of the well-known shoes. Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] whose name is  [[Elphaba]], had been waiting for the shoes for seven years.  In ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] based on Maguire's novel, Nessarose is unable to walk and uses a [[wheelchair]].  In both the book and musical, the character is portrayed in a less negative light than in the Baum books or earlier movie, though it portrays her as becoming fanatical, so much so that she limits the rights of the munchkins and degenerates into 'witch'. In the musical (where she was originally portrayed by [[Michelle Federer]]), this tyranny stems from her love of a Munchkin named [[Boq]], with whom she had fallen in love after [[Glinda]] persuaded him to take Nessa to the Ozdust Ballroom (in order to get him away from herself). In order to keep Boq from leaving her for Glinda, Nessa enforces several strict laws on the Munchkins in order to keep her love around her. Even after Elphaba enchants her ruby slippers so she can walk, Boq is still fixated on Glinda, and Nessa accidentally causes his heart to shrink when attempting to make him 'lose your heart to me'. Elphaba is forced to turn Boq into the Tin Woodsman to keep him alive, and Nessa laments her status as 'The Wicked Witch of the East'.

In [[Roger S. Baum]]'s ''[[Lion of Oz and the Badge of Courage]]'', the Wicked Witch of the East is the main antagonist. The book was adapted into the 2000 animated film ''[[Lion of Oz]]''. In the movie [[Lion of Oz]] she was voiced by [[Lynn Redgrave]].

In 2007, [[Turner Entertainment]] collaborated with [[Madame Alexander]] to create a series of [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] toys centered on the main characters from the 1939 movie, one of which was the Wicked Witch of the East. She is depicted as having blonde hair, a red shirt with a green belt and a burgundy dress over her distinguishable striped stockings and ruby slippers. She also is wearing a hat similar to the [[Wicked Witch of the West|Witch of the West]]'s, although it is colored red.

In ''[[The Muppet's Wizard of Oz]]'', the Wicked Witch of the East is played by Miss Piggy (as are all of the other witches/fairies). She manages to lift the house long enough to threaten the Munchkins before it falls back on top of her, killing her this time.
