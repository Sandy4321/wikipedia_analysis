* '''Birdtown''' - Southeastern corner of Lakewood, a well-known 8-street residential district on the southeast side of the city that was built specifically for the workers of the nearby Union Carbide company in the 1890s. The houses are distinctive and most of the streets are named after birds. Birdtown was recently designated a National Register Historic District. Located adjacent to Madison Park, the former Union Carbide factory, and the W. 117th St. Rapid Transit Station. Many of the original houses built there were boarding houses.  Birdtown achieved National Historic Register status in 2006.

* '''Clifton Boulevard''' - Lined with big trees and multi-family homes, apartment complexes, and 4x4 brick structures, the 7-lane Clifton Boulevard is one of the busiest streets in Lakewood.

* '''Clifton Park''' - The wealthiest neighborhood of Lakewood is situated in the northwestern corner of the city, and consists mostly of magnificent Victorian mansions. Bounded by Sloane on the south, West Clifton on the east, The Rocky River on the west, and Lake Erie on the north. Built in the late 19th century, this area has been historically and continues to be the home to many of greater Cleveland's most prominent citizens. Includes the private Clifton Beach community.

* '''Downtown Lakewood''' - The main section of Lakewood is centered at Detroit Avenue and Warren Road. This district is lined with office buildings, restaurants, and variety shops. Lakewood Library, the [[USPS]], Lakewood Hospital, and Lakewood City Schools are all located in this district.

* '''West End''' - The West End is the westernmost neighborhood of Lakewood, along the Rocky River Reservation. There was a proposal to create a lifestyle center here in 2004, but after a controversial Mike Wallace "60 Minutes" segment critical of the City's attempts to use eminent domain, residents voted against it by a handful of votes.

* Lakewood's nickname "City of Beautiful Homes" is due to the fact the city was intentially designed in the early 1900s with a lack of industry and an emphasis on a diverse variety of residential housing structures including many large tudors mainly near the lakeshore, and multi-family and smaller single family homes in many other sections of the city.
