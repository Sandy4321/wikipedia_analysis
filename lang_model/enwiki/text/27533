'''''Rainbow Six''''' is the first in a [[Rainbow Six|series]] of [[first-person shooter]]s [[computer game|computer]] and [[video game]]s. It was [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] for the [[Personal computer|PC]] in 1998. It was later ported to [[Mac OS]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[PlayStation]],[[Sega Dreamcast]] and [[Game Boy Color]]. 

The concept of the game was developed in part by [[Tom Clancy]], who soon began writing a [[Rainbow Six (book)|book of the same name]] for his [[John_Clark_(Tom_Clancy_character)|John Clark]] series of novels. The game's development team coordinated their efforts with Tom Clancy and much of the game corresponds to the book and vice versa, however, the endings differ because the game was completed first. The game is a [[tactical shooter]], which focuses more on stealth and tactics than on sheer firepower. [[Terrorism|Terrorists]] (or "Tangos") can be dispatched with 1 or 2 shots, as can the player, or any of his/her teammates.

Before each mission is a planning stage, where the player is given a briefing. and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform. Then, the player gives orders that each team will follow during the mission.

In the mission itself, the player takes control of one team leader, and can see their plan of action on their [[Head-Up Display]]. The teams not under player control follow the orders given to them in the planning stage. The player can take control of any living team leader.

The game forms a campaign, that is a series of scenarios, with the plot being advanced in the mission briefing of each scenario. Any casualties that occur during a mission are permanent, so the deceased cannot be used in future missions. However, the player has the ability to "rewind" to retry a [[pyrrhic victory|successful but disastrous]] mission.

Online multiplayer gaming was popular on the Mplayer.com and Zone.com services and for a time featured a thriving competitive clan based community. In the R6 era, clans like FSF(Freelance Special Forces) pioneered many of today's "competitive online gaming" cliches.
