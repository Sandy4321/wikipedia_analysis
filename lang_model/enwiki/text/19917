===Florida Championship Wrestling (2007<U+2013> 2009)===
Terrell debuted in FCW alongside Beverly Mullins, and they competed in various matches together, including lingerie matches. Soon afterward, Terrell and Mullins drifted apart, leading to Terrell receiving a larger singles wrestling role as she competed against various other FCW Divas, including Mullins (now renamed to Wesley Holiday), Miss Angela, [[The Bella Twins]], [[Alicia Fox]], and [[Rosa Mendes|Roucka]]. Terrell also started a [[sorority]] member gimmick and aligned herself with Brad Allen and [[Nick Nemeth|Nic Nemeth]]. Terrell made her FCW television debut when she competed in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest which ended in a no contest. Since then, she and Angela have been the ring announcers for FCW. Later on, Terrell lost her first FCW televised match in a fatal four-way match including Roucka, Wesley Holiday, and Alicia Fox after Fox [[dropkick]]ed her from the turnbuckle as Terrell was attempting [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|an aerial move]]. She then teamed with [[The Bella Twins|Nikki Bella]] and [[Eve Torres]] on the December 14 edition of FCW to take on Roucka, Wesley Holiday, and Alicia Fox, which Terrell's team won after Eve pinned Holiday as the remaining Divas fought on the outside. In the beginning of the first-ever Queen of FCW tournament, Terrell defeated Wesley Holiday in the first round before losing to Alicia Fox in the semi-finals. Since then Terrell has appeared various other times as an announcer and wrestler. She teamed up with Angela Fong various times as well as competed against [[Serena Deeb|Serena Mancini]], [[Miss April (wrestler)|April Lee]], and [[Alicia Fox]] in a Four Pack challenge, to crown the new number one contender for the Queen Of FCW Crown, but came out short after being thrown out of the ring. Tiffany wrestled against the newly crowned Serena Mancini and injured her humerus bone, on the September 24, 2009 taping of FCW.

In late June 2009, Tiffany was "promoted" to full-time General Manager of ECW. However, Tiffany was absent from [[television]] due to a [[car accident]] with [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] substituting as ECW General Manager.
