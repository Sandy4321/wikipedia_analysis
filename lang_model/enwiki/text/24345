'''Zinc''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>z<U+026A><U+014B>k}}, from {{lang-de|Zink}} and also known as '''spelter''') is a [[metal]]lic [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Zn''' and [[atomic number]] 30. It is a first-row [[transition metal]] in [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]].  Zinc is chemically similar to [[magnesium]] because its [[ion]] is of similar size and its only common [[oxidation state]] is +2.  Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has five stable [[isotope]]s. The most exploited zinc [[ore]] is [[sphalerite]], or [[zinc sulfide]]; the largest exploitable deposits are found in Australia, Canada and the United States. Zinc production includes [[froth flotation]] of the ore, [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and final [[extractive metallurgy|extraction]] using electricity.

[[Brass]], which is an [[alloy]] of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC. Impure zinc metal was not produced in large scale until the 13th century in [[India]], while the metal was unknown to [[Europe]] until the end of the 16th century. [[alchemy|Alchemists]] burned zinc in air to form what they called "philosopher's wool" or "white snow." The element was probably named by the alchemist [[Paracelsus]] after the German word ''Zinke''.  German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] is normally given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment.  Work by [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Alessandro Volta]] uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. [[Corrosion]]-resistant [[galvanization|zinc plating]] of steel is the major application for zinc.  Other applications are in batteries and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as [[zinc chloride]] (in deodorants), [[zinc pyrithione]] (anti-[[dandruff]] [[shampoo]]s), [[zinc sulfide]] (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or [[zinc diethyl]] in the organic laboratory.

===Reactivity===

Zinc has an [[electron configuration]] of [Ar]3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup> and is a member of the [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong [[reducing agent]].<ref name=CRC2006p8-29>{{harvnb|CRC|2006|pp='''8'''-29}}</ref> The surface of the pure metal [[tarnish]]es quickly, eventually forming a protective [[passivation|passivating]] layer of the basic [[Hydrozincite|zinc carbonate]], Zn<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, by reaction with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite book | publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 |  page=121 | isbn=0-8247-9213-0 | title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys| first=Frank C. | last=Porter }}</ref> This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]].

===Isolation of the pure element===

The isolation of metallic zinc in the West may have been achieved independently by several people.

Flemish metallurgist [[P.M. de Respour]] reported that he extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668.<ref name="Emsley2001p502"/>  By the turn of the century, [[<U+00C9>tienne Fran<U+00E7>ois Geoffroy]] described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore being smelted.<ref name="Emsley2001p502"/> In Britain, [[John Lane (metallurgist)|John Lane]] is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at [[Landore]], prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=R.

German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]] normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc even though Swedish chemist [[Anton von Swab]] distilled zinc from calamine four years before.<ref name="iza" /> In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal.<ref name="Weeks1933p21"/>  This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.<ref>{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=122}}</ref>

===Later work===
William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for [[calcining]] [[zinc sulfide]] into an oxide usable in the retort process.<ref name="Lehto1968p822"/> Prior to this only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, [[Johann Christian Ruberg]] improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gray | fist = Leon | title = Zinc | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7614-1922-5 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish  | page = 8}}</ref> Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium, which processed even more zinc.<ref name="iza" />

Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A [[coordinate covalent bond]] is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a [[hydrophobic]] pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.<ref name="Greenwood1997p1224<U+2014>1225"/>

===Other proteins===
Zinc serves a purely structural role in [[zinc finger]]s, twists and clusters.<ref name="Cotton1997p628">{{harvnb|Cotton|1997|p=628}}</ref> Zinc fingers form parts of some [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that recognize [[DNA sequence|DNA base sequences]] during the replication and transcription of [[DNA]]. Each of the nine or ten Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger's structure by coordinately binding to four [[amino acid]]s in the transcription factor.<ref name="Greenwood1997p1225"/> The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence.

[[File:Zinc finger rendered.png|thumb|left|100px|[[Zinc finger]]s help read DNA sequences]]
In [[blood plasma]], zinc is bound to and transported by [[albumin]] (60 %, low-affinity) and [[transferrin]] (10%).<ref name=Rink2000/> Since transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice-versa.

=== Dietary intake ===
[[Image:Foodstuff-containing-Zinc.jpg|thumb|upright|Foods and spices that contain zinc]]
In the U.S., the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (RDA) is 8 mg/day for women and 11 mg/day for men.<ref name=NRC2000p442>{{harvnb|NRC|2000|p=442}}</ref> Median intake in the U.S. around 2000 was 9&nbsp;mg/day for women and 14&nbsp;mg/day in men.<ref name=NRC2000p442/> Red meats, especially beef, lamb and liver have some of the highest concentrations of zinc in food.<ref name=Berdanier2007/><!-- page 195 --> 

The concentration of zinc in plants varies based on levels of the element in soil. When there is adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard).<ref name=Ensminger1993>{{cite book|last=Ensminger|first=Audrey H.|coauthors=Konlande, James E.|title=Foods & Nutrition Encyclopedia|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|date=1993|edition=2nd|pages=2368<U+2014>2369|isbn=0849389801|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C}}</ref> Zinc is also found in beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and [[blackcurrant]].<ref name="USDA_Zn">{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w309.pdf |title=  Zinc content of selected foods per common measure | accessdate = 2007-12-06 | format = PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work = USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20 }}</ref> [[Soil conservation]] is needed to make sure that [[crop rotation]] will not deplete the zinc in soil.

Other sources include [[food fortification|fortified food]] and [[dietary supplement]]s, which come in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body.<ref name=Allen1998/> This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts.<ref name=Allen1998>{{cite journal |first = Lindsay H. | last = Allen | title = Zinc and micronutrient supplements for children | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 68 |issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 495S<U+2013>498S | year = 1998 |month = August | pmid=9701167 |doi= | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/68/2/495S }}</ref> However, harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent, and should probably not exceed 20&nbsp;mg/day in healthy people,<ref>{{cite journal |last =Maret | first = W. | coauthor = Sandstead H.

===Deficiency===
{{main|Zinc deficiency}}

Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, but can be associated with [[malabsorption]], [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses.<ref name=Prasad2003/> Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse.<ref name=NRC2000p442/> Clinical outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, host defense properties, defects in carbohydrate utilization, and reproductive teratogenesis.<ref name=NRC2000p447>{{harvnb|NRC|2000|p=447}}</ref> Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ibs | first=K.

Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, vegetarians, and those with renal insufficiency. There is a paucity of adequate zinc [[biomarker]]s, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor [[sensitivity and specificity]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hambidge | first=M. | title=Biomarkers of trace mineral intake and status | journal=Journal of Nutrition | volume=133 Suppl 3 | pages=948S<U+2013>955S | year=2003 | month=March | pmid=12612181 | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12612181 }}</ref> Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.<ref name=Hambridge2007/>

Zinc deficiency is plants' most common crop micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient [[soil]] is [[cultivation|cultivated]] in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas.<ref name=Broadley2007/> Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.<ref name=Broadley2007/>

==Precautions==
===Toxicity===
Even though zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.<ref name=Fosmire1990/> The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Contaminant Hazard Reviews | date = April 1993 | issue = 10 | title = Zinc Hazard to Fish, Wildlife, and Invertebrates: A Synoptic Review | last = Eisler | first = Ronald | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service | location = Laurel, Maryland | format = PDF | url = http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/infobase/eisler/chr_26_zinc.pdf}}</ref> The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just [[mole (unit)|micromolar]] amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all ''[[Daphnia]]'' in water.<ref>{{cite journal | title=  Mechanisms of chronic waterborne Zn toxicity in Daphnia magna | first  = Brita, T. A.  | last =  Muyssen  | coauthors = De Schamphelaere, Karel A.

The free zinc ion is a powerful [[Lewis acid]] up to the point of being [[corrosive]]. Stomach acid contains [[hydrochloric acid]], in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive [[zinc chloride]]. Swallowing a post-1982 American one [[Cent (United States coin)|cent]] piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining due to the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Chronic Ingestion of a Zinc-Based Penny | first=Dawn N. | last=Bothwell | coauthors=Mair, Eric A.;  Cable, Benjamin B. | journal=Pediatrics  | volume=111 | issue=3 | pages=689<U+2013>691 | year=2003 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/111/3/689 | doi=10.1542/peds.111.3.689 | pmid=12612262 }}</ref> 

There is evidence of induced [[copper deficiency]] at low intakes of 100<U+2013>300&nbsp;mg Zn/d; a recent trial had higher hospitalizations among elderly men taking 80&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson AR, Munoz A, Gottlieb JL, Jarrard DF |title=High dose zinc increases hospital admissions due to genitourinary complications |journal=J.

===Poisoning===
In 1983, the [[United States Mint]] began minting [[Cent (United States coin)|pennies]] coated in copper but made primarily of zinc. With the new zinc pennies, there is the potential for zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1&nbsp;kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis, while another patient, who ingested 12&nbsp;grams of zinc, only showed [[lethargy]] and [[ataxia]] (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements).<ref>{{cite journal

Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body.
