'''The Tower at Cityplace ''' is a 42-story building located at 2711 North Haskell Avenue at [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|North Central Expressway]] ([[U.S. Route 75|US 75]]) in the [[Cityplace, Dallas|Cityplace]] district of [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]). The building is {{convert|560|ft|m|0}} tall and has {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2|-4}} of office space.<ref name="dbj2003-09-17"/>

== History ==
[[Image:Cityplace Center 1988.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Tower at Cityplace during construction in 1988.]]
The building was designed by Cossutta & Associates of New York to be the corporate headquarters for [[Southland Corporation]] (now 7-Eleven). Formerly named CityPlace East, it was conceived as the first phase of the 130 acre (526,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) [[Cityplace]] development. A twin tower (CityPlace West), later canceled, was planned across [[North Central Expressway]] with a [[skybridge]] connection over the highway.<ref name="skyscrapers.com"/> Several mid-rise buildings were also planned around the base of both towers. Construction began in December 1984 and the tower opened in 1988 after one year of delays. During this time and as a result of Southland's buyout in 1987, the need for headquarters space was reduced by 50%, leaving the lower 19 floors vacant. Because of the building's unique floorplate, converting the space to speculative office space was a challenge. Despite opening during the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] and resulting real estate crash in Dallas, the building was eventually filled. Cityplace East was renamed Cityplace Tower and was the last major skyscraper built in Dallas during the 1980s.<ref>Steve Brown. (1988, December 2).

Although neighborhood blocks were demolished in the mid-80's to make way future phases of Cityplace, additional plans were put on hold. In 1989, Southland sold land on the west side of North Central Expressway (including the CityPlace West site). Today this area is home to the [[West Village, Dallas|West Village]] development.<ref name="dbj2003-09-17"/>. Enough Brazilian red granite was ordered and cut for the twin tower and office buildings; it remains for sale in a south Dallas County storage yard.<ref>STEVE BROWN. (2008, August 22).

In 2000, [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART's]] [[Cityplace Station]], after years of planning, opened beneath North Central Expressway with entrances on both sides of the highway.

7-Eleven moved to [[One Arts Plaza]] in 2007, leaving half of the building vacant. Ashkenazy & Agus Ventures bought the property for $125 million and spent $7 million in upgrades.<ref>STEVE BROWN.

Retrieved December, 15 2009 from NewsBank on-line database (America's Newspapers) </ref> There were plans to turn the top of the tower into luxury apartments, but an influx of new office tenants changed this plan. The building was renamed Tower at Cityplace. In 2008 UCR Urban proposed new retail development on the ground sites previously reserved for mid rise office towers.<ref>http://www.ucrurban.com/property_uploads/200807081102580.cityplace_tower.pdf</ref>

==Design ==
At almost $300 million for construction and improvements, the 42-story Cityplace skyscraper was the most expensive office project ever built in Dallas.<ref>Steve Brown. (1988, December 2). CITYPLACE NOW IN THE MARKETPLACE - Marketers tout `unique' building. The Dallas Morning News  HOME FINAL ed., 1D. Retrieved December, 15 2009 from NewsBank on-line database (America's Newspapers) </ref> 

Constructed as an elaborate corporate headquarters, the lower floors were devoted to facilities not commonly found in multitenant buildings. The ground floor contains a 38,000-square-foot conference center with a 175-seat auditorium, a large cafeteria and a fitness center.

There are seven, 5-story atrium lobbies spaced throughout the tower with glass windows at each end. This unique design provides clear views of downtown and East Dallas, but limits floor space on each level. The second and third floors, along with a basement-level concourse, were built with space for retail tenants. Below the tower is a 3,400-car underground parking garage, one of the largest in the region.<ref>STEVE BROWN. (2009, July 24).

The fa<U+00E7>ade of the building is of Brazilian red [[granite]], and the first four floors are finished in pink and white marble, imported wood paneling and decorative tile. Elevators are lined with brass, polished wood and stone, and cut mirrors. <ref>Steve Brown. (1988, December 2). CITYPLACE NOW IN THE MARKETPLACE - Marketers tout `unique' building.

On June 8, 2009 [[Fortune 500]] company [[Dean Foods]] announced plans to move into approximately 240,000 [[square feet]] in the Cityplace Tower in first quarter of 2010.<ref>Hethcock, Bill.
