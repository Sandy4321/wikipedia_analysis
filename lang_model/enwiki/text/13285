Music critic [[Tim Riley (music critic)|Tim Riley]] writes that "'Spanish Harlem Incident' is a new romance that pretends to be short and sweet, but it's an example of how Dylan begins using uncommon word couplings to evoke the mysteries of intimacy...her 'rattling drums' plays off his 'restless palms'; her 'pearly eyes' and 'flashing diamond teeth' off his 'pale face.'"<ref>{{cite book|author=Riley, Tim.|page=87|year=1992|title=Hard Rain: A Dylan Commentary|publisher=Knopf/Vintage Books USA|isbn=0-679-74527-0}}</ref>  Dylan has only ever performed the song in [[Rock concert|live concerts]] during the period immediately following the release of the ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' album in 1964.<ref name="allmusic"/>

The song was covered by [[The Byrds]] on their 1965 debut album, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]]'', and had first been performed by the band during their pre-fame residency at [[Ciro's]] [[nightclub]] in West Hollywood, California.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=83<U+2013>87|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  The song was actually one of four Dylan covers to appear on their debut album.  After its appearance on the ''Mr. Tambourine Man'' album, The Byrds performed the song infrequently at live [[concert]]s.<ref name="timeless"/>
