The university offers more than 100 undergraduate, 61 master's and 26 doctoral programs.<ref>http://ire.uncg.edu/pages/factbook/2009-10/PDFs/history/2009Profile.PDF</ref> The university's academic schools and programs include Arts & Sciences, Business & Economics, Education, Health & Human Performance, Human Environmental Sciences, Nanoscience & Nanoengineering, Music, Theatre & Dance, Nursing, Continual Learning, Graduate School, Ashby Residential College and Lloyd International Honors College.

The university holds two classifications from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, as a <U+201C>research university with high research activity<U+201D> and for <U+201C>community engagement<U+201D> in curriculum, outreach and partnerships. 

UNCG is distinguished by its five leadership areas <U+2013> business, cultural leadership, education, public policy and social change, and science. Additionally, the university is home to a bevy of research institutes and centers including the Gateway University Research Park, Center for Applied Research, Center for Creative Writing in the Arts, Center for Drug Discovery, Institute for Community and Economic Engagement, Center for Biotechnology, Genomics & Health Research, Music Research Institute and the Southeastern Regional Vision for Education (SERVE).

==History==
[[Image:Statenormalandindustrial.jpg|thumb|350px|right|North Carolina State Normal and Industrial College, ca. 1906.]]

Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] by legislative enactment on February 18, 1891 as the '''State Normal and Industrial School''' and opened October 5, 1892. The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.

The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the "State Normal and Industrial School" to the '''State Normal and Industrial College''' in 1896, and again in 1919 to '''North Carolina College for Women'''. In 1932, it changed to the '''Woman's College of the University of North Carolina''', when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to the '''University of North Carolina at Greensboro''' when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as "the W.C."

Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.

==Campus==
[[Image:Fountainuncg.JPG|thumb|170px|left|The Fountain in front of the Dining Halls]]

UNCG has an architecturally diverse campus with distinctively unique landmarks.<ref>[http://www.blandwood.org/CollegiateArchitectureinGreensboro.html]</ref> Historic structures include the Foust Building (1891), Spencer Hall (1904, 1907), the Quad (1919<U+2013>1923), the Chancellor's Residence (1923), Aycock Auditorium (1927), and Alumni House (1937).<ref>Marvin A. Brown, Greensboro: An Architectural Record (1995)</ref>  Other features include a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.

Other landmarks include "Charlie," a statue of the University's founder [[Charles Duncan McIver]] outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to "the Rawk" and the clock tower&mdash;two campus landmarks&mdash;and school traditions (''See Traditions below''). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed in 2005.

The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and "the Caf," the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.

The campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities &mdash; [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Elon University|Elon]], [[High Point University]], [[NC State]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]], [[UNC Charlotte]], [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], and [[Winston-Salem State University]].

===Athletics===
{{main|UNC Greensboro Spartans}}
[[Image:UNCGreensboroSpartans.png|thumb|left|UNCG Spartans logo]]
The intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s during the days of the WCUNC, with students participating in national golf tournaments in 1948 and the school hosting the national tournaments for women's golf (1954) and tennis (1965). During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991. Between 1982-1987 the Men's Soccer team has won the NCAA Division III national championship title every year except for 1984. 

The 18 athletic teams currently at UNCG include:

Baseball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Men's Cross Country, Women's Cross Country, Men's Golf, Women's Golf, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Softball, Men's Indoor Track, Women's Indoor Track, Men's Tennis, Women's Tennis, Men's Track, Women's Track, Women's Volleyball, and Wrestling.

In March 2011, UNCG announced the school was dropping wrestling.

====The Blue Crew====
The Blue Crew is a student organization dedicated to cheering on the Spartans at athletic events.  The Blue Crew adds excitement to games and makes opposing teams feel incredibly unwelcome with a sea of blue/yellow tie dyed shirts and loud cheers.

===Traditions===
Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where "The Rawk" and the clock tower are located.

====The Rawk====

The Rawk<ref>[http://deanofstudents.uncg.edu/policy/posting.pdf UNCG Posting Policy]</ref> is a large boulder donated by members of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.

The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's "Rawkin' Welcome Week," which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.

====Clock Towers====
Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.

Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.

A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] chimes.

====Other traditions====
It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisy&mdash;the school flower of UNCG&mdash;after student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 "to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms."<ref>[http://www.uncg.edu/ure/graphic_standards/color.html The University Colors], [[UNCG]]. Accessed 9 September 2006.</ref>) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.

Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.

===M.F.A. Writing Program===

The MFA Writing Program is one of the oldest such programs in the country.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} During the early years, the University had among its faculty a number of noted writers, such as [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], 
[[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Hiram Haydn]], [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]] and [[Randall Jarrell]]. They invited other distinguished writers to campus to read from their work and to meet with students; these writers included [[Robert Lowell]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Flannery O<U+2019>Connor]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Saul Bellow]]. In 1965, under the leadership of Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling students to have individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included [[Fred Chappell]], [[H.T. Kirby-Smith]], [[Michael Parker (novelist)|Michael Parker]], [[Craig Nova]], [[Stuart Dischell]], [[Jennifer Grotz]] and [[David Roderick]]. Notable graduates include [[Claudia Emerson]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Keith Lee Morris]], Lee Hadaway and [[Rodney Jones]].

== Residential Colleges ==

=== Cornelia Strong College ===

[[Cornelia Strong College]] provides a social and academic community within the context of the larger university. There is no specific curriculum. The college is open to resident and non-resident undergraduate and graduate students. Strong College fellows are faculty members who take an active role in the development of Strong College's student members.

=== Grogan College ===

[[Grogan College|Ione Grogan College]], established in 1997, is limited to freshman and serves about 300 students per year. The college is divided into smaller learning communities, each headed by a faculty fellow. The college offers classes that meet general requirements, and ease freshman into the college experience.

=== Ashby Residential College ===

The [[Warren Ashby Residential College at Mary Foust]], established in 1970, is a community of freshman and sophomore students, faculty and staff who live or work in Mary Foust Hall. Also known as RC (or ARC), the college offers small classes, close student and faculty interaction and a rich community living experience.

In addition to freshmen and sophomores, those who have graduated from the program and are rising juniors or seniors may apply to be Mary Foust upperclassmen. Typically 8<U+2013>12 or so juniors and seniors are selected each year to continue living in Mary Foust as mentors. Each upperclassman is required to complete an "upperclassman project."  These projects are typically activities that support community interaction within Mary Foust.

Many Mary Foust alumni continue to support and participate in Ashby Residential College. Many of the staff are alumni.
