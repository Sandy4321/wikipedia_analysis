The '''Sphinx Head Society''' is the oldest [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|senior honor society]] at [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, New York. Sphinx Head recognizes Cornell senior men and women who, throughout their undergraduate years, have demonstrated respectable strength of character on top of a dedication to leadership and service at Cornell University.<ref name='HonoraryArticle'>[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov07/sphinx.head.html 10 faculty and staff members honored by Sphinx Head society], page 14, Cornell Chronicle, December 7, 2007</ref> Election into Sphinx Head has been recognized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the highest non-scholastic honor within reach of undergraduates."<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30715F8355A127A93CBA8178ED85F4D8285F9 63 Juniors Elected to Cornell Societies], The New York Times, May 19, 1929, p.

==Founding==
Sphinx Head was founded in [[1890]] by a group of men from the senior class.<ref name='AlumniNews1901'>"History of Some of the Later Cornell Organizations", Cornell Alumni News, December 18, 1901, p. 89. http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3166/12/004_12.pdf</ref>  The Society was founded in order to "create and maintain a stronger feeling" for Cornell University and to promote "a closer and stronger friendship among members of the Senior class."<ref name='AlumniNews1901'>"History of Some of the Later Cornell Organizations", Cornell Alumni News, December 18, 1901, p. 89. http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3166/12/004_12.pdf</ref> In 1891, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Sphinx Head as "a secret senior society of the nature of [[Skull and Bones]]," a senior honor society at [[Yale University]] of which [[Andrew Dickson White]], Cornell University's Co-founder and first President, was a member.<ref>"Cornell University", The New York Times, May 10, 1891.</ref>   White encouraged the formation a secret society system on the Cornell campus.<ref>[http://cornellsun.com/node/21711 The Secret Life of A.D.

==Membership==

[[Image:SH1899.jpg|thumb|175px|Sphinx Head, Class of 1899<ref>''Cornell University Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections''</ref>]]

Each year, Sphinx Head usually taps fewer than forty members of the senior class for membership, both men and women.<ref name='AlumniNews1901'>"History of Some of the Later Cornell Organizations", Cornell Alumni News, December 18, 1901, p. 89. http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3166/12/004_12.pdf</ref>  Since the Society's founding, membership has been "reserved for the most respected" members of the senior class at Cornell.<ref>[http://www.dos.cornell.edu/wsh/history_2.html Willard Straight Hall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The names of newly tapped Sphinx Heads were published in ''The New York Times'' through the 1930s, but are now published exclusively in ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]''.<ref> "Cornell Societies Elect", ''The New York Times'', October 19, 1930.</ref><ref>"Cornell Societies Elect New Members", ''The New York Times'', May 13, 1926.</ref><ref> "Cornell Societies Elect", ''The New York Times'', October 14, 1938.</ref>   Sphinx Head also awards honorary membership to Cornell administration, faculty, staff, and alumni for their "significant personal and/or professional accomplishment, outstanding leadership, distinguished service to the university and interest in and commitment to undergraduate student life and development."<ref name='HonoraryArticle'>[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov07/sphinx.head.html 10 faculty and staff members honored by Sphinx Head society], page 14, Cornell Chronicle, December 7, 2007</ref>

==At Cornell==
[[Image:Sphinx_Head_Tomb.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Historic Sphinx Head Tomb]]

Sphinx Head has "retained an aura of mystery throughout its history on campus," holding some "closely guarded secrets and traditions."<ref>Secret's Out, Cornell Alumni Magazine, May/June 2003, p. 36.</ref> Although membership in Sphinx Head is public, the proceedings of the Society remain concealed. Since the founding the Society, Sphinx Head members have been responsible for starting many long-standing Cornell University traditions such as the annual [[Dragon Day]] celebration, the use of [[Cornell Big Red|"The Big Red"]] to describe Cornell athletics, as well as Spring Day, the precursor to the current [[Slope Day]] celebration. <ref>[http://www.dos.cornell.edu/wsh/history_2.html Willard Straight Hall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.slopeday.cornell.edu/2008/history.php</ref><ref>''Cornell Alumni News'', October, 1950</ref> 

Members of Sphinx Head have held many prominent positions within Cornell University serving as Presidents, Provosts, Deans, Directors of Athletics, Cornell Council members, Trustees and Chairpersons of the Board of Trustees. More than one-third of the Presidents of the Cornell University Alumni Association have been members and twenty percent of the Chairpersons of the Cornell University Board of Trustees have been affiliated with the Society. <ref>Alumni Association: Larry Gubb, William Kleitz, Elbert Tuttle, Robert White, Walter Nield, Charles Werly, Richard Vanderwarker, Bruce Hackstaff, Joseph Driscoll</ref><ref>Chairman: Becker, Purcell, Noyes; Mieing holds honorary membership.</ref> Names of alumni can be found on the Cornell campus on Bartels Hall, [[Fernow Hall]], [[S.C.
