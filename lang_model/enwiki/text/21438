==Career==
Eriksen was born in [[Bergen]] and picked up the guitar at twelve, and started the band <U+00AB>Lorraine<U+00BB> in 1976 together with schoolmates (including keyboardist Hans-Petter Isaksen & bassist Roar Nilson) from [[Nattland]] primary school.<ref name="mic"/> He got the role as "local guitar hero" inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]], playing at school dances. He continued appearing in various local bands, including <U+00AB>Sharks & Whales<U+00BB> (the continuation of <U+00AB>Lorraine<U+00BB> now including Hans-Petter Isaksen & bassist Ole Vaksdal) with the album ''Reaped by Man'' released in 1988.

After being labeled "A cross between [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Eddie Van Halen]]" by the ''[[Guitar Player Magazine]]'' in 1989,<ref name=kvalitetsartister>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kvalitetsartister.no/Chris_Thompson_og_Mads_Eriksen_band.html |title=Chris Thompson & Mads Eriksen band - KvalitetsArtister.no}} (in Norwegian)</ref> Eriksen has embarked on a solo recording career together with producer and bassist [[Frank Hovland]]. In 1989 he debuted as a solo artist with the album ''Journey'', and has released a total of eight solo albums since then. Among other releases is the album ''Rediscovery'' which was released together with previous [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] guitarist and vocalist [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]].<ref name="mic"/>

In 1993 Eriksen was invited to contribute to the 150th anniversary of Edvard Grieg's birth. The result was a mini-CD called ''Intermission Troldhaugen'' (1993), where he interpreted six compositions by Grieg on electric guitar. This was also the year Eriksen participated in the band ''Jordal Express'' with [[Helge Jordal]], Gisle Johnsen, Eirik <U+00AB>Pytten<U+00BB> Hundvin and Magne Lunde. The following year he was appointed musical ambassador of Norway in the U.S.<ref name="mic"/><ref name="kvalitetsartister"/>

Eriksen has also performed with [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] among other symphony orchestras. In the spring of 2009 he toured with [[Ronni Le Tekr<U+00F8>]] ([[TNT (band)|TNT]]) og [[Terje Rypdal]] under the name N3 (short for  Norwegian Three).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.norwegian3.com/ |title=N3-Norwegian3 - Norwegian3.com}} (in Norwegian)</ref>

Eriksen has been working full time as a guitarist and guitar teacher since 1988. In addition to many private students, he has taught in the municipal musical schools in [[Bergen]] and [[Sund]].
