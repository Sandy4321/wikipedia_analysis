'''Louis Henri Sullivan''' ([[September 3]], [[1856]] &ndash; [[April 14]], [[1924]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]], called the "father of [[modern architecture|modernism]]". He is considered by many as the creator of the modern [[skyscraper]], was an influential architect and critic of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]], and was a mentor to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

==Biography==
Louis Sullivan<ref>Hugh Morrison, ''Louis Sullivan: Prophet of Modern Architecture'' (New York: Norton, 1998), 2.</ref> was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], to an Irish-born father and a Swiss-born mother both of whom had emigrated to the [[United States]] in the late 1840s. While attending high school Sullivan met [[Moses Woolson]], whose teachings made a lasting impression on him, and nurtured him until his death. After graduating from high school, Sullivan studied architecture briefly at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Learning that he could both graduate from high school a year early and pass up the first two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by passing a series of examinations, Sullivan entered MIT at the age of 16. After one year of study, he moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and talked himself into a job with architect [[Frank Furness]].

The [[Long Depression|Depression of 1873]] dried up much of Furness<U+2019>s work, and he was forced to let Sullivan go. At that point Sullivan moved on to [[Chicago]] in 1873 to take part in the building boom following the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. He worked for [[William LeBaron Jenney]], the architect often credited with erecting the first [[steel]]-frame building. After less than a year with Jenney, Sullivan moved to [[Paris]] and studied at the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts]] for a year. [[Renaissance]] art inspired Sullivan<U+2019>s mind, and he was influenced to direct his architecture to emulating [[Michelangelo]]'s spirit of creation rather than replicating the styles of earlier periods. He returned to Chicago, not yet 18 years old. He began work for the firm of Joseph S. Johnston & John Edelman as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]]. Johnston & Edleman were commissioned for interior design of the Moody Tabernacle, which was completed by Sullivan.[http://www.prairiestyles.com/lsullivan.htm] In 1879 [[Dankmar Adler]] hired Sullivan; a year later, he became a partner in the firm. This marked the beginning of Sullivan's most productive years.  And it was at this firm that Sullivan would deeply influence a young designer named [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who came to embrace Sullivan's designs and principles as the inspiration for his own work.

With a string of triumphs such as the [[1889 in architecture|1889]] [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]] in Chicago (where Adler and Sullivan reserved the top floor of the tower for their own atelier), the [[1891 in architecture|1891]] [[Wainwright Building]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and the [[1899 in architecture|1899]] [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building|Carson Pirie Scott Department Store]] on State Street in Chicago, Louis Sullivan was the first architect to fully imagine and realize a rich architectural vocabulary for a revolutionary new kind of building: the steel high-rise.

==Sullivan and the Steel High-Rise==
Prior to the late 19th century, the weight of a multistory building had to be supported principally by the strength of its walls.  The taller the building, the more strain this placed on the lower sections of the building; since there were clear engineering limits to the weight such "load-bearing" walls could sustain, large designs meant massively thick walls on the ground floors, and definite limits on the building's height.

The development of cheap, versatile steel in the second half of the 19th century changed those rules.  By assembling a framework of steel girders, architects and builders could suddenly create tall, slender buildings with a strong and relatively delicate steel skeleton.  The rest of the building's elements - the walls, floors, ceilings, and windows - were suspended from the steel, which carried the weight.  This new way of constructing buildings, so-called "column-frame" construction, pushed them up rather than out.  The steel weight-bearing frame allowed not just taller buildings, but permitted much larger windows, which meant more daylight reaching interior spaces.  Interior walls became thinner, which created more usable floor space.    

Chicago's [[Monadnock Building]] (which was not designed by Sullivan) literally straddles this remarkable moment of transition: the northern half of the building, finished in 1891, is of load-bearing construction, while the southern half, finished only two years later, is column-frame.  (While experiments in this new technology were taking place in many cities, Chicago was the crucial laboratory.  Industrial capital and civic pride drove a surge of new construction throughout the city's downtown in the wake of the 1871 fire.)

The technical limits of weight-bearing masonry had always imposed formal as well as structural constraints; those constraints were suddenly gone.  None of the historical precedents were any help, and this new freedom created a kind of technical and stylistic crisis.

Sullivan was the first to cope with that crisis. He addressed it by embracing the changes that came with the steel frame, creating a grammar of form for the high rise (base, shaft, and pediment), simplifying the appearance of the building by breaking away from historical styles, using his own intricate flora designs, in vertical bands, to draw the eye upwards and emphasize the building's verticality, and relating the shape of the building to its specific purpose. All this was revolutionary, appealingly honest, and commercially successful.

Louis Sullivan is credited with coining the phrase "[[form follows function]]," which would become the great battle-cry of modernist architects.  This credo, which placed the demands of practical use above aesthetics, would later be taken by influential designers to imply that decorative elements, which architects call "ornament," were superfluous in modern buildings.  But Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such dogmatic lines during the peak of his career.  Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush [[Art Nouveau]] and something like [[Celtic Revival]] decorations, usually cast in iron or terra cotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage.  Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the Carson Pirie Scott store on South State Street.  These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly-recognizable signature.

Another signature element of Sullivan's work is the massive, semi-circular arch.  Sullivan employed such arches throuighout his career - in shaping entrances, in framing windows, or as interior design.

All of these elements can be found in Sullivan's widely-admired breakthrough work, the [[Guaranty Building (Buffalo, New York)|Guaranty Building]] which he designed while partnered with Adler.  The 1895 office building in Buffalo, New York was visibly divided into three "zones" of design: a plain, wide-windowed base for the ground-level shops; the main office block, with vertical ribbons of masonry rising unimpeded across nine upper floors to emphasize the building's height; and an ornamented cornice perforated by round windows at the roof level, where the building's mechanical units (like the elevator motors) were housed.  The cornice crawls with Sullivan's trademark Art Nouveau vines; each ground-floor entrance is topped by a semi-circular arch.

Because of Sullivan's remarkable accomplishments in design and construction at such a critical point in architectural history, he has sometimes been described as the "father" of the American skyscraper.  In truth, many architects had been building skyscrapers before or simultaneously with Sullivan.  Chicago itself was replete with extraordinary designers and builders in the late years of the 19th century, including Dankmar Adler, [[Daniel Burnham]], and [[John Wellborn Root]].  Root was one of the builders of the Monadnock Building (see above).  That and another Root design, the Masonic Temple Tower (both in Chicago), are cited by many as the originators of skyscraper aesthetics of bearing wall and column-frame construction respectively.  

It may be that Sullivan's prominence in skyscraper history can be credited not only to his brilliance, but in some degree to the myth-making skills of his disciple, Frank Lloyd Wright, and to the impact of Sullivan's own book, The Autobiography of an Idea.  He may also owe some of his legend to the tragic tint of his later years, which lend this great innovator's story a poignancy which has captured the imagination of student and historian alike.

==Later Career and Decline==
In 1890 Sullivan was one of the ten architects, five from the Eastern US and five from the Western US, chosen to build a major structure for the "White City", the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], held in Chicago in [[1893 in architecture|1893]]. Sullivan's massive Transportation Building and huge arched [["Golden Door"]] stood out as the only forward-looking design in a sea of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] historical copies, and the only gorgeously multicolored facade in the White City. Sullivan and fair director [[Daniel Burnham]] were vocal about their displeasure with each other. Sullivan was later (1922) to claim that the fair set the course of American architecture back "for half a century from its date, if not longer." (Autobiography of an Idea, p. 325)  His was the only building to receive extensive recognition outside America, receiving three medals from the ''Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs'' the following year.

Adler and Sullivan broke their partnership after the Guaranty Building.  By both temperament and connections, Adler had always been the one who brought in new business to the partnership, and after the rupture Sullivan went into a twenty-year-long financial and emotional decline, beset by a shortage of commissions, chronic financial problems and [[alcoholism]].  He obtained a few commissions for small-town Midwestern banks (see below), wrote books, and in 1922 appeared as a critic of [[Raymond Hood]]'s winning entry for the [[Tribune Tower]] competition, a steel-frame tower dressed in [[neo-gothic architecture|Gothic]] stonework that Sullivan found a shameful piece of historicism. He and his former understudy Frank Lloyd Wright reconciled in time for Wright to help fund Sullivan's funeral after he died, poor and alone, in a Chicago hotel room on [[April 14]], [[1924]]. A modest headstone marks his final resting spot in [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago's [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]] neighborhood.  Only yards away from his resting-place, some of Chicago's lesser-known but much wealthier dead are entombed in handsome and distinctive tombs designed by Sullivan himself.  A monument (shown) was later erected in Sullivan's honor, a few feet from his headstone.

Sullivan's legacy is contradictory. He is the first modernist. His stripped-down, technology-driven, forward-looking designs clearly anticipate the issues and solutions of Modernism. In his last years, Sullivan seemed willing to abandon ornament altogether in favor of honest massing.  But to experience Sullivan's built work is to experience the irresistible appeal of his incredible designs, the vertical bands on the Wainwright Building, the burst of welcoming [[Art Nouveau]] ironwork on the corner entrance of the Carson Pirie Scott store, the (lost) terra cotta griffins and porthole windows on the Union Trust building, the white angels of the [[Bayard-Condict Building|Bayard Building]]. Except for some designs by his long time draftsman [[George Grant Elmslie]], and the occasional tribute to Sullivan such as Schmidt, Garden & Martin's First National Bank in [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Colorado]] (built across the street from Adler and Sullivan's Pueblo Opera House), his style is unique. A visit to the preserved Chicago Stock Exchange trading floor, now at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]], is proof of the immediate and visceral power of the ornament that he used so selectively. Original drawings and other archival materials from Sullivan are held by [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and by the Drawings and Archives Department in the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]]. Fragments of Sullivan buildings are also held in many fine art and design museums around the world.

==Preservation==
During the postwar era of [[urban renewal]], Sullivan's works fell into disfavor, and many were demolished. In the 70's growing public concern for these buildings finally resulted in many being saved. The most vocal voice was [[Richard Nickel]], who even held one-man protests of demolitions. Nickel and others sometimes rescued decorative elements from condemned buildings, sneaking in during demolition. This practice led to Nickel's death inside Sullivan's Stock Exchange building, when a floor above him collapsed.

By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, Sullivan's star was well on the descent and for the remainder of his life his output consisted primarily of a series of small bank and commercial buildings in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Yet a look at these buildings clearly reveals that Sullivan's muse had not abandoned him. When the director of a bank that was considering hiring him asked Sullivan why they should engage him at a cost higher than the bids received for a conventional Neo-Classic styled building from other architects, Sullivan is reported to have replied, "A thousand architects could design those buildings. Only I can design this one." He got the job. Today these commissions are collectively referred to as Sullivan's "Jewel Boxes." All are still standing.
