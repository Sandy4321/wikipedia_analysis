==Biography==
Arad and his brother, architect [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]], were born in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].

In 1968 he was selected for study at '''Chapelle Musicale Reine Elisabeth''' in [[Waterloo, Belgium]], earning a Laureate there in 1971 and a Diplome Superieure from [[Brussels Conservatory]] in 1973.

Two months later he repeated, winning first prize in the International Viola Competition in [[Geneva]].
