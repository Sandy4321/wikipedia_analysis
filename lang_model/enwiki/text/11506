'''''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach <U+2013> The Artist and his Wife''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru}}) is an 1899 painting by [[Peder Severin Kr<U+00F8>yer]]. One of the best known paintings of the [[Skagen Painters]], it depicts Kr<U+00F8>yer with his wife [[Marie Kr<U+00F8>yer|Marie]] and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Kr<U+00F8>yer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Kr<U+00F8>yer (1851-1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

In 1895, in a letter to his friend [[Oscar Bj<U+00F6>rck]], Kr<U+00F8>yer wrote "I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together <U+2014> but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with [[Marie Kr<U+00F8>yer|Marie Triepcke]] as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.<ref name=hirschsprung>{{cite web|url=http://hirschsprung.dk/Image.aspx?id=12&col=7|title=P.S.

==Final work==

The final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Kr<U+00F8>yer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Kr<U+00F8>yer's faithful dog, Rap. After Kr<U+00F8>yer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1900.<ref name=hirschsprung/> It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the [[Symbolists]] who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Kr<U+00F8>yer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extranet.uv.khs.dk/materiale/Dansk%20Opgave%201/www/opg4-hirschsprung/arbejder/234/index.html|title=Sommeraften ved Skagens strand|publisher=K<U+00F8>ge Hamdelsskole|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> A few months later, he was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after a nervous breakdown.<ref name=hirschsprung/>
