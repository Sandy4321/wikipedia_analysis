== History ==
Before 1952, the entire State of Florida was under the jurisdiction of one diocese, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine]]. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Saint Augustine archbishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley]] purchased land throughout South Florida in anticipation of a future population boom.<ref>{{cite web| last=Gannon| first=Michael| title=The Builder Bishop| publisher=''Saint Augustine Catholic''| date=2007-10-30| url=http://www.staugcatholic.org/feature2.shtml| accessdate=2007-10-30|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715202643/http://www.staugcatholic.org/feature2.shtml |archivedate = July 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas.<ref name="anniversary"/>

The Diocese of Miami was created on October 7, 1958, with [[Coleman Carroll]] installed as [[bishop]]. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed one half of the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in [[Cuba]]. This set off a mass exodus of [[Cuban exile]]s to South Florida. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. [[Operation Pedro Pan]], created by Monsignor [[Bryan O. Walsh]], placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| last=Catholic Charities| title=Catholic Charities History| publisher=Catholic Charities| url=http://www.catholiccharitiesadm.org/who_we_are.htm| accessdate=2007-08-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070731135652/http://www.catholiccharitiesadm.org/who_we_are.htm|archivedate=July 31, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Mariel Refugees.jpg|thumb|left|Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis]]
Due to an increased population, the diocese was divided in 1968. Eight counties became part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg|Diocese of St. Petersburg]] and the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando|Diocese of Orlando]]. Miami was made an archdiocese by [[Pope Paul VI]], and was named Metropolitan See for all of Florida. Carroll became an archbishop on March 2, 1968.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiarchdiocese.org/ip.asp?op=A152500&lg=E|title=Archdiocese of Miami: History - Made an Archdiocese|author=Miami Archdiocese|publisher=Miami Archdiocese|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> He participated in the church reforms of [[Vatican II]] as one of the Council Fathers.<ref name="anniversary" /> During the civil rights struggles of the 60's, Carroll was influential in stemming threatened racial riots in Miami and in desegregating Catholic schools roughly 10 years before the rest of the State.<ref name="historybook">{{cite book | last = The Archdiocese of Miami| title =History of the Archdiocese of Miami 1958-2008 | publisher =Editions du Signe | year =2007 | location = | pages = 27| isbn =978-2-7468-1935-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=The Florida Memory Project| title=Florida Timeline| publisher=The Florida Memory Project| url=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/| accessdate=2007-11-10| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011084612/http://floridamemory.com/Timeline/ <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref> He became a founder of the Community Relations Board which worked to "quell waves of misunderstanding, discrimination and discontent which often threatened to flood South Florida's multi-ethnic community."<ref name="historybook"/>

On November 3, 1994, [[Pope John Paul II]] appointed John C. Favalora as the third archbishop of Miami. During his tenure, he built two new high schools and nine grade schools.

In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before they could work with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.<ref name="charteryouth">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/ocyp/charter.shtml|title=Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People|accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|year=2005|author=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops}}</ref>

This formation includes not only academic classes but also human, spiritual and pastoral education. St. John Vianney Seminary, which is located in Miami, states as its fundamental purpose "to provide an undergraduate education for students whose stated objective is to serve the Catholic Church as priests", but it also offers education to lay ministers and to "others who may be enriched by its services".<ref name="JohnV"/> St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary, located in Boynton Beach, offers a Master's Degree in Theology and Theological Studies and a First Professional Degree in Divinity and Ministry.
