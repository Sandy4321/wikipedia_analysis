The third '''USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)''' ("Mighty Mo" or "Big Mo") is a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[battleship]], notable as the final battleship to be built by the [[United States]], the second-to-last in the world after [[HMS Vanguard (23)|HMS ''Vanguard'']], and the site of the [[Japan]]ese surrender at the end of [[World War II]]. 

She was one of the [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] "fast battleship" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. ''Missouri'' was ordered on [[12 June]] [[1940]] and her [[keel]] was laid at the [[New York Navy Yard]] in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]] on [[6 January]] [[1941]]. She was launched on [[29 January]] [[1944]] and commissioned on 11 June. The ship was the fourth of the ''Iowa'' class and the final battleship commissioned by the [[US Navy]]. The ship was christened at her launching by [[Mary Margaret Truman]], daughter of [[Harry S. Truman]], then a senator from [[Missouri]].

During World War II, ''Missouri'' saw action at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]], and shelled the Japanese home islands of [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] and [[Honsh<U+016B>]]. ''Missouri'' fought in the [[Korean War]], then was decommissioned into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] in 1955. She was recommissioned in the 1980s, and refitted with modern armaments. In 1991, she participated in the [[Gulf War]]. 

''Missouri'' was decommissioned a final time on [[31 March]] [[1992]], having received a total of eleven [[battle star]]s, and is presently a [[museum ship]] at [[Pearl Harbor]].

==History==
===World War II (1944-1945)===
====Shakedown and Service with Task Force 58, Admiral Mitscher====
After trials off [[New York]] and shakedown and battle practice in [[Chesapeake Bay]], ''Missouri'' departed [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[11 November]] [[1944]], transited the [[Panama Canal]] [[18 November]] and steamed to [[San Francisco]] for final fitting out as fleet [[flagship]]. She stood out of [[San Francisco Bay]] [[14 December]] and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on Christmas Eve 1944.  She departed Hawaii on [[2 January]] [[1945]] and arrived in [[Ulithi]], West [[Caroline Islands]], [[13 January]] [[1945]]. There she was temporary headquarters ship for [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]. The [[battleship]] put to sea [[27 January]] to serve in the screen of the [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|''Lexington'']] carrier task group of Mitscher's [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF&nbsp;58]], and on [[16 February]] her [[aircraft carrier]]s launched the first air strikes against Japan since the famed [[Doolittle raid]], which had been launched from carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']] in April 1942.

''Missouri'' then steamed with the carriers to [[Iwo Jima]] where her main guns provided direct and continuous support to the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion landings]] begun [[19 February]]. After TF&nbsp;58 returned to Ulithi [[5 March]], ''Missouri'' was assigned to the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|''Yorktown'']] carrier task group. On [[14 March]] ''Missouri'' departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against targets along the coast of the [[Inland Sea]] of [[Japan]] beginning [[18 March]], ''Missouri'' shot down four Japanese [[aircraft]].

Raids against [[airfield]]s and [[naval base]]s near the Inland Sea and southwestern [[Honsh<U+016B>]] continued. During a Japanese attack, two [[bomb]]s penetrated the hangar deck and decks aft of carrier [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|''Franklin'']], leaving her dead in the water within 50&nbsp;miles (90&nbsp;km) of the Japanese mainland. The [[cruiser]] [[USS Pittsburgh (CA-72)|''Pittsburgh'']] took ''Franklin'' in tow until she gained speed to 14&nbsp;knots (26&nbsp;km/h). ''Missouri''<U+2019>s carrier task group provided cover for ''Franklin''<U+2019>s retirement toward Ulithi until [[22 March]], then set course for pre-invasion strikes and [[bombardment]] of [[Okinawa]].

''Missouri'' joined the fast battleships of TF&nbsp;58 in bombarding the southeast coast of [[Okinawa]] [[24 March]] [[1945]], an action intended to draw enemy strength from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of invasion landings. ''Missouri'' rejoined the screen of the carriers as [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[United States Army|Army]] units [[Battle of Okinawa|stormed the shores of Okinawa]] on the morning of [[1 April]]. Planes from the carriers shattered a special Japanese attacking force led by battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'' [[7 April]]. ''Yamato'', the world's largest battleship, was sunk, as were a cruiser and a [[destroyer]]. Three other enemy destroyers were heavily damaged and [[scuttled]]. Four remaining destroyers, sole survivors of the attacking fleet, were damaged and retired to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]].

On [[11 April]] ''Missouri'' opened fire on a low-flying [[kamikaze]] plane which penetrated the curtain of her shells and crashed on the starboard side just below her main deck level. The starboard wing of the plane was thrown far forward, starting a [[gasoline]] fire at 5&nbsp;inch (127&nbsp;mm) Gun Mount No. 3; yet the battleship suffered only superficial damage, and the fire was brought quickly under control.  The remains of the pilot's body was recovered on board the ship just aft of one of the 40&nbsp;mm gun tubs.  Captain William Callaghan decided that the young Japanese pilot had done his job, to the best of his ability and with honor and that he deserved a military funeral.  Not all of the crew agreed with that decision, after all the pilot was still their enemy and had tried to kill them, but the Captain's orders were respected and the following day the pilot was buried at sea with military honors.

About 23:05 on [[17 April]] [[1945]], ''Missouri'' detected an enemy [[submarine]] 12&nbsp;miles (22&nbsp;km) from her formation. Her report set off a hunter-killer operation by the [[aircraft carrier|light carrier]] [[USS Bataan (CVL-29)|''Bataan'']] and four [[destroyer]]s, which sank Japanese submarine [[Japanese submarine I-56|''I-56'']].

''Missouri'' was detached from the carrier task force off Okinawa [[5 May]] and sailed for Ulithi. During the Okinawa campaign she had shot down five enemy planes, assisted in the destruction of six others, and scored one probable kill. She helped repel 12 daylight attacks of enemy raiders and fought off four night attacks on her [[carrier battle group|carrier task group]]. Her shore bombardment destroyed several gun emplacements and many other military, governmental, and industrial structures.

[[Image:Kamikaze zero.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A Japanese Zero about to hit the ''Missouri'']]

====Service with the 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey====
''Missouri'' arrived Ulithi [[9 May]] [[1945]] and thence proceeded to [[Apra Harbor]], [[Guam]], [[18 May]]. That afternoon [[Admiral]] [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], Commander [[U.S. 3rd Fleet|3d Fleet]], broke his flag in ''Missouri''. She passed out of the harbor [[21 May]], and by [[27 May]] was again conducting shore bombardment against Japanese positions on Okinawa. ''Missouri'' now led the 3rd Fleet in strikes on airfields and installations on [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] [[2 June]] and [[3 June]]. She rode out a fierce storm [[5 June]] and [[6 June]] that wrenched off the bow of the cruiser [[USS Pittsburgh (CA-72)|''Pittsburgh'']]. Some topside fittings were smashed, but ''Missouri'' suffered no major damage. Her fleet again struck [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] [[8 June]], then hit hard in a coordinated air-surface bombardment before retiring towards [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. She arrived [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], Leyte, [[13 June]] [[1945]], after almost three months of continuous operations in support of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]].

Here she prepared to lead the 3rd Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within its home waters. The mighty fleet set a northerly course [[8 July]] to approach the Japanese mainland. Raids took [[Tokyo]] by surprise [[10 July]], followed by more devastation at the juncture of [[Honsh<U+016B>]] and [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] [[13 July]] and [[14 July]]. For the first time a naval gunfire force wrought destruction on a major installation within the home islands, when ''Missouri'' closed the shore to join in a bombardment [[15 July]] that rained destruction on the [[Nihon Steel]] Co. and the [[Wanishi Ironworks]] at [[Muroran, Hokkaido]].

During the night of [[17 July]] to [[18 July]] ''Missouri'' bombarded industrial targets in [[Honsh<U+016B>]]. [[Inland Sea]] aerial strikes continued through [[25 July]] [[1945]], and ''Missouri'' guarded the carriers as they struck hard blows at the Japanese capital. As July ended the Japanese no longer had any home waters. ''Missouri'' had led her fleet to gain control of the air and sea approaches to the very shores of Japan.

Strikes on [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] and northern [[Honsh<U+016B>]] resumed [[9 August]] [[1945]], the day the second [[atomic bomb]] was dropped. Next day, at 20:54, ''Missouri'''s men were electrified by the unofficial news that Japan was ready to surrender, provided that the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]'s prerogatives as a sovereign ruler were not compromised. Not until 07:45, [[15 August]], was word received that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Truman]] had announced Japan's acceptance of [[unconditional surrender]].

====Signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender====
[[Image:MacArthur Surrender.jpg|thumb|right|300px|American and British sailors and officers watch General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] sign documents during the surrender ceremony aboard ''Missouri'' on [[2 September]] [[1945]]. The unconditional surrender of the Japanese to the [[Allies]] officially ended the Second World War.]]
[[Image:MissouriPlaque.png|thumb|left|Plaque on the USS Missouri]]
Admiral Sir [[Bruce Fraser]] of the [[Royal Navy]], the Commander of the [[British Pacific Fleet]], boarded ''Missouri'' [[16 August]], and conferred the order [[Order of the British Empire|Knight of the British Empire]] upon Admiral Halsey. ''Missouri'' transferred a landing party of 200 officers and men to the battleship [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa'']] for temporary duty with the initial occupation force for Tokyo [[21 August]]. ''Missouri'' herself entered [[Tokyo Bay]] early [[29 August]] to prepare for the signing by Japan of the official [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender (1945)|instrument of surrender]].
High-ranking military officials of all the [[Allied Powers]] were received on board [[2 September]]. [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] boarded shortly after 08:00, and [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander for the Allies, came on board at 08:43. The Japanese representatives, headed by [[Foreign Minister]] [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]], arrived at 08:56. At 09:02 General MacArthur stepped before a battery of microphones and the 23&nbsp;minute surrender ceremony was broadcast to the waiting world. 

By 09:30 the Japanese emissaries had departed. The afternoon of [[5 September]] Admiral Halsey transferred his flag to the battleship [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']], and early the next day ''Missouri'' departed Tokyo Bay. She received homeward bound passengers at [[Guam]], then sailed unescorted for [[Hawaii]]. She arrived [[Pearl Harbor]] [[20 September]] and flew Admiral Nimitz's flag on the afternoon of [[28 September]] for a reception.

During this ceremony, the deck of the ''Missouri'' was decorated with just two American flags. One had flown on the mast of [[Commodore Matthew Perry|Commodore Perry's]] ship when he had sailed into that same bay nearly a century earlier to urge the opening of Japan's ports to foreign trade.

=== Post-war (1946 to 1950) ===
[[Image:Missouri_panama_canal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Missouri'' moves through the [[Panama Canal]] en route to the [[United States]] in October 1945.]]

The next day, ''Missouri'' departed Pearl Harbor bound for the eastern seaboard of the United States. She reached [[New York City]] [[23 October]] [[1945]] and broke the flag of [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] commander Admiral [[Jonas Ingram]]. Four days later, ''Missouri'' boomed out a [[21-gun salute]] as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Truman]] boarded for [[Navy Day]] ceremonies.

After an overhaul in the [[New York Naval Shipyard]] and a training cruise to [[Cuba]], ''Missouri'' returned to New York. The afternoon of [[21 March]] [[1946]], she received the remains of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Ambassador]] to the United States, [[Mehmet Munir Ertegun]]. She departed [[22 March]] for [[Gibraltar]] and [[5 April]] anchored in the [[Bosphorus]] off [[Istanbul]]. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19 gun salutes during the transfer of the remains of the late Ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.

''Missouri'' departed Istanbul [[9 April]] and entered [[Phaleron Bay]], [[Piraeus, Greece]] the following day for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and citizens. She had arrived in a year when there were ominous [[Russia]]n overtures and activities in the entire [[Balkan]] area. Greece had become the scene of a [[Communist]]-inspired [[civil war]], as Russia sought every possible extension of [[Soviet]] influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]] region. Demands were made that [[Turkey]] grant the Soviets a base of seapower in the [[Dodecanese Islands]] and joint control of the [[Dardanelles|Turkish Straits]] leading from the [[Black Sea]] into the [[Mediterranean]].

The voyage of ''Missouri'' to the eastern Mediterranean comforted Greece and Turkey. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest in preserving both nations' independence.

''Missouri'' departed Piraeus [[26 April]], touching at [[Algiers]] and [[Tangiers]] before arriving [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] [[9 May]]. She departed for [[Culebra Island]] [[12 May]] to join Admiral Mitscher's [[U.S. 8th Fleet|8th Fleet]] in the Navy's first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City [[27 May]], and spent the next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the [[Davis Strait]] and south to the [[Caribbean]] on various Atlantic command training exercises.

''Missouri'' arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[30 August]] [[1947]] for the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Hemisphere Peace and Security. President Truman boarded [[2 September]] to celebrate the signing of the [[Rio Treaty]], which broadened the [[Monroe Doctrine]] by stipulating that an attack on one of the signatory American states would be considered an attack on all.
[[Image:Grounded Missouri.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Missouri'' was accidentally grounded early on the morning of [[17 January]] [[1950]].]]
The Truman family boarded ''Missouri'' [[7 September]] [[1947]] to return to the United States and debarked at Norfolk [[19 September]]. Her overhaul in New York<U+2014>which lasted from [[23 September]] to [[10 March]] [[1948]]<U+2014>was followed by refresher training at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The summer of 1948 was devoted to midshipman and reserve training cruises. The battleship departed Norfolk [[1 November]] for a second 3 week [[Arctic]] cold-weather training cruise to the Davis Strait. During the next two years, ''Missouri'' participated in Atlantic command exercises from the [[New England]] coast to the [[Caribbean]], alternated with two midshipman summer training cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from [[23 September]] [[1949]] to [[17 January]] [[1950]].

Now the only U.S. battleship in commission, ''Missouri'' was proceeding seaward on a training mission from [[Hampton Roads]] early on [[17 January]] when she ran aground 1.6&nbsp;miles (3.0&nbsp;km) from [[Thimble Shoals Light]], near [[Old Point Comfort]]. She hit shoal water a distance of three ship lengths from the main channel. Lifted some seven feet above waterline, she stuck hard and fast. With the aid of tugs, pontoons, and an incoming tide, she was refloated on [[1 February]] [[1950]]. The ship was eventually repaired, but the Navy had other plans for the dreadnought. Like most vessels in the post-WWII fleet, the ''Missouri'' was seen as a liability more than an asset, so the Navy began to prepare her for decommissioning. At the last second, President Truman learned of the Navy's decision. Truman<U+2014>a Missouri native and formerly a senator from the state<U+2014>issued an [[executive order]] stating that as long as he remained the President of the United States the battleship ''Missouri'' would remain an active part of the fleet. Ironically, this order worked in the Navy's favor.

===The Korean War Period (1950 to 1955) ===
In 1950, the [[North Korean]] army [[Korean War|invaded]] [[South Korea]]. The United States intervened in the name of the [[United Nations]], and sent troops, tanks, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization ''Missouri'' was called up from the Atlantic fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on [[19 August]] to support U.N. forces on the Korean peninsula.

''Missouri'' joined the U.N. just west of [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] on [[14 September]], where she became the flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[A. E. Smith (admiral)|A. E. Smith]]. The first American battleship to reach Korean waters, she bombarded [[Samchok]] on [[15 September]] [[1950]] in an attempt to divert troops and attention from the Inchon landings. This was the first time since WWII that ''Missouri'' had fired her guns in anger, and in company with the cruiser [[USS Helena (CA-75)|''Helena'']] and two [[destroyer]]s, she helped prepare the way for the [[U.S. Eighth Army|8th Army]] offensive.

''Missouri'' arrived at [[Inchon]] [[19 September]], and on [[10 October]] became flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[J. M. Higgins]], commander, [[Cruiser Division 5]]. She arrived [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]] [[14 October]], where she became flagship of [[Vice Admiral]] [[A. D. Struble]], Commander, [[U.S. 7th Fleet|7th Fleet]]. After screening the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|''Valley Forge'']] along the east coast of [[Korea]], she conducted bombardment missions from [[12 October]] to [[26 October]] in the [[Chonjin]] and [[Tanchon]] areas, and at [[Wonsan]] where she again screened carriers eastward of Wonsan. 

On [[15 September]] [[1950]], [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] launched his famous [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasion]] of Korea during the [[battle of Inchon]]. This broke North Korean supply lines, resulting in a North Korean retreat to the north with U.N. forces in hot pursuit. Up till now, the U.N. forces had only engaged North Korean units, but there was talk among the commanders of the U.N. forces (notably General MacArthur) about invading [[China]]. A communist nation itself, China had been closely monitoring the North Korean retreat as it gradually approached the Korea/China border. The Chinese had already issued several warnings announcing their intentions to defend their country, and when it became obvious that North Korean forces could not beat the U.N. forces China took action. On [[19 October]] [[1950]] some 380,000 [[People's Liberation Army]] soldiers under the command of General [[Peng Dehuai]] crossed into North Korea and launched a full scale [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|assault against advancing U.N. troops]]. Caught by surprise, the U.N. forces realized they would have to fall back, and quickly executed an emergency retreat. U.N. assets were shuffled in order to cover this retreat, and as part of the force tasked with covering the U.N. retreat ''Missouri'' was moved into [[Hungnam]] [[23 December]] to provide gunfire support about the [[Hungnam defense perimeter]] until the last U.N. troops, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]], were evacuated by way of the sea on [[24 December]] [[1950]].

[[Image:Mossouri North Korea Deployment.JPG|thumb|right|320px|''Missouri'' fires her guns against enemy positions during the Korean War. Notice the effect on the seawater under the guns.]]
''Missouri'' conducted additional operations with carriers and shore bombardments off the east coast of Korea until [[19 March]] [[1951]]. She arrived [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] [[24 March]], and 4 days later was relieved of duty in the Far East. She departed Yokosuka [[28 March]], and upon arrival at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] on [[27 April]] became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[James L. Holloway, Jr.]], commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. During the summer of 1951, she engaged in two [[midshipman]] training cruises to northern Europe. ''Missouri'' entered [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] [[18 October]] for an overhaul, which lasted until [[30 January]] [[1952]].

Following winter and spring training out of Guantanamo Bay, ''Missouri'' visited New York, then set course from Norfolk [[9 June]] for another midshipman cruise. She returned to Norfolk [[4 August]] and entered [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] to prepare for a second tour in the Korean combat zone.

''Missouri'' stood out of [[Hampton Roads]] on [[11 September]] [[1952]] and arrived Yokosuka [[17 October]]. She broke the flag of Vice Admiral [[Joseph J. Clark]], commander of the [[U.S. 7th Fleet|7th Fleet]], on [[19 October]]. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing [[artillery]] support by bombarding enemy targets in the [[Chaho-Tanchon]] area, at [[Chongjin]], in the [[Tanchon-Sonjin]] area, and at [[Chaho]], [[Wonsan]], [[Hamhung]], and [[Hungnam]] during the period [[25 October]] through [[2 January]] [[1953]].

''Missouri'' put in to Inchon [[5 January]] [[1953]] and sailed thence to [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], Japan. General [[Mark W. Clark]], Commander in Chief, U.N. Command, and Admiral Sir [[Guy Russell]], the [[Royal Navy]] commander of the British Far East Station, visited the battleship [[23 January]]. In the following weeks, ''Missouri'' resumed "Cobra" patrol along the east coast of Korea to support troops ashore. Repeated strikes against Wonsan, Tanehon, Hungnam, and Kojo destroyed main supply routes along the eastern seaboard. The last gunstrike mission by ''Missouri'' was against the Kojo area [[25 March]]. She sustained a grievous casualty [[6 March]] [[1953]], when her commanding officer Captain [[Warner R. Edsall]] suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] while conning her through the [[submarine net]] at Sasebo. She was relieved as the 7th Fleet [[flagship]] [[6 April]] by her older sister [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']].

''Missouri'' departed Yokosuka [[7 April]] [[1953]] and arrived Norfolk [[4 May]] to become flagship for Rear Admiral [[E. T. Woolridge]], commander, Battleships-Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, [[14 May]]. She departed [[8 June]] on a midshipman training cruise, returned to Norfolk [[4 August]], and was overhauled in Norfolk Naval Shipyard [[20 November]] to [[2 April]] [[1954]]. Now the flagship of Rear Admiral [[R. E. Kirby]], who had relieved Admiral Woolridge, ''Missouri'' departed Norfolk [[7 June]] as flagship of the midshipman training cruise to [[Lisbon]] and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. She returned Norfolk [[3 August]] and departed the 23rd for inactivation on the West Coast. After calls at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[San Francisco]], ''Missouri'' arrived in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] [[15 September]] [[1954]]. Three days later she entered [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] where she decommissioned [[26 February]] [[1955]], entering the [[Bremerton]] group, [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]].

Upon arrival in [[Bremerton]], ''Missouri'' was moored at the last pier of the reserve fleet berthing.  This placed her very close to the mainland, and she served as a popular tourist attraction, logging about 180,000 visitors per year, who came to view the "surrender deck" where a bronze plaque memorialized the spot where [[Japan]] surrendered to the [[Allies]], and the accompanying historical display that included copies of the surrender documents and photos. A small cottage industry grew in the civilian community just outside the gates, selling souvenirs and other memorabilia. Nearly thirty years would pass before ''Missouri'' would again return to active duty.

=== Recommissioning (1985 to 1990) ===
As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]], ''Missouri'' was reactivated in 1984 and recommissioned in [[San Francisco]] on [[10 May]] [[1986]]. Like her ''Iowa''-class sisters, ''Missouri'' was refitted with the latest weaponry available, including the [[Armored Box Launcher|Armored Box Launcher (ABL)]] system that enabled her to launch 32 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] missiles and 16 [[Harpoon missile]]s. She was also equipped with four [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx Close In Weapon System]] (CIWS) guns to shoot down enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s and aircraft. "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Casper W. Weinberger]] told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions."<ref>[http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/missouri/bb63-mo.html Quoted from chinfo.navy.mil]</ref>

Four months later, the nation's most accomplished battleship departed her new homeport of [[Naval Station Long Beach|Long Beach]] for an around-the-world cruise, bringing the message of "Strength for Freedom" to eight nations: [[Australia]], [[Diego Garcia]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Panama]]. ''Missouri'' became the first battleship to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe since [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s "[[Great White Fleet]]" 80 years before<U+2014>a fleet which included [[USS Missouri (BB-11)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-11)]], the first battleship of that name. 

In 1987, ''Missouri'' was given additional smaller-caliber weapons and sent to take part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the escorting of reflagged [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tankers]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. On [[25 July]], the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the [[Indian Ocean]] and North [[Arabian Sea]]. The ship spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment<U+2014>a striking contrast to the World Cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for [[Battlegroup Echo]], ''Missouri'' escorted the tanker [[convoy]]s into the [[Strait of Hormuz]], keeping the fire control system trained on land-based Iranian [[Silkworm missile|Silkworm]] missile launchers.

''Missouri'' returned to the United States via [[Diego Garcia]], [[Australia]] and [[Hawaii]] in early 1988. Several months later, ''Missouri's'' crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for the Rim of the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in [[Canada]], [[San Diego]], [[Seattle]] and [[Bremerton]].

1989 was a hectic year in the life of the ''Missouri''. The early months found the ship in the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard]] for routine maintenance. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend brought its share of [[fireworks]]. A few months later, the battleship departed for Pacific Exercise (PacEx)'89, where the ''Missouri'' and her sister ship the [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] performed a simultaneous gunfire demonstration for the [[aircraft carrier]]s [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|''Enterprise'']] and [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|''Nimitz'']]. The highlight of PacEx was a port visit in [[Pusan]], [[Republic of Korea]]. In 1990, ''Missouri'' again took part in the RimPac Exercise with ships from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] in addition to United States Navy ships.

=== Gulf War (1990 to 1991) ===
On [[2 August]] [[1990]], [[Iraq]]i dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] invaded the tiny emirate of Kuwait. In the middle of the month, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support to [[Saudi Arabia]] and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with the Iraqi dictator. ''Missouri'''s scheduled four-month Western Pacific port-to-port cruise set to begin in September was cancelled just a few days before the ship was to leave. She had been placed on hold in anticipation of being mobilized as forces continued to mass in the Middle East.

The word came. ''Missouri'' departed in mid-November for the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf. Amid the press coverage that a ship of the stature of ''Missouri'' is used to receiving, the historic [[Battleship|dreadnought]] pulled away from Pier 6 at [[Naval Station Long Beach|Long Beach]] and headed for Hawaii, her first stop on the long journey to the Persian Gulf. ''Missouri'''s crew celebrated [[Thanksgiving]] in [[Pearl Harbor]], then headed for the [[Philippines]] for more work-ups enroute to the [[Persian Gulf]]. Next stop after [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] was [[Pattaya Beach, Thailand]], for a couple days of liberty, amid the underway training for gunnery, General Quarters and defense against [[chemical weapon]]s.

''Missouri'' arrived in the Persian Gulf a few days into the new year of 1991, and immediately answered a distress call from a ship on fire in Persian Gulf waters. ''Missouri'' dispatched firefighting experts to help, and then journeyed on to the island emirate of [[Bahrain]]. 

After a very short liberty in Bahrain, ''Missouri'' headed north for operations. It was a few days after that, on [[17 January]] [[1991]] that the ship fired [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[missile]]s at Iraqi-held targets. These early morning launches helped mark the start of the war. As the United States and other countries around the world heard the words "The liberation of Kuwait has begun", ''Missouri'' continued to fire Tomahawks<U+2014>28 in all.

On [[29 January]] [[1991]] ''Missouri'', escorted by the frigate [[USS Curts (FFG-38)|''Curts'']], moved northward to engage Iraqi forces. In her first combat action of the Gulf War, ''Missouri''<U+2019>s gun crews sent 2,700&nbsp;pound (1200&nbsp;kg) shells crashing into an Iraqi command and control bunker just north of [[Khafji, Saudi Arabia]]. This marked the first time her 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea. ''Missouri''<U+2019>s gun crews returned to action [[5 February]], silencing an Iraqi artillery battery with another 10 rounds. Over a three-day period, ''Missouri'' bombarded Iraqi strongholds with 112 16&nbsp;inch shells. ''Missouri'' shared gunnery duties with her younger sister [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']], and the two battleships continued to hammer their targets with 16&nbsp;inch shells.

[[Image:Missouri Shoots.JPG|thumb|left|300px|''Missouri'' fires a [[broadside]] of her 16&nbsp;inch guns during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Both ''Missouri'' and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] fired their big guns in support of US and Coalition ground forces.]]

In support of the ongoing ground offensive ''Missouri'' trained her guns on [[Faylaka Island]] during the night of [[23 February]] in a pyrotechnic [[feint]] intended to convince Iraqi troops along the [[Kuwait]]i coast that the sea-borne invasion was imminent. ''Wisconsin'', escorted by the frigate [[USS McInerney (FFG-8)|''McInerney'']], joined her younger sister in the offshore bombardment to lend additional credibility to the threat of an allied [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasion]]. The feint worked, as Iraqi forces, believing that a sea-born invasion was imminent, reinforced their lines along the coast, allowing the real allied invasion force to circle around the coastal defense units. Shortly after ''Missouri''<U+2019>s shelling of Faylaka Island ''Wisconsin'' launched her [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] to spot for her 16&nbsp;inch guns. When ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s drone arrived over Faylaka Island it observed several Iraqi soldiers waving white flags following ''Missouri''<U+2019>s attack on their trench lines<U+2014>the first ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/pioneer.htm information taken fromt he Federation of American Scientists website]</ref> By the time President Bush ended hostilities both ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' had passed the million-pound (450 t) mark of ordnance delivered on Iraqi targets. During the [[Persian Gulf War]] the Iraqis fired two [[Silkworm missile]]s at the ship. One missile fell harmlessly into the sea, while the other was shot down by the Royal Navy destroyer [[HMS Gloucester (D96)|HMS ''Gloucester'']] using two [[Sea Dart missile]]s.

Iraq agreed to a [[Soviet Union]] proposed [[cease fire]] agreement on [[28 February]] [[1991]], ending the last war any battleship ever fought in.

In mid-March, ''Missouri'' made the long transit back to the West Coast, via two ports in Australia: [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. The ship returned to a joyous reunion with loved ones six months to the day after her departure.

=== Deactivation (1991 to 1992) ===
''Missouri'''s final year found the ship visiting [[Seattle, Washington]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and [[San Francisco, California]] The ship left for one final mission the day after Thanksgiving <!-- please provide a calendar date, Wikipedia is international and non-Americans do not know when the Americans celebrate their national holidays. The Calendar date in America for Thanksgiving is [[November 25]], so the day after Thanksgiving would be the 26th.--> 1991. Heading across the Pacific, "Mighty Mo's" last act of diplomacy was to visit [[Pearl Harbor]] for the remembrance of those who had died 50 years earlier on [[7 December]] [[1941]]. It was a rare sight to see the beginning and the end of U.S. involvement in World War II in the same port.

With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the corresponding perceived lack of a threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining battleships as part of the active fleet was deemed an ineffective expenditure. ''Missouri'', veteran of three wars, was decommissioned for the final time on [[31 March]] [[1992]] at [[Long Beach, California]]. Her last commanding officer, Captain [[Albert L. Kaiss]], wrote this note in the ship's final Plan of the Day:

{{Cquote|''"Our final day has arrived. Today the final chapter in battleship ''Missouri'''s history will be written. It's often said that the crew makes the command. There is no truer statement ... for it's the crew of this great ship that made this a great command. You are a special breed of sailors and Marines and I am proud to have served with each and every one of you. To you who have made the painful journey of putting this great lady to sleep, I thank you. For you have had the toughest job. To put away a ship that has become as much a part of you as you are to her is a sad ending to a great tour. But take solace in this<U+2014>you have lived up to the history of the ship and those who sailed her before us. We took her to war, performed magnificently and added another chapter in her history, standing side by side our forerunners in true naval tradition. God bless you all."''<ref>[http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/missouri/bb63-mo.html Quoted from chinfo.navy.mil]</ref>}}

=== Museum ship (1993 to present) ===

On [[4 May]] [[1998]], [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John H. Dalton]] signed the donation contract that transferred the historic battleship to the nonprofit USS ''Missouri'' Memorial Association (MMA) of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. The ship was towed from [[Bremerton, Washington]], on [[23 May]] to the Port of [[Astoria, Oregon]] where she sat in [[fresh water]] at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] to kill and drop the [[barnacle]]s and [[sea grass]]es that had grown on her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] in Bremerton. She was open to public tours for two days and then was towed across the eastern Pacific, and was gently docked at [[Ford Island, Pearl Harbor]] on [[22 June]], just 500&nbsp;yards (about 450&nbsp;meters) from the [[USS Arizona Memorial|''Arizona'' Memorial]]. Less than a year later, on [[29 January]] [[1999]], ''Missouri'' was opened as a museum operated by the MMA. 

Originally, the decision to move ''Missouri'' to Pearl Harbor was met with much resistance. Many people feared that the battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']], whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking during [[December 7]] air raid at Pearl Harbor has since become synonymous with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. To help guard against this perception ''Missouri'' was placed well back of the [[Arizona Memorial|''Arizona'' Memorial]], and positioned in Pearl Harbor in such a way as to prevent those participating in Military Ceremonies on ''Missouri''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s aft decks from seeing the ''Arizona'' Memorial. The decision to have ''Missouri''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow face the ''Arizona'' Memorial was intended to convey that ''Missouri'' now watches over the remains of the battleship ''Arizona'' so that those interred within ''Arizona''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the individual identities of the ''Arizona'' Memorial and the ''Missouri'' Memorial, which has improved the public<nowiki>'</nowiki>s perception of having both ''Arizona'' and ''Missouri'' in the same harbor.

''Missouri'' is not eligible for designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]], even though she is the last completed U.S. battleship and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on [[14 May]] [[1971]] for hosting the signing of the instrument of Japanese surrender that ended World War II. This is because much of her original equipment was removed when she was reactivated and modernized in 1986, and her configuration changed to accommodate new weapons, which resulted in a net loss of her historical integrity. Still, the battleship has secured her place in history, and her role as a museum in Pearl Harbor ensures that future generations will not forget her contribution.

According to museum officials, the ''Missouri'' is still owned by the U.S. Navy, and if needed can be restored and re-commissioned for active duty at any time.

''Missouri'' received three [[battle star]]s for her service in World War II, five for her service during the [[Korean War]], and three for her service during the [[Gulf War]].
