'''[[Romania]]''' competed at the '''[[1984 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[United States]]. 124 competitors, 71 men and 53 women, took part in 86 events in 13 sports.<ref name="sports-reference">{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/ROU/summer/1984/ |title=Romania at the 1984 Summer Games |accessdate=2011-05-13 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref> Notably, [[Romania]] was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] nation to participate at these Games; all others followed the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[boycott]] of the Games.  The Romanian athletes were greeted with warm applause as they entered the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] during the opening ceremony, in part an affirmation of the nation's defiance of the boycott. The Romanian olympic team was phenomenally successful at the games for a modestly populated nation, ultimately placing just under the [[United States]] in the gold medal tally.
