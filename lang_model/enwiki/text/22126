Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.  A quick start from Cambridge coupled with a poor one from Oxford saw the Light Blues take a third of a length lead before being reined back at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]].  A one-second lead at the mile post preceded a period of warnings from [[Referee#Rowing|umpire]] Ronnie Howard to both coxes as they contested the same water.<ref name=aggro>{{Cite newspaper | work = [[The Times]] | date = 8 April 1985 | title = Oxford's aggression steers them to a place in history | first = Jim | last = Railton | page = 13 | issue =62106}}</ref> Oxford held a [[Glossary of rowing terms#Equipment / parts of the boat|canvas]]' lead as the crews passed under [[Hammersmith Bridge]] and began to move away along [[Chiswick Eyot]].  A ten-second lead at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] became a thirteen second lead at the finishing post, as Oxford took the win by four and three-quarter lengths in a time of 17 minutes 11 seconds.<ref name=aggro/> This was Oxford's tenth consecutive victory, and their eleventh in twelve years, and took the overall record to 68&ndash;62 in favour of Cambridge.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 11 June 2014}}</ref>
