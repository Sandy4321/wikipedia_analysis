'''''The Mummy''''' is a [[1999 in film|1999]] American [[adventure film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Sommers]], starring [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Rachel Weisz]], with [[Arnold Vosloo]] in the title role as the reanimated [[mummy]]. The movie features substantial dialogue in ancient [[Egyptian language]], spoken with the assistance of a professional [[Egyptologist]]. It is a loose remake of '[[The Mummy (1932 film)|the 1932 film of the same name]] which starred [[Boris Karloff]] in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror franchise, the movie was eventually turned into a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] adventure film.

Filming began in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]] on [[May 4]], [[1998]] and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the [[Sahara desert]]. The visual effects were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] provided the orchestral score.

''The Mummy'' opened on [[May 7]], [[1999]] and grossed [[USD|$]]43&nbsp;million in 3,210&nbsp;theaters; the movie went on to gross $415&nbsp;million worldwide. Reception to the film was mixed, with reviewers alternatively praising or complaining about the special effects, the slapstick nature of the story and characters, and the stereotyped villains. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', as well as ''[[The Mummy: The Animated Series]]'', and the [[spin-off]] film ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. Another sequel, ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'', will open on [[August 1]], [[2008]]. [[Universal Studios]] also opened a [[roller coaster]], ''[[Revenge of the Mummy]]'', in 2004. The movie and its sequel's [[novelization]]s were written by [[Max Allan Collins]].

==Plot==
The movie begins in [[Egypt]], circa 1290 BC. High priest [[Imhotep#Modern cultural impact|Imhotep]] is having an affair with [[Ankhesenpaaten|Anck-su-namun]], the mistress of [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]. When the Pharaoh discovers this, Imhotep and Anck-su-namun murder the monarch. Anck-su-namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her [[crypt]] and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to [[Hamunaptra]], the city of the dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual can be completed, and Anck-su-namun's soul is sent back to the [[Underworld]].

As punishment for their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|mummified]] alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of ''Hom Dai'': his tongue is cut out, and he is buried alive, wrapped like a [[mummy]], along with a swarm of flesh-eating [[dung beetle|scarabs]]. The horror of the ritual is that it grants eternal life, forcing him to endure the agony of his wounds for all time. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a [[sarcophagus]] below a statue of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Anubis]], and kept under strict surveillance by the [[Medjay|Medjai]], descendants of Seti's palace guards<U+2014>if Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth. The Medouis started to fight the Medjai as they tried to free Imhotep.

Three thousand years later, in 1923, the American Rick O'Connell is serving as a captain in a unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]], which is traveling to Hamunaptra in search of the treasure rumored to be there. When they reach the fabled city, a group of Arabs attack. Left in charge when the unit's commanding officer deserts during the battle, Rick retreats into the city when the Arabs overrun his unit. Surrounded by his attackers, O'Connell thinks he will be killed, but on seeing that O'Connell is next to the statue of Anubis, the attackers flee. Rick is left to wander out of the desert; unknown to him, the battle was witnessed by a group of the Medjai.

Three years later, [[Cairo]] librarian and aspiring [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], Evelyn "Evie" Carnahan and her bumbling brother Jonathan contact Rick in prison. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn striking a deal with the warden to keep Rick from being hanged. Rick upholds his bargain and leads an expedition to Hamunaptra, where Rick's group encounters a band of treasure hunters led by the famed Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former friend of Rick who also knows the location of the lost city. The Medouis along with German, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Austrian, Italian, and Russian mercenaries who they hired follow the group.

Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, both groups are attacked by the Medjai, led by Ardeth Bey, who warns them of the evil buried in the city. Rather than heed Bey's warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city while the Medouis and the mercs split up to follow different ways to follow the expeditions and to look in another part. Evelyn is looking for the Book of Amon-Ra, a golden book capable of taking life away, but unexpectedly find the remains of Imhotep instead. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a box containing the [[Book of the Dead]], accompanied by [[canopic jar]]s carrying Anck-su-namun's preserved organs; each of the Americans takes a jar as loot.

At night, a Medouis takes the Book of the Dead from the Americans' tent and reads a page aloud, intentionally awakening Imhotep. The mummy with the help of the Medouis and the mercenaries hunts down the Americans who opened the box, slowly regenerating with each person he kills. Beni survives a meeting with Imhotep by pledging allegiance to him and helps him track down the remaining Americans and the canopic jars. Evelyn realizes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amon-Ra can kill the high priest once again; soon after this, seven Germans and Bulgarians captures Evelyn and brings her to Imhotep, who intends to sacrifice her to resurrect Anck-su-namun. Rick and Jonathan rescue Evelyn and, after an intensive battle with Imhotep's mummies, thwart his attempts. Evelyn reads from the Book of Amon-Ra, which takes away Imhotep's immortality, and Rick kills him.

As they are leaving, Beni falls behind to plunder the treasures of the lost city and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. They surround him and kill him as his torch flame goes out. The heroes escape and ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels, unaware that their saddlebags are packed with the treasures that Beni looted earlier. The Medouis and the European mercenaries escape the pyramid.

*'''[[Arnold Vosloo]]''' as '''High Priest Imhotep''': One of Pharoah Seti I's most trusted advisers, Imhotep betrays his sovereign out of love for Anck-su-namun. [[South Africa]]n stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay, but only agreed to take on the role of Imhotep "if I could do it absolutely straight.

==Production==
===Origins===
In 1992, producer James Jacks decided to update the original ''Mummy'' film for the 1990s.<ref name= "Cinescape">{{cite news | title = ''The Mummy'' That Wasn't | publisher = Cinescape | date = [[May 3]], [[1999]] | }}</ref> [[Universal Studios]] gave him the go-ahead, but only if he kept the budget around $10&nbsp;million.<ref name= "Hobson">{{cite news | last = Hobson | first = Louis B | title = Universal rolls out new, improved ''Mummy'' |  publisher = [[Calgary Sun]] | date = [[May 1]], [[1999]] | }}</ref> The producer remembers that the studio "essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise";<ref name= "Hobson"/> in response, Jacks recruited horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]] on-board to direct. Barker<U+2019>s vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.<ref name= "Slotek">{{cite news | last = Slotek | first = Jim | title = Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = [[May 2]], [[1999]] | }}</ref><ref name= "Cinescape"/> Jacks recalls that Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",<ref name= "Hobson"/> and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".<ref name= "Slotek"/> After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company. Filmmaker [[George A. Romero]] was brought in with a vision of a zombie-style horror movie similar to ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', but this was considered too scary by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture.<ref name= "Hobson"/>

[[Joe Dante]] was the next choice, increasing the budget for his idea of [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as a brooding Mummy.<ref name= "Hobson"/> This version (co-written by [[John Sayles]]) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story.<ref name= "Slotek"/> It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, making it to the final product.<ref name= "Cinescape"/> However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15&nbsp;million and rejected Dante<U+2019>s version. Soon after, [[Mick Garris]] was attached to direct but eventually left the project,<ref name= "Chase">{{cite news | last = Chase | first = Donald | title = What Have They Unearthed? |  publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = [[May 3]], [[1999]] | }}</ref> and [[Wes Craven]] was offered the film but turned it down.<ref name= "Slotek"/> Then, Stephen Sommers called Jacks in 1997 with his vision of ''The Mummy'' "as a kind of [[Indiana Jones]] or ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time".<ref name= "Hobson"/> Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale.<ref name= "Snead">{{cite news | last = Snead | first = Elizabeth | title = Updating A Well-Preserved Villain |  publisher = [[USA Today]]| date = [[May 7]], [[1999]] | }}</ref> He had wanted to make a ''Mummy'' film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment.<ref name= "Cinescape"/> At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web | first=Liane | last=Bonin | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84361,00.html | title=That's a Wrap | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=1999-05-07 | accessdate= 2008-04-01}}</ref> Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.<ref name= "Argent">{{cite news| last = Argent | first = Daniel| title = Unwrapping ''The Mummy'': An Interview with Stephen Sommers |  publisher = Creative Screenwriting | date = 1999 }}</ref>

===Principal photography===
Filming began in [[Marrakech, Morocco]] on [[May 4]], [[1998]] and lasted 17&nbsp;weeks. Photography then moved to the [[Sahara desert]] outside the small town of Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on [[August 29]], [[1998]].<ref name= "behind">{{cite web | title = Behind the Scenes | work = The Mummy Official Site|publisher=Universal Studios | year = 1999 | url = http://www.mummyvideo.com/bhs/| accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}</ref> The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions.<ref name= "Portman">{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = ''Mummy'' Unearths Horror, Humour | publisher = [[Ottawa Citizen]] | date = [[May 5]], [[1999]] | }}</ref> To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours.<ref name= "Braund"/> Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.<ref name= "Portman"/> Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, "He [Fraser] stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated."<ref name= "Jones, Alison"/> The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them,<ref name= "Slotek"/> a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.<ref name="show me 3">{{cite web|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273360_3,00.html|title=Show Me The Mummy (page 3)|author=Staff|date=1999-05-14|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>

Production Designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the location because, "A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano."<ref name= "behind"/> A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at [[Shepperton Studios]], where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16&nbsp;weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes.<ref name= "behind"/> Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] which doubled for the [[Giza]] Port on the [[River Nile]]. This set was {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} in length and featured "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".<ref name= "behind"/>

===Special effects===
The filmmakers reportedly spent $15&nbsp;million of the $80&nbsp;million budget on special effects, provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]];<ref name="modern mummy"/><ref name= "Slotek2">{{cite news| last = Slotek| first = Jim| title = ''Mummy'' Unwraps a New Fraser "Cartoon" Character | publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = 1999-05-09}}</ref> the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies.<ref name="modern mummy"/> John Andrew Berton, Jr., [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s Visual Effects Supervisor on ''The Mummy'', started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used [[motion capture]] in order to achieve "a menacing and very realistic Mummy".<ref name= "behind"/> Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.<ref name="modern mummy">{{cite journal | first=Estelle | last=Shay | title=Thoroughly modern Mummy | journal=[[Cinefex]] | year=1999 | month=April | volume= | issue=77 | pages=71<U+2013>76 | quote=On the special effects used in the film, and on the company who made them, Industrial Light & Magic. }}</ref>

To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, "When you see his film image, that<U+2019>s him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, that<U+2019>s really his face. And that<U+2019>s why it was so hard to do."<ref name= "behind"/> Vosloo described the filming as a "whole new thing" for him; "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree."<ref name="show me 3"/> Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.<ref name= "Portman"/>

==Soundtrack==
The music for ''The Mummy'' was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], with additional orchestrations provided by [[Alexander Courage]].<ref name=amg/> The soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on [[May 4]], [[1999]]. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements;<ref name="score reviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219|title=The Mummy (Jerry Goldsmith) Soundtrack Review|work=ScoreReviews.com|accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref> Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work.<ref name="score reviews"/>

Overall, Goldsmith's score was well-received. [[All Music Guide]] described it as a "grand, melodramatic score" which delivered the expected highlights.<ref name=amg>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:a9fqxqekldae|title=Allmusic: The Mummy (1999 Original Score)|work=[[All Music Guide]]|accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref> Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall.<ref name=TrackSounds>{{cite web|author=Coleman, Christopher|year=2000|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/themummy.htm|title=The Mummy by Jerry Goldsmith|work=TrackSounds.com|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref><ref name="score reviews"/> On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion,<ref name="filmtracks">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mummy.html|title=The Mummy: Editorial Review|work=FilmTracks.net|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition.<ref name="score reviews"/> Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as "representative of both Goldsmith<U+2019>s absolute best and his most mediocre. Thankfully [...] his favourable work on this release wins out."<ref name=TrackSounds/>

[[Stephen Holden]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "This version of ''The Mummy'' has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think ''Night of the Living Dead'' stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant.

==Adaptations==

''The Mummy''{{'}}s box office performance led to numerous sequels and spinoffs. In 2001, the sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' was released; the film features most of the surviving principal characters, as a married Rick and Evelyn confront Imhotep and the [[Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Scorpion King]].<ref name="rolling stone- mummy return"/> The film also introduced the heroes' son, [[Characters related to The Mummy#Alexander 'Alex' O'Connell|Alex]].<ref name="rolling stone- mummy return">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949327/review/5949328/the_mummy_returns|title=The Mummy Returns|author=Travers, Peter|date=2001-05-09|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> The two films inspired both an [[animated series]] called ''[[The Mummy: The Animated Series]]'' and lasted two seasons, and a [[spin-off]] prequel, ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002), telling the story of the Akkadian warrior as he was crowned king.

A second sequel, ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'', is set to be released in 2008, with the story taking place in [[China]], and Rachel Weisz being replaced with [[Maria Bello]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Garrett, Diane | coauthors=Fleming, Michael  | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962923.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Fraser returns for 'Mummy 3' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-04-11]] | accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964831.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Bello replaces Weisz in 'Mummy' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-05-13]] | accessdate=2007-05-13 }}</ref> A prequel to ''The Scorpion King'', ''[[The Scorpion King: Rise of the Akkadian]]'', is also in production.
