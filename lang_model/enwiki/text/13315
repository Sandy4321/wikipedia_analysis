Erhard was first known for the "est Training" (1971<U+2013>1983) and the <U+201C>Forum<U+201D> (1984<U+2013>1991), which were offered to the public through an organizational structure that included Erhard Seminars Training Inc. (1971<U+2013>1975), est, an educational corporation (1975<U+2013>1981), and Werner Erhard & Associates (WEA, 1981<U+2013>1991). Erhard, along with John Denver, Robert W. Fuller, and others, founded The Hunger Project in 1977.

In 1991, Erhard retired from business, sold his intellectual properties to a group of his former employees (who formed Landmark Education) and moved abroad.

The newly-renamed Erhards moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

In 1961, Erhard sold [[correspondence course]]s in the Midwest, then [[California]], and eventually moved to [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|85}} After a few months, he took a job with [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'s [[Great Books of the Western World|"Great Books"]] program, and was soon promoted to area training manager. In January 1962 Erhard switched to the Parent's Magazine Cultural Institute, a child development materials division of ''[[Parents Magazine]]''.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|112}} In the summer of 1962 he was promoted to the position of territorial manager for California, [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]], and moved to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]; and in the spring of 1963 to Los Angeles.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|82-106}} In January 1964, "Parents" promoted Erhard and transferred him to [[Arlington, Virginia]] as a southeast manager.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|94}} In August 1964, Erhard resigned his position in Arlington over a dispute with the company president and returned to his previous position in San Francisco.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|107-114}}

In 1967 Erhard was promoted to vice president.<ref>[[Bartley, William Warren]], ''[[Werner Erhard The Transformation of a Man]]'': ''The Founding of EST'', Clarkson Potter, 1978. ISBN 0-517-53502-5 pages 117-138</ref> 

===Early influences===
In California in the 1960s Erhard engaged in a variety of [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[New Age]] and [[Landmark Education Vocabulary|transformative]] activities.

Tipton wrote: 'Erhard calls Zen Buddhism the <U+201C>essential<U+201D> one of all the disciplines that he has studied.<ref>Steven M. Tipton: Getting saved from the sixties: moral meaning in conversion and cultural change. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1982, page 329. ISBN 0520038681</ref> and 'Various observers of ''est'' have traced its ideas to Zen, [[Vedanta]], and [[Christian perfectionism|Christian Perfectionism]]; [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] [[determinism]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and [[Fritz Perls|Perls]]; [[Alfred Korzybski|Korzybski]]'s ''[[General Semantics]]'', [[Norman Vincent Peale]]'s ''The Power of Positive Thinking'', [[Napoleon Hill]]'s ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'', and the self-image psychology of [[Maxwell Maltz]]'s ''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]''. Its methods have been traced to [[hypnosis]], [[autosuggestion]], [[revivalism]], [[psychodrama]], [[encounter group|encounter]], [[Gestalt therapy]] and [[behavior modification]]; [[Subud]] and [[yoga]]; military, monastic, and penal institutions, sales and business motivation courses.<ref>Steven M. Tipton: ''Getting saved from the sixties: moral meaning in conversion and cultural change''. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1982, page 329. ISBN 0520038681</ref>

Bartley noted in his biography of Erhard that in addition to [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Dale Carnegie]] courses, [[Maxwell Maltz]]'s [[Psycho-Cybernetics]], [[Fritz Perls]]' [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[transpersonal psychology]], [[Scientology]], and [[Subud]], were among other psychological and [[spirituality|spiritual]] influences.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|13,121,141}} 

In 1963 Erhard took part in [[Esalen]] seminars, becoming involved with [[encounter group]]s.<ref>[http://www.agpf.de/Erhard-Kult.htm AGPF web-page on Erhard, est etc]: "1963 nimmt Erhard an Esalen-Seminaren teil.

====Zen====
In William Bartley's biography, ''Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, the Founding of est'' (1978), Erhard describes these explorations. Bartley quotes Erhard as acknowledging Zen as the essential contribution that "created the space for" est.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|146,147}} Bartley details Erhard's connections with Zen beginning with his extensive studies with [[Alan Watts]] in the mid 1960s<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|118}} Bartley quotes Erhard as acknowledging:
<blockquote>
Of all the disciplines that I studied, practiced, learned, Zen was the essential one. It was not so much an influence on me, rather it created space. It allowed those things that were there to be there. It gave some form to my experience. And it built up in me the critical mass from which was kindled the experience that produced est.<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|118}} 
</blockquote>

====Scientology====
William Bartley, in his biography of Werner Erhard, wrote: 
<blockquote>
<U+201C>When I asked Werner to sum up the differences between est and Scientology, he reflected for a moment.

'...The essential difference between est and Scientology is two-fold. The first has to do with Scientology<U+2019>s emphasis on survival and its idea that the purpose of life is survival.  est sees the purpose of life as wholeness or completion <U+2013> truth <U+2013> not survival..<br>
The other main difference between est and Scientology lies in the treatment of knowing.  Ron Hubbard seems to have no difficulty in codifying the truth and in urging people to believe it.  But I suspect all codifications, particularly my own.  In presenting my own ideas, I emphasize their [[epistemological]] context.  I hold them as pointers to the truth, not as the truth itself.<br>
I don<U+2019>t think anyone ought to believe the ideas that we use in est.  The est philosophy is not a belief system and most certainly ought not to be believed.  In any case, even the truth, when believed, is a lie.  You must experience the truth, not believe it.'<ref name="erhard-transform"/>{{rp|151,157}} </blockquote>

==The era of the est training (1971 - 1984)==
Erhard reported having experienced a revelation while driving across the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] on [[U.S. Route 101]] in [[Marin County, California]] in 1971. He started to see the world as perfect "the way it is" and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world (that it should differ from "the way it is") that precluded or at least limited one's experiential and creative appreciation of it. Erhard, who had become an instructor of [[Mind Dynamics]]<ref>[[Pressman, Steven]], ''[[Outrageous Betrayal]]: The dark journey of Werner Erhard from est to exile''.

==Werner Erhard and Associates (1981 - 1991) and "the Forum"==

of Chile and businessman <U+2014> on aspects of language, setting up sets of practices which make a distinction between, on the one hand "speaking that describes being" with, on the other hand, "speaking that brings forth being". These seminars culminated in Erhard's announcement in 1984 of the retirement of the est-training, after the participation of 750,000 "graduates", and its replacement by a new program called "the Forum", inaugurated in January 1985.

Erhard intended this new "work" to acquire more mainstream respectability and to appeal to business and management markets. What est had called "space" or the "space of being" now became "the domain of possibility" or the "possibility of being for human beings". Where part of est's "Day 4" had included a "three-circle talk" on "being, doing, and having", the Forum now featured three distinctions of the domains of "possibility, presence, and representation"<ref>See ''Industry Weekly'' June 15, 1987 article (vol 233, no 6), "Create Breakthroughs in Performance by Changing the Conversation," by Perry Pascarella; among other sources forthcoming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}</ref>

On February 1, 1991,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} some of the employees of Werner Erhard and Associates purchased the assets of WE&A, licensed the right to use its intellectual property and assumed some of its liabilities, paying $3 million and committing to remitting up to $15 million over the following 18 years in licencing fees.<ref>

==1991 - present==

Since his retirement in 1991, Erhard has kept a low profile, except for a few public appearances. He appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in an episode titled "Whatever Happened to Werner Erhard?" via satellite from [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] on December 8, 1993. {{As of|2001}} Erhard maintained a residence with Gonneke Spits in [[Georgetown, Cayman Islands]]<ref name="paymoney">[http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/4932/ Pay Money, Be Happy], ''New York Magazine'', [[Vanessa Grigoriadis]], July 9, 2001.</ref>

He has worked in the area of peace and reconciliation in [[Northern Ireland]] with author Peter Block.<ref name="peterblock">[http://www.masteryfoundation.org/peace/ireland/blockanderhard Mastery Foundation]</ref> He attended an event on May 11, 2004 at the [[John F.

The event took place in honor of a friend, [[Warren Bennis]], who had taken [[Erhard Seminars Training]] and then consulted for [[Werner Erhard and Associates]].   

In recent years Werner has devoted his time to academic investigation, and presentations in writing and lectures of his ideas.

== Public perception ==
The psychiatrist [[Marc Galanter (MD)|Marc Galanter]] described Erhard as "a man with no formal experience in mental health, self help, or religious revivalism, but a background in retail sales."<ref>Marc Galanter: ''[[Cults: Faith, Healing and Coercion|Cults: faith, healing, and coercion]]''. New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. ISBN 9780195056310 , page 80.</ref>

[[Michael Zimmerman]], Philosophy Professor at Tulane University:    
 <blockquote>   
   He (Erhard) had no particular formal training in anything, but he understood things as well as anyone I<U+2019>d ever seen. And I<U+2019>ve been around a lot of smart people in academia. This is an extraordinary intellect I saw at work here, and a difficult personality.   
    
   Werner would be the first to admit that he learned a lot from other people. He has debts to other thinkers, to various religious traditions. When I teach my class on Heidegger, for example, I start out with referring to the influences on [[Heidegger]]<U+2019>s thought: Aristotle, Plato, Kant, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard <U+2013> so many thinkers. So Werner, I think, has to be conceived in that way. He<U+2019>s a kind of artist, a thinker, an inventor, who has big debts to others, borrowed from others, but then put the whole thing together in a way that no one else had ever done.<ref name="symon-transformation">{{imdb title|0849480|Transformation: The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard}}, Documentary, 2006, Directed by Robyn Symon. http://www.transformationfilm.com/</ref>

As noted in Sports Illustrated, Tiger Woods' father said "What I learned through est was that by doing more for myself, I could do much more for others.  Which is where Tiger comes in. What I learned led me to give so much time to Tiger, and to give him the space to be himself, and not to smother him with dos and don'ts. I took out the authority aspect and turned it into companionship. I made myself vulnerable as a parent. When you have to earn respect from your child, rather than demanding it because it's owed to you as the father, miracles happen. I realized that, through him, the giving could take a quantum leap.
