[[Image:Ivan Sat Img Sept 7 2004.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Satellite image of Hurricane Ivan passing through Lesser Antilles]]
The '''effects of [[Hurricane Ivan]] in the Lesser Antilles and South America''' included 44&nbsp;deaths and over $1&nbsp;billion in damage (2004&nbsp;USD), primarily on [[Grenada]] where it was considered the worst hurricane in nearly 50&nbsp;years. Ivan developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 2]] and rapidly intensified to become a major hurricane, passing through the southern [[Lesser Antilles]] on [[September 7]] with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). At the time its tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 160&nbsp;miles (260&nbsp;km) with hurricane force winds outward to 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km),<ref name="adv22">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2004|title=Hurricane Avila Public Advisory Twenty-Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-11-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/pub/al092004.public.022.shtml?}}</ref> and the northern portion of the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] passed over Grenada.

In the region, the worst damage occurred on Grenada, where the damage total of $1.1&nbsp;billion (2004&nbsp;USD, $1.2&nbsp;billion 2007&nbsp;USD) represented 200% of its [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. The hurricane damaged more than 14,000&nbsp;homes in the nation, and 30% of the houses in the nation were destroyed which left about 18,000&nbsp;people homeless. A total of 39&nbsp;people were killed by the hurricane. Elsewhere, moderate damage was reported in northern [[Venezuela]], where at least three fatalities were reported. One person died each on [[Trinidad]] and [[Barbados]]. The name ''Ivan'' was later [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]].<ref name="wmo"/>

==Preparations==
Early in its duration, the [[National Hurricane Center]] consistently forecasted Ivan to track further to the north than in actuality. Late on [[September 5]], the government of [[Barbados]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for its territory. Shortly thereafter, [[Saint Lucia]] was put under a hurricane watch and [[Grenada]] and its dependencies were put under a tropical storm watch. As the hurricane approached the southern [[Lesser Antilles]], more watches were issued, and by 24&nbsp;hours prior to Ivan passing through the island chain a hurricane warning was in effect for Barbados, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Tobago]], and [[Grenada]], and a tropical storm warning was in effect for [[Trinidad]]. With the path of Ivan more southerly than predicted, the hurricane warnings were dropped to tropical storm warnings for the northern islands, and by late on [[September 7]] when the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of the hurricane passed near Grenada, hurricane warnings were in effect for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Grenada. Subsequently, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of [[Venezuela]] through the [[Guajira Peninsula]] of [[Columbia]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Stacy Stewart|year=2004|title=Hurricane Ivan Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-10-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004ivan.shtml?}}</ref>

===Grenada===
[[Image:Grenada ivan.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Damage on Grenada]]
Passing just to the south of the island, Hurricane Ivan produced strong winds on [[Grenada]], with sustained winds reaching 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) and gusts peaking at 133&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) at [[Point Salines International Airport]]; the airport recorded 5.26&nbsp;inches (134&nbsp;mm) of precipitation during the hurricane's passage.<ref name="wmo"/> Of the nation's six [[Parishes of Grenada|parishes]], the four southernmost ones were most severely affected, constituting 80% of the total population.<ref name="usaid">{{cite web|author=John Wilson|year=2004|title=Hurricane Ivan Grenada Community Revitalization|publisher=United States Agency for International Development|accessdate=2007-11-21|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/IEEs/grenada/IEE04_76.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The government of [[Barbados]] created a Hurricane Ivan Housing Recovery Project, which repaired or rebuilt 190&nbsp;houses for people without the available funds; around 90 homes required minor immediate repairs, while the rest required significant reconstruction. The project finished in early 2006 for a total of $5&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;[[Barbadian dollar|BBD]], $2.8&nbsp;2007&nbsp;[[USD]]).<ref name="gob113"/>

Several nearby countries assisted [[Grenada]] in its aftermath. The government of [[Guyana]] shipped about $250,000 (2004&nbsp;USD, $40&nbsp;million 2004&nbsp;GYD) worth of sugar, as well as 100&nbsp;members of the Guyana Defense Force to assist in restoring order and reconstruction. The government of [[Trinidad & Tobago]] sent 190&nbsp;policemen, and the government of [[Anguilla]] sent 1,230&nbsp;cases of water. A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide the support that Grenada needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Miranda La Rose|date=2004-09-17|title=One hundred soldiers headed for Grenada|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=2007-12-04|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/index.pl/article_general_news?id=8664253}}</ref> Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of [[Grenada]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) deployed 67,600&nbsp;gallons of water, 500&nbsp;rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000&nbsp;liter water bladder kits, and a water treatment kit;<ref>{{cite web|author=USAID Press Office|year=2004|title=U.S. Providing Assistance to Grenada|accessdate=2007-11-21|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/releases/2004/pr040909.html}}</ref> assistance from USAID totaled $6&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation.<ref name="usaindex"/> In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Commission Humanitarian aid Office]] (ECHO) provided <U+20AC>3&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;[[Euro|EUR]]).
