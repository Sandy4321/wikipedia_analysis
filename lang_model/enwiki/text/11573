'''State Highway 329''' or '''SH 329''' is a [[state highway]] that runs from [[Grandfalls, Texas|Grandfalls]] in southwestern [[Texas]] east and southeast to [[Rankin, Texas|Rankin]].

==History==
The route was originally designated in 1940 as the part of the highway from Grandfalls to Crane. The part of the route from Crane to Rankin was added to the designation in 1990, transferred from '''Farm to Market Road 870'''.

==Route description==
Beginning at a junction with [[Texas State Highway 18|SH 18]] at Grandfalls in [[Ward County, Texas|Ward County]], SH 329 runs east to a junction with [[U.S. Highway 385 (Texas)|US 385]] at [[Crane, Texas|Crane]] in [[Crane County, Texas|Crane County]]. In Grandfalls the highway is known as 1st Street; in Crane it is known as 6th Street.
