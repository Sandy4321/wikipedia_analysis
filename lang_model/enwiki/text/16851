'''''Gradius V''''' is a Japanese-developed [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] published by [[Konami]] for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]] in 2004. ''Gradius V'' was largely developed under contract by the [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] team responsible for ''[[Radiant Silvergun]]'' and ''[[Ikaruga]]'' under supervision of Konami's internal development studio, [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]].

The game is set predominantly in [[outer space]] where players control a fictional [[spacecraft]] called [[Vic Viper]] through a continuously scrolling background depicting the territories of Bacterian&mdash;an evil empire which serves as the player's enemy.<ref name="Manual45">Gradius V instruction manual, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref>

==Mechanics==
The game takes place as a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[scrolling shooter]] with the Vic Viper contending with formations of enemies, both stationary and moving, that fire bullets.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Ed |title=Gradius V |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/547/547707p1.html}}</ref> Players go through levels consisting of open space and others consisting of maneuvering through close quarters which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling.<ref name="Lewis"/><ref name="1UP">{{cite web |author=1UP Staff |title=Gradius V (PS2) |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3134612&did=1}}</ref> Should players come into contact with anything on the screen, the Vic Viper explodes, and they lose a life.<ref name="Lewis"/> In ''Gradius V'', the hit box (the pixels which must be touched by an object to destroy the ship) has been reduced in size to allow players to get through small areas more easily.<ref name="Turner">{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |title=Gradius V |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/gradius-v/547712p1.html}}</ref> ''Gradius V'' marks the first time in the series in which players can reappear immediately and resume the game from where they lose a life ever since Salamander series. Alternatively, players may also restart at a previously cleared checkpoint depending on the game's settings.<ref name="Lewis"/> If all lives are lost players have the option to [[continue (video games)|continue]] and restart the game from where they left off. Players receive extra lives after scoring a certain number of points as indicated in the game's settings,<ref>Gradius V Instruction Manual, pp. 8.</ref> and players may receive extra continues depending on how much total playing time has been accumulated.<ref name="Manual6"/>

The game can be played with [[single-player|one player]] or with two players simultaneously.<ref name="Scalzo">{{cite web |last=Scalzo |first=John |title=Gradius V |publisher=[[Gaming Target]] |date=2004-12-02 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=3809}}</ref> After players start the game, they will enter a "Select Weapon Array" screen, where they may select the types of [[power-up]]s they will use through the course of the game.<ref name="Manual6">Gradius V Instruction Manual, pp. 6.</ref> There is also an unlockable feature called "Weapon Edit" in which players can access if certain conditions are met. In this mode, they can customize the Vic Viper with various combinations of weapons found in the "Select Weapon Array" screen, from earlier ''Gradius'' games, or new weaponry.<ref name="Manual11">Gradius V Instruction Manual, pp. 11.</ref> Players are able to start the game from the beginning or at any stage that was previously cleared. Players can also play a "Score Attack" mode, where they play the game from the beginning under specific parameters. At the end of "Score Attack" mode, players receive a password which allows them to post their highest achieved score on the Internet.<ref>Gradius V instruction manual, pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref> [[File:Gradius V screen01.jpg|thumb|left|The player is confronted by several enemies and uses the multiple control mechanic to direct the ship's weapons.]]Finally, players have the option to view the highest local scores, save or load game data using a PlayStation 2 memory card, or to adjust the game's settings, including stereo or monoural sound, difficulty, number of lives available, the number of points required to earn extra lives, the ability to restart from a [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]] or immediately after being destroyed, or button configuration.<ref>Gradius V instruction manual, pp. 7<U+2013>9.</ref>

Throughout the game, players can accumulate various [[power-up]] capsules after destroying certain enemies or enemy formations. Collecting a power-up capsule moves a yellow cursor on the power meter at the bottom of the screen. Pressing the "Power-Up" button will award the player the power-up that is highlighted on the power meter. The types of power-ups that can be obtained throughout the course of the game are selected at the "Select Weapon Array" and "Weapon Edit" menus before starting.<ref name="Manual11"/> The cursor cycles through the following power-ups in order: "Speed Up", "Missile", "Double", "Laser", "Multiple", and "Shield".<ref name="Lewis"/> With the "Speed Up" power-up, players are able to increase speeds of their ships; with the "Missile" power-up, players can launch air-to-surface missiles to destroy ground targets; and with the "Double" power-up, players can fire an additional gun that fires in another direction other than forward. The "Laser" power-up allows players to fire enemy-piercing lasers, the "Force Field" power-up gives players three additional hits before being destroyed, and "Multiple" power-up gives players clones (also called "Options") that shadow their movements and mimic their firing.<ref name="Manual12">Gradius V Instruction Manual, pp. 12.</ref> A new feature in ''Gradius V'' gives players the ability to control their "Multiples" with the push of a button, depending on which weaponry was selected before starting the game. By pressing a button, players can freeze their Multiples in place, cause them to rotate around the Vic Viper, control the direction of their fire, or spread them out above and below the ship.<ref name="Turner"/><ref name="Manual12"/>

In an interview with the game's producer Yasushi Takano on the promotional [[DVD]], ''Gradius Breakdown'', Takano said that he felt the traditional ''Gradius'' formula had become stagnant and expressed a desire for a new direction in order for the series to remain relevant,<ref name="Breakdown">{{cite video|date=September 2004 | title = Gradius Breakdown | medium = DVD | location = North America | publisher = Konami}}</ref> he also admitted that some of their early work was not as impressive as it would later become.
The game went through several revisions and the game was subsequently delayed and made frequent appearances at [[trade fair]]s including the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and [[Tokyo Game Show]]. Plans were also made to produce a counterpart for [[video arcade]]s alongside the console version, but it was canceled because of time constraints.<ref name="Breakdown"/>

===Audio===
The soundtrack was composed by freelance composer [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] whose previous video game work includes the soundtrack to the [[tactical role-playing game]] ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', the shoot'em up ''[[Radiant Silvergun]]'' and the [[action game|action]]/RPG hybrid ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. Sakimoto noted in an interview that "It was a great honor for me to able to work on a title like this, but also very stressful" and names the original ''[[Gradius]]'' as an important source of inspiration on his work.<ref name="sakimoto">{{cite web | title = Hitoshi Sakimoto interview | publisher= CocoeBiz | url = http://www.cocoebiz.com/sakimoto/interviews/interview04.shtml | accessdate = 2006-06-22 | author = Ezaki, Kahori | coauthors = McCawley, James | date = 2004-09-16}}</ref> He also revealed that his clients requested a music style that would be reminiscent of the earlier games, and the soundtrack as a result comprises remixes of music used in previous ''Gradius'' titles as well as original tracks.<ref name="sakimoto"/> Synthesized [[Musical instrument|orchestral instrument]]s were used throughout the production of the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hitoshi Sakimoto Interview - PALGN Interview | url = http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=5761 | publisher = PALGN | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | author = Larsen, Phil | date = 2006-11-06 | quote = but regarding Gradius V, I used orchestral instruments to make the whole work consistent.}}</ref>

The soundtrack was released separately on [[Compact Disc|CD]] as ''Gradius V Soundtracks'' by Konami Media Entertainment in Japan on August 18, 2004, and features 22 tracks.<ref>{{cite web ||url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=KOLA-081 |title=Chudah's Corner - Gradius V Soundtracks |accessdate=6 September 2010}}</ref>

===Bundling===
On April 9, 2004, Konami announced that a DVD called ''OPTIONS'' was being offered to [[pre-order]]ing customers in Japan containing interviews with the developers, art galleries and a number of recorded playthroughs demonstrating the inner workings of the game's stages.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gradius Preorder Bonus | publisher=IGN Entertainment | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/505/505360p1.html | accessdate=2006-07-25| author = Hitmitsu, Suppai | date = 2004-04-09}}</ref> Adding further incentive for customers to purchase the upcoming game, Konami later revealed the availability of ''The History of Vic Viper''&mdash;a book indicating inner design, the background and the roadmap of the Vic Viper ships. The book was included with all versions of the original Japanese pressing of the game.<ref name="bonus">{{cite web | title=Early Gradius V Bonus | publisher=IGN Entertainment | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/519/519246p1.html | accessdate=2006-07-25 | author = Dunham, Jeremy | date = 2004-05-26}}</ref> An additional DVD with expanded content titled ''Gradius V Official DVD The Perfect'' was also released in Japan to be ordered separately or with the game from Konami's online retail store, Konamistyle.<ref name="bonus"/>. For the North American release of the game, Konami produced a DVD called ''Gradius Breakdown'' as a pre-order incentive. ''Breakdown'' includes a retrospective of the ''Gradius'' series and a number of recorded playthroughs of the game.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gradius V Breakdown DVD - The Next Level Show and Tell | url = http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/promos/gradius-v-breakdown/ | accessdate = 2007-11-02 | date = 2004-10-22 | publisher = The Next Level | author = Cunningham, James}}</ref>

Konami also held an online high score ranking competition in the US and the winners received a director's cut version of the ''Gradius Breakdown'' DVD that included more concept art and additional playthroughs of some of the later levels in ''Gradius V''.

Overall, ''Gradius V'' received positive reviews from magazines and websites and amassed a [[Metacritic]] rating index of 82, based on 46 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | title= Gradius V for PlayStation 2 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic | publisher = Metacritic | url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/gradius-v | accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> Positive response tends to focus on the intricate [[level design]], graphical excellence, and "old school" appeal of the [[shoot 'em up]] genre. Most negative criticism highlights the difficulty of the game, as well as what is deemed an over-reliance on established genre conventions, to which [[G4tv.com]] said that "While the action is always constant and involving, the lack of variation and the need to be in an exact spot at an exact time is simply not going to strike everyone as fun."<ref>{{cite web | title=Gradius V for PlayStation 2 - Reviews - G4tv.com | date=22 October 2004 | author=D'Aprile, Jason | publisher=G4tv.com | url=http://g4tv.com/games/ps2/18950/gradius-v/review/ | accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>
