'''Animal cognition''' is the name given to the study of the mental capacities of non-human [[animal]]s. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], including the study of animal conditioning and learning, but has also been strongly influenced by research in [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].  The alternative name [[cognitive ethology]] is therefore sometimes used; much of what used to be considered under the title of ''animal intelligence'' is now thought of under this heading.<ref name ="Shett">Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution and Behavior'' (2nd ed) New York: Oxford.</ref> 

Research in animal cognition mostly concerns [[mammals]], especially [[primate intelligence|primates]], [[Cetacean intelligence|cetaceans]], and [[elephant intelligence|elephants]], as well as [[Dog intelligence|dogs]], [[Cat intelligence|cats]], [[raccoons]] and [[rodents]]. However, research also extends to non-mammalian [[vertebrates]] such as [[bird intelligence|birds]] including [[Parrots#Intelligence_and_learning|parrots]], [[Corvidae#Intelligence|corvids]], and [[Pigeon intelligence|pigeons]], as well as to [[reptiles]] such as [[Monitor_lizard#Intelligence|lizards]], [[snakes]], and [[fish]], even to [[invertebrates]] such as [[cephalopod intelligence|cephalopods]], [[Pain in invertebrates#Cognitive abilities|spiders]], and [[Pain in invertebrates#Cognitive abilities|insects]].<ref name ="Shett" />

== Historical background ==
{{ethology}}

=== Animal cognition from anecdote to laboratory ===

The behavior of non-human animals has captivated human imagination from antiquity, and over the centuries many writers have speculated about the animal mind, or its absence, as [[Descartes]] would have it.<ref>Descartes, R. (1649), <U+2018><U+2019>Passions of the Soul<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  Speculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after  [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] placed humans and animals on a continuum,  although Darwin<U+2019>s largely anecdotal approach to the topic would not pass scientific muster later on.<ref>Darwin, C. 1871, <U+2018><U+2019>The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  Unsatisfied with the anecdotal method of Darwin and his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[Romanes]],<ref>Romanes, J. G. 1883, <U+2018><U+2019>Animal Intelligence<U+2019><U+2019></ref> [[E. L. Thorndike]] brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny.  Thorndike<U+2019>s careful observations of the escape of cats, dogs, and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that intelligent behavior may be compounded of simple associations and that inference to animal reason, insight, or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading.<ref>Thorndike, E. L. 1911, <U+2018><U+2019>Animal intelligence<U+2019><U+2019>.</ref>  At about the same time,  [[I. P. Pavlov]] began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs.  Pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes; such attempts, he said, led only to disagreement and confusion. He was,  however, willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations.<ref>Pavlov, I.P. 1928, <U+2018><U+2019>Lectures on conditioned reflexes<U+2019><U+2019></ref>

=== The behavioristic half-century ===

The work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist [[John B. Watson]]<ref>Watson, J. B. (1913). Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it. <U+2018><U+2019> Psychological Review, 20<U+2019><U+2019>, 158-177</ref>  set the direction of much research on animal behavior for more than half a century.  During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike<U+2019>s [[Operant conditioning|instrumental (or operant) conditioning]] and Pavlov<U+2019>s [[Classical conditioning|classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning]] were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref>Miller, S. & Konorski, J. (1928) Sur une forme particuli<U+00E8>re des reflexes conditionels. <U+2018><U+2019>Comptes Rendus des Seances de la Societe de Biologie et de ses Filiales<U+2019><U+2019>, 99, 1155-1157</ref><ref>Skinner, B. F. (1932) <U+2018><U+2019>The Behavior of Organisms<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories,<ref>Hull, C. L. (1943) <U+2018><U+2019>The Principles of Behavior<U+2019><U+2019></ref> but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes.   Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the [[radical behaviorism]] of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including "private events" like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.<ref>Skinner, B. F. <U+2018><U+2019>About Behaviorism<U+2019><U+2019> 1976</ref> 

Despite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960, the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years. Influential exceptions included, for example, [[Wolfgang K<U+00F6>hler]] and his insightful chimpanzees<ref>K<U+00F6>hler, W. (1917) <U+2018><U+2019>The Mentality of Apes<U+2019><U+2019></ref> and [[Edward Tolman]] whose proposed [[cognitive map]] was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals.<ref>Tolman, E. C. (1948) <U+2018><U+2019>Cognitive maps in rats and men<U+2019><U+2019> Psychological Review, 55, 189-208</ref>

=== The cognitive revolution ===

Beginning around 1960, a "[[Cognitive psychology|cognitive revolution]]" in research on humans<ref>Niesser, U. (1967) <U+2018><U+2019>Cognitive Psychology<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals.  Inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace. An important proponent of this shift in thinking was [[Donald O. Hebb]],  who argued that "mind" is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior, and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior<ref>p. 3,  Hebb, D. O. 1958 <U+2018><U+2019> A Textbook of Psychology<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  Animals came to be seen as  "goal seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve, and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity.".<ref  name="Menzel">p. 2 , Menzel, R. & Fischer, J. (2010) <U+2018><U+2019>Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition<U+2019><U+2019></ref>  However, it is interesting to note that many cognitive experiments with animals made, and still make, ingenious use of  conditioning methods pioneered by Thorndike and Pavlov.<ref name="Wass">Wasserman & Zentall (eds) (2006)  <U+2018><U+2019>Comparative Cognition<U+2019><U+2019></ref>

The scientific status of "consciousness" in animals continues to be hotly debated.  Serious consideration of conscious thought in animals has been advocated by some (e.g., [[Donald Griffin]]),<ref>Griffin, D.(1985) <U+2018><U+2019>Animal Thinking<U+2019><U+2019></ref> but  the larger research community has been notably cool to such suggestions<ref>p.8 ff, Wasserman & Zentall (eds) (2006)  <U+2018><U+2019>Comparative Cognition<U+2019><U+2019></ref>

== Methods ==

The acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed.   The remarkable behavior of large-brained animals such as [[primates]] and [[cetacea]] has claimed special attention, but all sorts of mammals large and small, birds, fish, ants, bees, and others have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies.  In the laboratory,  animals push levers, pull strings, dig for food, swim in water mazes, or respond to images on computer screens in discrimination, [[attention]], [[memory]], and [[categorization]] experiments.<ref name="Wass"/>  Careful field studies explore memory for food caches, navigation by stars,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} communication, tool use, identification of [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]], and many other matters. Studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species. These developments reflect an increased cross-fertilization from related fields such as [[ethology]] and behavioral biology.  Also, contributions from [[behavioral neuroscience]] are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process.

Several long term research projects have captured a good deal of attention.  These include ape-language experiments such as the [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] project and [[Nim Chimpsky|project Nim]].  Other animal projects include [[Irene Pepperberg]]'s extended series of studies with the [[African Gray Parrot]] [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], [[Louis Herman|Louis Herman's]] work with [[bottlenosed dolphin]]s, and studies of long-term memory in pigeons in which birds were shown to remember pictures for periods of several years. 

Some researchers have made effective use of a [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]ian methodology, taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development, and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species. Others have been inspired by concerns for [[animal welfare]] and the management of domestic species: for example [[Temple Grandin]] has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals.<ref>Grandin, Temple (2009) ''Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best life for Animals'' (with Catherine Johnson)</ref> From a methodological point of view, one of the main risks in this sort of work is [[anthropomorphism]], the tendency to interpret an animal's behavior in terms of human [[feeling]]s, thoughts, and motivations.<ref name="Shet"/>

Human and animal cognition have much in common, and this is reflected in the research summarized below; most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition. Of course, research in the two also differs in important respects.  Notably, much research with humans either studies or involves language, and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings. Following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition.

=== Perception ===

Like humans, non-human animals process the data from eyes, ears, and other sensory organs to achieve a useful picture of the environment.  Perceptual processes have been studied in many species, with results that are often similar to those in humans. Equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from, or go beyond those found in humans, such as [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] in bats and dolphins, motion detection by [[Lateral line|skin receptors]] in fish, and extraordinary visual acuity, motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some [[Bird vision|birds]].<ref>Stebbins, W. C. & M. A. Berkley (1990) ''Comparative Perception,Vol. I, Basic Mechanisms; Vol. II, Complex Signals'' New York: Wiley.</ref>

=== Attention ===

Much of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. [[Attention]] refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands.<ref>Smith, E. E., and Kosslyn, S. M. (2007)  <U+2018><U+2019> Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain" Pearson Prentice Hall.</ref>   Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.<ref>Blough, D. S. (2006)  Reaction-time explorations of visual attention, perception, and decision in pigeons. In E. A. Wasserman & T. R. Zentall (Eds) ''Comparative Cognition: Experimental Explorations of Animal Intelligence<U+2019><U+2019>   pp. 89-105. New York: Oxford.</ref>

The following paragraphs contain brief accounts of several experiments. These are intended to give the reader a bit of the flavor of research on attention, but they barely scratch the surface, and readers should consult the references for descriptions of many other experiments. Also, one must interpret putative "attentional" effects with caution, because they can often be accounted for in several different ways. For example, lack of response to a current stimulus might reflect inattention, but it might also reflect lack of motivation, or result from past learning that suppresses response to that stimulus or promotes an alternative response. Most experiments include control conditions intended to exclude as many alternative interpretations as possible.

==== Selective learning ====

Animals trained to discriminate between two stimuli, say black versus white, can be said to attend to the "brightness dimension," but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others. More enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives.  For example, several studies have shown that performance is better on, for example, a color discrimination (e.g. blue vs green) after the animal has learned another color discrimination (e.g. red vs orange) than it is after training on a different dimension such as an X shape versus and O shape. The reverse effect happens after training on forms. Thus, the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension, color or form, the animal will attend to.<ref>N. J. Mackintosh (1983) <U+2018><U+2019>Conditioning and Associative Learning<U+2019><U+2019> New York: Oxford</ref>

Other experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed.  In "blocking", for example, an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus ("A") by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment.  After the animal responds consistently to A, a  second stimulus ("B") accompanies A on additional training trials.  Later tests with the B stimulus alone elicit little response, suggesting that learning about B has been blocked by prior learning about A .<ref>Kamin, L. J. (1969) Predictability, surprise, attention, and conditioning.  In Campbell and Church (eds.) <U+2018><U+2019>Punishment and aversive behavior<U+2019><U+2019>, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts pp. 279-296</ref>   This result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information.  Thus, in the experiment just cited,  the animal failed to attend to B because B added no information to that supplied by A.  If true, this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing, but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention.<ref>Mackintosh, N. J. (1994) <U+2018><U+2019>Animal Learning and Cognition<U+2019><U+2019> San Diego: Academic Press</ref>

==== Divided attention ====

Casual observation suggests that attention is a limited resource and is not all-or-none:  the more attention is devoted to one aspect or dimension of the environment, the less is available for others.<ref>Zentall, T. R. (2004) Selective and divided attention in animals. <U+2018><U+2019>Behavioural Processes<U+2019><U+2019> 69, 1-16</ref>   In preparing a meal you may divide your attention among a number of things, but a sudden spill may distract you from a falling souffle. A number of experiments have studied this sort of thing in animals.   For example, in one experiment, a tone and a light came on simultaneously.  The pigeon subjects gained reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two dimensions (a high pitch together with a yellow light).    The birds did fairly well at this task, presumably by dividing attention between the two dimensions.  When only one of the stimulus dimensions varied, while the other was held at its rewarded value, discrimination improved on the variable stimulus, and later tests showed that discrimination had also gotten worse on the alternative stimulus dimension.<ref>Blough, D. S. (1969)  Attention shifts in a maintained discrimination. <U+2018><U+2019>Science<U+2019><U+2019>,166, 125-126</ref>  These outcomes are consistent with the idea that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli.

==== Visual search and attentional priming ====

As noted above, attention functions to select information that is of special use to the animal.  Visual search typically calls for this sort of selection, and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it.  

Experimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by Luc Tinbergen (1960).<ref>Tinbergen, L.(1960) The natural control of insects in pine woods:  I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. <U+2018><U+2019>Archives N<U+00E9>erlandasises de Zoologie<U+2019><U+2019> 13, 265-343.</ref> Tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects. For example, he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available. Tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others.  This "attentional priming" is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object, which Tinbergen called a "searching image." 

Tinbergen<U+2019>s field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments. For example, Pietrewicz and Kamil (1977, 1979) <ref>Pietrewicz, A. T. & Kamil, A. C. (1977)  Visual detection of crypic prey by blue jays <U+2018><U+2019>(Cyanocitta cristata). Science,<U+2019><U+2019> 195,580-582.</ref><ref>Pietrewicz, A. T.  Kamil, A. C. (1979) Search image formation in the blue jay <U+2018><U+2019>(Cyanocitta cristata). Science,<U+2019><U+2019> 204, 1332-1333)</ref> presented blue jays with pictures of tree trunks upon which rested either a moth of species A, a moth of species B, or no moth at all.  The birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth. Crucially, the probability with which a particular species of  moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species  (e.g. A, A, A,<U+2026>) than it was after a mixture of trials (e.g. A, B, B, A, B, A, A<U+2026>).  These results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object.

Another way to produce attentional priming in search  is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target.  For example, if you hear a song sparrow you may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub, or among other birds.  A number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects.<ref>Blough, P. M. (1989). Attentional priming and visual search in pigeons. <U+2018><U+2019>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes,<U+2019><U+2019> 17, 292-298.</ref><ref>Kamil, A.C. & Bond, A. B. (2006) Selective attention, priming, and foraging behavior. In E. A. Wasserman and T. R. Zentall(eds) <U+2018><U+2019>Comparative Cognition:  Experimental Exploration of Animal Intelligence<U+2019><U+2019> New York: Oxford</ref> 

Still other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search.  For example, the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases.  This rise in RT is steep if the distracters are similar to the target, less steep if they are dissimilar, and may not occur if the distracters are very different in from the target in form or color.<ref>Blough, D. S. & Blough, P. M. (1990) Reaction-time assessments of visual processes in pigeons. In M. Berkley & W. Stebbins (Eds.) <U+2018><U+2019>Comparative perception (pp. 245-276). New York:Wiley.</ref>

=== Concepts and categories ===

Fundamental but difficult to define, the [[concept]] of "concept" was discussed for hundreds of years by philosophers before it became a focus of psychological study.  Concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups; the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events, diverse things that have a common function, relationships such as same versus different,  or relations among relations such as analogies.<ref name =Cats>E. E. Smith & D. L. Medin (1981) <U+2018><U+2019>Categories and Concepts<U+2019><U+2019>  Harvard Univ. Press</ref>     Extensive discussions on these matters together with many references may be found in Shettleworth (2010)<ref name = Shet>Sara J. Shettleworth (2010) <U+2018><U+2019>Cogntion, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd Ed)<U+2019><U+2019> Oxford Univ. Press</ref>  Wasserman and Zentall (2006) <ref name="Wass"/> and in Zentall ''et al.'' (2008).  The latter is freely available online <ref name = Zentall>Zentall, T. R., Wasserman, E. A., Lazareva, O. F., Thompson, R. R. K., Ratterman, M. J. (2008).

Retrieved from http://psyc.queensu.ca/ccbr/index.html {{doi|10.3819/ccbr.2008.30002}}</ref>

==== Methods ====

Most work on animal concepts has been done with visual stimuli, which can easily be constructed and presented in great variety, but auditory and other stimuli have been used as well.<ref>Dooling, R. J., & Okanoya, K. (1995). Psychophysical methods for assessing perceptual categories. In G. M.Klump, R. J.Dooling, R. R.Fay, & W. C.Stebbins (Eds.),<U+2019><U+2019> Methods in Comparative Psychoacoustics<U+2019><U+2019> (pp. 307<U+2013>318). Basel, Switzerland: Birkh<U+00E4>user Verlag.</ref> Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well.<ref name=Shet/>
In a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non-category items.   Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures.  Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts,  is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first;  the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.<ref name=Wass/><ref name=Shet/><ref name =Zentall/>

==== Perceptual categories ====

Perceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features.  For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid.  This sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival.  Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).<ref name=Wass/><ref name=Shet/><ref name = Zentall/>

===== Natural categories =====

Many animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color.  For example, bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not.  Seemingly much more difficult is an animal<U+2019>s ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while belonging to the same group.   In a classic study [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs.<ref>R. J. Herrnstein (1964) <U+2018><U+2019>Complex Visual Concept in the Pigeon<U+2019><U+2019> Science, 146, 549-551</ref>  The birds readily learned to poke the photos with their beaks containing partial or full views of humans and to avoid photos with no human, despite great differences in the form, size, and color of both the humans displayed and in the non-human pictures.  In follow-up studies pigeons categorized other natural objects (e.g. trees) and after training they were able without reward to sort photos that had never been seen before .<ref>R. J. Herrnstein (1979) <U+2018><U+2019>Acquisition, Generalization, and Discrimination Reversal of a Natural Concept<U+2019><U+2019> J. of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 5, 116-129</ref><ref>R. S. Bhatt, E. A. Wasserman, W.F.J. Reynolds, & K. S.. Knauss (1988) <U+2018><U+2019>Conceptual behavior in pigeons: Categorization of both familiar and novel examples from four classes of natural and articifial stimuli.<U+2019><U+2019> J. of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 14, 219-234</ref>  Similar work has been done with natural auditory categories, for example, bird songs  <ref>H-W Tu, E. Smith & R. J. Dooling, (2011).  Acoustic and perceptual categories of vocal elements in the warble song of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulates)  <U+2018><U+2019>J. of Comparative Psychology, 125, 420-430)<U+2019><U+2019></ref>

==== Functional or associative categories ====

Perceptually unrelated stimuli may come to be responded to as members of a class if they have a common use or  lead to common consequences. An oft-cited study by Vaughan (1988) provides an example.<ref>W. Vaughan, Jr. (1988) Formation of equivalence sets in pigeons. <U+2018><U+2019>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Process 14, 36-42</ref>  Vaughan divided a large set of unrelated pictures into two arbitrary sets, A and B.  Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set A but not for pecks at pictures in set B.  After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items in set B led to food and items in set A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again,  and so on.   Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals,  associating reward with  a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward, as if they were thinking "if these pictures in set A bring food, the others in set A must also bring food."  That is, the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent.   Several other procedures have yielded similar results.<ref name=Shet/><ref name = Zentall/>

==== Relational or abstract categories ====

When tested in a simple stimulus matching-to-sample task (described above) many animals readily learn specific item combinations, such as "touch red if the sample is red, touch green if the sample is green."  But this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between "same" and "different" as general concepts.  Better evidence is provided if, after training, an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before.  Monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this, as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli. However,  because the sample is presented first, successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen "familiar" item rather than the conceptually "same" item.   A number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities, with mixed results.<ref name=Shet/><ref name=Zentall/>

==== Rule learning ====

The use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans, but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates (e.g.<ref>D<U+2019>Amato, M., & M. Columbo (1988). Representation of serial order in monkeys (<U+2018><U+2019>Cebus apella<U+2019><U+2019>).  <U+2018><U+2019>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes,<U+2019><U+2019> 14, 11-139</ref> ) and also in other animals.  Much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the "rule" consists of the order in which a series of events occurs.  Rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order.   For example,  Murphy ''et al.'' (2008) <ref>Murphy, R. A., E. Mondragon & V. A. Murphy (2008)  Rule learning by rats. <U+2018><U+2019>Science<U+2019><U+2019>, 319, 1849-1851.</ref> trained rats to discriminate between visual sequences.  For one group ABA and BAB were rewarded, where A="bright light" and B="dim light."  Other stimulus triplets were not rewarded.  The rats learned the visual sequence, although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward.  More importantly, in a second experiment with auditory stimuli, rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned.  Similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well.<ref>Kundrey, S. M. A., B Strandell, H. Mathis & J. D.

=== Memory ===

The categories that have been developed to analyze [[memory|human memory]] ([[short term memory]], [[long term memory]], [[working memory]]) have been applied to the study of animal memory, and some of the phenomena characteristic of human short term memory (e.g. the [[serial position effect]]) have been detected in animals, particularly [[monkey]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Wright |last2 = Santiago |last3 = Sands |last4 = Kendrick |last5 = Cook |year = 1985 |title = Memory processing of serial lists by pigeons, monkeys, and people |journal = Science |volume = 229 |pages = 287<U+2013>289 }}</ref> However most progress has been made in the analysis of [[spatial memory]]; some of this work has sought to clarify the physiological basis of spatial memory and the role of the [[hippocampus]]; other work has explored the spatial memory of [[scatter-hoarder]] animals such as [[Clark's Nutcracker]], certain [[jay]]s, [[tit (bird)|tits]] and certain [[squirrel]]s, whose ecological niches require them to remember the locations of thousands of caches <ref name = "Shet"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Balda |first1 = R. |last2 = Kamil |first2 = A.

=== Spatial cognition ===

The ability to properly navigate and search through the environment is a critical task for many animals. Much of this movement seems to be directed, in the sense that the animals in question seem to be purposely moving towards a particular spot for a reason. Purposeful navigation implies some sort of cognitive map of the external environment.<ref>{{cite book |author = Lund, Nick |title = Animal cognition |publisher = Psychology Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-415-25298-0 |page = 4 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ti4cgStf6q8C&pg=PA4 }}</ref> Research in this area (Brown & Cook, 2006<ref>[http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/asc/toc.htm Animal Spatial Cognition:Comparative, Neural & Computational Approaches]</ref>) has focused on such diffuse topics as landmark and beacon use by [[ants]] and [[bees]], the encoding and use of geometric properties of the environment by [[pigeons]], and the ability of [[rats]] to represent a spatial pattern in either [[radial arm maze]]s or [[Morris water navigation task|water mazes]]. Sometimes included under the envelope of spatial cognition is work in humans and other animals in [[visual search]] tasks, which aim to experimentally address questions about searching through one's environment for a particular object.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

It has been hypothesized that apes may be quite good at spatial cognition, while dogs are not. Apes may be skillful at using spatial cues to find food, as that is an activity typical to their every day lives. The domesticated dog, on the other hand, typically lives with a human who provides necessities such as food and shelter. The dog is more likely to need to understand social cues given by humans, such as pointing or gazing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brauer|first=Juliane|coauthors=Juliane Kaminski, Julia Riedel, Josep Call, Michael Tomasello|title=Making Inferences About the Location of Hidden Food: Social Dog, Causal Ape|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2006|volume=120|issue=1|pages=38<U+2013>47|accessdate=10/07/2012}}</ref>

=== Timing ===

{{further|Time perception}}

==== Time of day: Circadian rhythms ====

{{main|Circadian rhythms}}
The behavior of most animals is synchronized with the earth's daily light-dark cycle.  Thus, many animals are active during the day, others are active at night, still others near dawn and dusk. Though one might think that these "circadian rhythms" are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light, nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a "biological clock" that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness.<ref name = "Shet" /> Circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things - they occur even in plants <ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Webb |first1 = Alex A.R. |year = 2003 |title = The physiology of circadian rhythms in plants |journal = New Phytologist |volume = 160 |pages = 281<U+2013>303 }}</ref> - that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes, and the reader is referred to the main article ([[Circadian rhythms]]) for further information.

==== Interval timing ====

Survival often depends on an animal's ability to time intervals. For example, rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower had had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar. In one experiment  hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Henderson |first1 = ''et al.'' |year = 2006 |title = Timing in free-living rufous hummingbirds, ''Selasphorus rufus'' |journal = Current Biology |volume = 16 |pages = 512<U+2013>515 }}</ref>

The details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species.  One of the most common methods is the "peak procedure". In a typical experiment, a rat in an [[operant chamber]] presses a lever for food.  A light comes on, a lever-press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time, say 10 seconds, and then the light goes off. Timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on.  On these test trials the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then, when no food comes, gradually stops pressing.  The time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time.

Experiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly, can time more than one event at once, and can integrate time with spatial and other cues. Such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing, though no one theory has yet gained unanimous agreement.<ref name="Shet"/>

=== Tool and weapon use ===

{{Further|Tool use by animals}}
Some species, such as the [[Woodpecker Finch]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]], use particular tools as an essential part of their [[foraging]] behavior. However, these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations. Several species have now been shown to be capable of more flexible tool use. A well known example is Jane Goodall's observation of chimpanzees "fishing" for [[termite]]s in their natural environment, and captive great apes are often observed to use tools effectively; several species of [[corvid]]s have also been trained to use tools in controlled experiments, or use bread crumbs for bait-fishing.<ref>[http://www.orenhasson.com/EN/bait-fishing.htm]{{Verify credibility|date=January 2012}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=January 2012}}

Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the [[Fongoli]] [[savannah]] sharpen sticks to use as [[spear]]s when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070222-chimps-spears.html Chimps Use "Spears" to Hunt Mammals, Study Says] John Roach for National Geographic News (February 22, 2007) (accessed on June 12, 2010)</ref>

Some [[cephalopod]]s are known to use [[coconut]] shells for protection or [[camouflage]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Finn |first = J. K. |coauthors = Tregenza, T., Tregenza, N. |title = Defensive tool use in a coconut-carrying octopus |journal = Current Biology |volume = 19 |issue = 23 |pages = R1069-R1070 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.052 |pmid = 20064403 }}</ref>

=== Reasoning and problem solving ===

Closely related to tool use is the study of reasoning and problem solving.  It has been observed that the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas positioned out of reach, is not through [[trial-and-error]]. Instead, they were observed to proceed in a manner that was "unwaveringly purposeful."<ref>Wolfgang K<U+00F6>hler ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917)</ref>

It is clear that animals of quite a range of species are capable of solving a range of problems that are argued to involve abstract reasoning;<ref>For Chimpanzees, see for example [[David Premack]] (1983) ''[[The_Mind_of_an_Ape#Other_concepts|The Mind of an Ape]]''</ref> modern research has tended to show that the performances of [[Wolfgang K<U+00F6>hler]]'s chimpanzees, who could achieve spontaneous solutions to problems without training, were by no means unique to that species, and that apparently similar behavior can be found in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent, if appropriate training is given.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Causal reasoning]] has also been observed in rooks and New Caledonian crows.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 17171360 |doi = 10.1007/s10071-006-0061-4 |volume = 10 |issue = 2 |title = Non-tool-using rooks, Corvus frugilegus, solve the trap-tube problem |year = 2007 |month = April |journal = Anim Cogn |pages = 225<U+2013>31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1107 |volume = 276 |issue = 1655 |title = Do New Caledonian crows solve physical problems through causal reasoning? |year = 2009 |month = January |journal = Proc. R. Soc. B |pages = 247<U+2013>254 }}</ref>

=== Language ===

{{main|Animal language}}
{{further|Talking animal}}
The modeling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research.  In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including [[parrots]] and [[Great Spotted Woodpecker]]s. Arguing from his own results with the animal [[Nim Chimpsky]] and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences.<ref>Terrace, H., L.A. Petitto, R.J. Sanders, T.G. Bever(1979)Science 206 (4421): 891<U+2013>902</ref> Shortly thereafter [[Louis Herman]] published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenosed dolphin. (Herman, Richards, & Wolz, 1984). Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]], many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations, but there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.<ref name = "Shett"/>

=== Consciousness ===

[[File:Mirror test with a Baboon.JPG|thumb|Mirror test with a baboon]]

The sense in which animals can be said to have [[consciousness]] or a [[self-concept]] has been hotly debated; it is often referred to as the debate over animal minds. The best known research technique in this area is the [[mirror test]] devised by [[Gordon G. Gallup]], in which an animal's skin is marked in some way while it is asleep or sedated, and it is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behavior towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself. Self-awareness, by this criterion, has been reported for chimpanzees and also for other great apes, the [[European Magpie]],<ref>{{cite journal |first = Helmut, Ariane, and Onur |last = Prior, Schwarz, and G&uuml;nt&uuml;rk&uuml;n |title = Mirror-Induced Behavior in the Magpie (Pica pica): Evidence of Self-Recognition |journal = PLoS Biology |publisher = Public Library of Science |year = 2008 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060202 |accessdate = 2008-08-21 |url = http://biology.plosjournals.org/archive/1545-7885/6/8/pdf/10.1371_journal.pbio.0060202-L.pdf |volume = 6 |pages = e202 |pmid = 18715117 |last2 = Schwarz |first2 = A |last3 = G<U+00FC>nt<U+00FC>rk<U+00FC>n |first3 = O |issue = 8 |pmc = 2517622 |last4 = De Waal |first4 = Frans | editor1-last=De Waal | editor1-first=Frans }}</ref> some [[cetaceans]] and a solitary [[elephant]], but not for monkeys. The mirror test has attracted controversy among some researchers because it is entirely focused on vision, the primary sense in humans, while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the [[olfactory]] sense in dogs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

It has been suggested that [[metacognition]] in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self-awareness.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/a0020129 |last = Couchman |first = Justin J. |coauthors = Coutinho, M. V. C., Beran, M. J., & Smith, J. D. |title = Beyond Stimulus Cues and Reinforcement Signals: A New Approach to Animal Metacognition |journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume = 124 |issue = 4 |pages = , 356 <U+2013>368 |year = 2010 |url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/com-124-4-356.pdf |pmid = 20836592 |pmc = 2991470 }}</ref> The great apes, dolphins, and [[rhesus monkeys]] have demonstrated the ability to monitor their own mental states and use an "I don't know" response to avoid answering difficult questions. These species might also be aware of the strength of their memories. Unlike the mirror test, which relies primarily on body images and bodily self-awareness, uncertainty monitoring paradigms are focused on the kinds of mental states that might be linked to mental self-awareness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A different approach to determine whether a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This type of research was originally used to investigate a child's [[crib talk|crib speech]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976). With speech-capable birds, the methods of passive-speech research open a new avenue for investigation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In July, 2012 during the "Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals" conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:
{{quotation|Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.<ref name=cdeclaration>{{cite web|title=The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>}}

=== Numeracy ===

Some animals are capable of distinguishing between different amounts and rudimentary counting.

[[Western lowland gorilla]]s given the choice between two food trays demonstrated the ability to choose the tray with more food items at a rate higher than chance after training.<ref>Anderson, U.S., Stoinski, T.S., Bloomsmith, M.A., Marr, M.J., Smith, A.D., & Maple, T.L.

Other experiments have been conducted that show animals<U+2019> abilities to differentiate between non-food quantities.  [[American black bear]]s demonstrated quantity differentiation abilities in a task with a computer screen.  The bears were trained to touch a computer monitor with a paw or nose to choose a quantity of dots in one of two boxes on the screen.  Each bear was trained with [[reinforcement]] to pick a larger or smaller amount.  During training, the bears were rewarded with food for a correct response.  All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities.  The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller [[retina|retinal image]], which would indicate they are only judging size.<ref>Vonk J., Beran M.J. (2012) Bears <U+2018>count<U+2019> too: quantity estimation and comparison in black bears, Ursus americanus, Animal Behaviour, 84, 1, 231-238.</ref>

[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots.  Experimenters set up two boards showing various numbers of dots in a poolside setup.  The dolphins were initially trained to choose the board with the fewer number of dots. This was done by rewarding the dolphin when it chose the board with the fewer number of dots.  In the experimental trials, two boards were set up, and the dolphin would emerge from the water and point to one board.  The dolphins chose the arrays with fewer dots at a rate much larger than chance, indicating they can differentiate between quantities.<ref>Jaakkola K., Fellner W., Erb L., Rodriguez M., Guarino E.

A particular [[African Grey Parrot|grey parrot]], after training, has shown the ability to differentiate between the numbers zero through six using [[Talking bird|vocalizations]].  After number and vocalization training, this was done by asking the parrot how many objects there were in a display.  The parrot was able to identify the correct amount at a rate higher than chance.<ref>Pepperberg I. (2006) Grey parrot numerical competence: a review. Anim Cogn, 9, 377<U+2013>391.</ref>  
[[Pterophyllum|Angel<U+FB01>sh]], when put in an unfamiliar environment will group together with conspecifics, an action named [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]].  Given the choice between two groups of differing size, the angelfish will choose the larger of the two groups.  This can be seen with a discrimination ratio of 2:1 or greater, such that, as long as one group has at least twice the fish as another group, it will join the larger one.<ref>G<U+00F3>mez-Laplaza, L.M. & Gerlai, R.

== Cognitive faculty by species ==

A common image is the ''[[Great chain of being|scala naturae]]'', the ladder of nature on which animals of different species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top.<ref name=campbell1991snr>Campbell, C.B.G., & Hodos, W. (1991). The Scala Naturae revisited: Evolutionary scales and anagenesis in comparative psychology. J. Comp. Psychol. 105:211-221</ref>

A more fruitful approach has been to recognize that different animals may have different kinds of cognitive processes, which are better understood in terms of the ways in which they are cognitively adapted to their different ecological niches, than by positing any kind of hierarchy.  (See [[Sara Shettleworth|Shettleworth]] (1998), Reznikova (2007).)

One question that can be asked coherently is how far different species are intelligent in the same ways as humans are, i.e., are their cognitive processes similar to ours. Not surprisingly, our closest biological relatives, the [[great ape]]s, tend to do best on such an assessment. Among the birds, [[corvid]]s and parrots have typically been found to perform well. [[Octopod]]es have also been shown to exhibit a number of higher-level skills such as tool use,<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.052 |title = Defensive tool use in a coconut-carrying octopus |year = 2009 |last1 = Finn |first1 = Julian K. |last2 = Tregenza |first2 = Tom |last3 = Norman |first3 = Mark D. |journal = Current Biology |volume = 19 |issue = 23 |pages = R1069<U+2013>70 |pmid = 20064403 }}</ref> but the amount of research on [[cephalopod intelligence]] is still limited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
