'''Namibian nationality law''' regulates who is or may become a citizen of the [[southern Africa]]n country of [[Namibia]]. The primary source of nationality law in Namibia is Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Namibia]], with additional provisions provided by the Namibian Citizenship Act of 1990.<ref name="Chipepera">{{cite book|url=http://www.kas.de/upload/auslandshomepages/namibia/Children_Rights/Children_i.pdf|first=Faith|last=Chipepera|first2=Katharina G.|last2=Ruppel-Schlichting|chapter=Children's right to citizenship|title=Childrens' Rights in Namibia|publisher=Konrad Adenauer Stiftung}}</ref> 

==Citizenship at birth==
A person may be a citizen of Namibia at birth either through operation of Article 4(2) (''[[jus sanguinis]]'', i.e. descent from a Namibian citizen) or a restricted form of ''[[jus soli]]'' (Article 4(1), birth in Namibia to a citizen parent or to a parent who is ordinarily and legally resident in the country).<ref name="Chipepera"/>

==Acquisition of citizenship==
Article 4(3) mandates a period of at least two years' wait before a non-Namibian may obtain Namibian citizenship through marriage to a Namibian. In 2010, the Cabinet brought forth a bill to amend Sections 3 and 5 of the Citizenship Act to set the required time to ten years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201007050757.html|first=Fifi|last=Rhodes|title=Namibia: Cabinet Approves Amendment of Namibian Citizenship Act|work=New Era|date=2010-07-10|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

Article 4(5) provides for [[naturalisation]]. A minimum period of five years of residence in Namibia is required for naturalisation.

==Multiple citizenship==
Section 26 of the 1990 Act states that no Namibian citizen may also be a citizen of a foreign country. However, this section of the act states that it is subject to the provisions of other laws. In a 2011 High Court case, Judge Dave Smuts ruled that a Namibian citizen by birth or descent could not be deprived of citizenship without consent, effectively legalising multiple citizenship for those citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2011/june/article/dual-citizenship-legal-for-born-namibians/|first=Werner|last=Menges|title=Dual citizenship legal for born Namibians||work=The Namibian|date=2011-06-07|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite case|url=http://www.saflii.org/na/cases/NAHC/2011/159.html|litigants=Le Roux v Minister of Home Affairs|reporter={{bracket|2011}} NAHC 159|accessdate=2012-06-23|date=2011}}</ref> Applicants for naturalisation, however, must still renounce all their other citizenships under Section 5(1)(g) of the Citizenship Act.
