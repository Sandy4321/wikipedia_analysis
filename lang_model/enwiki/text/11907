The '''14-inch Gun M1907''' (356&nbsp;mm) and its variants the '''M1907MI''', '''M1909''', and '''M1910''' were large [[coastal artillery]] pieces installed to defend major [[United States|American]] [[seaport]]s between 1895 and 1945. They were operated by the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]]. Most were installed on [[Disappearing gun|disappearing carriages]], with four guns in twin turrets at the unique [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]] in [[Manila Bay]], [[Philippines]].<ref>[http://cdsg.org/fort-and-battery-list/ Coast Defense Study Group fort and battery list]</ref> All of the weapons not in the [[Philippines]] were scrapped during [[World War II]].

==History==
In 1885, [[William Crowninshield Endicott|William C. Endicott]], [[President]] [[Grover Cleveland]]'s [[Secretary of War]], was tasked with creating the [[Board of Fortifications]] to review seacoast defenses. The findings of the board illustrated a grim picture of existing defenses in its 1886 report and recommended a massive $127 million construction program of breech-loading guns, [[12-inch coast defense mortar|mortars]], floating batteries, and submarine (underwater) [[naval mine|minefields]] for some 29 locations on the US coastline. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented. Coast Artillery fortifications built between 1885 and 1905 are often referred to as Endicott period fortifications.

After the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]], the government wanted to protect American seaports in the event of war, and also protect newly gained territory, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Cuba]], from enemy attack. A new Board of Fortifications, under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Secretary of War [[William Taft]], was convened in 1905. Taft recommended technical changes, such as more searchlights, electrification, and in some cases less guns in particular fortifications. The seacoast forts were funded under the Spooner Act of 1902 and construction began within a few years and lasted into the 1920s. The defenses of the Philippines on islands in [[Manila Bay]] were built under this program.<ref>Berhow, Mark A. and McGovern, Terrance C., ''American Defenses of Corregidor and Manila Bay 1898<U+2013>1945'', Osprey Publishing Ltd.; 1st edition, 2003; pages 7<U+2013>8.</ref> 14-inch guns were emplaced in the harbor defenses of [[Los Angeles]], the Panama Canal, [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], and Manila Bay, Philippines, all constructed under the Taft program. Except for Fort Drum, the guns were on [[disappearing gun|disappearing carriages]]; when the gun was fired, it dropped behind a concrete and/or earthen wall for protection from [[counter-battery fire]].<ref>[http://cdsg.org/fort-and-battery-list/ Coast Defense Study Group fort and battery list]</ref>

===14-inch gun M1907 and M1907MI===
The M1907 was a wire-wound gun 34 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long. The M1907MI was a built-up gun (the usual US practice) of the same length. All of these were emplaced on disappearing carriages.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/descriptionandi03statgoog#page/n46/mode/1up Description of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16-inch Seacoast Guns, p. 45]</ref>

===14-inch gun M1909===
[[File:FortDrum After.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Drum in Manila Bay, called the <U+201C>concrete battleship<U+201D>, was a unique fort mounting four 14-inch guns in two twin turrets.]]
[[File:FortDrumSandyHook.jpg|thumb|left|A twin 14-inch turret made for Fort Drum being tested at the [[Sandy Hook Proving Ground]].]]
[[File:Fort Drum DN-SN-83-09891.JPEG|thumb|left|Fort Drum in 1983 with {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62}} behind the fort.]]
The M1909 was a wire-wound gun 40 calibers long designed specifically for the turrets of [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]] on El Fraile Island in Manila Bay, Philippines. The turrets were made by [[Newport News Shipbuilding]]. Fort Drum was built by razing the small island down to the water and building a massive concrete fort on it. The fort had four 14-inch M1909 guns in two twin M1909 turrets, with four [[6-inch gun M1897|6-inch guns]] in [[casemates]] on the sides. Despite holding out against Japanese bombardment, the fort was surrendered after destroying the guns along with [[Corregidor]] on 6 May 1942. It was recaptured by [[US Army Rangers]] on a modified Navy landing ship in April 1945.

===14-inch gun M1910===
The M1910 was a wire-wound gun 40 calibers long. All were emplaced on disappearing carriages. Locations included [[Fort Frank]] and [[Fort Hughes]] in Manila Bay as well as [[Fort MacArthur]], San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/descriptionandi03statgoog#page/n46/mode/1up Description of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16-inch Seacoast Guns, p. 42]</ref>

===World War II===
Along with other coast artillery weapons, the 14-inch guns in the Philippines saw action in the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[Philippines Campaign (1941-42)|invasion in World War II]]. Since they were positioned against a naval attack, they were poorly sited to engage the Japanese, and the open mountings were vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack; their only protection was [[camouflage]] nets. Destruction procedures were executed on all the guns prior to the surrender of US forces on 6 May 1942.

In 1940<U+2013>44, [[16"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun|16-inch gun]] batteries were constructed at most harbor defenses, and all 14-inch guns not in the Philippines were scrapped 1943<U+2013>44.

==Surviving examples==
