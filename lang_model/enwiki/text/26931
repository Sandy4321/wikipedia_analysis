"'''You're Not the One'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Sky Ferreira]] from her debut [[studio album]] ''[[Night Time, My Time]]'' (2013). Released on September 24 of that year by [[Capitol Records]], it served as the album's [[Single (music)|lead single]]. The song was written and produced by [[Ariel Rechtshaid]] and [[Justin Raisen]], with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira and [[Dan Nigro|Daniel Nigro]]. It is styled in [[indie rock]] and [[Synthpop|electropop]], while its lyrics portray a relationship in which there is not enough mutual interest.

Contemporary music critics provided positive reviews for "You're Not the One", selecting it as a standout from its parent album and highlighting its overall sound. Grant Singer directed a [[music video]] for the track, which was released in September 2013. It follows the relationship between Ferreira and a possible love interest, interspersed with shots of her dancing in front of lasers. The song has been performed by Ferreira on several live events, some of which were television shows.

==Background==
"You're Not the One" was written in 2012, at a time when<U+2014>according to Ferreira<U+2014>she "was in a different headspace". "I had been dating someone for three years, since I was 17, and that person guarded me from everything", she said. Ferreira explained that her life was essentially limited to modelling, crafting songs and "watch[ing] TV", which resulted in her not having a "chance to discover [her]self."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9248-sky-ferreira/|title=Sky Ferreira|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=October 23, 2013|author=Fitzmaurice, Larry|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]}}</ref>

The track was recorded in 2013 by [[Ariel Rechtshaid]], at the Heavy Duty Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. Rechtshaid and [[Justin Raisen]] produced the track, contributed towards its instrumentation and provided background vocals for the song. The two played the [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] while they were accompanied by [[Dan Nigro|Daniel Nigro]] when playing the [[electric guitar]]; Rechtshaid played the bass and Garrett Ray helmed the [[Drum kit|drums]]. During [[Post-production#Music|post-production]], David Schiffman [[Audio mixing|mixed]] the song and [[Emily Lazar]] mastered it.<ref name=notes>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Night Time, My Time]]|artist=[[Sky Ferreira]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Capitol Records|Capitol]]|format=[[Compact Disc]]}}</ref>

During a July 2013 interview with ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', Ferreira announced that the track would serve as the [[Single (music)|lead single]] from an upcoming [[extended play]]<U+2014>which ultimately became her debut album ''[[Night Time, My Time]]''.<ref name="glamour"/> The single cover for "You're Not the One" was revealed on September 9, 2013, and the song itself was released 15 days later, on September 24.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=September 9, 2013|author=O'Mance, Brad|title=Sky Ferreira's new single now has some 'cover art'|url=http://www.popjustice.com/thenews/sky-ferreiras-new-single-now-has-some-cover-art/119621/}}</ref><ref name=amazon>{{cite web|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|asin=B00F14HOXG|title=You're Not the One <U+2013> Sky Ferreira|url=http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Not-The-One/dp/B00F14HOXG|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=September 24, 2013}}</ref> An official remix of the track by producer Cid Rim was released online in March 2014;<ref name=cidremix>{{cite web|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].

==Critical reception==
"You're Not the One" received positive feedback from [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]]. Heather Phares of [[AllMusic]] selected the song as one of ''Night Time, My Time''{{'}}s stronger tracks, as did [[Digital Spy]]'s Lewis Corner; the latter elaborated that it "continues the premise that [Ferreira] has finally emerged as an artist who knows what she wants".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

==Music video==
The official [[music video]] for "You're Not the One" was directed by Grant Singer, and written and co-produced by ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'' magazine senior editor Patrik Sandberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1489552/sky-ferreira-youre-not-the-one-video/video/|publisher=[[Stereogum]]|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=September 24, 2013|title=Sky Ferreira <U+2014> "You're Not the One" Video|author=Breihan, Tom}}</ref><ref name=v>{{cite web|work=[[V (American magazine)|V]]|accessdate=May 1, 2014|title=The Video: You're Not the One|author=Sandberg, Patrik|url=http://vmagazine.com/site/content/1658/the-video-youre-not-the-one}}</ref> Ferreira announced plans to shoot a visual for the track in July 2013, and stated that Singer would direct it.<ref name=glamour/> According to Singer, the video took nine months to craft; it was originally supposed to be filmed in Berlin so it had a "''[[Christiane F. <U+2013> We Children from Bahnhof Zoo|Christiane F.]]'' vibe", however this did not occur due to unknown reasons. Sandberg suggested the twist ending and the use of an ice pick, which he thought should be used as a "narrative tool" instead of just a prop. Singer described the overall video as "sinister and [[Pop culture|pop]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imvdb.com/blog/2014/01/video-chats-grant-singer-on-his-recent-collaborations-with-sky-ferreira |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 1, 2014 |title=Video Chats: Grant Singer on His Recent Collaborations with Sky Ferreira |last=Alexander |first=Adam |publisher=[[IMVDb]]}}</ref> The visual is mainly set in a nightclub, where Ferreira is seen dancing in front of multicolored lasers.<ref name="v"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5720511/sky-ferreira-returns-with-youre-not-the-one-single-watch-music|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=September 24, 2013|title=Sky Ferreira Returns With 'You're Not The One' Single: Watch Music Video|author=Lipshutz, Jason|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref>

The video begins with Ferreira walking towards a blue projector screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black jacket and a transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly as a group of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man<U+2014>her apparent love interest<U+2014>as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man kisses her, while her love interest looks surprised. The latter walks away and finds a woman with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. Later, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who is lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word 'not', dripping blood as well.<ref>{{cite video|title=You're Not the One|people=Singer, Grant (director)|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|year=2013|medium=music video}}</ref> ''Spin''{{'}}s Marc Hogan found the video too "focused on Ferreira's model" abilities to "complement the song effectively".<ref name="spin"/>
