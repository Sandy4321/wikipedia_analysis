==The Albatross Expedition==

Chauncey Thomas, as captain, commanded the US Fish Commission Steamer, ''Albatross'' during a scientific expedition in the Hawaiian Islands and southern Pacific in 1902.  Orders issued at the onset of the expedition made it unclear where ultimate authority in the expedition lay, with the ship's captain, or the scientist-in-charge, [[Charles Henry Gilbert]] (1859-1929).  Before leaving port, Thomas requested clarification, which he received, confirming the norm: that the ship's captain always had ultimate authority regarding the safety of the crew and the ship.  The expedition proceeded, but was marred by a barrage of complaints that pitted the scientific crew against the ship's crew, and was characterized by lengthy letters.<ref>J. Richard Dunn, "Charles Henry Gilbert, Naturalist in Charge and Chauncey Thomas, Commanding: Conflict Aboard a US Fish Commission Steamer Albatross, 1902."

== Career==

Thomas held a variety of commands in the United States Navy.  For 27 months, he was commander of the gunboat Bennington, which cruised in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of North and South America Alaskan ports in the summer of 1903 and the coast of Central America the following fall and winter. In July 1904, while in port at San Diego, the boiler exploded and the ship sank.  The gunboat lost 1 officer and 65 men dead, and nearly every other man on board suffered some injury.<ref>Raymond Mann, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.''

== Rear Admiral ==

Admiral Barry was forced to resign after an alleged affair with a cabin boy.<ref>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ebbarry.htm Admiral Barry forced to Resign]</ref>

Camp Thomas, formed in 1910 as a base for the 4th Marine Regiment, was named for him.  The Regiment was deployed there against the possibility of the disorder in Mexico spreading to Southern California.  Camp Thomas disbanded in June, 1911.<ref>[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/corps/text/FAHEY2.HTML  Camp Thomas]</ref>
