'''Ankylosauria''' is a group of [[herbivorous]] [[dinosaur]]s of the order [[Ornithischia]].  It includes the great majority of dinosaurs with [[Armour (zoology)|armor]] in the form of bony osteoderms. Ankylosaurs were bulky [[quadruped]]s, with short, powerful limbs.  They are first known to have appeared in the early [[Jurassic Period]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]], and persisted until the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]]. They have been found on every continent except [[Africa]]. The first dinosaur ever discovered in [[Antarctica]] was the ankylosaurian ''[[Antarctopelta]]'', fossils of which were recovered from [[Ross Island]] in 1986.

Ankylosauria was first described by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in 1923.<ref name = "osborn1923">Obsborn, H. F. (1923). "Two Lower Cretaceous dinosaurs of Mongolia." ''American Museum Novitates", '''95''': 1<U+2013>10.[http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3267]</ref> In the [[Linnaean classification]] system, the group is usually considered a suborder or an infraorder. It is contained within the group [[Thyreophora]], which also includes the stegosaurs, armored dinosaurs known for their combination of plates and spikes.

==Classification==
Ankylosauria is split into two [[family (biology)|families]], [[Nodosauridae]] (the nodosaurids) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (the ankylosaurids). The big difference is that most ankylosaurids (except the "polacanthines") have bony [[Club (zoology)|clubs]] at the end of their tails, which nodosaurids lack.

The nodosaurids had narrow heads, and frequently had large spikes protruding from their bodies. This group traditionally includes ''[[Nodosaurus]]'', ''[[Edmontonia]]'', and ''[[Sauropelta]]''.

The polacanthines, an intermediate group sometimes placed in their own family, were once placed in the Nodosauridae, due to their lack of tail clubs. More recently, it has been found that they were more closely related to the ankylosaurids and, by most [[cladistic]] definitions, are members of that family. The polacanthines include, among others, ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', ''[[Polacanthus]]'' and ''[[Mymoorapelta]]''. Opinions range from them belonging to their own family, the Polacanthidae,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=Phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosauria|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth(ed)|author=Carpenter K|pages=455<U+2013>484|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33964-2}}</ref> distinct from the other two or being a subfamily of the Ankylosauridae, to some researchers questioning their status as a discrete group.

The traditional ankylosaurids are from later in the [[Cretaceous]]. They had much wider bodies and have even been discovered with bony eyelids. The large clubs at the end of their tails may have been used in self-defense (swung at predators) or in sexual selection. This family included ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'', and ''[[Pinacosaurus]]''.

In 1997, [[Kenneth Carpenter|Carpenter]] defined the clade Ankylosauria as all thyreophorans closer to ''Ankylosaurus'' than to ''Stegosaurus'' (a definition followed by most paleontologists today, including Sereno, 2005). This "stem-based" definition means that the primitive armored dinosaur ''[[Scelidosaurus]]'', which is slightly closer to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids, is technically a member of Ankylosauria. Upon the discovery of ''[[Bienosaurus]]'', [[Dong Zhiming]] (2001) erected the family [[Scelidosauridae]] for both of these primitive ankylosaurs.

===Taxonomy===
A simplified version of one possible classification follows:

* Order [[Ornithischia]] (the "bird hipped" dinosaurs)
** Suborder [[Thyreophora]] (armored [[herbivore]]s)
*** Infraorder Ankylosauria (the tanks)
**** Family [[Scelidosauridae]]
***** ''[[Bienosaurus]]''
***** ''[[Scelidosaurus]]''
**** ''[[Antarctopelta]]''
**** ''[[Minmi (dinosaur)|Minmi]]''
**** Family [[Ankylosauridae]]
***** Subfamily Ankylosaurinae (tail clubs)
***** ?Subfamily Polacanthinae
**** Family [[Nodosauridae]]
