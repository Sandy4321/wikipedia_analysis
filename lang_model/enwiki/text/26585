''' St Cynfarwy's Church, Llechgynfarwy''' is a medieval [[parish church]] in [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The first church in the vicinity was established by [[St Cynfarwy]] (a 7th-century saint about whom little is known) in about 630, but no structure from that time survives. The present building contains a 12th-century [[baptismal font]], indicating the presence of a church at that time, although extensive rebuilding in 1867 removed the datable features of the previous edifice.

It is a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]], a national designation given to "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> in particular because it is "a simple, rural church of Medieval origins".<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5396|title=Church of St Cynfarwy|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|year=2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> The church is still used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]], one of nine in a combined parish, although there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009.

==History and location==
St Cynfarwy's Church is set within a churchyard at the side of the road in the centre of [[Llechgynfarwy]], a hamlet in [[Anglesey]], north Wales.<ref name=List/> The settlement is in the countryside about {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the north-west of [[Llangefni]], the county town, and about {{convert|10|mi|0}} from the port of [[Holyhead]].<ref name=RC/>

According to the 19th-century Anglesey historian [[Angharad Llwyd]], the first church was established here by [[St Cynfarwy]] in about 630.<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=301|title=A History of the Island of Mona|year=1833|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DMY_AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=R. Jones}}</ref> The date of the present structure is uncertain,<ref name=List/> although one 19th-century historian suggested that it might be from the 15th century.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|year=1862|journal=[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]|volume=VIII|series=3rd|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=116<U+2013>117|title=Mona Mediaeva No. XXVII|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam29assogoog#page/n138/mode/1up}}</ref> There was a church here before the 15th century, however, since the [[baptismal font|font]] is from the 12th century and a church was recorded in this location in the [[Norwich Taxation]] of 1254.<ref name=List/><ref name=Jones/> On 5 November 1349, the possessions of the deceased clergyman who had been the incumbent priest of Llechgynfarwy were dealt with by an inquisition at [[Beaumaris]], Anglesey <U+2013> one of several dead clergymen whose goods were considered that day.  According to the historian Antony Carr, the timing suggests that the priests had been victims of the [[Black Death]], and he notes that "the clergy as a class were hit particularly hard" by it.<ref>{{cite book|series=Studies in Anglesey History|title=Medieval Anglesey|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-9568769-0-4|last=Carr|first=Antony|publisher=Anglesey Antiquarian Society|year=2011|page=226}}</ref> 

A chapel was added on the south side of the building in 1664. St Cynfarwy's was largely reconstructed in 1867 under Henry Kennedy, the architect of the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=List/><ref name=RC/> Kennedy's work, which rebuilt the church "almost from the foundations" in the words of a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region, left no datable features.<ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=116|chapter=Llechcynfarwy}}</ref><ref name=Pev>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|page=195|chapter=Anglesey|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref> When Llwyd described the church in 1833, she called it a "spacious and handsome cruciform edifice", with [[transepts]] on the north and south sides;<ref name=Llwyd/> there is nothing on the north side of the present building apart from the porch in the north-west corner, added by Kennedy in 1867.<ref name=Pev/>

St Cynfarwy's is still used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]], and is one of nine churches in the combined [[benefice]] of Bodedern with Llanfaethlu.<ref name=CinW/>  As of 2011, the nine churches do not have an incumbent priest, and this position has been vacant since September 2009.<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/ben.php?dosommat=detail&which=139 |title=Church in Wales: Benefices |accessdate=1 November 2011|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref> The church is within the [[deanery]] of Llifon and Talybolion, the [[archdeaconry]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=Parish>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/bangor/diocese/parish_details/llifon_talyblion/stcynfarwy.html|title=Deanery of Llifon & Talybolion: St Cynfarwy, Llechgynfarwy|publisher=Church in Wales|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>

People associated with the church include [[Owen Humphrey Davies]], a 19th-century composer, conductor and quarry worker, who became a clergyman in his late forties.  He was rector of the church from 1895 until his death in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-HUM-1828.html|title=Davies, Owen Humphrey|work=[[Welsh Biography Online]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=1 November 2011|date=2009|last=Griffith|first=Robert David}}</ref>

==Architecture and fittings==
St Cynfarwy's is built in [[Early Decorated]] style using [[rubble masonry]] dressed with [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]].  The roof is made from slate and has a stone [[bellcote]] decorated with Tudor roses at the west end.<ref name=List/>

The arched inner door of the porch (which was added by Kennedy in 1867), with its "ornate hinges", leads into the north-west corner of the [[nave]].<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/> Inside, the 19th-century roof with its exposed woodwork can be seen above the nave and [[chancel]], which together measure 40&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches by 16&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;inches (12.3 by 5.1&nbsp;m). There is no structural division between them, apart from two steps that lead up into the chancel.<ref name=List/><ref name=RC/> The 17th-century chapel is on the south side of the church, and the wooden trusses of its roof can also be seen. There are external [[buttress]]es to support the structure at the north-east corner and alongside the porch.<ref name=List/>

The north wall of the church has a window of two lights (sections of window separated by [[mullion]]s; the [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]]-style window in the south wall has three lights topped with [[trefoil]]s (a pattern of three overlapping circles) set in a rectangular frame.  The south wall of the chapel has a two-light window in an arch.  Above it, there is a stone with the date "1664" and the initials "W&nbsp;B".<ref name=List/> These are the initials of William Bold, a member of the family owning an estate and house about {{convert|1|mi|0}} from the church.<ref name=Pev/> The east window has two lights with three trefoils in the decorative stone [[tracery]] at the top, set in an arched frame with a [[hoodmould]] on the outer wall.<ref name=List/>  Geometric patterns of stained glass, dating from about 1860, decorate the east window.<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/> A survey in 1937 by the [[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]] also noted a brass plate by the north nave window commemorating the 18th-century bequest of a Catherine Roberts to "two old housekeepers of unblemished character".<ref name=RC/>

The 12th-century stone font, which is {{convert|18|in|cm|0}} in diameter and {{convert|13|in|cm|0}} high, has a small circular bowl decorated with four panels carved with [[saltire]] crosses; a fifth panel is plain. It is set on a 19th-century base at the west end of the church.<ref name=List/><ref name=RC/><ref name=Pev/> Monuments include one in the south chapel to Helen Bold (died 1631), the mother of William Bold. It has a large inscribed brass plate set in marble showing the genealogical links between the Bold family and the [[Tudor dynasty]]. There are two 18th-century memorials on the north wall of the nave, less elaborate than the Bold memorial.<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/>

A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 said that the church's [[chalice]], dated 1632, was "an interesting and very rare example" from the time of [[Charles I of England|King Charles&nbsp;I]] (reigned 1625<U+2013>1649), and had "a mixture of characteristics of different periods."<ref name=plate/> It has a hexagonal stem engraved in medieval style, with a base depicting the Crucifixion and a more modern "engraved feather-like decoration".<ref name=plate/> The inscription and coat of arms record that it was donated by William Bold. It measures just under {{convert|8|in|cm|0}} high and is about {{convert|3.25|in|cm|0}} in diameter.  The survey also noted a 19th-centry silver eight-sided [[paten]], decorated with similar engravings to the chalice.<ref name=plate>{{cite book|title=The church plate of the Diocese of Bangor|last=Jones|first=E. Alfred|year=1906|publisher=Bemrose and Sons Ltd|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/churchplateofdio00joneuoft#page/13/mode/1up|pages=13<U+2013>14}}</ref>

==Assessment==
St Cynfarwy's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 12 May 1970, and has been listed because it is regarded as "a simple, rural church of Medieval origin."<ref name=List/> [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that although the church retains some medieval fabric and has some features that date from the 17th century, it "is largely of 19th-century character", calling it "a simple vernacular building".<ref name=List/>
