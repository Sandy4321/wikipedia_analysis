'''John Joseph "Johnny" Greene''' (April 21, 1920 <U+2013> November 4, 2010) was an American [[collegiate wrestling|collegiate wrestler]] and [[American football|football]] player.

Greene competed in wrestling and football at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1940 to 1944. He was captain of the Michigan wrestling team in 1944 and was also selected to play in the 11th annual [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] that same year. He was inducted into the [[University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor]] in 1989.

Greene was drafted by the [[Detroit Lions]] in the [[1944 NFL Draft]] and played seven seasons for the Lions from 1944 to 1950. After moving to the [[End (American football)|end]] position in 1945, Greene became a star, ranking among the [[National Football League]] (NFL) leaders in [[Reception (American football)|reception]]s and/or receiving yards each year from 1945 to 1949.  He had an 88-yard touchdown reception that was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time.  When he retired, he was the Lions' all-time leading receiver with 2,965 receiving yards, 26 [[touchdown]] catches and 173 receptions.  He also served as an assistant coach for the Lions during the [[1951 Detroit Lions season|1951 season]].

===1945 season===
For the [[1945 Detroit Lions season|1945 season]], the Lions' head coach [[Gus Dorais]] moved Greene to the [[End (American football)|end]] position after being impressed with his speed.<ref name=obit/>  Greene started all 10 games for the Lions at the end position in 1945.  He led the [[1945 Detroit Lions season|1945 Lions]] in receiving with 26 receptions for 550 yards (21.2 yards per catch) and five receiving touchdowns. He also ranked fifth among all NFL players in receptions, receiving yards, and yards per catch during the [[1945 NFL season|1945 season]].<ref name=PFR/>

===1946 season===
Greene's production fell off during the [[1946 Detroit Lions season|1946 season]], as he appeared in all ten games, but only started two games.  The highlight of Greene's 1946 season came in a 17-7 victory (the Lions only victory in 1946) over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on November 10, 1946.  In that game, Greene caught a pass from [[Dave Ryan (American football)|Dave Ryan]] at midfield and ran the remaining 50 yards for a touchdown.  The play, good for an 88-yard gain, was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time.<ref name=PFR/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bowl Consent for Army Eleven Gives Zest To Drills For Penn|date=November 14, 1946|newspaper=The Owosso Argus-Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WgQvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=F6sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6970,2586222&dq=greene+lions&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lions Beat Steelers on Passes|newspaper=Meriden Record|date=November 11, 1946|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WaVHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t_4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4800,3392080&dq=greene+lions&hl=en}}</ref> Even with the reduced playing time, Greene's 22 receptions in 1946 ranked eighth in the NFL.<ref name=PFR/>

===1947 season===
During the [[1947 Detroit Lions season|1947 season]], Greene was the Lions' leading receiver for the third straight year.  He appeared in 12 games (six as a starter) and caught 38 passes for 621 yards (16.3 yards per catch).  He ranked sixth in the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards.<ref name=PFR/>  Greene's longest reception of the 1947 season was a 47-yard gain on a pass from [[Roy Zimmerman (American football)|Roy Zimmerman]] in a 35-7 victory over the [[New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lions Turn Back New York By 35-7: Giants Suffer Fifth Defeat in Row Before 28,812 Briggs Stadium Fans|date=November 3, 1947|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E11FC3B5E17738DDDAA0894D9415B8788F1D3}}</ref>  Greene acquired the nickname "the Cinderella Kid" while playing for the Lions, a reference to "his rise to stardom after comparative obscurity while a lineman in college and early in his Lions' career."<ref name=obit/>

Mann and Greene, both University of Michigan alumni, led the Lions' receiving corps.  Mann caught 33 passes for 560 yards in 1948, only 35 yards behind Greene.  [[Wallace Triplett]], an African-American player who joined the Lions in 1949, praised Greene for his leadership in welcoming the African-American players.  Triplett recalled: "I want to say 'thank you' to John because what we have now in the NFL would not have been possible had it not been for him and others like [[Bill Dudley]].  John was a star and a captain for the Lions. So, when he and Bill came over to me in the locker room, shook my hand and welcomed me to the Lions, it made a huge impact in my acceptance on the team and in the League.  I will always appreciate what John and Bill did for me."<ref name=obit/>

===1949 season===
