==History==
===The Pages===
The Redwalls were originally named The Pages, and the band was formed by brothers Logan and Justin Baren and their longtime friend Andrew Langer. They added drummer Jordan Kozer, and began to play small shows while all four members were still in high school. They were originally a cover band that played [[British invasion]] rock songs, but they decided to write their own music after a few months. They recorded their first studio album, ''[[Universal Blues]]'', on independent label Undertow Music. Before the album was released, [[Ken Coomer]] sent a demo of the band to [[Capitol Records]], who signed the band. After recording the album, Kozer decided to attend [[DePaul University]], and The Pages brought in drummer Ben Greeno to replace Kozer.

===The Redwalls===
As they were signing with Capitol, the label requested that they change their name to The Redwalls, and the band abided. Capitol released their already-finished album on Undertow under the new name. [[Capitol Records]] released their follow-up album and major label debut ''[[De Nova]]'' in [[June 2005]]. Their first single, "Thank You", was performed on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] on [[June 21]] [[2005]]. They later performed "Build a Bridge" on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]. They spent the summers of 2005 and 2006 opening for [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and played at [[Lollapalooza]] in both years.
