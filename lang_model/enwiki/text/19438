'''Marcus Lindblom''' is known for his English [[Game localization|localization]] of the 1995 video game ''[[EarthBound]]''.

== Early life and career ==

Marcus Lindblom was raised in "a traditional, middle-class family".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> He dropped out of college, got married, and moved with his spouse to Japan<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> in the late 80s.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> They planned to stay several months, but stayed four years before returning in 1990.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>

== Nintendo ==

In the United States, Lindblom returned to college and,<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> in 1990,<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> began to work at [[Nintendo of America]]'s customer service and game assistance call center in [[Redmond, Washington]]. He would wake up at four a.m. to work before class, and he considered the schedule "energizing". Upon his graduation, Lindblom became a Software Analyst at Nintendo, where he worked on their games.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>

Nintendo's games are developed in Japan. The American office translates, fixes, and produces games for English-language release.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> Localization was handled by a single person in contact with the headquarters and not a full department of localization. As such, the localizer had more latitude when making decisions.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> Lindblom worked on ''[[Wario's Woods]]'' before coming to the ''[[EarthBound]]'' project<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> around January 1995.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> Nintendo writer Dan Owsen had [[Game localization|localized]] a tenth of the game's script before moving to another project and leaving the translation to Lindblom. Owsen had coined some of the game's "most iconic phrases", such as "say fuzzy pickles".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> The game was translated from Japanese by a translator, and Lindblom received a paper script with the rough translation. Masayuki Miura, a Japanese writer, worked with Lindblom to contextualize the English script for the mood and message intended by the game's original development team.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>

Lindblom found the cultural translation hardest, where he had to portray "an outsider's view of the U.S." in a format that would interest Americans.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> Nintendo did not want a direct translation, but a more American version of the script.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> He recalled that he was given latitude to make the script "as weird as [he] wanted" but also sought to stay true to the original text's translation, though he never communicated with [[Shigesato Itoi]] (the game's creator) directly.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> Lindblom's own humor and office in-jokes worked their way into the script alongside cultural allusions to [[Bugs Bunny]], comedian [[Benny Hill]], and ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> Outside the game's script, Lindblom's in-game text includes the item and weapon names as well as the combat prompts. His writing contains multiple [[Easter egg (video games)|Easter eggs]], such as in some of the character's names.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> One character is named for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. After taking the day off for her birthday, Lindblom recalled working for the next 30 days straight, without weekends off.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> He remembered the workload as large, and recalled "grinding-out" for about 14 hours a day.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> The localization process took four months.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>

Lindblom has called the ''EarthBound'' localization his highest achievement, and credited Miura and the game's "tone" for helping him tackle the magnitude of the project. He remembers the game as "very [positive at its heart]"<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> and wrote it as "a glass half full kind of game".<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> When asked of his favorite contribution to the final work, Lindblom remembered the character Pokey's mother, Lardna. He described the name choice as "just the most ridiculous thing to have picked".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> Nicholas Dean Des Barres of ''[[DieHard GameFan]]'', an original reviewer, wrote that ''EarthBound'' was translated "impeccably"<ref name="DHGF: Review"/> and praised the game's humor.<ref name="DHGF: Viewpoint"/> In the period following its release, the game's English localization has found praise. Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as "top-notch for its time".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> ''Kotaku'' found the localization "funny, clever, and evocative".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>

Lindblom recalls his and his team's devastation at the release's critical response and sales. He remembered that critics placed a high importance on graphics quality propelling the industry, and that popular reviewer conception of the game's graphics as "simplistic" hurt its reception. Lindblom felt that the game's changes to the RPG formula, e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies, were ignored in the following years.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> At the time of the game's Virtual Console rerelease, he felt the game had aged well.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/>

== After Nintendo ==

Lindblom worked on several other Nintendo games<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> and left in 1996.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> He later worked at studios such as [[Electronic Arts]], [[Vivendi Games]],<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> [[Midway Games]], and [[THQ]]. Lindblom established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009. The company has contracted with Microsoft and is also developing a [[real-time strategy]] [[Facebook game]] named ''The Robot Apocalypse''.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> {{as of|2013}}, Lindblom runs Carried Away Games, a mobile games studio.<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/> He described many of the games he worked on in his career as "forgettable" and the eventual popularity of ''EarthBound'' as "satisfying".<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> He cited the example of a wedding proposal done through hacked text in ''EarthBound'' as something that made him happy.<ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/> After following the fan community from afar, in mid-2012, Lindblom approached the Fangamer booth at the [[Penny Arcade Expo]] and explained his involvement in the game.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> When ''EarthBound'' was announced for the Wii U Virtual Console, the press began to show greater interest in Lindblom's work.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> Lindblom had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He did not plan to profit from the book, but felt he "owed" the fan community for its dedication. In response, he said he plans to continue his ongoing dialogue with the community.<ref name="Polygon: Quash"/> Lindblom told ''Kotaku'' that he thinks of ''EarthBound'' as his "finest accomplishment".<ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/>
