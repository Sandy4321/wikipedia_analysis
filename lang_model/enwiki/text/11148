'''Intermediate cartridges''' are military [[rifle]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s that are less powerful than typical [[Full power rifle cartridge|full power]] [[battle rifle]] cartridges such as the [[7.92x57mm Mauser|7.92mm Mauser]] or US [[.30-06]], but still significantly more powerful than the [[pistol]] cartridges (e.g. [[9mm Parabellum]]) used in [[sub-machine guns]]. As their [[recoil]] is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, [[automatic firearm|fully automatic rifles]] firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of 250 <U+2013> 500 metres, which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in combat. This allowed for the development of the [[assault rifle]] concept, which is a [[selective fire]] weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles firing full power cartridges. The first intermediate cartridge was the German [[7.92x33mm Kurz]].  Other examples include the Soviet [[7.62x39mm]] used in the [[AK-47]] and [[AKM]] series, and the [[.280 British]] round developed for the [[EM-2]]. The [[5.56x45mm]] NATO cartridge is also an intermediate cartridge.

During the Second World War, the sub-machine gun and bolt action rifle were used as individual weapons in the infantry section. However, each had their disadvantages. The submachine gun fired pistol cartridges and had a maximum range of 100 metres. It did have good firepower, being able to fire automatic, and worked well at the short ranges typically encountered in urban and jungle warfare. However, it was not much use beyond 100 metres and was by nature something of an area weapon rather than a precision one. The bolt action rifle was very accurate to 1000 metres in the hands of a trained marksman, but typical combat ranges were much shorter, around 150 <U+2013> 300 metres, and not often beyond 500 metres. Therefore, the extra range of the rifle was wasted; "...if hasty wartime training was such that he [the infantryman] had no better than a fifty per cent chance of hitting a target at 300 yards, there was no logical reason to give him a rifle and ammunition designed to kill at 2000 yards" <ref>p136, Ian V. Hogg "Modern Small Arms" Bison Books Ltd, United Kingdom, 1983</ref> . Bolt action rifles in use at the time were comparatively long and heavy, and the rate of fire was only around 10 - 15 rounds per minute.

What was needed was a selective fire weapon firing a cartridge midway in power between the rifle and pistol/sub-machine gun, which had the accuracy of the former out to typical combat ranges, and the firepower of the latter at short ranges.

Accordingly, the [[7.92x33mm]] Kurz was developed by the Germans, which was a shortened version of the standard 7.92x57mm Mauser round. Learning from the German innovation, the British, Soviets and Belgians were quick to pick up on the concept after World War 2.
