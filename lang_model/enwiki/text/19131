==Plot==
A number of burglaries by a cat burglar take place in Springfield, hitting even the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]]' house. Among the stolen items are Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, and Bart's stamp collection. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves and install security devises. A neighborhood watch group is created, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its member break more laws than they catch criminals, and they are turned into [[vigilante]]s. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor [[Kent Brockman]]'s ''[[Smartline]]'', the cat burglar calls the show and informs Homer that he will rob the world's largest [[cubic zirconia]] from the Springfield museum.

Homer and his group begin guarding the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to stop them, but quickly ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is. At first he gloats about how nobody wanted his help before, but quickly agrees to tell after the family begins to become impatient. The burglar is exposed as being a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.

Homer captures Molloy at the retirement home, and he returns the saxophone and various other objects. [[Chief Wiggum]] arrests him and he is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably want to know where he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and after Molloy tells them where to look, they all rush out of the station hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell.

The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. [[New Zealand]] actor [[Sam Neill]] guest starred in the episode as Molloy, the cat burglar. Executive producer [[David Mirkin]] thought Neill, a big ''The Simpsons'' fan, was "lovely" to direct. Mirkin also said Neill was "really game" and did "a terrific job" on the episode.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Neill considers recording this episode to be a "high-point" of his career.<ref>{{cite news|title='Poetic Justice' premiere blocked|date=July 24, 1993 |work=The Cincinnati Post |page=2C}}</ref> One scene of the episode features Kent Brockman reporting on the burglaries. He says: "When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind? This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be. So, professor: would you say it's time for everyone to panic?", to which a professor replies: "Yes I would, Kent." Mirkin said this was a joke the staff enjoyed doing because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly "always trying to scare everybody" by creating panic and depression.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer the Vigilante"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="Mirkin2">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer Loves Flanders"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The Malloy character is based on British actor [[David Niven]]'s performance as the character Raffles in the 1939 film ''[[Raffles (1939 film)|Raffles]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> The music heard at the beginning of the episode during the burglaries is the same as the music in the American television series ''[[The Pink Panther (film)|The Pink Panther]]''.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page11.shtml|title=Homer the Vigilante|accessdate=2008-08-17|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Flanders tells Homer that his [[Shroud of Turin]] beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. The Shroud of Turin is a [[linen]] cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have been physically traumatized in a manner consistent with [[crucifixion]].

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was "a bit lacking in focus", but it contained "a number of satisfying set-pieces <U+2014> we like [[Professor Frink]]'s walking house security system <U+2014> and displays Wiggum at his all-time most useless."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: "After the many plots of the prior show, 'Vigilante' maintains a much tighter focus. It<U+2019>s not quite as wonderful an episode as its immediate predecessor, but it<U+2019>s strong nonetheless. Much of the humor comes from Homer<U+2019>s newfound power and abuse of it.
