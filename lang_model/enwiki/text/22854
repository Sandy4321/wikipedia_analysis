'''Winnipeg''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Winnipeg.ogg|<U+02C8>|w|<U+026A>|n|<U+026A>|p|<U+025B>|<U+0261>}}) is the capital and largest city of the province of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the [[confluence]] of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] Rivers.

The name Winnipeg comes from the [[Cree language|Western Cree]] words for "muddy waters". The region was a trading centre for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]] before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the [[Red River Colony|Selkirk settlers]] in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2011, Winnipeg is the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|seventh-largest municipality]] in Canada.<ref name="2006CensCSDPop">{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=303&SR=1&S=3&O=D&RPP=25&CMA=602| title = Winnipeg Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) with census subdivision (municipal) population breakdowns |publisher= Statistics Canada |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref>

Known as the "Gateway to the West", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games and is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (hockey), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).

{{Further|History of Winnipeg|Timeline of Winnipeg history}}
Winnipeg lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and the [[Red River Valley|Red River of the North]], a location now known as "[[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]]".
