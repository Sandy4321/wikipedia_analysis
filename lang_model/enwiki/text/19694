{{otherships|HMS Kent}}

'''HMS ''Kent'' (54)''' was a [[County class cruiser|''County''-class]] [[heavy cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the late 1920s. She was the [[lead ship]] of the ''Kent'' [[ship class|subclass]]. After completion the ship was sent to the [[China Station]] where she remained until the beginning of the [[Second World War]], aside from a major refit in 1937<U+2013>38. ''Kent'' hunted the German [[pocket battleship]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} in the [[East Indies]] in late 1939 and then was reassigned to troop convoy escort duties in the [[Indian Ocean]] in early 1940. She was transferred to the [[Mediterranean]] in mid-1940, but was torpedoed shortly after arriving. The ship was under repair for a year and was then assigned to [[British Home Fleet|Home Fleet]] where she escorted [[Arctic convoys of World War II|convoys]] to and from North [[Russia]] for the next several years. In mid-1944 ''Kent'' escorted British [[aircraft carrier]]s as their aircraft made attacks on German shipping and airfields in Norway. A few months later was flagship of a force that intercepted a German convoy in Norwegian waters and sank two freighters and five escorts. The ship was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in early 1945 and placed in [[Wikt:mothball|reserve]] until she was used as a target. ''Kent'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.

==Description==
''Kent'' displaced {{convert|13550|LT|MT|lk=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|13520|LT|MT}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|630|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|5|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving four shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|80000|shp|lk=on}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|31.5|kn|lk=on}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Kent'' carried a maximum of {{convert|3425|LT|t}} of fuel oil that gave her a range of {{convert|13300|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. The ship's complement was 784 officers and men.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 123, 412<U+2013>13</ref>

The ship mounted eight 50-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[BL 8 inch Mk VIII naval gun|8-inch (203 mm) guns]] in four twin [[gun turret]]s. Her secondary armament consisted of four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} Mk V]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns in single mounts. ''Kent'' mounted four single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder (40&nbsp;mm)]] light AA guns ("pom-poms"). The ship carried two quadruple [[torpedo tube]] above-water mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref name=r12>Raven and Roberts, p. 412</ref>

''Kent'' was only lightly protected with little more than a single inch of plating protecting vital machinery. Her [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s were the exception and were protected by {{convert|2|-|4.375|in|mm}} of armour. Space and weight was reserved for one [[aircraft catapult]] and its [[seaplane]], but they were not fitted until after she was completed.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 251, 412</ref>

==History==
''Kent'' was built by [[Chatham Dockyard]] and [[Keel|laid down]] on 15 November 1924. She was launched on 16 March 1926 and commissioned 25 June 1928.
The ship was assigned to the [[5th Cruiser Squadron]] on the [[China Station]] and spent the bulk of the interbellum period there.<ref>Whitley, pp. 83, 86</ref> In 1929<U+2013>30 she received a [[HACS|High-Angle Control System]], used to direct her anti-aircraft guns, and an [[aircraft catapult]] was also fitted. Her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of two single 4-inch guns [[wikt:abreast|abreast]] the forward [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] in 1932<U+2013>33. Two quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers .50-calibre (12.7&nbsp;mm) Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s were added in 1934.<ref name=rr51>Raven and Roberts, p. 251</ref>

In 1937, ''Kent'' returned to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and underwent a major refit, which included a {{convert|4.5|in|adj=on|0}} [[Krupp cemented armour]] belt abreast the [[engine room|engine and boiler room]]s as well as the dynamo room and the [[Fire-control_system#Naval_fire_control|fire control transmitting station]]. This belt extended {{convert|6|ft|1}} down from the lower [[deck (ship)|deck]]. Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments. The ship's aft [[director (military)|director]] was moved to a pedestal [[wikt:abaft|abaft]] the searchlight tower that replaced the original aft control station. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower. The changes raised the ship's displacement by {{convert|74|LT|t}} and cost an estimated <U+00A3>161,000.<ref group=Note>Adjusted for inflation to 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}} pounds, <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|161000|1936}}}}.</ref> Unlike her [[sister ship]]s, no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the [[Washington Treaty]] limits, but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[flying boat]].<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 244, 251</ref>

In November 1939 she joined with the French heavy cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Suffren||2}} and the Australian [[destroyer]]s {{HMAS|Voyager|D31|2}} and {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|2}} to hunt for the German pocket battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee'' in the East Indies and then was reassigned to escort troop convoys in the Indian Ocean in January 1940.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 8, 13, 20</ref> 

Following the declaration of war by [[Italy]], she was transferred to the [[British Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Fleet]], arriving at [[Alexandria]] in August 1940 with the [[3rd Cruiser Squadron]].<ref name=w6>Whitley, p. 86</ref> On 17 August 1940, ''Kent'', the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, {{HMS|Malaya||2}}, {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}} and twelve destroyers bombarded Italian positions near [[Bardia]] and [[Fort Capuzzo]]. Two weeks later the ship participated in [[Malta_Convoys#September_1940_.E2.80.93_Operation_Hats|Operation Hats]], escorting a convoy from Alexandria to [[Malta]].<ref>Rohwer, pp. 36, 38</ref>

On 15 September 1940 the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|R87|2}}, ''Kent'', the [[anti-aircraft cruiser]]s {{HMS|Calcutta|1918|2}} and {{HMS|Coventry|1916|2}}, and seven destroyers left Alexandria bound for [[Benghazi]]. During the night of 16/17 September 1940, aircraft from the ''Illustrious'' mined the harbour of Benghazi. They also attacked shipping in the harbour with torpedoes and bombs, sinking two destroyers and two merchant ships. ''Kent'' and two destroyers were detached to bombard [[Bardia]] while returning to Alexandria. During the night of 17/18 September 1940 the ship was hit in the stern by a torpedo from Italian [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] [[bomber]]s from the 279th Independent Torpedo Squadron ({{lang-it|Squadriglie Autonomo Aerosiluranti}}) led by [[Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia]]. She was towed back to base by the destroyers with great difficulty.<ref>Gustavsson and Slongo, pp. 140, 143</ref> 

''Kent'' was given temporary repairs at Alexandria from 19 September to 18 October to allow her to return to the [[United Kingdom]]. Extensive repairs at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] followed from 1 January to 20 September 1941. During this time six [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm light AA guns]] were added and the ship received a variety of [[radar]]s. These included [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 279|Type 284]] radar for surface gunnery control, [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 285|Type 285]] anti-aircraft gunnery radar, and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 281|Type 281]] air warning radar.<ref name=r0>Raven and Roberts, p. 430</ref> When her repairs were completed in September 1941, she spent 
several months [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#W|working up]]. On 8 December ''Kent'' sailed from [[Scapa Flow]] carrying the British [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Eden]], and the Soviet Ambassador to Great Britain, [[Ivan Maisky]]. She reached [[Murmansk]] on 12 December where the diplomats disembarked to meet with [[Joseph Stalin]]. ''Kent'' [[sortie]]d on 17 December, with two Soviet destroyers, in a failed attempt to intercept the German 8th Destroyer Flotilla that was engaging two British minesweepers attempting to rendezvous with [[Convoy PQ 6]]. The ship brought Eden back home by 29 December.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 120, 127<U+2013>28</ref>

The cruiser was assigned to the Home Fleet and escorted convoys to and from North Russia. She briefly escorted Convoy QP 8 on the return leg from Russia in March 1942 and provided distant cover for Convoy QP 10 the following month. ''Kent'' attempted to rendezvous with the damaged [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Trinidad|46|2}} west of [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] as she returned from Murmansk in May, but ''Trinidad'' was sunk by German aircraft before that could happen. On 21 May the ship joined [[Convoy PQ 16]] as part of the close escort.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 150, 158, 164<U+2013>65, 167</ref> 

After her return from the Soviet Union, the ship was refitted in [[Liverpool]] from 18 July to 7 November. Her catapult and quadruple .50-calibre machine guns were removed and six more single 20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon guns were added.<ref name=r0/> In early January 1943 the cruiser provided cover for Convoy RA 51 and, several weeks later, [[Convoy JW 52]]. While on the latter mission, ''Kent'' was unsuccessfully attacked by the {{ship|German submarine|U-625||6}}.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 221, 226</ref>  During a brief refit between 22 September and 4 October at Chatham Dockyard, the ship exchanged six single 20&nbsp;mm guns for three twin 20&nbsp;mm gun mounts.<ref name=r0/> In November she provided cover to Convoys RA 54A, [[Convoy JW 54A|JW 54A]] and [[Convoy JW 54B|JW 54B]]. The ship covered the outbound Convoys [[Convoy JW 56A|JW 56A]], [[Convoy JW 56B|JW 56B]] and the returning Convoy RA 56 in January<U+2013>February 1944. The following month ''Kent'' was part of the covering force for [[Convoy JW 57]].<ref>Rohwer, pp. 286, 300, 307</ref>

[[Image:HMS Kent planes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Thirteen [[Vought F4U Corsair|Chance-Vought Corsairs]] flying in formation over HMS ''Kent'', as seen from the escort carrier {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}}]]
On 17 July 1944, the ship was assigned to the covering force protecting three British aircraft carriers flying off aircraft to attack the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||6}}. ''Kent'' escorted three aircraft carriers that attacked the German airfield at [[Kristiansand]] on 10 August. She escorted two carriers on 12 September while their aircraft attacked German shipping near [[Stadlandet]]. On the night of 13/14 November 1944, as flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Rhoderick McGrigor]] during [[Operation Counterblast]], the ship, with the light cruiser {{HMS|Bellona|63|2}} and four destroyers attacked Convoy KS.357 off Listerfjord, south-east of [[Egersund]], [[Norway]]. The convoy consisted of four freighters escorted by the [[minesweeper]]s ''M.416'', ''M.427'' and four [[submarine chaser]]s. Opening fire at 2300 hrs, the cruisers and destroyers sank two of the freighters and all the escorts above except one unidentified vessel.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 343, 349, 352, 371</ref>

''Kent'' was paid off in January 1945 and remained in reserve for several years until she was used as a target. The ship "was allocated to [[British Steel|BISCO]] on 22 January 1948 and arrived at [[Troon]] on 31 January to be broken up by West of Scotland Shipbreakers."<ref name=w6/>
