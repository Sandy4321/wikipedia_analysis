The '''Singing Priests of Tagbilaran''' or '''SPOT'''<ref>[http://www.acronymattic.com/results.aspx?q=SPOT What does SPOT stand for?] Acronym Attic search</ref> is a group of [[Catholic]] [[priests]] from [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]. In addition to preaching sermons they also evangelize from the stage in songs and dances.<ref name="asian"/>

The Singing Priests of Tagbilaran were formed in [[1998]] by  Paring Bol-anon Fathers  [[Arnold Zamora]],  Melchisedech "Edick"  E. Monreal,  Justino "Loy"  H. Estoque, Jr.,  Bonifacio "Boy" G. Espeleta, Jr., Jeffrey "Oloy"  P. Malanog  and Petronilo "Jun" Ligtas, Jr. <ref name="spot"/>

In [[2003]],  the group was composed of Fathers [[Arnold Zamora]], Melchisedech "Edick" E. Monreal, Irvin B. Garsuta, Justino "Loy" H. Estoque, Jr.,  Bonifacio "Boy" G. Espeleta, Jr., Jeffrey "Oloy" P. Malanog, Joseph Swanee Skelton, Jr. ,  and pianist, Mr. Joseph D. Namoc.<ref name="asian"/>

==History==
The Singing Priests of Tagbilaran are all graduates of the  [[Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary]].  The members come from different graduating classes and age groups, but all received their musical training from the same [[seminary]].

With the common desire to share their talents along with their philosophy of joy, prayer and fun, they bonded together to form a singing group called SPOT (Singing Priests of Tagbilaran). The group is also named SPOTlight since they seek to bear "the light of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]" to the world.<ref name="asian"/>

In the [[Philippines]], SPOT has performed in many concerts. They were the main attraction in the diocesan production, HIUSATLO (three acting in unison). They staged a solo concert, Valentine's SPOTlight, at the [[Bohol]] Tropics Resort in February,  [[1998]]. <ref name="spot"/>

In the summer of [[1998]], they gave concerts for religious causes in the [[United States]]. They performed in many cities in [[California]] including [[San Francisco]], [[South San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Stockton]],[[Los Angeles]], [[Redwood City]], [[Foster City]], [[Santa Maria]] and [[Vallejo]]. They also performed in [[Seattle, WA]] and [[Las Vegas, NV]]. The proceeds from these series of benefit concerts in the United States was used as the seed money of the priests' standard living allowance, a monthly standard salary for priests in Bohol, [[Philippines]].<ref name="spot"/> 

Their debut album entitlled ''Singing Priests of Tagbilaran'',  contains a repertoire of [[religious]] and [[popular songs]] in [[English language|English]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].  This album also highlights the works of Father [[Arnold Zamora]], the group's musical [[arranger]] and [[accompanist]].  This compilation of songs portrays the universal message of love and peace. The blending of their voices characterizes human emotions of joy, hope, sorrow and understanding.<ref name="spot"/>

In [[2003]],  the second batch of SPOT did concerts in [[San Francisco, California]],  [[Fairfield, California]],  [[Sacramento, CA]],  [[Stockton, CA]],   [[Houston, Texas]],  [[Chicago, Illinois]],  [[Orlando, Florida]],  [[Miami, Florida]],  [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], and  [[Los Angeles, California]].  Proceeds from the benefit were for the retired and sickly priests of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]],  [[Bohol]].  <ref name="asian"> Ferdie S. Villar [http://www.asianjournal.com/print/pdfs/asianjpdf/sept_04/SF/0903_SF/p.17-sec2.pdf Tagbilaran Singing Priests perform at Star of the Sea Church on September 17] www.asianjournal.com  Retrieved  January,  [[2007]]. </ref>  In addition, the proceeds were used for the health plan of the clergy.<!-- The concert was  first financed by the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]], then later reimbursed plus the net income.-->

Fr. Eugene D. Tungol, Pastor of the Epiphany Church in [[San Francisco, California]] was a major catalyst in all of SPOT's concerts in the [[U.S]].<ref name="spot"/> <!--The Singing Priests of Tagbilaran performs live upon invitation.-->
