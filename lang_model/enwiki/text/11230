The '''Kelantanese dinar''' was first struck in 2006 by [[Mariwasa Kraftangan]] of [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], a local producer of souvenirs and replicas of objects of art and culture. The Government of the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Kelantan]] attempted to give the [[dinar]] a [[legal tender]] status, but this was vetoed by the federal Malaysian government in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The dinar has now been privately issued, albeit without a legal tender status. The only currency that is legal tender in Kelantan is the [[Malaysian ringgit]]. According to the Malaysian constitution, ninth schedule, list I sub 7.a the states of Malaysia do not have the right to issue coins.

These fantasy coins have a metallic composition of 22 [[Carat (purity)|carat]] gold. There are 3 denominations - 1/4,1/2, and 1 dinar.

In 2007, a gold 2 dinars was struck to commemorate the birthday of the [[Sultan of Kelantan]].

==Kelantan's 2010 gold and silver coin issue==

The [[World Islamic Mint]] of [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] has been given the authority by the [[Government of Kelantan]] to strike this series' new coins.

The denominations that have now been struck are as follows;

Silver - 1 dirham, 2, 5, 10, and 20 dirhams.

Gold - 1/2 and 1 dinar, 2, 5, and 8 dinars.

The obverses depict a monogram in Arabic within a decorative border.

The reverses of these pieces depicts the full Kelantanese Coat-of-Arms.

These coins were introduced into circulation in Kelantan on [[12 August]] [[2010]], but the [[Malaysian ringgit]] also circulates in tandem.

One official agent has been appointed to sell the coins to the public in Kuala Lumpur. The agent concerned has a website at [http://www.nubex.com.my].
