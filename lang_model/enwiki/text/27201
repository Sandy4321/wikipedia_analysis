'''Yellowstone National Park''', established by the [[U.S. Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Ulysses S.

[[Library of Congress]]</ref> is a [[national park]] located primarily in the U.S. state of [[Wyoming]], although it also extends into [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]]. Yellowstone was the first national park in the world, and is known for its [[wildlife]] and its many [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal features]], especially [[Old Faithful Geyser]], one of the most popular features in the park.<ref name="facts">{{cite web |title=Yellowstone Fact Sheet |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/factsheet.htm |date=August 10, 2006 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> It has many types of [[ecosystem]]s, but the [[subalpine]] [[forest]] is dominant.

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000&nbsp;years.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/yell/historyculture/index.htm National Park Service: Yellowstone, History and Culture] Accessed May 8, 2011</ref> The region was bypassed during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in the early 19th century. Aside from visits by [[mountain man|mountain men]] during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The [[U.S. Army]] was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the [[National Park Service]], which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.

Yellowstone National Park spans an area of {{convert|3468.4|sqmi|km2}},<ref name="acres"/> comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and [[mountain range]]s.<ref name="facts"/> [[Yellowstone Lake]] is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the [[Yellowstone Caldera]], the largest [[supervolcano]] on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.<ref>[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/about/faq/faqhistory.php United States Geological Survey, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory: Questions About Yellowstone Volcanic History] accessed May 6, 2011</ref> Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism.<ref name="geothermal">{{cite web |title=Geothermal Features and How They Work |publisher=National Park Service |date=February 17, 2007 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/geothermal.htm |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> [[Lava]] flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone.

Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]].<ref name="facts"/> The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Yellowstone Park is the largest and most famous [[megafauna]] location in the [[Continental United States]]. [[Grizzly Bear]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], and free-ranging herds of [[American Bison|bison]] and [[elk]] live in the park.  The [[Yellowstone Park Bison Herd]] is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the [[United States]]. [[Forest fire]]s occur in the park each year; in the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988|large forest fires]] of 1988, nearly one third of the park burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including [[hiking]], [[camping]], [[boating]], [[fishing]] and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either [[snow coach]]es or [[snowmobile]].

The park is located at the headwaters of the [[Yellowstone River]], from which it takes its historical name. Near the end of the 18th century, [[Coureur des bois|French trappers]] named the river "Roche Jaune," which is probably a translation of the [[Mandan|Minnetaree]] name "''Mi tsi a-da-zi''" (Rock Yellow River).<ref name="Macdonald">{{cite web |last=Macdonald |first=James S., Jr. |title=History of Yellowstone as a Place Name |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.yellowstone-online.com/history/yhtwo2.html |accessdate=2008-12-14}}
</ref> Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as "Yellow Stone." Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]], the Native American name source is not clear.<ref name="naming">{{cite web |title=Yellowstone: A Brief History of the Park |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/Yell257.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080414040117/http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/Yell257.pdf |archivedate=April 14, 2008}}</ref>

The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in [[Gardiner, Montana|Gardiner]], Montana, in the [[1950s]], an obsidian projectile point of [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |title=Homeland: An archaeologist's view of Yellowstone Country's past |author=Lahren, Larry |publisher=Cayuse Press |year=2006 |pages=161 |isbn=0978925106}}</ref> These [[Paleo-Indians]], of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of [[obsidian]] found in the park to make such [[cutting tool]]s and [[weapon]]s. [[Arrowhead]]s made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the [[Mississippi Valley]], indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east.<ref name="Janetski">{{cite book |last=Janetski |first=Joel C. |title=Indians in Yellowstone National Park |publisher=University of Utah Press |year=1987 |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |isbn=0-87480-724-7}}</ref> By the time [[White people|white]] [[Exploration|explorers]] first entered the region during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805, they encountered the [[Nez Perce (tribe)|Nez Perce]], [[Crow Indians|Crow]] and [[Shoshone]] tribes.

In 1806, [[John Colter]], a member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 1807<U+2013>1808. He observed at least one [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] area in the northeastern section of the park, near [[Tower Fall]].<ref name="Haines">{{cite web |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Lewis and Clark Era (1805<U+2013>1814) |work=Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1a.htm |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-11-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061015000223/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1a.htm |archivedate=2006-10-15}}</ref> After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and [[Blackfoot]] tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of "[[fire and brimstone]]" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "[[Colter's Hell]]". Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and [[Petrifaction|petrified]] trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth.<ref name="Haines2">{{cite web |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Fur Trade Era (1818<U+2013>42) |work=Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |year=2000 |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1b.htm |accessdate=2006-11-15 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061015000323/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1b.htm |archivedate=2006-10-15}}</ref>

After an 1856 exploration, mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] (also believed to be the first or second European American to have seen the [[Great Salt Lake]]) reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a "spinner of yarns". In 1859, Captain [[William F. Raynolds]], U.S. Army surveyor embarked on a [[Raynolds Expedition|two year survey]] of the northern Rockies. After wintering in Wyoming, in May 1860, Raynolds and his party which included naturalist [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]] and guide Jim Bridger attempted to cross the [[Continental Divide]] over Two Ocean Plateau from the [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]] drainage in northwest Wyoming. Heavy spring snows prevented their passage but had they been able to traverse the divide, the party would have been the first organized survey to enter the Yellowstone region.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Kenneth H. |title=Enchanted Enclosure-Historic Roads in the National Park System-Chapter 2-The Raynolds Expedition of 1860 |year=1976 |publisher=Historical Division, Office Of The Chief Of Engineers, United States Army |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/baldwin/chap2.htm |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref> The [[American Civil War]] hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s.<ref name="Haines3">{{cite web |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Exploring Era (1851<U+2013>63) |work=Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |year=1975 |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1c.htm |accessdate=2006-11-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061015000255/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1c.htm |archivedate=2006-10-15}}</ref>

The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the [[Cook<U+2013>Folsom<U+2013>Peterson Expedition]] of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake.<ref name="Haines4">{{cite web |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Folsom Party (1869) |work=Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |year=2000 |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee2b.htm |accessdate=2007-10-09 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070611045003/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee2b.htm |archivedate=2007-06-11}}</ref> The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition]] in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana [[Henry D. Washburn|Henry Washburn]], and included [[Nathaniel P. Langford]] (who later became known as "National Park" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt. [[Gustavus Cheyney Doane|Gustavus Doane]].

The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the ''Helena Herald'' newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor [[Thomas Francis Meagher]], who had previously commented that the region should be protected.<ref name="Haines5">{{cite web |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=Cornelius Hedges |work=Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |year=2000 |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee4a.htm#hedges |accessdate=2007-10-09 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013103509/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee4a.htm#hedges |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from [[Jay Cooke]] to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman [[William D.

In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871]]. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by [[William Henry Jackson]], as well as paintings by [[Thomas Moran]]. His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from [[public auction]]. On March 1, 1872, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed ''The Act of Dedication''<ref name="memory.loc.gov"/> law that created Yellowstone National Park.<ref name="grant">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=History & Culture |work=General Grant National Memorial |publisher=National Park Service |date=July 25, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/gegr/historyculture/index.htm |accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>

[[Ferdinand V.

He wished for others to see and experience it as well.  Eventually the railroads and, some time after that, the automobile would make that possible. The Park was not set aside strictly for ecological purposes, however the designation <U+201C>pleasure ground<U+201D> was not an invitation to create an amusement park.

There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years: some locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries; local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Political Geography of National Parks |last=Dilsaver |first=Lary M. |coauthors=William Wyckoff |date=May, 2005 |work=The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 74, No. 2 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=237<U+2013>266 |accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref> and numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/nrepa_local_interests_and_conservation_history/C73/L38/ |title=NREPA: Local Interests and Conservation History |last=Wuerthner, 11-15-07 |first=George |date=2007-11-15 |work=George Wuerthner's On the Range |publisher=NewWest |accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref>

After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior <ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(SUBJ+@band(Yellowstone+National+Park--Periodicals+)) Report of the Superintendent of the Yellowstone National Park to the Secretary of the Interior for the year 1872.] From The Evolution of the Conservation Movement, 1850-1920. [[Library of Congress]]</ref> and correctly predicted that Yellowstone will become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1875, Colonel [[William Ludlow]], who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of [[George Armstrong Custer]], was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's ''Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.'' The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist [[George Bird Grinnell]]. Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. "It is estimated that during the winter of 1874<U+2013>1875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."<ref name="Punke">{{cite book |last=Punke |first=Michael |title=Last Stand: George Bird Grinnell, the Battle to Save the Buffalo, and the Birth of the New West |publisher=Smithsonian Books |year=2007 |location=|pages=102 |url=|doi=|id=|isbn=9780060897826}}</ref>

As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877.<ref name="langford">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years |work=Yellowstone History |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page3.htm |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref><ref name="norris">{{cite web |last=Rydell |first=Kiki Leigh |coauthors=Mary Shivers Culpin |title=The Administrations of Nathaniel Langford and Philetus Norris |work=A History of Administrative Development in Yellowstone National Park, 1872<U+2013>1965 |publisher=Yellowstone National Park |url=http://64.241.25.110/yell/pdfs/history/administration/chapter1.pdf |format=PDF |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>
Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand, [[Philetus Norris]] volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities.<ref name="norris"/>

In 1880, [[Harry Yount]] was appointed as a gamekeeper to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Yount had previously spent a number of years exploring the mountain country of present-day Wyoming, including the [[Grand Tetons]], after joining Dr. Hayden<U+2019>s Geological Survey in 1873.<ref>{{cite book

The [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] built a [[train station]] in [[Livingston, Montana|Livingston]], Montana, connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883.<ref name="tour">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years |work=Yellowstone History |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page16.htm |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via [[stagecoach]]. By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a [[Union Pacific Railroad]] connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by [[World War II]] and ceased around the 1960s. Much of the railroad line was converted to nature trails, among them the Yellowstone Branch Line Trail.

During the 1870s and 1880s [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes were effectively excluded from the national park. A number of tribes had made seasonal use of the Yellowstone area, but the only year-round residents were small bands of Western [[Shoshone]] known as "Sheepeaters". They left the area under the assurances of a treaty negotiated in 1868, under which the Sheepeaters ceded their lands but retained the right to hunt in Yellowstone.

In 1963, after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the [[Leopold Report]], the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended management of Yellowstone's elk population.<ref>Leopold, A.

The [[wildfire]]s during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately {{convert|793880|acre|ha sqmi|0}} or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger.

The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000 [[archeology|archeological]] sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Yellowstone National Park|historic structures]] and features, and of these [[Obsidian Cliff]] and five buildings have been designated [[National Historic Landmarks]].<ref name="facts"/> Yellowstone was designated an [[International Biosphere Reserve]] on October 26, 1976, and a [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage Site]] on September 8, 1978.

[[Image:Yellowstone lake.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Yellowstone Lake]]]]

Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is {{convert|63|mi|km}} north to south, and {{convert|54|mi|km}} west to east by air. Yellowstone is {{convert|2219789|acre|ha sqmi}}<ref name="acres"/> in area, larger than the states of [[Rhode Island]] or [[Delaware]]. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at {{convert|87040|acre|ha sqmi}}. Yellowstone Lake is up to {{convert|400|ft|m}} deep and has {{convert|110|mi|km}} of shoreline. At an elevation of {{convert|7733|ft|m}} above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is [[prairie|grassland]].<ref name="facts"/>

The [[Continental Divide]] of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a [[topography|topographic]] feature that separates [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and [[Snake River]]s are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The park sits on the [[Yellowstone Plateau]], at an average elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by [[mountain range]]s of the [[Rocky Mountains|Middle Rocky Mountains]], which range from {{convert|9000|to|11000|ft|m}} in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop [[Eagle Peak (Wyoming)|Eagle Peak]] ({{convert|11358|ft|m|disp=/}}) and the lowest is along Reese Creek ({{convert|5282|ft|m|disp=/}}).<ref name="facts"/> Nearby mountain ranges include the [[Gallatin Range]] to the northwest, the [[Beartooth Mountains]] in the north, the [[Absaroka Range]] to the east, and the [[Teton Range]] and the [[Madison Range]] to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is [[Mount Washburn]] at {{convert|10243|ft|m}}.

Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest [[petrified forest]]s, trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris, are believed to have come from the park area itself. This is largely due to the fact that Yellowstone is actually a massive caldera of a supervolcano. There are 290 [[waterfall]]s of at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the park, the highest being the [[Yellowstone Falls|Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River]] at {{convert|308|ft|m}}.<ref name="facts"/>

Three deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000&nbsp;years. The [[Lewis River (Wyoming)|Lewis River]] flows through [[Lewis Canyon]] in the south, and the [[Yellowstone River]] has carved two colorful canyons, the [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]] and the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.

Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the [[Snake River Plain]], a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho some {{Convert|400|mi|km|-1}} to the west. This feature traces the route of the [[North American Plate]] over the last 17 million years as it was transported by [[plate tectonics]] across a stationary [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the [[crust (geology)|crust]] of the Earth.<ref name="snake">{{cite web |url=http://tapestry.usgs.gov/features/34snakeriver.html |title=The Snake River Plain |work=|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=March 12, 2001 |accessdate=2007-03-12 }}</ref>

The [[Yellowstone Caldera]] is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "[[supervolcano]]" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000&nbsp;years ago, which released 240&nbsp;cubic miles (1,000&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of ash, rock and [[pyroclast]]ic materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]].<ref name="volcanic">{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs100-03/ |title=Tracking Changes in Yellowstone's Restless Volcanic System |work=|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=January 19, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> It produced a [[Volcanic crater|crater]] nearly a two thirds of a mile (1&nbsp;km) deep and {{convert|52|by|28|mi|km}} in area and deposited the [[Lava Creek Tuff]], a [[Tuff#Welded tuff|welded tuff]] [[geologic formation]]. The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1&nbsp;million years ago, ejected 588&nbsp;cubic miles (2,450&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the [[Huckleberry Ridge Tuff]] and created the [[Island Park Caldera]].<ref name="volcanic history">{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/history.html |title=Volcanic History of the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field |work=Yellowstone Volcano Observatory |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=February 2, 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> A smaller eruption ejected 67&nbsp;cubic miles (280&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of material 1.2&nbsp;million years ago, forming the [[Henry's Fork Caldera]] and depositing the [[Mesa Falls Tuff]].<ref name="volcanic"/>

Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the [[extinction]] of many species, primarily in North America.<ref name="sciamerican">{{cite web |last=Bindeman |first=Ilya N. |title=The Secrets of Supervolcanoes |work=|publisher=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=1&articleID=0006E0BF-BB43-146C-BB4383414B7F0000 |month=June |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the [[West Thumb]] of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows.<ref name="volcanic history"/>

Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied [[magma chamber]]. This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make an accurate prediction for future volcanic events.<ref name="time">{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/faqsfactivity.html#eruptagain |title=Questions About Future Volcanic Activity |work=Yellowstone Volcano Observatory |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=February 2, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

Between 630,000 and 700,000&nbsp;years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] lavas such as those that can be seen at [[Obsidian Cliff]]s and [[basalt]]ic lavas which can be viewed at [[Sheepeater Cliff]]. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic [[V-shaped valley]], indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by [[glacier|glaciation]].

The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is [[Old Faithful Geyser]], located in [[Upper Geyser Basin]]. [[Castle Geyser]], [[Lion Geyser]] and [[Beehive Geyser]] are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world<U+2014>[[Steamboat Geyser]] in the [[Norris Geyser Basin]]. There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether.

In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New [[fumarole]]s were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally.<ref name="geyserbasin">{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2003/NorrisTherm03.html |title=Notable Changes in Thermal Activity at Norris Geyser Basin Provide Opportunity to Study Hydrothermal System |work=Yellowstone Volcano Observatory |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=March 16, 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past.

Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge [[landslide]], which caused a partial dam collapse on [[Hebgen Lake]]; immediately downstream, the [[sediment]] from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as [[Quake Lake|Earthquake Lake]]. Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs that normally have clear water turned muddy.<ref name="earthquake"/> A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera.<ref name="volcanic"/> Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days.

=== Flora ===
Over 1,700 [[species]] of [[tree]]s and other [[vascular plant]]s are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be [[exotic species]] and are non-native.

In Yellowstone's hot waters, [[bacteria]] form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other [[arthropod]]s live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from [[sulfur]]. In 2005, researchers from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse [[hyperthermophilic]] species is [[hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]].<ref name="bacteria">{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/30.html |title=Microbes In Colorful Yellowstone Hot Springs Fueled By Hydrogen, CU-Boulder Researchers Say |work=|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder |date=January 24, 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources.

Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest [[megafauna]] wildlife habitat in the [[contiguous United States|lower 48 states]]. There are almost 60 species of [[mammal]]s in the park, including the [[gray wolf]], the [[threatened species|threatened]] [[lynx]], and [[grizzly bear]]s.<ref name="facts"/> Other large mammals include the [[American bison|bison]] (buffalo), [[American black bear|black bear]], [[elk]], [[moose]], [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[mountain goat]], [[pronghorn]], [[bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain lion]].

The [[Yellowstone Park Bison Herd]] is the largest public herd of [[American Bison]] in the [[United States]]. The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit [[bovine]] diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to [[brucellosis]], a [[bacteria]]l disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause [[cattle]] to [[miscarriage|miscarry]]. The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the "likely source" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and [[North Dakota]]. Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle.<ref name="aphis">{{cite web |title=Brucellosis and Yellowstone Bison |work=Brucellosis |publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/brucellosis/cattle.htm |accessdate=2007-03-16}} {{dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref> Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The [[Yellowstone Park Bison Herd]] reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter.<ref name="bison2">{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Bison |work=Nature and Science |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bisonqa.htm |date=August 9, 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> The [[Yellowstone Park Bison Herd]] is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America.

To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996<U+2013>97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter.<ref name="aphis"/> [[Animal rights]] activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.<ref name="aphis"/>

Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of ''"destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry"'' on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone.<ref name="dow">{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=2007-06-07}}</ref> Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed.<ref name="dow"/> After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the [[coyote]] then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.
[[File:WolfRunningInSnow.jpg|right|thumb|A reintroduced [[gray wolf]] in Yellowstone National Park]]
By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (which oversees threatened and endangered species), [[Mackenzie Valley Wolf|Mackenzie Valley wolves]], imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval.<ref name="rmw">{{cite web |title=Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery 2005 Interagency Annual Report |work=|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Nez Perce Tribe, National Park Service, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, Idaho Fish and Game, and USDA Wildlife Services |date=|url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/annualrpt05/2005_WOLF_REPORT_TOTAL.pdf |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref> Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995<U+2013>96.<ref name="rmw"/> The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.<ref name="delisting">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Final Rule Designating the Northern Rocky Mountain Population of Gray Wolf as a Distinct Population Segment and Removing This Distinct Population Segment From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=February 27, 2008 |url=http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&o=09000064803cae39 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone.

Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000<U+2014>the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone.

[[Wildfire]] is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir|Douglas-fir]] has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. [[Lodgepole Pine]]s <U+2014>the most common tree species in the park<U+2014> generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. [[Subalpine Fir]], [[Engelmann Spruce]], [[Whitebark Pine]] and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. [[Populus tremuloides|Aspen]] trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil.<ref name="fireecology">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Fire Ecology |work=Yellowstone Wildland Fire |publisher=National Park Service |date=October 25, 2006 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070209144441rn_1/www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/ecology.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.<ref name="fireecology"/>

About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by [[lightning]], while another six to ten are started by people<U+2014> in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three [[fire lookout|fire towers]], each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public.

[[File:yellowstonefiredamage.jpg|left|thumb|Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone]]
In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. [[Controlled burn]]s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas.<ref name="prescribed ">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Prescribed Fire |work=Yellowstone Wildland Fire |publisher=National Park Service |date=October 25, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070610004917/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger.
The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.

[[File:Crown fire Old Faithful.jpg|thumb|right|A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988]]

1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the droughts of 1988 and 1989. [[Grass]]es and [[plant]]s which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from {{convert|8500|acre|ha sqmi}} throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to {{convert|99000|acre|ha sqmi}} on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than {{convert|150000|acre|ha sqmi}} were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the {{convert|793000|acre|ha sqmi}} that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage.<ref name="fires"/> Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.

Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals<U+2014> surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000<U+2013>50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.<ref name="fires"/>

Called the [[Teton<U+2013>Yellowstone tornado]], it was classified as an [[Fujita Scale|F4]], with wind speeds estimated at between {{convert|207|and|260|mph|km/h}}. The tornado left a path of destruction {{convert|1|to|2|mi|km}} wide, and {{convert|24|mi|km}} long, and leveled {{convert|15000|acre|ha sqmi}} of mature pine forest.<ref name="tornado">{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Severe Weather |work=|publisher=Wyoming Climate Office |date=March 14, 2007 |url=http://www.wrds.uwyo.edu/wrds/wsc/climateatlas/severe_weather.html |accessdate=2007<U+2212>03<U+2212>20}}</ref>

Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year.<ref name="Visitation">{{cite web |title=Historical Annual Visitation Statistics |work=Yellowstone National Park |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/parkmgmt/historicstats.htm |date=August 10, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> In 2010, a record number of visitors came to the park in July: 975,000.  July is the busiest month for Yellowstone National Park.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/08/04/yellowstone.visitor.record/index.html /CNN Travel]</ref> At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.<ref name="facts"/>

Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from [[Gardiner, Montana|Gardiner]], Montana, and extends to [[Cooke City, Montana|Cooke City]], Montana, are closed to wheeled vehicles.<ref name="roads">{{cite web |title=Road Construction Delays and Closures |publisher=National Park Service |date=April 9, 2007 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/roadclosures.htm |accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May.<ref name="hours">{{cite web |title=Operating Hours & Seasons |publisher=National Park Service |date=April 22, 2007 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/hours.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> The park has {{convert|310|mi|km}} of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances.<ref name="facts"/> There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided [[snowmobile]] and [[snow coach]] tours.<ref name="winter">{{cite web |title=Winter Services in Yellowstone |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/winterser.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.
[[File:Old faithful inn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Faithful Inn]]]]
The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the [[Old Faithful Inn]] built in 1903<U+2013>04 and the entire [[Fort Yellowstone|Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District]]. An historical and educational tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.

[[Camping]] is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites.<ref name="facts"/> Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south. [[Backcountry]] campsites are accessible only by foot or by [[horseback riding|horseback]] and require a permit. There are {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of [[hiking]] trails available.<ref name="hikes">{{cite web |title=Hiking in the Park |publisher=National Park Service |date=August 17, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/hiking.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> The park is not considered to be a good destination for [[mountaineering]] because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in "frontcountry" zones such as drive in campgrounds.<ref name="pets">{{cite web |title=Regulations Regarding Pets |publisher=National Park Service |date=July 12, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/pets.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year.<ref name="safety">{{cite web |title=Information Every Visitor Needs to Know |publisher=National Park Service |date=March 6, 2007 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/yoursafety.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> [[File:YellowstoneBears.jpg|thumb|left|Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger]]

[[Hunting]] is not permitted, though it is allowed in the surrounding national forests during season. [[Fishing]] is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters.<ref name="fishing">{{cite web |title=Fishing in Yellowstone National Park |publisher=National Park Service |date=April 4, 2007 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> Many park waters are [[fly fishing]] only and all native fish species are [[catch and release]] only.<ref name=YNPFishReg>[http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/fishreg06.pdf 2007 Yellowstone National Park Fishing Regulations]</ref> Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a {{convert|5|mi|km}} stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and [[Shoshone Lake]], and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination.<ref name="boating">{{cite web |title=Boating in Yellowstone National Park |publisher=National Park Service |date=September 18, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/boating.htm |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>

In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/yellowstoneindepth/episode3transcript.htm National Park Service]</ref>

Other protected lands in the region include [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest|Caribou-Targhee]], [[Gallatin National Forest|Gallatin]], [[Custer National Forest|Custer]], [[Shoshone National Forest|Shoshone]] and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway]] is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed [[Beartooth Highway]] provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include [[West Yellowstone, Montana|West Yellowstone]], Montana; [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]], Wyoming; [[Red Lodge, Montana|Red Lodge]], Montana; [[Ashton, Idaho|Ashton]], Idaho; and [[Gardiner, Montana|Gardiner]], Montana.
