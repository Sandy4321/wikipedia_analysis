{{Campaignbox 2011 Libyan civil war}}

The '''Battle of Misrata''' is a battle of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] between pro-Gaddafi loyalists and [[Libyan opposition|anti-Gaddafi forces]], which hold [[Misrata]], the third largest city in [[Libya]].

Following the initial stages of the uprising, the Libyan government took back most towns in the west of the country, leaving Misrata the only major city under rebel control in [[Tripolitania]], along with several locations in the [[Nafusa Mountains]]. It has since become one of the major and most symbolic battles of the war. During the siege, the city has seen intense fighting and is under daily assaults and shelling. Following the beginning of the UN military intervention in the civil war, NATO declared that breaking the encirclement of the city was its top priority.

It is so far the longest battle of the war and one of the three bloodiest, alongside the [[First Battle of Benghazi]] and the [[Battle of Az Zawiyah]].

==The Battle==
===Rebels capture the city and the air base battle===
''' 18<U+2013>26 February'''

On 18 February, the battle for the city started with violent confrontations between, initially unarmed, protestors and pro-Gaddafi militiamen. By 23 February, the opposition drove out loyalist forces from the city and were in full control. 6-14 protestors were killed in the clashes and another 200 were wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhjournal.com/2011/02/23/clampdown-in-libyan-capital-as-protests-close-in/|title=Clampdown in Libyan capital as protests close in|date= February 23, 2011|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12636798|title=Libya revolt: Gaddafi in crimes against humanity probe|publisher=BBC News|date= March 3, 2011|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref>

On 24 February, Gaddafi loyalists armed with [[rocket-propelled grenades]] and [[mortars]] fired at a group of opposition fighters guarding the airport. During the fighting, the airport's defenders seized a [[ZPU|ZPU-4]] [[anti-aircraft]] gun used by the militias and turned it against them. When the battle started, officers from an air force school near the airport mutinied and helped the opposition attack an adjacent military air base where Gaddafi's troops were stationed. The officers then disabled fighter jets at the base to prevent them from being used against the uprising.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/24/AR2011022401170.html|title=Gadhafi forces strike back at Libya uprising|agency=Associated Press|date=Feb 24, 2011|accessdate=Feb 25, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://feb17.info/confirmed/this-just-in/|title=This Just In !!|publisher=Feb17.info|date= February 24, 2011|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>

On the evening of the second day of the battle, Gaddafi's forces, supported by tanks, succeeded in retaking part of the military air base. Fighting at the base continued until after midnight, leaving 22 dead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2011/02/25/protesters_hit_by_hail_of_gunfire_in_libya_march/|title=Protesters hit by hail of gunfire in Libya march

On 6 March, pro-Gaddafi forces attempted to retake Misrata, and sent soldiers and tanks into the city. The rebels allowed the government forces to enter the center of the city so that they could be surrounded and captured. Seven tanks and 25 technicals entered Misrata and three tanks made it all the way to the center before the fighting began and they became trapped.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/9417359.stm | work=BBC News | title=Libya revolt as it happened: Monday | date=8 March 2011}}</ref>

===Artillery and tank attacks===

On 16 March, a new artillery attack on Misrata commenced and another round of fighting started. The rebels claimed to have destroyed 16 loyalist tanks and captured 20 government soldiers.

;17<U+2013>18 March
On the night of 17 March, government troops started an artillery and tank attack on Misrata. The attack continued well into the next day. During 18 March, a cease-fire was announced by the government, following the United Nations Security council resolution on authorisation for military intervention by foreign countries. However, the attack on Misrata continued for at least another four hours. It was not know if this was deliberate or the orders had not gotten to the troops on the ground in the city yet. By the time the cease-fire was ordered, government troops had already breached the rebel defences on the outskirts of the city and were in Misrata itself with tanks firing randomly and troops conducting house-to-house searches to capture opposition fighters, according to the rebels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/18/libya.civil.war/index.html?hpt=C1#|title=Opposition: Violence rages despite Libyan claim of cease-fire|accessdate=18 March 2011 | work=CNN|date=19 March 2011}}</ref> Video from the city itself showed damaged streets, following heavy fighting, with at least four destroyed tanks and two armored personel carriers.<ref>{{Youtube|rSiVshn_vE8|Misurata 18 March}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libyafeb17.com/2011/03/egypts-military-has-begun-shipping-arms-over-the-border-to-libyan-revolutionaries/ |title=Video: more footage from Misratah showing 2 disabled tanks today |publisher=Libya February 17th |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref>

On 22 March, artillery shelling and sniper fire in Misrata continued.

Overnight, Gaddafi's forces managed to capture the main hospital in Misrata, and had positioned snipers on top of it. The opposition requested a hospital ship to be sent to Misrata's port, the only part of the city still in firm rebel control, to treat the injured, as the injured no longer had a place to go.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-23 |title=Libya Live Blog - March 23 |publisher=Al Jazeera Blogs |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref>

Due to the difficulty of getting journalists to Misrata, little to none of their report can be independently confirmed.

They also stated that they fought Gaddafi's forces in Souwa, the western part of Misrata, where they claimed to have destroyed one tank and killed six loyalist soldiers.

On 3 April, according to a witness from the city's Al Qalaa section, the rebels attacked Gaddafi's forces positioned in the area of Taghma around five in the morning, forcing Gaddafi's forces to retreat to the section of Jfara after a five-hour battle.

The numbers of civilians killed in comparison to the numbers of rebels killed have also varried, with one doctor in the city claiming that 80 percent of those killed were civilians,<ref name=autogenerated7 /> while a member of Misrata's medical committee stated that up until 21 April, 365 people were killed, of which only 85 were civilians.<ref name="irishtimes1"/><ref name="thestarphoenix1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/story_print.html?id=4653578&sponsor=|title=Director, photographer killed in Libya|accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref> Based on various reports during the battle, roughly three-quarters (of the lower number) to a fifth (of the higher number) of those killed were rebels, while the rest were civilians (see infobox at the top of the article). Loyalist forces had also suffered around 200 dead, a number based on witness and rebel reports.
