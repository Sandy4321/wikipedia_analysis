{{infobox californium}}
'''Californium''' is a synthetic [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metallic [[chemical element]] in the [[actinide]] series with the symbol '''Cf''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;98. The element was first produced in 1950 by bombarding [[curium]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[ion]]s) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It was the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be synthesized and is one of the highest atomic mass elements to be produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye. The element was named for [[California]] and the [[University of California]].

The element has two crystalline forms under normal pressure, one above 900&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and one below; a third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. It disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulating]] in skeletal tissue. The most stable of californium's twenty [[isotope]]s is californium-251, which has a [[half-life]] of 898&nbsp;years. Californium-252, whose half-life is 2.645&nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the U.S. state of Tennessee and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain [[isotopes of californium]] to emit [[neutron]]s. For example, californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with [[neutron diffraction]] and [[neutron spectroscopy]]. [[Ununoctium]] (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with [[calcium-48]] [[ion]]s.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Unlike many other elements heavier than [[plutonium]], enough californium can be collected to determine some of its properties. Californium is a silvery white [[actinide]] metal{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} with an estimated [[melting point]] of 900&nbsp;<U+00B1>30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and an estimated [[boiling point]] of 1475&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.{{sfn|Haire|2006|pp=1522, 1523}} The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut by a razor blade; above 300&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, californium metal quickly deteriorates.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}} Below 51&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]<!-- KEEP IN KELVIN --> (-220&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) californium metal is either [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66&nbsp;K it is [[antiferromagnetic]] (an intermediate state), and above 160&nbsp;K<!-- KEEP IN KELVIN --> (-110&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) it is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1525}} It forms [[alloy]]s with [[lanthanide]] metals.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}} 

The element has two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] under normal pressures: a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close-packed]] form dubbed alpha (<U+03B1>) that exists below 900&nbsp;<U+00B0>C with a density of 15.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] form designated beta (<U+03B2>) that exists above 900&nbsp;<U+00B0>C with a density of 8.74 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} At 48&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]] of pressure the <U+03B2> form changes into an [[orthorhombic crystal system]] due to de-localization of the atom's [[Electron shell|5f electrons]], which frees them to bond.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}{{#tag:ref|The three lower mass transplutonium elements <U+2014>[[americium]], [[curium]], and [[berkelium]] <U+2014> require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}|group=note}} The resistance to uniform pressure, called the [[bulk modulus]], of californium is 50&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;5&nbsp;GPa, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70&nbsp;GPa).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}

===Chemical properties and compounds===
Californium exhibits [[Valence (chemistry)|valences]] of 4, 3, or 2, indicating the number of [[chemical bond]]s one atom of the element can form.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other 3+ valence actinide elements{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} and the element [[dysprosium]], which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table.{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4-8}} The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing with added moisture.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} Californium reacts when heated with [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], or a [[chalcogen]] ([[oxygen]] family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous [[mineral acid]]s are rapid.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} <!-- EXPLAIN Only californium-249 is suitable for chemical study.<ref name="Emeleus">{{cite book|last=Emeleus|first=H.

The only californium [[ion]] that is stable in [[aqueous solution]]s is the californium(III) [[cation]].{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4-8}} The element forms a water-soluble [[chloride]], [[nitrate]], [[perchlorate]], and [[sulfate]] and is precipitated as a [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]] or [[hydroxide]].{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} If problems of availability of the element could be overcome, then CfBr<sub>2</sub> and CfI<sub>2</sub> would likely be stable.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=1272}} 

The +2 [[oxidation state]] is represented by californium(II) bromide (yellow, CfBr<sub>2</sub>) and californium(II) iodide (dark violet, CfI<sub>2</sub>).{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} The +3 oxidation state is represented by californium(III) oxide (yellow-green, Cf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), californium(III) fluoride (bright green, CfF<sub>3</sub>) and californium(III) iodide (lemon yellow, CfI<sub>3</sub>).{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} Other +3 oxidation states include the sulfide and [[metallocene]].{{sfn|Cotton|1999|p=1163}} Californium(IV) oxide (black brown, CfO<sub>2</sub>), californium(IV) fluoride (green, CfF<sub>4</sub>) represent the +4 oxidation state. The +4 oxidation state creates strong [[oxidizing agent]]s and +2 state creates strong [[reducing agent]]s.{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}}

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of californium}}
Twenty [[radioisotope]]s of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a [[half-life]] of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years.{{sfn|NNDC|2008}} All the remaining isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes.{{sfn|NNDC|2008}} The isotopes of californium range in [[mass number]] from 237 to 256.{{sfn|NNDC|2008}}

Californium-249 is formed from the [[beta decay]] of [[berkelium]]-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a [[nuclear reactor]].{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4-8}} Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its habit of collecting neutrons (high [[neutron capture]]) and tendency to interact with other particles (high [[cross section (physics)|cross section]]).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1504}} 

Californium-252 has a half-life of 2.645 years and is a very strong [[neutron]] emitter, making it extremely [[radioactive]] and harmful.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Hicks, D.

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of [[curium]]-242 ({{Nuclide|curium|242}}) was bombarded with 35&nbsp;MeV-[[alpha particle]]s ({{Nuclide|helium|4}}) in the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[cyclotron]] at [[Berkeley, California]], which produced californium-245 ({{Nuclide|californium|245}}), which has a half-life of 44&nbsp;minutes, plus one [[free neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}).{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

The discoverers named the new element for California and the [[University of California]]; this was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=849}} {{#tag:ref|[[Europium]], in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named [[americium]].

[[Terbium]] was named for the city it was discovered in, so element 97 was named [[berkelium]].{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=848}}|group=note}} However, the element directly above element&nbsp;98 in the periodic table, [[dysprosium]], has a name that simply means "hard to get at" so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=347}} They added that "the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California."{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=848}}

The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element. In an article entitled "Facts and Fallacies of World War III" in the July, 1961 edition of ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, the claim was made that "A californium atomic bomb need be no bigger than a pistol bullet. You could build a hand-held six-shooter to fire bullets that would explode on contact with the force of 10 tons of TNT."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Popular Science|page=180|date=July 1961|volume=179|issue=1|issn=0161-7370}}</ref>

In October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of [[ununoctium]] (element 118) had been identified at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in Dubna, Russia, as the product of bombardment of californium-249 with [[calcium]]-48, making it the heaviest element ever synthesized.

==Precautions==
Californium disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulating]] in skeletal tissue.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=106}} The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}} 

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.<ref name=ANL2005/>

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through [[gamma ray]] emission.<ref name=ANL2005/> [[Ionizing radiation]] emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer. An incidence of two to six fatal cancers are expected to occur for every 100,000 people continuously exposed to soil with an initial average concentration of 1&nbsp;[[Picocurie|pCi]]/g of californium-251 and californium-249, respectively.<ref name=ANL2005/> For comparison, radiation levels in soil of 0.2&nbsp;pCi/g are considered low while levels at or above 4.2&nbsp;pCi/g are regarded as high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/tenorm/sources.html#summary-table|title=TENORM Sources|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|year=2011|accessdate=20110406}}</ref>
