The [[Houston Astros]] chose Nevin with the [[List of MLB first overall draft choices|first overall pick]] in the [[1992 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref name="lwhitelat"/> [[Hal Newhouser]], a [[scout (sport)|scout]] for the Astros, had evaluated [[Derek Jeter]] extensively prior to the draft.

Signing bonuses given to the first overall pick were increasing rapidly. [[Todd Van Poppel]], the first pick of the [[1990 MLB draft]], signed for $1.2 million, while the [[1991 MLB draft]]'s first pick, [[Brien Taylor]], signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college.<ref name=development/> Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, [[John Burke (1990s pitcher)|John Burke]], who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection.<ref name=development/> Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.<ref name=olney2004/>

===International career===
Nevin tried out for the [[United States national baseball team]] in the summer of 1990 to play in that year's [[1990 Goodwill Games|Goodwill Games]] and [[World University Baseball Championship]] (WUBC). To prepare for those tournaments, the team played a series against Japan and a game in Cuba.<ref name=usa>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-18/sports/sp-394_1_cal-state-fullerton-baseball-team |title=Titans' Nevin to Play Baseball for Team U.S.A. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 18, 1990 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Nevin played [[second base|second]] and [[third base]] for Team USA in 13 of its 22 games, batting .229. The team released him before the Goodwill Games and WUBC as it cut players to meet the roster maximum.

Nevin tried out for Team USA again before the [[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].

===Professional career===
====Prospect years (1992<U+2013>1997)====

Nevin traveled with the Astros at the end of their [[1992 Houston Astros season|1992 season]] but was not on the team's roster. The Astros sent Nevin to the instructional [[Arizona Fall League]] during the off-season.<ref name=diamond/><ref name=gainesville/> Before the 1993 season, ''[[Baseball America]]'' ranked Nevin as the 30th-best prospect in baseball.<ref name=top100>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/top-100-prospects/all-time.html|title=All-Time Top 100 Prospects|publisher=Baseball America|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref>

The Astros considered sending Nevin to the [[Jackson Generals]] of the [[Class AA]] [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] to start his professional career.<ref name=diamond/> The team also considered promoting him directly to the major leagues, [[List of Major League Baseball players who never played in the Minor League|skipping the minor leagues entirely]]. At the Astros' [[spring training]] in 1993, Nevin batted .350 and showed good [[power hitting]].<ref name="one step away"/> The Astros weighed bringing Nevin to Houston for [[Opening Day]] as they sought to add a right-handed batter to complement the left-handed power of [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Steve Finley]] and [[Eric Anthony]] and make the team less vulnerable to left-handed pitching. But with [[Ken Caminiti]] in the first year of a three-year contract to play as the starting third baseman, Nevin had nowhere to play [[baseball positions|defensively]]. The Astros assigned him to the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[Tucson Toros]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], one level below the major leagues, where he made his professional debut.<ref name="one step away">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-10/sports/sp-11716_1_phil-nevin |title=Just One Step Away: Phil Nevin Is Doing Well at Triple-A Tucson; His Move Up to Houston Seems Right on Schedule|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Mike|last=DiGiovanna|date=July 10, 1993 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref>

While Nevin was with the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager [[Rick Sweet]] to play Nevin as a [[left fielder]], which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play different positions.<ref name="one step away"/> Veteran [[first baseman]] [[Jim Lindeman]] served as Nevin's mentor, helping him keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform.<ref name="one step away"/> Nevin started the 1993 season with a .247 batting average, but batted .309 with [[baserunner]]s in [[scoring position]] and had 49 RBI. By July, he made ten starts in [[left field]], without committing an [[error (baseball)|error]].<ref name="one step away"/> The Astros, however, were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in "[[clutch (sports)|clutch]]" situations to cases where there were no baserunners and the score was not close.<ref name="one step away"/>

Nevin's intensity almost got the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson.<ref name="one step away"/> He was taunted by a man seated in the front row, and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested.<ref name="one step away"/>

Nevin played third base and left field in 1993.<ref name="one step away"/> He batted .286 that season, with 10 home runs and 91 RBI. He had a .359 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and .413 [[slugging percentage]] (SLG).<ref name=toledo>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MG1PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aQMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6502,5522937&dq=phil-nevin&hl=en|title=Baseball Notebook: Nevin Expected to Join Hens Soon|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=August 18, 1995|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref> ''Baseball America'' rated him the 24th best prospect before the 1994 season.<ref name=top100/> He returned to Tucson that year, posting a .263 batting average with 12 home runs and 71 RBI. He had a .343 OBP, and .393 SLG.<ref name=toledo/> Nevin also played [[first base]].<ref name=toledo/> His major-league debut, however, was delayed both by his defense (61 errors in his first two seasons) and the [[1994<U+2013>95 Major League Baseball strike|MLB 1994<U+2013>95 work stoppage]].<ref name=toledo/>

{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote="I wouldn't say that he was a disappointment. His attitude left something to be desired, but we don't question whether he has the ability to play in the big leagues. He does."|source=&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;[[Bob Watson]]<ref name=toledo/>}}

The Astros traded Caminiti to the [[San Diego Padres]] before the 1995 season. With Caminiti no longer blocking his path to the major leagues, Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros' starting third baseman.<ref name=top100/> But the Astros did not invite him to spring training. Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to work out with [[replacement players]] during the work stoppage.<ref name=curse/> Not wanting to be seen as "scabs" by the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]], minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players, while career minor-leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues. When prospects including Nevin and [[Billy Wagner]] refused to play with the replacement players, Astros' general manager [[Bob Watson]] issued an ultimatum, saying anyone who refused to play in the team's first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-03-01/sports/9503010027_1_scabs-astros-replacement-player |title=Astros To Send Packing Players Who Won't Play|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |first=Jerry |last=Greene|date=March 1, 1995 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/19333706.html?dids=19333706:19333706&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+01%2C+1995&author=Jim+Molony&pub=USA+TODAY+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Astros+give+minor+leaguers+ultimatum&pqatl=google |title=Astros give minor leaguers ultimatum |first=Jim |last=Molony|page=04.C|newspaper=USA Today |date=March 1, 1995 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}} {{subscription required|date=April 2012}}</ref> The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season, while [[Dave Magadan]] started at third base on [[Opening Day]].

The Astros acquired pitcher [[Mike Henneman]] from the [[Detroit Tigers]] for a [[player to be named later]] on August 10; Nevin was identified as the player five days later. In 1996, Nevin played in Class AA for the Tigers with the [[Jacksonville Suns]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]], where he was converted into a [[catcher]].<ref name=kepner/>

====Recovering from earlier struggles (1998<U+2013>2001)====
After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher [[Matt Walbeck]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]], where Collins was manager, for minor league player Nick Skuse. After an injury to starting catcher [[Todd Greene]], Collins gave Nevin the opportunity to compete for the starting job with Walbeck.<ref name=catch>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/18/sports/sp-30263 |title=Nevin May Be the Catch of Spring |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Mike|last=DiGiovanna|date=March 18, 1998|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the [[umpire (baseball)|home plate umpire]] in a 1998 game.<ref name=utsandiego/>

He then had the best offensive years of his career: he hit 31 home runs with a .916 [[on base plus slugging]] (OPS) during the 2000 season. He was named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team in {{mlby|2001}}, when he hit 41 home runs with 126 RBI and had a .976 OPS. He also led major-league third basemen in [[Error (baseball)|errors]], however, with 27, and had the lowest [[fielding percentage]] of all major league third basemen (.930).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2001-specialpos_3b-fielding.shtml|title=2001 National League Third Base|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

====Injuries and final seasons (2002<U+2013>2006)====
Nevin in 2002 played first base, which was considered his strongest defensive position.<ref name=sosd/> But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons.

Nevin was often frustrated with the dimensions of [[Petco Park]]. He hit a [[double (baseball)|double]] during a 2004 game that he believed would have been a home run in other stadiums; when he reached [[second base]], he pointed toward Padres' general manager [[Kevin Towers]]' suite and threw down his helmet, resulting in a postgame argument.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan |last=Hayes |url=http://www.nctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/mlb/padres/padres-mets-provide-an-example-as-padres-deliberate-on-petco/article_e4311517-127d-541f-b298-65b6216f1727.html |title=Mets provide an example as Padres deliberate on Petco's dimensions |newspaper=North County Times |date=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Towers said the two had a "love-hate" relationship.<ref name=utsandiego/>

Two nights after [[San Diego Padres]] management informed Nevin that [[Xavier Nady]] would replace him as the starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Sidney Ponson]] on July 25, 2005.<ref name=signonsandiego/> Nevin exercised a [[trade (sports)|clause]] in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises, one of which was the Orioles.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary |last=Washburn|work=MLB.com |url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050725&content_id=1144718&vkey=news_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal |title=Nevin rejects proposed Ponson deal|date=July 25, 2005|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the [[waivers (baseball)|non-waiver]] trade deadline, to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Chan Ho Park]], whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump.<ref name=signonsandiego/><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20050730&content_id=1150504&vkey=pr_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=Rangers acquire IF Phil Nevin from San Diego in exchange for RHP Chan Ho Park|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=July 30, 2005|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1<U+2013>12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44.

He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.<ref name=signonsandiego/>

Nevin had one year remaining on a contract worth $9 million.
