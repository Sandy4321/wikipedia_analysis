'''''Faryl''''' is the [[debut album]] by British [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Faryl Smith]], released on 9 March, 2009 by [[Universal Classics and Jazz]]. Smith rose to fame after her appearance on the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|second series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', and signed with Universal after the competition. The album was recorded during December 2008 and January 2009 and features the track "River of Light", a song set to ''[[The Blue Danube]]'', for which a promotional music video was recorded. The album also features a 60 piece orchestra, and was produced by Jon Cohen. ''Faryl''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s promotion included numerous television and radio appearances, and Smith meeting with [[Gordon Brown]] at [[10 Downing Street]].

After its release, ''Faryl'' became the fastest selling classical solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days, and the album sold 29,200 copies in the first week, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. It received mostly positive reviews, with praise for Smith's voice and maturity. ''Faryl'' entered the charts at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a ''Britain's Got Talent'' contestant to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour of the US to publicise the album.

==Reception==
Pete Paphides, writing for ''[[The Times]]'', said that the songs were performed "with power and restraint", and that the "arrangements by Jon Cohen suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist". He compared it favourably to three other [[Mothering Sunday]] releases, [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Just Go (Lionel Richie album)|Just Go]]'', [[Ronan Keating]]'s ''[[Songs for My Mother]]'' and [[Barry Manilow]]'s ''[[The Greatest Songs of the Eighties]]''.
