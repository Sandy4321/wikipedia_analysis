{{nihongo|'''Ventus'''|<U+30F4><U+30A7><U+30F3><U+30C8><U+30A5><U+30B9>|Ventusu|lead=yes}}, commonly nicknamed {{nihongo|'''Ven'''|<U+30F4><U+30A7><U+30F3>}}, is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[Square Enix]]'s [[video game]] franchise ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Having first made cameos in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and other related titles, Ventus was introduced in the 2010 prequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' as one of the three protagonists. In its story, Ventus is introduced as the youngest apprentice of [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Master Eraqus|Master Eraqus]] who trains him alongside his best friends, [[Terra (Kingdom Hearts)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (Kingdom Hearts)|Aqua]], to become experienced warriors with the weapon [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Keyblades|Keyblade]]. When Terra goes on a mission to find the missing [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xehanort|Master Xehanort]], Ventus follows him as he starts getting concerned about his fate. As he journeys through various worlds, Ventus learns about his origins and his relation with Xehanort and his apprentice [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Vanitas|Vanitas]].

Ventus was designed by director [[Tetsuya Nomura]] who wanted him to have an important connection with the series' main character [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Ventus bears an extremely striking resemblance to the character of [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]], both of whom are voiced by [[K<U+014D>ki Uchiyama]] in Japanese and [[Jesse McCartney]] in English. After Ventus's first cameo, Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in ''Birth by Sleep''. Video game websites also commented on Ventus's first appearance, first confusing him for Roxas during development of ''Birth by Sleep'', but nevertheless, his role within the game has been well received.

==Appearances==
Before being introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', Ventus first made cameos in the secret endings of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and its re-release, ''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix'', which depicted him and his friends Terra and Aqua battling [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xehanort|Master Xehanort]] and [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Vanitas|Vanitas]]. Ventus is also shown in a cameo in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' when [[Xion (Kingdom Hearts)|Xion]], a replica of Sora, is seen as Ventus while fighting [[Organization XIII#Xigbar|Xigbar]].<ref name="daysultimania">{{cite book |trans_title=Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days Ultimania|title=<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> 358/2 Days <U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2>|year=2009|isbn=978-4-7575-2578-8 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=}}</ref> Ventus is also constantly referenced by Xigbar in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and ''358/2 Days'' while [[Organization XIII#Xemnas|Xemnas]], the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Nobody]] of Xehanort, is in search of him in Castle Oblivion.<ref name="bbs"/> 

Prior to the start of ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', Ventus was the apprentice of Master Xehanort, who trained him to complete the legendary <U+03C7>-blade. However, due to Ventus's reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracted it from his heart, resulting in the creation of Vanitas,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep|developer=Square Enix PDD 5|publisher=Square Enix, Disney Interactive Studios |date= September 7, 2010|platform=PlayStation Portable|quote='''Xehanort:''' Pure light against pure darkness, to forge the ultimate key.

Ventus is mentioned in the secret ending of ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded#Kingdom Hearts Re:coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'', when Mickey reveals he has learned where Ventus's heart is, having searched for Terra, Aqua, and him over the past ten years.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts Re:coded|developer=Square Enix, h.a.n.d.|publisher=Square Enix, Disney Interactive Studios |date=October 7, 2010 |platform=Nintendo DS|level=Reconnect: Kingdom Hearts}}</ref> In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', Sora briefly takes the form of Ventus during a dream, and when his heart is wounded, Ventus's armor appears to protect his body. In the ending of the game, Ventus is shown in Castle Oblivion, still in his catatonic state, smiling all of a sudden.

==Creation and development==
When first designing Ventus, Tetsuya Nomura already decided the character should look like Sora or Roxas, and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas's being revealed to have Sora's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers.<ref name="bbs"/> Despite similarities with Roxas, Nomura wanted Ventus's personality to more closely resemble Sora's, which led to his forward attitude, yet at the same time, he wanted him to be slightly more serious as the game continued in order to differentiate them.<ref name="scenario">{{cite journal| journal = [[Famitsu]]| publisher = [[Enterbrain]] and [[Tokuma Shoten]]|trans_title=Tetsuya Nomura Interview| title = <U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> <U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B9> <U+30D0><U+30A4> <U+30B9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30D7>| language = Japanese| date = August 27, 2009| pages =| author = Famitsu Staff| url =}}</ref> Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and its rerelease ''Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix''. Ventus's name first appeared as a code in a 2006 [[Tokyo Game Show]] promotional video of the games. In the making of the endings, Nomura had only drawn the settings of Terra, Aqua and him, but after finishing them, he had drawn their faces. Despite not revealing their identities, Nomura still said that they were characters from the past from the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series.<ref>{{cite book |title=<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>II <U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2> |trans_title=Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania |year=2005|isbn=978-4-7575-1621-2 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=}}</ref> Following their release, Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven, having been first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in ''Final Mix'', while his full name was still unrevealed.<ref name="ScenarioMysteries">{{cite book |title=<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>II FINAL MIX+ <U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2> |year=2007 |trans_title=Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ Ultimania|isbn=978-4-7575-2013-4|language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=}}</ref> He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kingdom Hearts Another Report (Included with the video game Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix) |date=March 2007|isbn=|language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |page=}}</ref> 

Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not the same character. Additionally, he stated that by playing ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus,<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Famitsu]]| publisher = [[Enterbrain]] and [[Tokuma Shoten]]| title = <U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> <U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B9> <U+30D0><U+30A4> <U+30B9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30D7>|trans_title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep| language = Japanese| year = 2007| month = September| pages =| author = Famitsu Staff| url =}}</ref> with one of the game's mission being exploring his true identity.<ref>{{cite web| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts| url = http://psp.ign.com/articles/824/824305p1.html| author = Gantayat, Anoop| date = October 2, 2007| publisher = [[IGN]]| accessdate = January 25, 2010}}</ref> In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection.<ref name="ScenarioMysteries"/><ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Famitsu]]| publisher = [[Enterbrain]] and [[Tokuma Shoten]]|trans_title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep| title = <U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> <U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B9> <U+30D0><U+30A4> <U+30B9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30D7>| language = Japanese| year = 2007| month = October| pages =| author = Famitsu Staff| url =}}</ref> The guidebook ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep [[Ultimania]]'' clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus's heart entered Sora's body and Roxas's birth allowed Ventus's heart to reside in Roxas.<ref name="bbspage">{{cite book |title=<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> <U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B9> <U+30D0><U+30A4> <U+30B9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30D7> <U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2>|trans_title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania|year=2010 |isbn=978-4-7575-2788-1 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=616<U+2013>623}}</ref> In early versions of development, Nomura thought that the heart healing Ventus's broken heart in the beginning would be Sora before being born, but due to overseas opinions, such portrayal was discarded.<ref name="bbs"/> Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced [[K<U+014D>ki Uchiyama]] in Japanese and [[Jesse McCartney]] in English.

Ventus's name means "wind" in Latin; both it and his {{nihongo|Wayward Wind|<U+30D5><U+30EC><U+30C3><U+30B7><U+30E5><U+30D6><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30BA>||lit. "Fresh Breeze"}} Keyblade have a "sky" theme similar to that of Sora's.<ref name="ScenarioMysteries"/> During development of ''Birth by Sleep'', the Osaka team in charge of making it thought that Ventus should be related with Vanitas, something which Nomura liked as he wanted to add more connections to the game. Therefore, the name Vanitas was also made to link it to Ventus's name, with both of them having similar meanings. Nomura had troubles designing Ventus's, Terra's and Aqua's armors due how they would be able to summon them. Therefore, an "X" was added to their clothes as a mean to activate the armors as well as due to the fact it was one of the game's keywords. Ever since development of ''Birth by Sleep'' started, the staff already decided that Ventus's, Aqua's and Terra's stories would be told in separate scenarios, with Ventus's story being the second one written. They also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series, leading to the interaction between the three scenarios.<ref name="bbs">{{cite book |title=<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4> <U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B9> <U+30D0><U+30A4> <U+30B9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30D7> <U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30DE><U+30CB><U+30A2>|trans_title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania|year=2010 |isbn=978-4-7575-2788-1 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=640<U+2013>649}}</ref> In gameplay perspective, Ventus was designed to be the easiest character to play with in ''Birth by Sleep'', although Nomura recommended to players that Ventus should be the second character to play with in order to understand the story better.<ref name="event">{{cite web| title = Tetsuya Nomura Talks Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep| url = http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2009/12/23/kh_bbs_nomura_interview/| author = Gantayat, Anoop| date = December 23, 2009| publisher = Andriasang| accessdate = September 9, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, the way Ventus handles his Keyblade backwards is meant to show the gameplay differences between his and Terra's and Aqua's scenarios.<ref name="scenario"/> Nomura also remarked Ventus's encounter with the characters [[Organization XIII#Axel|Lea]] and [[Organization XIII#Saix|Isa]] as an important event from the game, hoping both newcomers and older gamers will also find it important from Ventus's perspective.<ref name="event"/>

==Reception==
Due to his resemblance with Roxas, video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' when seeing one of Ventus's images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3163003|title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep preview|author=Parish, Jeremy|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=March 19, 2010|date=September 19, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/917/917954p1.html|title=TGS 2008: Square Enix Closed Mega Theater Exposed|author=Hatfield, Damien|publisher=IGN|accessdate=March 19, 2010|date=October 9, 2008}}</ref> However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications still discussed how similar they were and if there was a connection between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/rpg/kingdomheartsbirthbysleep/news.html?sid=6199110&mode=previews|title=TGS 2008: Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep Hands-On|author=VanOrd, Kevin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=March 19, 2010|date=October 10, 2008}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]] particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/kingdom-hearts-the-story-so-far/a-2009092210413205031/p-4|title=Kingdom Hearts: the story so far, page 4|last=Glasser|first=AJ|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> Amanda L.
