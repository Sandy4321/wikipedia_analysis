She is best known for her long-running role as [[Lisa Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Born in [[Paris, France]], her family moved [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1966. As a child, Smith was often mocked because of her unusual first name and her voice. She became a professional actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to [[New York City]] in 1984 where she appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]''. Her first film role came in 1985's ''[[Heaven Help Us (film)|Heaven Help Us]]'', followed by roles in ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]'' and ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]''.

In 1987, she auditioned for a role in a series of animated [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] about a [[Simpson family|dysfunctional family]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Smith intended to audition for the role of [[Bart Simpson]], but the casting director felt her voice was too high so she was given the role of Lisa instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half hour show called ''The Simpsons''. For her work as the character, Smith received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992.

Alongside ''The Simpsons'', Smith acted in the sitcom ''[[Herman's Head]]'' as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'', and Penny in two episodes of ''[[Dead Like Me]]''. She has appeared in several films, including ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Just Write]]'', ''[[Toys (1992 film)|Toys]]'' and ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''. In 2004 Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled ''More'' at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in [[New York City]]. Aside from ''The Simpsons'', Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]''. Smith starred in and served as [[executive producer]] for the independent relationship comedy ''Waiting For Ophelia'', which had its world premiere at the [[Phoenix Film Festival]] in April 2009.

Smith was married to actor Christopher Grove from 1990 to 1992 and Daniel Erickson from 2002 to 2008. She enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of ''Herman's Head'', Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists.

==Career==
===Early career===
Smith became a professional actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school.<ref name=local/><ref name=austele/> After appearances in a number of school plays she joined the local [[Arena Stage]] theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''. She went on to star in several other plays in Washington.<ref name=local/> She moved to [[New York City]] in 1984 and appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]'' alongside [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Glenn Close]].<ref name=love/><ref name="Town"/>

Her first film role came in 1985's ''[[Heaven Help Us (film)|Heaven Help Us]]''.<ref name=love/> She then played Putter in ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]''. The film was a [[box office bomb]] and critically panned although Smith "thought it would be the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died."<ref name=targum/> When filming was over, she rejoined ''The Real Thing'' before being out of work for six months and worried her career was over.<ref name=love/> However, the following year she played Connie in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', noting it was "truly a dreadful film but I had a great part in it."<ref name=love/> 

She moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1986 on the "semi-promise" of a part in a TV film.<ref name="Steps"/><ref name=love/> After the audition the role was given to another actress. Smith realized "that people don't mean what they say. It's not malicious. They just don't realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor&mdash;and all actors are impressionable." From then on, she decided to "just sort of build a wall around myself," to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part.<ref name=love/> In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of ''Living On Salvation Street'', (for which she was paid $14 for each performance)<ref name=austele/> ''Boys and Girls/Men and Women'' and ''How the Other Half Loves'', and played the recurring role of Luella Waters on the [[Showtime]] series ''[[Brothers (TV series)|Brothers]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brothers on Showtime|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/brothers/200260|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> She appeared in the films ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]'' and ''[[Ginger Ale Afternoon]]'' as "trailer-park girls."<ref name="Steps"/> She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one-woman show ''More''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/90684-The_Simpsons_Actress_Yeardley_Smith_Brings_Her_More_to_Los_Angeles|title="The Simpsons" Actress Yeardley Smith Brings Her More to Los Angeles|author=Hernandez, Ernio|work=[[Playbill]]|date=2005-01-19|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

Smith's longest-running role is voicing [[Lisa Simpson]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with the ''[[The Simpsons shorts]]'' on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart but casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'"<ref name=austele/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=2007-07-29|date=2008-10-26|author=Larry Carroll|publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> Smith was given the role of Lisa instead, although she almost turned it down.<ref name="Happy">{{cite news|title=She<U+2019>s happy as Lisa Simpson, although she<U+2019>d like more d<U+2019>oh |date=2004-04-04|accessdate=2008-10-26|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=Associated Press|author=Heidi Vogt}}</ref> Pietila stated, having seen her in ''Living on Salvation Street'',<ref name=austele/> Smith was always her preferred choice.<ref name=love/> In order to perform the voice, Smith lifts her voice up a little.<ref name=austele>{{cite news|title=She who laughs last|date=2007-12-08|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=8E|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Charles Miranda}}</ref> Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes she provided some of [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s squeaks and occasional speaking parts.<ref name=com>{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley|year=2007|title=Audio commentary for [[The Simpsons Movie]]| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in "[[Last Tap Dance in Springfield]]"  ([[The Simpsons (season 11)|season 11]], 2000) and Lisa, Jr. in "[[Missionary: Impossible]]".

Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices.<ref name=Glaister/> However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.<ref name=Glaister>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html|title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2004-04-03|author=Glaister, Dan|publisher=''The Age''}}</ref> The issue was resolved a month later,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml|title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2004-05-01|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> and Smith earned $250,000 per episode.<ref name="Sheridan"/> After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode.<ref>{{cite news | title = Simpsons cast sign new pay deal | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2008-06-03]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm | accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>

Despite the fame of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she doesn't mind, saying "it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice."<ref name="Sheridan">{{cite news|title=Meet the Simpsons|date=2004-05-06|accessdate=2008-10-26|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Express]]|author=Peter Sheridan}}</ref> In a 2009 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' she commented: "It's the best job ever.

Smith received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1992 but felt it wasn't worth anything, saying "there<U+2019>s part of me that feels it wasn<U+2019>t even a real Emmy." This is because the Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] is a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts]] award not voted on by the regular Emmy voters and not handed out during the primetime telecast.<ref name="Happy"/> However, Smith says "if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson."<ref name="Happy"/> The show's creator [[Matt Groening]] has called Smith very similar to Lisa: "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'"<ref name=love/> Writer [[Jay Kogen]] praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode "[[Lisa's Substitute]]", as able "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic."<ref name=love/>

===Further career===
From 1991-1994, alongside ''The Simpsons'', Smith acted in the sitcom ''[[Herman's Head]]'' as Louise.<ref name=local>{{cite news|title=Local actress finds a voice in 'Simpsons'|date=1994-11-20|accessdate=2008-10-26|work=[[The Washington Times]]|author=Paul Freeman}}</ref> Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marelene on ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'', and Penny in two episodes of ''[[Dead Like Me]]''.

Brooks]]' ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''.<ref name="Steps"/> Brooks, who is also executive producer of ''The Simpsons'', had cast Smith in his 1994 film ''[[I'll Do Anything]]'' (in one of the film's musical numbers) but her part was cut.<ref name=targum/> Aside from ''The Simpsons'', Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]''. She "had a voice over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [on auditions] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case."<ref name=love/>

In 2004 Smith performed her own off-broadway one-woman show entitled ''More'' at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in [[New York City]]. Directed by [[Judith Ivey]],<ref name="More"/> the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of ''The Simpsons'', her parents, her relationships and her struggles with [[bulimia]].<ref name="Steps">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D71731F934A25750C0A9629C8B63|title=Lisa Simpson's Voice Steps Out on Her Own |author=Gates, Anita|accessdate=2008-10-26|date=2004-03-17|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name="Happy"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Margo Jefferson called it an "appealing if overlong show", adding that "The career narrative needed shortening.

Smith starred in and served as [[executive producer]] for the independent relationship comedy ''Waiting For Ophelia'', which will be released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: "I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she "believe[d] in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: "You can support art even if it's not going to make a zillion dollars."<ref name=guard/> It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the [[Phoenix Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stars come out for Phoenix Film Festival|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/137338|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|accessdate=2009-04-21|author=Harter, Jess|date=2009-03-31}}</ref>
