==Plot==
The election race for President of Earth is in full swing, with two identical [[Human cloning|clones]] as candidates. Leela, appalled by the apathy of the Planet Express crew, exhorts them to register to vote. Meanwhile, a mining disaster sends the price of [[titanium]] through the roof, and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] seizes the opportunity to make a quick buck by [[Pawnbroker|pawning]] his 40% titanium body.

As a head with a pile of cash, Bender begins enjoying his new lifestyle. During a trip to the Hall of Presidents in the New New York Head Museum, [[Richard Nixon]]'s head ruins Bender's illusions about the glamour of a life without a body. The next day Bender heads off to the pawn shop to retrieve his body, but it has been sold. Later, Nixon's head announces its candidacy for President of Earth, using Bender's body to escape a constitutional provision that "no''body'' can be elected more than twice".

[[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], and Bender take off to [[Washington, D.C.]] to stop Nixon and recover Bender's body. Directly confronting Nixon fails to recover Bender's body, so the crew infiltrates Nixon's room at the [[Watergate Hotel]]. Leela successfully separates the sleeping head from the robot body, but Fry accidentally wakes Nixon. Confronting the intruders, Nixon begins ranting about his future plans for Earth. However, Bender records the conversation and knowing that the tape would ruin his election chances if released, Nixon trades the body for the tape.

On election day, Nixon wins by a single vote. He regained the robot vote by replacing Bender's body with a [[Super Robot|giant war robot]] while Leela and Fry forgot to vote against him. The episode ends with Nixon on a rampage through Washington D.C., escorted by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents into the White House.

==Continuity==
Nixon's head would continue to be president throughout the series and into the four direct-to-video feature films.  However, he does not use the supersuit he had at the end of the episode ever again.

This episode is the first to heavily feature the character of [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's head]]. Although Nixon is often remembered only as "Tricky Dick" the writers for this episode not only mocked his "ruthless drive" but also showed his resilience and relevance.<ref name="Nixon's shadow">{{cite book| title=Nixon's Shadow: The History Of An Image| author=Greenberg, David|page=346}}</ref> This episode also showcases the [[show-within-a-show]] ''The Scary Door'', a [[parody]] of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' featured in multiple episodes.
