'''Paul Eric Worrilow''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|w|<U+0254>r|l|o<U+028A>|}}; born May 1, 1990) is an [[American football]] [[linebacker]]  for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Delaware]] where he was recognized as an [[All-American]], and became one of the program's most decorated athletes.  The Falcons signed Worrilow as an [[undrafted free agent]] following the [[2013 NFL Draft]].

== Family and early years ==
Worrilow is the second youngest of four boys. His mother was born in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]] and his father was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. His oldest brother Edward, a marketing professional and accomplished pianist, also graduated from the University of Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.higherone.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3506:edward-worrilow&catid=20:management&Itemid=106 |title=Edward Worrilow |publisher=Higher One, Inc. |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref>  His older brother Mark played in the [[Aztec Bowl]] in 2009 and was captain of the Division III [[Ursinus Bears]] football team, where his younger brother James currently competes as a [[defensive lineman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ursinusathletics.com/sports/fball/2013-14/bios/worrilow_james_tcct |title=James Worrilow |publisher=Ursinus College |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}</ref> Worrilow trained throughout his childhood at the Stay Real Football Camp in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. Worrilow attended [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]] in Wilmington, Delaware where he led the Concord Raiders to the 2006 state Division II title and a berth in the state semifinals in 2005 and 2007.  Worrilow made the 2006 First Team All-State on both offense and defense, the 2007 second team All-State as Fullback and first team All-State, and was named Delaware's "2007 Defensive Player of the Year". Despite Worrilow's great success in high school, he was not offered a single scholarship to play NCAA Division I football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depreps.rivals.com/content.asp?cid=749726 |title=Official All-State football team |publisher=Depreps.rivals.com |date=December 10, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

== College career ==
Worrilow was not highly recruited after graduation and was only able to solidify offers from Division II schools.  Instead of taking any offers, Worrilow moved to [[Coffeyville, Kansas]], where he attended [[Coffeyville Community College]], a junior college known for funneling athletes into Division I football programs.  Worrilow was [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] his first year due to a defensive scheme change, and ultimately turned down interest from the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Northwest+Arkansas/articles/3168046/RECRUITING+GUY+Junior+college+linebacker+impressed |title=THE RECRUITING GUY : Junior college linebacker impressed with Arkansas - Northwest Arkansas |publisher=Zimbio |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> to return to Delaware in the spring of 2008 and walk on the Blue Hens football squad.

Worrilow immediately drew attention during his first spring at Delaware, earning a starting spot the following fall as a redshirt freshman along with a team scholarship as a walk-on.  Starting every game he played, Worrilow would eventually become team co-captain as a junior, and remain as captain through his senior year, racking up a University of Delaware fifth all-time high 377 career tackles<ref>[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130427/SPORTS07/304270043/Thought-NFL-doesn-t-faze-Paul-Worrilow ''The News Journal''] April 27, 2013 {{Dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> and earning a spot on both the Phil Steele<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philsteele.com/FCSINFO/Allconf_Allamerican/2012_PostSeason/2012_AllAmerican.html |title=2012 Postseason FCS All-American Team

Worrilow was signed as a [[free agent]] after the [[2013 NFL Draft]] by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] eventually making the final 53-man roster for the 2013 season.

On a November 3, 2013, loss against the Carolina Panthers, Worrilow recorded a career-high 19 tackles, tying his previous week's performance and a franchise record for most tackles in a game since 1994.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vaughn |last=McClure |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/98394/falcons-paul-worrilow-just-trying-to-grow |title=Falcons' Paul Worrilow just trying to grow |publisher=ESPN |date=November 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref>

Worrilow ended the 2013 NFL season as the Falcons' leading tackler, landing him a spot on [[Mel Kiper, Jr.|Mel Kiper]]'s All-Rookie Team alongside teammate and fellow rookie [[Desmond Trufant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.atlantafalcons.com/2014/01/03/worrilow-trufant-make-kipers-rookie-team/ |title=Worrilow, Trufant Make Kiper<U+2019>s All-Rookie Team |publisher=Atlanta Faclons |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

== Off the field ==
In the spring of 2011, Worillow discovered he had been matched to a 23 year-old female [[leukemia]] patient in need of a life-saving [[peripheral blood stem cell]] donation.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Cunningham|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution-Journal|title= Atlanta rookie Worrilow has Delaware in his heart|date=April 14, 2013|url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1373657}}</ref> Worrilow had two-years-prior signed up for the [[National Marrow Donor Program]], through which the chances of becoming a donor are 2/10ths of 1 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marrow.org/Join/FAQs_about_Joining.aspx#likely |title=FAQs about Joining the Registry |publisher=National Marrow Donor Program |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>  In the five days leading up to the procedure, Worrilow underwent a series of injections of a drug called [[filgrastim]] to increase the number of blood-forming cells in his bloodstream. On May 25, 2011, over the course of 6 hours, Worrilow's blood was then removed through a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that separates out the blood-forming cells, returning it back through a vein in his other arm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marrow.org/Registry_Members/Donation/Steps_of_Donation.aspx |title=Steps of Bone Marrow Donation or PBSC Donation |publisher=National Marrow Donor Program |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>  Worrilow has yet to meet the woman who received his donation.
