'''BAE Systems plc'''  is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[defence contractor|defence]], [[Information security|security]] and [[aerospace]] company headquartered in [[London]], United Kingdom and with operations worldwide. It is among the world's largest [[defence contractor]]s; it ranked as the third-largest based on applicable 2011 revenues.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://special.defensenews.com/top-100/charts/rank_2011.php |title=Defense News Top 100 for 2011 |publisher=Defense News |year=2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>  Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States, where its [[BAE Systems Inc.]] subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]]. Other major markets include Australia, India and Saudi Arabia. BAE was formed on 30 November 1999 by the [[British pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]7.7&nbsp;billion merger of two British companies; [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] (MES) <U+2013> the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the [[General Electric Company plc]] (GEC) <U+2013> and [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) <U+2013> an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer.

BAE Systems is the successor to various aircraft, shipbuilding, armoured vehicle, armaments and defence electronics companies, including [[Marconi Company|The Marconi Company]], the first commercial company devoted to the development and use of radio; [[Avro|A.V. Roe and Company]], one of the world's first aircraft companies; [[de Havilland]], manufacturer of the world's [[de Havilland Comet|first commercial jet airliner]]; [[British Aircraft Corporation]], co-manufacturer of the [[Concorde]] supersonic transport; [[Supermarine]], manufacturer of the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]; [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]], builders of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Havock class destroyer|first destroyers]]; and [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering]], builders of the Royal Navy's first [[Holland class submarine|submarines]]. Since its formation it has made a number of acquisitions, most notably of [[United Defense]] and [[Armor Holdings]] of the United States, and sold its shares in [[Airbus]], [[Astrium]], [[Alenia Marconi Systems|AMS]] and [[Atlas Elektronik]].

BAE Systems is involved in several major defence projects, including the [[F-35 Lightning II]], the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], the {{sclass|Astute|submarine}} and the {{sclass|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier}}s. The company has been the subject of criticism, in terms of general opposition to the arms trade and particularly specific allegations of unethical and corrupt practices. BAE Systems is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

==History==

===Heritage===
[[Image:Spitfire VII Langley USA.jpg|thumb|[[Supermarine]], manufacturer of the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] was a predecessor company of BAE Systems. It was purchased by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], which itself was merged into the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960.]]

BAE Systems was formed on 30 November 1999 by the <U+00A3>7.7&nbsp;billion merger of British Aerospace (BAe) and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES).<ref name="scotsman2000">{{Cite news |first=Andrew|last=Turpin |title= BAE Eyes US Targets After Profit Rockets |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |publisher=The Scotsman Publications|page=26 |date= 4 March 2000 |accessdate=7 September 2007}}</ref> As a result, BAE Systems is the successor to many of the most famous British aircraft, defence electronics and warship manufacturers. Predecessor companies built the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]], the world's first commercial jet airliner; the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]] "jump jet", the world's first operational [[V/STOL|Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing]] (VTOL) aircraft; the "groundbreaking"<ref>{{Cite news |first=James|last=Dow|title=Edinburgh's first line of defence |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=840772004 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040815131803/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=840772004 |archivedate=15 August 2004|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref> Blue Vixen radar carried by [[BAE Sea Harrier#Specifications (Sea Harrier FA2)|Sea Harrier FA2s]] and which formed the basis of the Eurofighter's [[Euroradar CAPTOR|CAPTOR]] radar; and co-produced the iconic [[Concorde]] supersonic airliner with [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]].

British Aerospace was a civil and [[military aircraft]] manufacturer, as well as a provider of military land systems. The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II. British Aerospace was formed on 29 April 1977 by the nationalisation and merger of The [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), the [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Group]] and [[Scottish Aviation]].<ref name="compcomm"/> Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions.<ref name="lineage">{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/storage/lineage/?t=lineage |title=The BAE Systems Lineage (click on Air tab) |accessdate=13 September 2007 |work=BAE Systems Heritage |publisher=BAE Systems plc}}</ref><!-- Citation based on "Air" section of this url, requires "Air" tab to be clicked, unfortunately no way of automating this in link -->

Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm The General Electric Company (GEC), dealing largely in military [[system integrator|systems integration]], as well as naval and land systems. Marconi's heritage dates back to [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company, founded in 1897.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/nonflash/timeline/1874_guglielmo_marconi/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080421093519/http://production.investis.com/heritage/nonflash/timeline/1874_guglielmo_marconi/ |archivedate=21 April 2008 |title=1874 Guglielmo Marconi |accessdate=13 September 2007 |work=BAE Systems Heritage |publisher=BAE Systems plc}}</ref> GEC purchased [[English Electric]] (which included Marconi) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses (as GEC-Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems). GEC's own defence heritage dates back to World War I, when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position, as the company was involved in important technological advances, notably the [[cavity magnetron]] for [[radar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Prideofownership/Economicfactors/Anewindustry/index.htm |title=A new industry |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=connected-earth.com|quote=during the Second World War it developed the cavity magnetron for radar |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070503152859/http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Prideofownership/Economicfactors/Anewindustry/index.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2007}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1999, GEC-Marconi/Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world's most important [[defence contractor]]s.

===Formation===
The 1997 merger of American corporations [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]], which followed the forming of [[Lockheed Martin]], the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence managing director [[John Weston (businessman)|John Weston]] commented "Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.".<ref>{{Cite news |first=Andrea|last=Rothman|coauthors=Landberg, Reed |title=Europe Defense Firms Feel Pressure to Unite|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970615&slug=2544541 |work=The Seattle Times|date=15 June 1997 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Business: The Company File: Defence merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=10 July 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2007}}</ref>

As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]] (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Adam |last=Jones|title=Europe cries foul as New BAe emerges |work=The Times |location=UK |date=20 January 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> The two companies envisaged including A<U+00E9>rospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|coauthors=Morrocco, John D. |title=French Government Grapples With Aerospace Strategy |work=Aviation Week and Space Technology |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=30 June 1997 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, A<U+00E9>rospatiale and [[Construcciones Aeron<U+00E1>uticas|Construcciones Aeron<U+00E1>uticas SA]] into an integrated company; in this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of A<U+00E9>rospatiale.<ref name="BAeDASArelations">{{Cite news |first=Bernard|last=Gray|coauthors=Skapinker, Michael|title=Giant waiting in the wings: Bernard Gray and Michael Skapinker ask if Europe's defence industry can consolidate in time to challenge US dominance|work=Financial Times|date=24 June 1997 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the [[Panavia Tornado]] and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that A<U+00E9>rospatiale was to merge with [[Matra]] and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding.<ref>{{Cite news |title=BAe and Dasa discuss proposals for merger: Aerospace groups still have 'important issues to resolve'|work=Financial Times |page=1 |date=24 July 1998 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman [[Richard Evans (businessman)|Richard Evans]] and DASA CEO [[J<U+00FC>rgen E.

-->
Meanwhile GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, ''The Independent'' had said "some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Russell|last=Hotten |title=GEC confirms Simpson job|work=The Independent |location=UK |publisher=Newspaper Pub |page=17|date=19 March 1996 |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref> When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival.

Retrieved 27 October 2006.</ref> Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.<ref name="ftBAeDASA"/> The merger created a [[vertically integrated]] company which ''The Scotsman'' described as "[a combination of British Aerospace's] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability",<ref>{{Cite news |first=Louise|last=Nevill|title=BAe and Marconi moving toward merger|work=The Scotsman |location=UK |publisher=The Scotsman Publications|page=17|date=4 January 1999 |accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Speculation Rises on GEC Merger |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |publisher=The Scotsman Publications |date=28 December 1998 |accessdate=17 September 2007}}</ref> In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]] to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ([[EADS]]), a [[horizontal integration]]. EADS has since considered a merger with [[Thales Group|Thales]] to create a "fully rounded" company.<ref name="integrated"/>

Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] which prevented a reference of the merger to the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]]. These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub-contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries. Another condition was the "[[Chinese wall|firewalling]]" of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF). In 2007 the government, on advice from the [[Office of Fair Trading]], announced it had agreed to release BAE from ten of the undertakings due to "a change in circumstances".<ref>{{Cite news |title= UK. Releases BAE SYSTEMS From Undertakings For Marconi Electronic Merger|work=Defense Daily International|date= 9 February 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2007}}</ref>

BAE inherited the "special" shareholding that was established when British Aerospace was privatised. This special share, with a nominal value of <U+00A3>1, is held on behalf of the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]. This shareholding prevents amendments of certain parts of the company's [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]] without the permission of the Secretary of State.<ref name="compcomm">{{cite web |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1991/fulltext/296c2.pdf |title=BAe and Thomson-CSF SA: A report on the proposed merger |accessdate=8 December 2005 |date= 6 February 1991 |publisher=[[Competition Commission]]|format=PDF}}</ref> These Articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than 15% of the company's shares or control the majority of the board and that the CEO and the Chairman of BAE Systems must be British nationals.

British Aerospace's head office was in Warwick House, Farnborough Aerospace Centre in [[Farnborough, Hampshire]]. BAE retains this but the [[registered office]], and base for the senior leadership team, is in the [[City of Westminster]].<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20010629231437/http://www.baesystems.com/facts/pages/page1.htm BAE Systems Facts BAE SYSTEMS]."

===Expansion and restructuring===
BAE Systems' first annual report identified Airbus, support services to militaries and integrated systems for air, land and naval applications as key areas of growth. It also stated the company's desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe. BAE described 2001 as an "important year" for its European joint ventures, which were reorganised considerably. BAE has described the rationale for expansion in the US; "[it] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined. Importantly, US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/investors/news/rp/rp2001/ar00/ar00.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071127160425/http://production.investis.com/investors/news/rp/rp2001/ar00/ar00.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|title=BAE Systems 2000 Annual Report |accessdate=5 October 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=BAE Systems |page=6}}</ref> When [[Dick Olver]] was appointed chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company's businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a "strategic bias" for expansion and investment in the US.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=Oil or missiles, the constant is power|work=Financial Times|date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=4 October 2007}}</ref> The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and, with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world.

In 2000 [[Matra Marconi Space]], a joint BAE/Matra company, was merged with the space division of DASA to form [[Astrium]]. On 16 June 2003 BAE sold its 25% share to EADS for <U+00A3>84&nbsp;million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company BAE invested an equal amount for "restructuring".<ref>{{Cite news |first= Mark |last= Odell |title= BAE agrees new deal for Astrium |work=Financial Times |page= 15 |date= 1 February 2003 |accessdate=23 January 2007}}</ref> In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=EADS and BAE SYSTEMS complete Airbus integration <U+2013> Airbus SAS formally established |publisher=BAE Systems plc|date=12 July 2001 |url=http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_120720011.html |accessdate=4 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071020052508/http://baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_120720011.html| archivedate= 20 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="awst formation">{{Cite news |first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|title=Climate Conducive For Airbus Consolidation |work=Aviation Week & Space Technology |date=19 March 2001 |accessdate=4 October 2007}}</ref> BAE sold its 54% majority share of [[BAE Systems Canada]], an electronics company, in April for $CAD310 (approx. <U+00A3>197&nbsp;million as of December 2010).<ref name="acquisitondisposal">{{cite web |url=http://bae-systems-investor-relations.production.investis.com/strategy-and-performance/acquisitions-and-disposals.aspx |title=Acquisitions and Disposals|publisher=BAE Systems plc |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> In November 2001, BAE announced the closure of the Avro Regional Jet ([[BAe 146|Avro RJ]]) production line at [[Woodford, Cheshire|Woodford]] and the cancellation of the Avro RJX, an advanced series of the aircraft family, as the business was "no longer viable".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=BAE SYSTEMS closes the RJX Programme |publisher=BAE Systems plc |date=27 November 2001 |url=http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_27112001.html |accessdate=4 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071020052514/http://baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_27112001.html| archivedate= 20 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The final Avro RJ to be completed became the last British civil airliner.

BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace's share of Airbus Industrie, which consisted of two factories at [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] and [[Filton]].

Since its creation BAE had a difficult relationship with the MOD. This was attributed to deficient project management by the company, but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of "fixed price contracts". BAE CEO [[Michael Turner (businessman)|Mike Turner]] said in 2006 "We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn't have taken".<ref>{{Cite news |first= Angela |last= Jameson |title= BAE Systems chief reaps reward for years of fighting for revival |url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article735302.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date= 27 February 2006 |accessdate=9 November 2006 }}</ref> These competition rules were introduced by [[Peter Levene, Baron Levene of Portsoken|Lord Levene]] during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to "cost plus contracts" where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit.<ref name="basic">{{cite web |url= http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP50.pdf |title= The UK Defence Industrial Strategy and Alternative Approaches |accessdate=9 November 2006 |author=Dr Steven Schofield |month= March |year= 2006 |format= PDF |work=Basic Papers: Occasional Papers on International Security Policy |page= 5 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061108211358/http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP50.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2006}}</ref>

The US defence market is competitive, however largely between American firms, while foreign companies are excluded. In December 2005 the MOD published the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE as the UK's "national champion".<ref name="econdis">{{Cite news |title= BAE Systems: Changing places |url= http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8091318 |work=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper |date= 26 October 2006 |accessdate=9 November 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061115211145/http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8091318| archivedate= 15 November 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The DIS identifies key industrial capabilities which must be maintained within the UK through long-term government commitments to support research spending and procurement. Of these capabilities, several are dominated by BAE, including naval vessels and submarines, combat vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, general munitions (with the exception of certain "niche capabilities abroad") and [[Network Enabled Capability]] (defined as C4ISTAR in the DIS).
