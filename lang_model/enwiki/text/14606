In [[English grammar]], the '''English subjunctive''' is the English manifestation of the [[subjunctive mood]], a [[verb]] [[grammatical mood|mood]] typically used in [[dependent clause]]s to express a wish, an emotion, a possibility, a judgement, an opinion, a necessity, or an action that is unlikely to occur or did not occur. It sometimes is referred to as the '''conjunctive mood,''' as it usually follows a subordinate [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]].

==Form==
===Modern form===

====Summary of forms====
The subjunctive in [[Modern English]] occurs in a variety of contexts in which the form of the verb used is different from that which it normally would be, given the implied time of the action. Regardless of the subject, the form of the present subjunctive verb used to express present or past desires and the like in ''that'' clauses is the bare form of the infinitive (not preceded by "to"). Hence, the present subjunctive of "to go" is "I go", "you go", "he/she/it go", "we go", "they go". For instance: "It was required that he '''go''' to the back of the line" (compared with the [[Realis mood|indicative]] "Everyone knows that he '''went''' to the back of the line"); "It is required that he '''go''' to the back of the line" (compared with the indicative "Everyone knows that he '''goes''' to the back of the line").

The English subjunctive also occurs in counterfactual dependent clauses, using a form of the verb that in the indicative would indicate a time of action prior to the one implied by the subjunctive. It is called the past subjunctive when referring counterfactually to the present, and is called the pluperfect subjunctive when referring counterfactually to the  past. It occurs in ''that'' clauses following the main-clause verb "wish" ("I wish that she '''were''' here now"; I wish that she '''had''' been here yesterday") and in ''if'' clauses expressing a condition that does not or did not hold ("If she were here right now, ..."; "If she '''had been''' here yesterday, ..."). 

A form of the subjunctive, called the future subjunctive, is used in ''if'' clauses of doubtful possibility with future reference; regardless of person and number, it uses the form "if I '''were to go'''".

====Table of forms====

The terms "present subjunctive" and "past subjunctive", such as appear in the following table, refer to the form and not to the time of action expressed. (Not shown in the table is the pluperfect subjunctive, which uses the ''had'' plus past participle construction when the counterfactual time of action is the past.)

As shown in the above table, the form of the subjunctive is distinguishable from the [[indicative]] in five circumstances:
# in the third person singular of any verb in the present form;
# in all instances of the verb "be" in the present form;
# in the first and third persons singular of the verb "be" in the past form;
# in all instances of all verbs in the future form; and
# in all instances of all verbs in the present negative form.

However, even when the subjunctive and indicative forms are identical, their time references are usually different.

The verb "be" is distinctive, having a larger number of forms than other verbs, because its forms in Modern English derive from three [[suppletion|different stems]] in Old English:  ''beon'' (be, being, been), ''wesan'' (was, is), and ''waeron'' (am, art, are, were).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Some [[English modal auxiliary verb|modal auxiliaries]] have a past subjunctive form. For example, the indicative ''will'' as in ''He will come tomorrow'' has the subjunctive form ''would'' as in ''I wish that he would come tomorrow''. Likewise, the indicative ''can'' as in ''He can do it now'' has the subjunctive form ''could'' as in ''I wish that he could do it now''. And the indicative ''shall'' as in ''I shall go there'' has the subjunctive form ''should'' as in ''If I should go there,...."

In [[Early Modern English]], the past subjunctive was distinguishable from the past indicative not only in the verb ''to be'' (as in Modern English), but also in the informal second-person singular of all verbs. For example: indicative ''thou sattest'', but subjunctive ''thou sat''.

Nevertheless, in some texts in which the pronoun [[thou]] is used, a final ''-est'' or ''-st'' sometimes is added;{{clarification needed|for which mood?|date=June 2011}} for example, ''thou beest'' appears frequently in the work of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and some of his contemporaries.

====Present subjunctive====

The term ''present subjunctive'' can be misunderstood, as it describes a ''form'' rather than a ''meaning''. The present subjunctive is so named because it resembles the present indicative in form, but the difference between them is a difference in [[Linguistic modality|modality]], not in temporality. For example, in ''I asked that it '''be done''' yesterday'', ''be done'' (a present subjunctive) has no present-tense sense, but instead refers to the past. 

The present subjunctive is used in ''that'' clauses expressing desire, demand, and related emotions, as in ''I insist that he '''be''' here'' or ''I prefer that she '''go''' to work now''. It also appears in ''lest'' clauses, as in ''I am running faster lest she '''catch''' me'', in which ''lest'' means "so that the event in the dependent clause won't happen", and in ''I worried lest she '''catch''' me'', in which ''lest'' indicates an adverse event that might happen.

While the above examples had both the main-clause event and the subordinate clause event in the present/future, the present subjunctive can also be used when both events are in the past. For example, in ''I insisted that he '''be''' here'', both the demand and the demanded event are placed in the past, and in ''I was running faster lest she '''catch''' me'', both the main-clause event and the event to be avoided are placed in the past. Thus the time frame of both events is dictated by the tense of the main-clause verb.

====Past subjunctive====

Like the term ''present subjunctive'', ''past subjunctive'' can be misunderstood, as it describes a ''form'' rather than a ''meaning''. The past subjunctive is so named because it resembles the past indicative in form, but the difference between them is a difference in [[Linguistic modality|modality]], not in temporality. For example, in ''If that '''were''' true, I would know it'', the word ''were'' (a past subjunctive) has no past-tense sense and instead describes a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] condition in the present.

In addition to appearing in counterfactual ''if'' clauses (''If I were there, he would know it''), the past subjunctive form also appears in ''that'' clauses expressing a wish that is unlikely to be fulfilled. Usually the main-clause verb in this circumstance is ''wish'', as in ''I '''wish''' that he '''were''' here'' now; but occasionally some other expression implying an unlikely wish is seen, as in ''It '''is high time''' (that) he '''bought''' a new car'' or ''I '''would rather''' that he '''did''' that''. (The latter example can also be recast in the present subjunctive, expressing doubt but not as much doubt as the past subjunctive: ''I '''would rather''' that he '''do''' that'').

In contrast, hoped-for things that may possibly occur take the indicative. In this circumstance, often the main clause verb is ''hope'', as in ''I '''hope''' that he '''comes''' now''. Likewise, in ''It '''is high time''' (that) he '''buys''' a new car'', there is a real possibility that he will indeed do so. 

=====Distinguishing past subjunctive with present meaning from past indicative with past meaning=====

In subordinate "if" clauses, the past subjunctive with present meaning can be distinguished from the past indicative with past meaning based on whether the verb in the main clause takes the conditional ''would'' form or not, and based on whether the tense forms (past or present form) in the two clauses are the same or different. For example:

*''If you '''were''' in class, you '''learned''' it.'' (non-conditional main verb with same tense form (past); ''past indicative'' verb in dependent clause expressing a possibility about the past)
*''If you '''were''' in class, you '''would be learning''' it.'' (conditional main verb with different tense form (present); ''past subjunctive'' verb in subordinate clause expressing present counterfactuality)

====Pluperfect subjunctive==== <!-- Please preserve this header. The link is being used in other articles.  -->
Since the "past subjunctive" is not a true past tense (it does not express past time of occurrence), it uses as its past tense what is structurally its [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] form. This past tense is known as the ''past perfect subjunctive'' or ''pluperfect subjunctive''; it is formed using ''had'' (the past subjunctive of ''to have'') plus the verb's past [[participle]].

The pluperfect subjunctive is used like the past subjunctive, except that it expresses a past-tense sense. For example:
*'''''Had I known''' (yesterday), I would have done something about it.'' (Or: '''''If I had known''' (yesterday), I would have done something about it.'')
*'''''Had''' I '''seen''' you, I definitely would have said hello.'' (Or: ''If I '''had seen''' you, I definitely would have said hello.'')
*''I would not be here '''had he not helped''' me.'' (Or: ''I would not be here if he '''had  not helped''' me.'')

When used in such [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] sentences with "if", this form often is called the "[[Conditional sentence|past conditional]]" or "conditional 3" in modern textbooks, though some grammarians reserve these terms for the form with "would" in the independent clause of the sentence. The main clause coinciding with a counterfactual ''if'' clause takes the [[conditional perfect]] ''would have'' + past participle form for its verb if the resultant action or state occurred in the speaker's past (as in the first two examples above), but uses the present form of the [[Conditional mood|conditional]], ''would'' + bare form of infinitive, if the resultant action or state is in the present (as in the third example above).

If a main clause is in the past tense, then a clause subordinate to it cannot be in the past subjunctive; instead, the subjunctive form must be the pluperfect subjunctive. However, if the main clause is in the present tense, then a clause subordinate to it might be in either of the two, depending on the meaning: for example, insistence or necessity uses the present subjunctive form as in "I insist that he go now", while a counterfactual wish takes the past subjunctive form, as in "I wish that he were leaving now."

The pluperfect subjunctive often is replaced with the past subjunctive, the past indicative, or the conditional perfect in colloquial speech, a substitution that commonly is considered incorrect. (See ''[[prescription and description]]''.)

In situations in which the present is influenced by the past, the ''present perfect subjunctive''&nbsp;<U+2014> ''that he have done''&nbsp;<U+2014> often is used in descriptions of requirements. For example, the following sentence declares two years of Spanish to be an important requirement for continuation:
*''It is important that he '''have completed''' two years of Spanish before graduation.''

Note the contrast between the previous sentence with a subjunctive usage connoting necessity with the following sentence, which expresses a fact rather than a desire and thus uses the present perfect indicative:
*''It is important that he '''has completed''' two years of Spanish before graduation.''

====Future subjunctive====
The future subjunctive is constructed using the past subjunctive form of the verb "to be" plus the [[to-infinitive]] of the dependent clause verb whose action is doubtful, or by using the [[English modal auxiliary verb|modal auxiliary verb]] "should" followed by the [[bare infinitive]]. Note that the "were" clauses are followed by the [[Conditional mood|present conditional]] ("would"), while the "should" clauses are followed by the [[Future tense|future indicative]] ("will"), because the "were" clauses express more doubt. For example:
:* '''''Were I to die''' tomorrow, then you would inherit everything.''
:* '''''If you were to give''' the money to me, then I would say no more about it.''
:* '''''If I should go''', then will you feed the hens? [or If I/he '''go'''...]'' 
:* '''''If he should fall''', who will carry the flag in his place? [or If he '''fall'''...]''

The "should" form is seldom used in American English; instead the indicative form ''If I go,...'' is usually used.

In contrast to the ''were to go'' subjunctive form for future reference, English has an ''am / is / are to go'' form for the indicative scheduled future. For example, ''I am to go there tomorrow'' indicates something that is scheduled, and therefore very probable, whereas ''If I were to go there tomorrow, I would ..." indicates that there is substantial doubt about whether I will go.

====Construction by inversion====
Where the subjunctive is used after "if" in a counterfactual condition (see below), the same effect can be achieved by omitting the "if" and inverting the verb and subject positions.
:* '''''If I were''' the President now,... / '''Were I''' the President now,...''
:* '''''If he had''' known it then,... / '''Had he''' known it then,...''
:* '''''If that be''' the case now,... / '''Be that''' the case now,...''
:* '''''If I were to arrive''' on time tomorrow,... / '''Were I to arrive''' on time tomorrow,...''
:*'''''If I should arrive''' on time tomorrow,... / '''Should I arrive''' on time tomorrow,...''
<!--:* '''''Come tomorrow''', I will not be on that plane. ''-->

===History===

{{Historical overview of English Subjunctive (table)}}

==Usage==
===To express a command, request, or suggestion===
[[Content clause]]s expressing commands, requests, or suggestions commonly use the present subjunctive in US English, but this usage is now rare in speech and rare in writing in UK English. Such clauses may be introduced by a verb like ''propose'', ''suggest'', ''recommend'', ''move'' (in the parliamentary sense), ''demand'', or ''mandate'', by an adjective like ''imperative'', ''important'', ''adamant'', or ''necessary'', or by a noun like ''insistence'' or ''proposal''.

This use of the subjunctive is known as the '''mandative subjunctive''' or the '''jussive subjunctive''' and is said to be the commonest use of the subjunctive in English.<ref>Quirk, Randolph; Greenbaum, Sidney; Leech, Geoffrey; Svartik, Jan (1985). "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language". Longman. ISBN 0-582-51734-6</ref> 

Note that the present subjunctive is used in these cases regardless of the actual time reference (which must be conveyed by the tense of the main verb):
*''I '''move(d)''' that the bill '''be put''' to a vote.''
*''I '''ask(ed)''' that he '''be shown''' mercy.''
*''It is (''or'' was) '''necessary''' that we '''not forget''' our instructions.'' / ''It is (''or'' was) '''necessary''' lest we '''forget''' our instructions.''
*''Her '''insistence''' that he '''leave''' seems (''or'' seemed) rude.''

Some of these words have two senses in different contexts: one that introduces a clause in the indicative, and one that introduces a clause in the subjunctive. For example, ''insist'' can mean ''assert forcefully and persistently as a statement of fact'', in which case it introduces the indicative (''He insisted that he '''was''' not guilty of the charges''; ''I insist that he '''is''' there''), or it can mean ''demand forcefully and persistently'', in which case it introduces the subjunctive (''He insisted that he '''be found''' not guilty of the charges''; ''I insist that he '''be''' there''). This use of the subjunctive is standard in North American English: in formal British English some publications retain it, while others replace it with the indicative.{{dubious|reason=see talk page|date=February 2012}}{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The verb in such constructions sometimes is believed mistakenly to be a sort of infinitive, contributing to the notion of the dying subjunctive.

====Main-clause preference words governing the subordinate-clause subjunctive====

The following main-clause ''verbs'', when expressing a desire specified in a subordinate "that" clause, often lead to the subordinate-clause verb taking the subjunctive mood: ''prefer, propose, request, ask, desire, advise, suggest, recommend, urge, specify, instruct, order, demand, insist, require, mandate, rule, necessitate, suffice, advocate, vote, move, would rather''.

*For example: ''I '''prefer''' that he '''leave'''''.

The following main-clause ''nouns'', when expressing a desire specified in a subordinate "that" clause, often lead to the subordinate-clause verb taking the subjunctive mood: ''preference, proposal, request, desire, advice, suggestion, option, alternative, recommendation, demand, requirement, necessity, imperative, condition, mandate, specification, rule, ruling, edict, instruction, principle, prerequisite, order, qualification, ultimatum, vote, motion''.

*For example: ''It is my '''preference''' that he '''leave.''''' / ''My '''preference''' is that he '''leave.'''''

The following main-clause ''adjectives'', when following a stative verb such as "to be" or "to appear", and when expressing a desire specified in a subordinate "that" clause, often lead to the subordinate-clause verb taking the subjunctive mood: ''preferable, optional, permissible, acceptable, okay, all right, satisfactory, desirable, advisable, sufficient, necessary, imperative, mandatory, important, urgent, vital, crucial, essential, fitting, right, appropriate, better, expedient, legitimate''.

*For example: ''It is '''preferable''' that he '''leave'''''.

====Third person requests with a main-clause subjunctive====

Sometimes the verb of a main clause can be in the subjunctive mood, without any explicit word like the above; this carries the force of a third-person request. This is the usage found in many set expressions, such as ''God bless you''.
:* ''America, America, God '''shed''' His grace on thee, and '''crown''' thy good with brotherhood'' ("[[America the Beautiful]]")
:* ''God '''save''' our gracious Queen''

The traditional English text of the [[Aaronic blessing]] is cast entirely in the subjunctive, with jussive force:
:''The Lord '''bless''' thee and '''keep''' thee. The Lord '''make''' His face to shine upon thee. The Lord '''lift up''' His countenance upon thee and '''give''' thee peace.''

While such constructions are sometimes viewed as third-person imperatives rather than subjunctives, they are similar to subjunctive "may" constructions such as ''May God bless you'', ''May God shed His grace on thee'', and ''May God save the Queen''.

===To express a wish===
The subjunctive is known as the "volitional" subjunctive when it is used to express a wish. A wish for a past or present event is contrary to fact, while a wish for the future either is impossible or has a very low probability.

The past subjunctive is used after the verb ''to wish'' to express that the wished-for event would occur at the same time as the wish: ''I wish (now) that he '''were''' here (now)''; ''I wished (in the past) that he '''were''' here (at that time in the past).'' With this use of the past subjunctive, the time of the wished-for action is conveyed by the tense of the main-clause verb. The subjunctive form of the modal ''can'' is ''could'', as in ''I wish (now) that I '''could''' swim (now)'' (= ''I wish (now) that I '''were able to''' swim (now)'') and ''I wished (in the past) that I '''could''' swim (in the past)'' (=''I wished (in the past) that I '''were able to''' swim (in the past)'').

To express a wish for something to have occurred prior to the time that the wish is made,  the past subjunctive is used: ''I wish (now) that he '''had been''' here (at a time in the past)''; ''I wished (at a time in the past) that he '''had been''' here (prior to that time in the past).''

To express a  present or past wish for a later occurrence, one uses the subjunctive form ''would'' of the future modal ''will'': ''I wish (now) that he '''would come''' here (in the future)''; ''I wished (in the past) that he '''would come''' here (at a time after the wish was made, either before or after the present)''.

The main-clause verb ''wish'' expresses a counterfactual <U+2014> something that is not actually the case <U+2014> while by comparison the main-clause verb ''hope'' expresses something that has a possibility of being true. Therefore, while ''wish'' governs the use of the subjunctive in the subordinate clause, ''hope'' governs the use of the indicative. For example:

*''I '''wish''' that he '''were''' there (right now).'' (But he is not.)
*''I '''hope''' that he '''is''' there (right now).'' (Maybe he is.)

===To express a counterfactual hypothesis===
The past subjunctive is used after the conjunction ''if'', and after the conjunction "that" when the main-clause verb is "suppose",  in a present-time contrary-to-fact and contrary-to-possibility [[protasis (linguistics)|protasis]]. For example:
:* ''If I '''were''' a millionaire, I would buy a sports car.''
:* ''If he '''had''' a car with him, he could drive us there.''
:* [[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|''If I '''were''' a rich man...'']]
:* ''Suppose that I '''were''' there now.''

In the same vein, the past subjunctive is used following the conjunctions ''as if'' and ''as though'' to express a contrary-to-fact situation that reality is supposed to resemble:
:* ''She looks '''as though she were going''' to kill him.''
:* ''He is trying to explain it&nbsp;<U+2014> '''as if he knew''' anything about the subject!''

The pluperfect subjunctive is used after the conjunction ''if'', and after the conjunction "that" when the main-clause verb is "suppose", in a past-time contrary-to-fact and contrary-to-possibility protasis. For example:

:* ''If I '''had been''' a millionaire, I would have bought a sports car.''
:* ''If he '''had had''' a car with him, he could have driven us there.''
:* ''Suppose that I '''had been''' there last week.''

===To express a purpose===
The conjunction ''lest'', indicating a negative purpose, generally introduces a subjunctive clause:
:* ''I eat '''lest I die'''.''
:* ''I shall place the book back on the shelf, '''lest it be''' lost.''

The conjunction ''in order that'', indicating a positive purpose, also sometimes introduces a subjunctive clause, though it more commonly introduces a clause using the auxiliary verb ''may'' (or in the subjunctive, ''might''):
:* ''I am putting your dinner in the oven '''in order that it (may) keep''' warm.''
:* ''He wrote it in his diary '''in order that he (might) remember'''.''

===To express a doubt or supposition===

The future subjunctive is used to express hypothetical future situations that are possible but doubtful :
:* ''I am torn; if I '''were to go''' with choice ''A'', I would be better off in the short term, but if I '''were to go''' with choice ''B'', I might be better off in the long term.''
:* ''Suppose that I '''were to go''' there.''

The present subjunctive sometimes is used after other conjunctions to express doubt or supposition, although nowadays the indicative oftener replaces this usage.
:* ''I will not let thee go, except [=unless] thou '''bless''' me.'' (Genesis 32:26)
:* ''Murder, though it '''have''' no tongue, will speak.''
:* ''Whoever he '''be''', he shall not go unpunished.''
:* ''Fee, fie, fo, fum / I smell the blood of an Englishman; / '''Be''' he alive or '''be''' he dead, / I'll grind his bones to make my bread.'' ([[Jack and the Beanstalk]])
:* ''If I '''be''' found guilty, I shall be given the maximum punishment.
:* ''I shall not do it unless [or until] I '''be''' told to do it.
:* ''Whether he '''vote''' for this or not (If he '''vote''' for it or if he not '''vote''' for it), we must proceed with the plan.
:* ''(No matter) whether they '''be''' tall or short, they must be treated the same.''
:* ''I want you to give this money to him so that he '''have''' enough for lunch. (the conjunction "''so that''" takes a subjunctive in formal English)

Rarely, the past subjunctive is used after other conjunctions to express doubt or supposition:

:* ''But [=although] he '''were''' dead, yet shall he live.'' (New Testament)

===Set phrases===
The subjunctive is used in a number of [[set phrase|fixed phrases]], relics from an older form of the language where it was much more common. Some could be alternatively analyzed as the [[imperative mood]], but those have related forms involving the insertion of "may" (e.g., "May God bless you") that are clearly subjunctive. Common examples are:
:* ''if need be''
:* ''as it were''
:* ''if I were you; were I you''
:* ''be that as it may''
:* ''(God) bless you!''
:* ''come Monday (Tuesday, etc.)''
:* ''come what may''
:* ''far be it from'' (or ''for'') ''me''
:* ''until death do us part''
:* ''[[God Save the Queen|God save our gracious Queen]]'', ''[[God Bless America|God bless America]]'', ''[[O Canada|God keep our land glorious and free]]'', ''[[God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen|God rest ye merry gentlemen]]'', etc.
:* ''Heaven forbid''
:* ''so be it''
:* ''suffice it to say''
:* ''woe betide''
:* ''peace be with you''
:* ''long live the king''
:* ''the powers that be'' 
:* ''albeit'' (a synthesis of ''all be it'', i.e. ''although it be'')
:* ''truth be told''
:* ''would that it were''
:* ''be it ever so humble, there's no place like home'' (proverb)

However, many fossil phrases seemingly employing the subjunctive often are re-analysed as imperative forms rather than as the subjunctive.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Hyperusage==
The subjunctive sometimes has been used simply as a conditioned variant that follows "if" and similar words even in the absence of a hypothetical situation.

:* ''Johnny asked me if I were afraid.'' (Barbara in ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968))

In the [[hypercorrection]] example quoted, "if" is a substitute for the unambiguous word "whether" (as in "Johnny asked me whether I was afraid"); in this case, "if" lacks the usual "in the event that" meaning that it has in other usages (as in "If we go to bed now, we shall be up at three o'clock"). In fact, such usage is quite old; for example:

:* ''... he asked me if I were about to return to London ...'' ([[Mary Shelley]] ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1833))
:* ''He asked me if I were a Priest.'' (''The Wesleyan-Methodist Magazine'' Vol. 3, Dec. (1824))

==Reduction in the usage of the subjunctive==
In some dialects of English, the ''were'' subjunctive has taken the form ''was'' in the first and third persons singular, where ''was'' is used by the past tense of the indicative, although some consider this replacement erroneous in formal speech and writing. The similarity of the counterfactual subjunctive ''were'' for present reference and the indicative form ''was / were'' (depending on person/number) for past reference has led to the former being replaced in some cases by the form of the latter, as in these examples:

:* ''If I was President...''
:* ''If he was a ghost... ''
:* ''If I was a rich girl...''

While these examples employ the present-reference subjunctive inflection ''am / is'' <U+2192> ''was'', they do not employ the further subjunctive inflection ''was'' <U+2192> ''were''.

However, in the context of the examples above, inversion cannot occur with the indicative as it would with the subjunctive; the following are ungrammatical, except insofar as they could be misinterpreted as questions:

:* ''Was I the President...''
:* ''Was he a ghost...''

This reduction of usage is not uniform; compare

:* ''[[If I Was]],'' a song written by [[Midge Ure]] and Danny Mitchell
:* ''[[And If I Was To Die In The Morning<U+2026> Would I Still Be Sleeping With You]],'' an [[Extended play|EP]] from the Canadian ''[[Your Favorite Enemies]]''
:* ''[[If I Was Your Man]],'' a song from [[Joe (singer)|Joe]]
:* ''[[If I Was a River]],'' a song written by [[Diane Warren]]
:* ''[[If I Was You (OMG)]],'' a song by [[Far East Movement]]
:* ''[[If I Was Your Girlfriend]],'' a song by [[Prince]]
:* ''I wish I was in the land of cotton'', opening line of song [[Dixie (song)#Lyrics|''Dixie'']]

with

:* ''[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]],'' a song written by [[Tim Hardin]]
:* ''[[If I Were a Boy]],'' a song written by [[Toby Gad]] and [[BC Jean]] and recorded by singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] in 2008.
:* ''[[If I Were Your Woman (song)]],'' a song recorded [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]]
:* ''[[If I Were You (Hoobastank song)|If I Were You]],'' a song by [[Hoobastank]]
:* ''[[If I Were You (Terri Clark song)|If I were You]],'' a song written and recorded by [[Terri Clark]]
:* ''[[If I Were Your Girl]],'' a song from [[Paula Abdul]]

The present-reference subjunctive inflection ''was'' <U+2192> ''were'' is not uniformly used in all varieties of spoken English. However, it still occurs in spoken [[North American English]] and in many dialects of [[British English]]. Some dialects replace it with ''was'' or with a modal verb, except perhaps in the most formal literary discourse. According to the Random House College Dictionary, "Although the [''were''] subjunctive seems to be disappearing from the speech of many, its proper use is still a mark of the educated speaker."<ref>{{cite book

In addition, the pluperfect subjunctive form in ''if I had gone'', indicating a counterfactual placed in the past, is often replaced in informal speech by the indicative past form in ''if I went;'' the counterfactual meaning is still clear because the main clause will contain the conditional modal verb phrase ''would have'' (''If I '''went''', I '''would have seen''' him''), while ''would have'' would not appear if the meaning were possibility rather than counterfactuality (''If I went, I saw him''). Another alternative form to the pluperfect subjunctive that is encountered in informal speech uses ''would have'' in both the counterfactual dependent clause and the resultive clause, as in ''If I '''would have gone''', I '''would have seen''' him''.
