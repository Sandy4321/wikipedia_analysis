The '''''Chicagoan''''' and '''''Kansas Cityan''''' were a pair of American named [[passenger trains]] operated by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. They ran from [[Chicago, Illinois]] to [[Wichita, Kansas]], with a later extension to [[Oklahoma City]].

On April 17, 1938, the Santa Fe introduced a pair of day trains using lightweight, streamlined cars from the [[Budd Company]]. These two, seven-car, lightweight, streamlined trains operated the {{convert|663|mi|km|adj=on}} route in 12 3/4 hours between end points. Shortly after entering service the train's western terminal would be moved to Oklahoma City, extending running times by three hours. 

The inaugural runs of the two lightweight streamliners were operated with [[Electro-Motive Corporation]] [[EMC E1|E1A]] units numbered 8 and 9, but within a month the Santa Fe assigned 1 and 10 the numbers of the old Santa Fe Box Cab Diesel Passenger units 1A and 1B. After being rebuilt in the Santa Fe's [[Topeka]] Shops with an elevated cab at one end only and a new nose added at that same end, they really resembled two E1A units that had been involved in a head on collision, and the shops repainted the results in the Santa Fe [[Warbonnet (paint scheme)|"war bonnet" paint scheme]]. These became the regular power for the trains.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
