It was released on July 26, 2005 as an [[arcade game]] and is the first game in ''[[The Idolmaster]]'' series. It was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Xbox 360]] on January 25, 2007 with many changes and improvements. The [[gameplay]] and story follows the career of a producer in charge of training prospective pop [[Japanese idol|idols]] on their way to stardom. This includes arranging the idol's schedule, taking them to jobs, training them during lessons, and directing them through auditions. As gameplay continues, a relationship will develop between the idol and her producer fostered through talking with the idol and forming good memories.

Development for the game began in 2002 to make an arcade game that would make players want to come back to play every day. To effectively use the competitive culture that surrounds video arcades, the game was developed so players would raise and compete against other players' idols on a national network. A port of the game had been discussed as early as two months before the arcade game was even released. The Xbox 360 was chosen because the development team felt its hardware and the [[Xbox Live]] network could handle the game's specifications. The original game features 10 songs the idols perform, which is increased to 16 in the Xbox 360 version, later released on several music albums.

==Gameplay==
''The Idolmaster'' is a [[Life simulation game|raising simulation game]] in which the player assumes the role of a producer working for the talent agency 765 Production (765 Pro) who is in charge of training 10 prospective pop [[Japanese idol|idols]] on their way to stardom. They include: [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Haruka Amami|Haruka Amami]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Chihaya Kisaragi|Chihaya Kisaragi]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Yukiho Hagiwara|Yukiho Hagiwara]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Yayoi Takatsuki|Yayoi Takatsuki]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Ritsuko Akizuki|Ritsuko Akizuki]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Azusa Miura|Azusa Miura]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Iori Minase|Iori Minase]], [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Makoto Kikuchi|Makoto Kikuchi]], and [[List of The Idolmaster characters#Ami and Mami Futami|Ami and Mami Futami]] (who work as a pair).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/idol/intro.htm|title=Idol Data|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> The player starts by choosing an idol to train and the idol's unit name. The player is initially able to train a single idol, but this can increase to up to three idols at a time once the player gains enough experience as a producer. The game depicts the activities of the producer and idol during one day of each in-game week.

At the start of every in-game day, text progression pauses when the player is given the option to greet the idol or take a break, which ends that in-game week. There are multiple responses to choose from, and the player is given a limited amount of time to make a choice; if no choice is made before time runs out, the choice with the worst possible outcome is automatically chosen. Depending on which choice is made will effect an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by the color of a heart on the [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]]. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from black, to teal, yellow-green, violet and finally red as enthusiasm increases. The player can view the state of an idol's [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] at this time, which are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]] will also increase. The player is shown an idol report which shows an idol's rank and level, and contains current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image, which gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity. The player can next choose to change the idol's song, her costume and accessories, or neither. Each idol unit can only perform at most three different songs, but these songs can be switched any number of times. The idol's daily schedule is divided into two choices: taking a lesson, which is followed by a communication phase, and taking an audition.<ref name="day0">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day0.htm|title=<U+30D7><U+30ED><U+30C7><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30B5><U+30FC><U+306E>1<U+65E5>|trans_title=A Producer's Day|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name="day1">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day1.htm|title=<U+671D>...1<U+65E5><U+306E><U+59CB><U+307E><U+308A>...|trans_title=Morning...the Start of a Single Day|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=July 20, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref>[[File:The Idolmaster arcade screenshot.jpg|thumb|230px|left|An example of Ami, Iori and Yukiho (respectively) taking a voice lesson. The player must tap the button that corresponds to the right note as the indicator passes from left to right over the notes.]]

The lessons are in the form of five [[minigame]]s which serve to increase an idol's statistics in either vocal, dance or visual image. Each lesson is divided into six parts, and the lesson's overall performance is ranked from bad, to normal, good and finally perfect.<ref name="day2">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day2.htm|title=<U+30EC><U+30C3><U+30B9><U+30F3>|trans_title=Lessons|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> Sometimes a lessons is temporarily unavailable. The communication phase of the gameplay mainly deals with the player talking with the idol and doing jobs to further her exposure to the public. The player is given multiple jobs to choose from, which change as an idol's rank increases. Like when greeting the idol before, the player is given multiple responses to choose from over the course of a conversation. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received from bad, to normal, good and finally perfect communication, which results in either good or bad memories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day3.htm|title=<U+30B3><U+30DF><U+30E5><U+30CB><U+30B1><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3>|trans_title=Communication|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> The good memories are tallied in the heart on the heads-up display.

When the player chooses to do an audition, the idol will use the previously chosen song and costume if she passes the audition; the song is also used during the audition. Each costume and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute which will effect the results of the audition. There are three types of auditions: ones limited to idols with an E or F rank, national auditions for idols of any rank, and special auditions that can be taken after satisfying certain conditions. Once an audition is chosen, the player can view the rank and level of the other idols who are auditioning. While the game's network was still active up to 2010, the game would match up to five other players from around the country who were auditioning at the same time; if enough players could not be found, [[non-player character]]s would fill the necessary spots. When taking an audition, the player guides the idol to appeal to three judges in vocal, dance and visual image by receiving points in each category.<ref name="day4">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day4.htm|title=<U+30AA><U+30FC><U+30C7><U+30A3><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3>|trans_title=Audition|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> How many points an idol receives when appealing is dependent on her statistics. Each audition is divided into three segments of nine attempts at an appeal followed by a mid-audition review. At the end of each segment, the three idols with the most points in a given image category will receive a number of stars in that category dependent on the current popularity trends from the idol report; an idol will also lose a star if she has the least points in a given category.

The interest level of the judges is indicated by three gauges which increase and decrease depending on how well or poorly an appeal is received. The appeals are also effected by how well the player stays in rhythm with the chosen song. If one judge is appealed to too many times, their interest level may drop to zero, at which point all the stars earned for that category will be revoked. The player also has the option to use up to three good memories during each audition which serve to dramatically increase an idol's appeal points and the gauges for the judges.<ref name="day4"/> At the end of the audition, the number of stars received determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen.<ref name="day4"/> In the case of a multiple idol unit, the player can choose who sings which lyrics, though at least one singer is needed for each line. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. An idol's rank starts at F, and goes up in stages to E, D, C, B, A and finally S.<ref name="ascii-primer-2-2"/> It is possible for an idol to make mistakes during a performance if she has not trained enough, which may effect the number of fans gained from the performance.<ref name="ascii-primer-2-2"/> The player is allowed to take photos during the performance,<ref name="day5">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day5.htm|title=TV<U+51FA><U+756A>|trans_title=TV Performance|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> but only the last one taken can be saved.

Once the day's schedule has been completed, the player returns to 765 Pro with the idol in the evening. The player will be shown the idol's rank, how many fans she has gained over the course of the day, and how many fans she currently has. If available, the idol will be given various presents and [[fan mail|letters]] from her fans at this time.<ref name="day6">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/imas/archive/intro/day6.htm|title=<U+591C>...1<U+65E5><U+306E><U+7D42><U+308F><U+308A>...|trans_title=Night...One Day Finished...|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|accessdate=August 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> The player's idol unit may be forced to retire under certain circumstances, such as the player not gaining enough fans by a specified time, which is called the rank up limit. In addition, if an idol's rank is either A or S, the idol will be forced to retire on week 62.

The Xbox 360 port of ''The Idolmaster'' features several changes to its gameplay.

Otherwise, choosing to take the day off will cause the game to immediately proceed to the next in-game week.

The rank up limit has been removed, and the player is now given 52 weeks to produce an idol unit with the addition of specifying the month.<ref name="ascii-primer-2-2"/> This does not include an additional three weeks which take up the idol's pre-debut period. The port uses [[Xbox Live]] during auditions to match players online,<ref name="ascii-primer-2-2"/> but an Xbox Live Gold subscription is needed to participate. An Xbox Live Free subscription only allows a player to view player rankings. The auditions limited to idols with a rank of E or F is split into two categories: Rookie and Local, and the national auditions now require a rank of D to participate. Up to five photos can now be saved during a performance.

Ishihara realized that players would need an emotional attachment to the game for them to play it every day. With the [[target audience]] to be male players, Ishihara thought that a [[Life simulation game|raising simulation]] where players could befriend girls and young women would lead players to form a strong emotional attachment for the game. Next, in order to effectively use the competitive culture that surrounds video arcades, Ishihara thought about various themes for the game, including [[professional wrestling]] and [[volleyball]]. Ishihara finally settled on a game featuring pop [[Japanese idol|idols]], who players would raise and compete against other players' idols to reach the top of the entertainment industry.<ref name="famitsu-interview1"/> There were some members of Namco that thought it would feel awkward to play ''The Idolmaster'' in public and that it would not be well received by players. However, when the game was first tested in arcades, there were long lines of people waiting to play. As word spread and its popularity grew, rival game companies said they had wanted to be the first to create a game like ''The Idolmaster''.<ref name="mantan1"/>

Following the success of the arcade game, Namco Bandai Games went on to develop its Xbox 360 port starting in early 2006, though a port of the game had been discussed as early as May 2005.<ref name="gamewatch-interview">{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20070130/imas.htm|title=Xbox 360<U+300C><U+30A2><U+30A4><U+30C9><U+30EB><U+30DE><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+300D>|trans_title=Xbox 360 The Idolmaster|publisher=Impress Watch Corporation|work=Game Watch|date=January 30, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> Namco Bandai Games [[Video game producer|producer]] Y<U+014D>z<U+014D> Sakagami was initially unsure if ''The Idolmaster'' would be suited for a [[video game console]] due to hardware and network limitations, but he felt that the Xbox 360 and its [[Xbox Live]] network could handle the game's specifications.<ref name="famitsu-interview1"/> This would also allow the developers to improve the game's quality and attract attention from those who never played the arcade game. Many people who were interested in the arcade game but never played it would tell Sakagami that this was either because their local arcade did not have ''The Idolmaster'', or because they were embarrassed to play it in public. According to Sakagami, to the development team of the port, there was a large significance in correcting these issues. Their other focus was on allowing players to comfortably play the game and enjoy its various scenarios without the rushed gameplay found in the arcade version.<ref name="famitsu-interview1"/> The developers employ [[motion capture]] to present a realistic view of the characters<U+2014>not only during normal gameplay,<ref name="famitsu-interview1"/> but also during performances, which are rendered using motion capture from professional dancers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kujioka, Toshihiko|url=http://www.idolmaster.jp/blog/2009/11/post-132.html|title=<U+30C7><U+30A3><U+30A2><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30BA><U+306E><U+30C0><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+306E><U+30D2><U+30DF><U+30C4>|trans_title=Dance Secrets for Dearly Stars|publisher=[[Namco Bandai Games]]|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2013|language=Japanese}}</ref> When developing the Xbox 360 port of ''The Idolmaster'', the characters had to be entirely redone, including the motion capture, which used the same actors as before.
