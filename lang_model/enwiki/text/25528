'''''Wheatfield with Crows''''' is a July 1890 painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's last painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist. The evidence of his letters suggests that ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as ''[[The Town Hall at Auvers|Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890]]'' and ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''.<ref name="Letter"/<ref name= "VGM"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vggallery.com/painting/by_period/auvers.htm| title=Auvers-sur-Oise: May <U+2013> July 1890 (75 paintings) |publisher=vggallery.com|accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref> Moreover, [[Jan Hulsker]] points out that a painting of harvested wheat, ''Field with Stacks of Wheat'' (F771), must be a later painting.<ref name= "Hulsker">{{cite book|last=Hulsker|first=Jan|title=The Complete Van Gogh: Paintings, Drawings, Sketches|year=1986|work=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-517-44867-X|page=480}}</ref>

==Provenance==

The [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was painted in July 1890, in the last weeks of van Gogh<U+2019>s life. Many have claimed it as his last painting, while it is also possible ''[[Tree Roots]]'', or the previously mentioned ''Daubigny's Garden'', was his final painting.

''Wheat Field with Crows,'' made on a [[Double-squares_and_Squares#Van_Gogh.27s_Double-square_canvases|double-square canvas]], depicts a dramatic, cloudy sky filled with crows over a wheat.<ref name= "VGM">{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3343&lang=en#moretotell |title=Wheat Field with Crows |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> A sense of isolation is heightened by a central path leading nowhere and by the uncertain direction of flight of the crows.

About 10 July 1890 van Gogh wrote to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] and [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo Bonger]], saying that he had painted another three large canvases at [[Auvers-sur-Oise|Auvers]] since visiting them in Paris on 6 July.<ref name="Letter">{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh and Jo van Gogh-Bonger. Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Thursday, 10 July 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let898/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|work=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>  Two of these are described as <!--- source is "d'immenses" ---> immense stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, thought to be ''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheatfield under Clouded Sky]]'' and ''Wheatfield with Crows'', and the third is ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''. He wrote that he had made a point of expressing sadness, later adding "extreme loneliness" (''de la solitude extr<U+00EA>me''), but also says he believes the canvases show what he considers healthy and fortifying about the countryside (and adds that he intended to take them to Paris as soon as possible):{{quote | text=There is nothing in van Gogh's words to support a simplistic interpretation along the lines of artistic ''angst'' and despair <U+2013> nor is there any evidence for the widely-held belief that it was this painting that van Gogh had on his easel at the time he killed himself.|sign= Ingo F. Walther <U+2013> Rainer Metzger|source= ''Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings''}} 
Walther and Metzger refer to a June 1880 letter of van Gogh's, in which he compared himself to a bird in a cage,<ref>{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Cuesmes, between about Tuesday, 22 and Thursday, 24 June 1880|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let155/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|work=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> and remark:{{quote|text=The crows in the painting, in other words, were an altogether personal symbol closely associated with van Gogh's own life.|sign= Ingo F. Walther <U+2013> Rainer Metzger|source= ''Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings''}} 

These painting are all examples of van Gogh's elongated double-square canvases, used exclusively by him in the last few weeks of his life, in June and July 1890.

The painting is held in the collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, as is ''Wheatfield under Clouded Sky''.
