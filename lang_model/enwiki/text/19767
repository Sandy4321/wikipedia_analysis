'''Pollution of the Hudson River''' is [[water pollution]] of the [[Hudson River]] and pollution of the parts of the [[Hudson River Valley]] affected by this water pollution.

The most discussed pollution of the Hudson River is [[General Electric]]'s contamination of the river with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) between 1947-77. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water. In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician [[Pete Seeger]] founded the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] and the [[Clearwater Festival]] to draw attention to the problem. The activism led to the site being designated as one of the [[superfund]] sites. Other kinds of pollution, including mercury contamination and sewage dumping, have caused problems also.

Various responses to pollution are proposed and debated.

==Types of pollution==
NYSDEC has listed various portions of the Hudson as having impaired [[water quality]] due to [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[cadmium]], and other [[toxic]] compounds. Hudson River tributaries with impaired water quality (not necessarily the same pollutants as the Hudson main stem) are Mohawk River, Dwaas Kill, Schuyler Creek, [[Saw Mill River]], [[Esopus Creek]], [[Hoosic River]], Quaker Creek, and [[Batten Kill]]. Many lakes in the Hudson [[drainage basin]] are also listed.<ref name="AutoD3-30">NYSDEC.

Other ongoing [[water pollution|pollution]] issues affecting the river include: accidental [[sanitary sewer overflow|sewage discharges]], [[urban runoff]], [[heavy metals]], [[furans]], [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs).<ref name="nysdec">{{cite web|title=Hudson River Estuary Program: Cleaning the river: Improving water quality | author=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).

===PCBs===
The numerous factories that at one time lined the Hudson River poured garbage and [[industrial waste]] directly into the river. 

[[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCB]]s were widely used as dielectric and coolant fluids, for example in transformers, capacitors, and electric motors. This pollution was not assessed in a comprehensive fashion until the 1970s.  By that time, the largest company still operating factories in the area was [[General Electric]], which became primarily responsible for cleaning the Hudson River. Between approximately 1947 and 1977, GE released between 500,000&nbsp;lbs and 1,500,000&nbsp;lbs of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) into the [[Hudson River]].<ref name="epa_ge">{{cite web|title=Hudson River PCBs <U+2014> Background and Site Information |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> The PCBs came from the company's two [[capacitor]] manufacturing plants at [[Hudson Falls]] and [[Fort Edward (town), New York|Fort Edward]] in [[New York]].<ref name="epa_ge"/>

The highest concentration of PCBs comes from the Thompson Island Pool.<ref name="AutoD3-21">Clean Up GE. [http://www.cleanupge.org/pcbs.html] Accessed 2011-11-9.</ref>

===Mercury===
A study reported in the August 2008 issue of the journal ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' suggests that [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in common Hudson River fish, including [[striped bass]], [[yellow perch]], [[largemouth bass]], [[smallmouth bass]] and [[carp]], has declined strongly over the past three decades.  The conclusions were extracted from a large database of mercury analyses of fish fillets accumulated by NYSDEC and collected over much of the length of the Hudson from New York City waters to the Adirondack [[drainage basin|watershed]]. The research indicates that the trends are in line with the recovery that the Hudson River has experienced over the past few decades, now that activist groups, government officials and industry are beginning to cooperate to help clean up the river system.<ref name="AutoD3-29">{{cite journal |last1=Levinton |first1=J.S. |last2=Ochron |first2=S.T.P. |year=2008 |title=Temporal and geographic trends in mercury concentrations in muscle tissue in five species of hudson river, USA, fish |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1691<U+2013>1697 |url= |doi=10.1897/07-438.1 |pmid=18266478}}</ref>

===Invasive species===

===Cooling water withdrawal===
In 2010 NYSDEC charged that the [[Indian Point Energy Center]], a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Buchanan, New York|Buchanan]], is violating the [[Clean Water Act]] due to its large withdrawals of water from the Hudson, which kills millions of fish and other aquatic organisms each year. The state is demanding that [[Entergy]], the plant operator, replace its [[fish screen]]s with [[cooling tower]]s to mitigate the environmental impacts.<ref name="AutoD3-34">{{cite news|title=Nuclear Plant<U+2019>s Use of River Water Prompts $1.1 Billion Debate With State|first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |newspaper=New York Times |date=2010-08-23 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/science/earth/23cooling.html |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Effects of pollution==
The PCBs caused extensive contamination of fish in the river and apparently triggered a rapid evolutionary change in the [[Microgadus tomcod|Atlantic tomcod]], which after about 50 years of exposure evolved a two amino acid change in its AHR2 receptor gene, causing the receptor to bind more weakly with PCBs than normal.<ref name="scidai11"/> The mutation does not prevent the tomcods from accumulating PCBs in their bodies and passing them on to [[striped bass]] and whatever else eats them.<ref name="scidai11">{{cite web|title= Pollution Triggers Genetic Resistance Mechanism in a Coastal Fish | publisher= [[Science Daily]] | url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110217141513.htm | accessdate=2011-02-18}}</ref> This system of passing contamination on to larger organisms is also known as [[biomagnification]].  The toxic chemicals also accumulated in [[sediment]]s that settled to the river bottom.<ref name="AutoD3-20">{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|location=[[New York, New York]]|url=http://www.epa.gov/hudson/faqs.htm|work=Hudson River PCBs|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> 

There are many economic effects caused by the PCB Contamination. The water cannot be used for agriculture use, money is lost from the fishing industry because of the ban on recreational fishing, medical expenses for people who have side-effects from the water, and the cost of clean-up efforts.

In 1976 the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] banned all fishing in the [[Upper Hudson River Valley|Upper Hudson]] due to health concerns with PCBs.<ref name="AutoD3-23">EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/hudson/ "Hudson River PCBs."] February 5, 2009.</ref><ref name="epa_ge">{{cite web|title=National Priorities List Fact Sheets: Hudson River PCBs | publisher=EPA | url=http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf | accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> PCBs are thought to be responsible for health issues that include neurological disorders, lower IQ and poor short-term memory (active memory), hormonal disruption, suppressed immune system, cancer, skin irritations, Parkinson<U+2019>s disease, ADHD, heart disease, and diabetes. PCB contamination in humans may come from drinking the contaminated water, absorption through the skin, eating contaminated aquatic life, and/or inhaling volatilized PCBs. PCB contamination is especially dangerous for pregnant and nursing women. The contamination can reach the fetus and potentially cause birth defects. Contamination through breast milk can also have harmful effects on the child indirectly.

==Responses to pollution==

===Clearwater===
{{main|Hudson River Sloop Clearwater}}
Clearwater has gained national recognition for its activism starting in the 1970s to force a clean-up of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contamination of the Hudson River caused by industrial manufacturing by [[General Electric]] and other companies on the river's edge. Other specific Hudson watershed issues with which Clearwater is concerned are development pressures in the southern half of the Hudson Valley, pesticide runoff, the [[Manhattan]] west side waterfront, [[Indian Point Energy Center|Indian Point]] nuclear reactors, and New York/New Jersey Harbor dredge spoil disposal.  Clearwater has gained worldwide recognition for its leadership in helping to pass landmark environmental laws, both state and federal, including the [[Clean Water Act]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Clearwater played a key role in the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) decision to compel one of the Hudson River<U+2019>s biggest polluters to begin removing toxic [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s from the water and restoring one of the most polluted portions of the river.<ref>[http://www.rollmagazine.com/jun10/currentPDF.pdf "Where Have All The Flowers Gone"], ''Roll Magazine'', p. 14, accessed November 4, 2010</ref>

In 2002, [[Pete Seeger]] was named a "Clean Water Hero" for his prominent efforts in the passage of the [[Clean Water Act]].<ref>[http://www.pcnr.com/news/2002-10-23/General_Stories/031.html "Pete Seeger Named Clean Water Hero"], The Putnam County News online edition, accessed November 4, 2010</ref>  His tireless devotion to working through Clearwater and promoting its message to effectively use the law in prosecuting polluters of America<U+2019>s waterways has made the [[Clean Water Act]] one of the most successful environmental laws in the country.<ref>[http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/speeches/clean.html "The 25th Anniversary of the Clean Water Act (Speech Transcript)"], Clinton White House Archives, accessed November 4, 2010</ref>

The EPA said after Seeger's death in 2014 that "the incredible work" of Seeger and the Clearwater organization helped make the Hudson River cleaner. "His leadership was extraordinary," regional Administrator Judith A. Enck told [[United Press International]].<ref name=upi.com>{{cite news|first=Gerry|last=Harrington|title=Movement afoot to name bridge after Pete Seeger |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2014/01/31/Movement-afoot-to-name-bridge-after-Pete-Seeger/UPI-15581391204873/ |work=[[United Press International]] |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref>

Seeger was involved in the environmental organization [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]], which he co-founded in 1966. This organization has worked since then to highlight pollution in the [[Hudson River]] and worked to clean it. As part of that effort, the [[sloop]] ''[[Sloop Clearwater|''Clearwater'']]'' was launched in 1969 with its inaugural sail down from [[Maine]] to [[South Street Seaport Museum]] in New York City, and thence to the [[Hudson River]].<ref>Featured in the PBS documentary, a more specific cite is needed.</ref> Amongst the inaugural crew was [[Don McLean]], who co-edited the book ''Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew'', with sketches by [[Thomas B. Allen]] for which Seeger wrote the foreword.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs |last=Howard |first=Alan |authorlink= |author2= |year=2007 |publisher=Lulu Press Inc. |location= |isbn=978-1-4303-0682-5 |page=420 }}</ref> Seeger and McLean sang "Shenandoah" on the 1974 ''Clearwater'' album. The sloop regularly sails the river with volunteer and professional crew members, primarily conducting environmental education programs for school groups. The [[Great Hudson River Revival]] (aka Clearwater Festival) is an annual two-day music festival held on the banks of the Hudson at [[Croton Point Park]]. This festival grew out of early fundraising concerts arranged by Seeger and friends to raise money to pay for ''Clearwater's'' construction.

In 1966, [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Toshi Seeger]] founded [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]], an environmental education organization and an actual boat (a [[sloop]]), that promotes awareness of the river and its history. Clearwater has gained national recognition for its activism starting in the 1970s to force a clean-up of PCB contamination of the Hudson caused by GE and other companies.<ref name="AutoD3-22">Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Beacon, NY. [http://www.clearwater.org/about/history/ "History."] Accessed 2010-10-05.</ref>

Seeger wrote and performed "That Lonesome Valley" about the then-polluted Hudson River in 1969, and his band members also wrote and performed songs commemorating the ''Clearwater''.

The 106-foot-long sailboat, ''Clearwater'', was built to conduct science-based environmental education aboard the sailing ship. ''Clearwater'' has education programs with many colleges and institutions, including SUNY New Paltz, and Pace University. The sail ship has become recognized for its role in the environmental movement. The Clearwater Festival brings Hudson Valley residents together to enjoy music, their cultural heritage, and support a cause.<ref>See the [http://www.clearwater.org/about/ Annual Clearwater Festival website]</ref> The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] said after his death that "the incredible work" of Seeger and the Clearwater organization helped make the Hudson River cleaner.

===Superfund designation===
In 1977, PCBs were banned in the United States.<ref name="AutoD3-24">{{cite web|title=NRDC: Historic Hudson River Cleanup | url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/hhudson.asp | accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> In 1983, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) declared a 200-mile (322-km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a [[Superfund]] site requiring cleanup. This superfund site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation. In 2001, after a ten year study of PCB contamination in the Hudson River, the EPA proposed a plan to clean up the river by dredging more than 100,000 pounds of PCBs. The worst PCB hotspots are targeted for remediation by removing and disposing of more than 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment.<ref name="AutoD3-25">{{cite web|title=EPA Region 2 | url=http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf | accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> The dredging project is the most aggressive environmental effort ever proposed to clean up a river, and will cost GE about $460,000,000. GE began sediment [[dredging]] operations to clean up the PCBs on May 15, 2009.<ref name="AutoD3-26">{{cite web|url=http://www.hudsondredging.com/|title=The Hudson River Dredging Project|publisher=General Electric | accessdate= 2009-10-22}}</ref> This stage (Phase One) of the cleanup was completed in October 2009, and was responsible for the removal of approximately 300,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment, which was more than the targeted amount. Over 620 barges filled with sediment were transported to the processing facility on the Champlain Canal, and over 80 rail cars transported the dredged sediment to a waste facility in Andrews, Texas.<ref name="AutoD3-27">Greenversations.

Before Phase two of the cleanup, GE was given the opportunity to opt out of the clean up efforts, but they chose to complete the project. Phase two of the cleanup project, led by GE and monitored by the EPA, began in June 2011. This phase targets approximately 2.4 million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment from a forty mile section of the Upper Hudson River. Phase Two of the clean up will take approximately 5 to 7 years to complete.<ref name="AutoD3-28">{{cite web|url=http://hudsondredgingdata.com/|title=Hudson Dredging Data|publisher=General Electric | accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

In 2009 dredging was started to remove contaminated sediments from the river bed and in 2010 General Electric agreed to finance and conduct a second dredging campaign at the Upper Hudson River between Fort Edward and Troy. These works will be supervised by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref name=EPA>{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency| location= New York, NY | url= http://www.epa.gov/hudson/faqs.htm | work= Hudson River PCBs| title=Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref>

There have been many programs of remediation work to reduce the PCB pollution. In 1984, approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} of the Hudson River was designated a [[Superfund]] site, and attempts to clean up the upper Hudson River began, including the removal in 1977-8 of {{convert|180000|cuyd|m3}} of contaminated river sediments near Fort Edward.<ref name="epa_super"/> In 1991, further PCB pollution was found at Bakers Falls, near the former GE Hudson Falls factory, and a program of remediation was started.<ref name="epa_super"/> In August 1995, a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} reach of the upper Hudson was reopened to fishing, but only on a catch-and-release basis.<ref name="epa_super"/> Removal of contaminated soil from [[Rogers Island (New York)|Rogers Island]] was completed in December, 1999.<ref name="epa_super"/> In 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) announced a further {{convert|2650000|cuyd|m3}} of contaminated sediments in the upper Hudson River would be removed.

In 1980, [[Consolidated Edison]] (Con Ed) agreed to drop its 17-year fight to build a [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] facility on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]], after a legal challenge by the non-profit environmental organization [[Scenic Hudson]].<ref name="AutoD3-32">Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY.

===Other calls for cleanup===
Though the work is slow going, environmental advocacy groups have lent their voice to the problem of pollution. [[Scenic Hudson]], Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Hudson Riverkeeper, and the NRDC continue to push for more action from General Electric.<ref>{{cite web|last=Revkin|first=Andrew|title=Dredging of Pollutants Begins in Hudson|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/science/earth/16dredge.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=18 October 2013|date=15 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dyer|first=Johanna|title=New Hudson River PCB Contamination Report Confirms Need for Thorough Cleanup|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jdyer/new_hudson_river_pcb_contamina.html|publisher=National Resource Defence Council|accessdate=18 October 2013|date=18 January 2013}}</ref>

In 1976, because of concern over continuing high levels of PCBs in local fish and other aquatic organisms, and the unacceptable risk to the health of consumers of such fish, the NYSDEC banned all fishing in the upper Hudson River, as well as commercial fishing of [[striped bass]] and several other species in the lower Hudson River,<ref name="epa_ge"/><ref name="epa_super">{{cite web|title=Hudson River PCBs |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=2007-06-27 |url=http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> and also issued advisories restricting the consumption of fish caught within a {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1|adj=on}} long segment of the Hudson River from Hudson Falls to [[Troy, New York|Troy]].<ref name="epa_ge"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Hudson River Virtual Tour <U+2014> Chapter 9: PCB Pollution in the Hudson |publisher=NYSDEC |url=http://www.dec.ny.us/lands/25974.html |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

===Opposition to cleanup===
GE fought a media and political battle to avoid cleaning up the river and countered that dredging the river would actually stir up PCBs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/hhudson.asp |title=Historic Hudson River Cleanup to Begin After Years of Delay, But Will General Electric Finish the Job?
