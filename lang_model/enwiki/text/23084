"'''Supernaut'''" is the fifth song of album [[Black Sabbath Vol. 4]] by [[British people|British]] [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Black Sabbath]].

In an interview with ''Q magazine'', [[Beck Hansen]] named the "Supernaut" riff as his all time favourite, equal with [[Neil Young]]'s "[[Cinnamon Girl (Neil Young song)|Cinnamon Girl]]." [[Frank Zappa]] had also identified that song as one of his all time favorites.<ref>Black Sabbath Vol. 4 2009 reissue booklet, page 11</ref> Supernaut was also one of [[Led Zeppelin]] drummer [[John Bonham]]'s favorite songs by Sabbath.<ref>http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=161380</ref>

The song was covered by Ministry side project [[1000 Homo DJs]] in 1990. It was released as a [[12-inch single|12-inch]] and [[CD single]]. The CD version of the single also contains the songs "Apathy" and "Better Ways", from the band's 1988 debut single, "Apathy."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/supernaut-mw0000269666 | title=1000 Homo DJs - Supernaut | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=November 4, 2013 | author=Raggett, Ned}}</ref>

Ned Raggett of [[Allmusic]] praised the cover, writing that "the title track is something else again, one of Al Jourgensen's best efforts at creating completely over-the-top industrial death disco. While it doesn't do much in the way of reinterpreting the original Black Sabbath number -- no lyric changes, same basic pace -- the amped-up guitars, huge drum fills, dancefloor-oriented pounding, and distorted lyrical screaming turn it into a massive, exhilarating crunch." Nevertheless, he stated that the b-side song, "Hey Asshole", was "consisting of little more than a shouted loop of the song title and a crunching rhythm as background for an extended rant by a character playing."<ref name="allmusic" />

[[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]] recorded the original vocals for the "Supernaut" cover.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com.tr/books?id=qr8zLwlIOpwC&pg=PA72&dq=1000+homo+djs+supernaut&hl=tr&sa=X&ei=3t13Ut4Zhcq0BtvBgCA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=1000%20homo%20djs%20supernaut&f=false | title=Black Box <U+2013> Wax Trax!

Both Reznor and Jourgensen dismissed this claim. In a 1992 [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] post regarding "Supernaut," Reznor said, "[I] finally told Al to redo it without me. The version that Wax Trax put out is Al, the version on the NIN [bootleg] single is me."<ref>{{cite web

When asked whose vocals appear on "Supernaut," Jourgensen replied, "That would be me on the original, on WaxTrax!
