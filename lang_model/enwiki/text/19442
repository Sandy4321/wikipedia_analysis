===MDA framework===
In 2008, Robin Hunicke, [[Marc LeBlanc]], and [[Robert Zubeck]] created the [[MDA framework|Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework]] to focus and improve game analysis. The framework categorizes the many aspects of a game as Mechanics, Dynamics, or Aesthetics, and outlines the inverse perspectives of designer and player. From the perspective of the designer, the Mechanics generate Dynamics which generate Aesthetics. From the perspective of the player, the player experiences the game through the Aesthetics, which are provided by Dynamics that emerge from Mechanics.
