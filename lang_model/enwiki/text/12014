'''Kents Cavern''' is a [[cave]] system in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. It is notable for its [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[geology|geological]] features. The caves are a [[geology|geological]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (since 1952) and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] (since 1957), and are open to the public.<ref>English Nature, "[http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000875.pdf  Kents Cavern]", Natural England (accessed 2007-02-18)</ref><ref name="bbc3867385">bbc.co.uk, "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/3867385.stm Visitor centre for ancient caves]", BBC (accessed 2007-02-18)</ref>

== Prehistory ==

The caverns and passages at the site were created around 2 million years ago by water action, and have been occupied by one of at least eight separate, discontinous native populations to have inhabited the [[British Isles]].<ref>[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/ahob/AHOBI/index_2.html Human Occupation of the British Isles Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The specimens discovered here are representative of the era's people (the other representative populations are [[Pakefield]], [[Boxgrove Quarry|Boxgrove]], [[Barnfield Pit|Swanscombe]], [[Pontnewydd]], Kent<U+2019>s Cavern/[[Red Lady of Paviland|Paviland]], [[Cheddar Man|Gough's Cave]] and the present descendants of [[Celt#Celts in Britain and Ireland|Celtic]] lineage).

=== Kents Cavern 4 ===

A prehistoric [[maxilla]] (upper jawbone) fragment was discovered in the cavern during a 1927 excavation by the [[Torquay Natural History Society]], and named ''Kents Cavern 4.'' It is thought to be between 37,000 and 40,000 years old, and although previously it was thought to only be 31,000 years old, it has been recently re-dated. Whether the specimen belongs to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', as originally described, or ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' as may now be possible, remains a mystery. The specimen is on display at the [[Torquay Museum]].

== Modern History ==
=== As an arch<U+00E6>ological site ===

Kents Cavern is first recorded as Kents Hole Close on a 1659 deed when the land was leased to John Black.<ref name="pike5">John R. Pike, Torquay (Torquay: Torbay Borough Council Printing Services, 1994), 5</ref> The earliest evidence of exploration of the caves in historic times are the inscriptions "William Petre 1571" and "Robert Hedges 1688" engraved on [[stalagmite]]s, and the first recorded [[excavation]] was that of Thomas Northmore in 1824.<ref name="pike5"/> Northmore's work attracted the attention of Dean Buckland, the first Reader in Geology at the [[University of Oxford]], who sent a party including [[John MacEnery]] to explore the caves in an attempt to find evidence that [[Mithras]] was once worshipped in the area.<ref name="russell107">Percy Russell, A History Of Torquay (Torquay: Devonshire Press Limited, 1960), 107</ref> MacEnery, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[chaplain]] at [[Torre Abbey]], conducted systematic excavations between 1824 and 1829.<ref name="pike5"/><ref name="russell107"/> When MacEnery reported to the [[British Association]] the discovery of [[flint tool]]s below the stalagmites on the cave floor, his work was derided as contrary to Bishop [[James Ussher|James Ussher's]] [[Biblical chronology]] dating the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to 4004 BC.<ref>Russell, 108</ref>

In September 1845 the recently created Torquay Natural History Society requested permission from Sir Lawrence Palk to explore the caves in order to obtain [[fossil]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] for the planned Torquay Museum, and as a result Edward Vivian and [[William Pengelly]] were allowed to conduct excavations between 1846 and 1858.<ref name="pike5"/> Vivian reported to the [[Geological Society]] in 1847, but at the time it was generally believed that early humans had entered the caves long after the formation of the cave structures examined.<ref name="russell109">Russell, 109</ref> This changed when in the Autumn of 1859, following the work of Pengelly at Kents Cavern and caves in [[Brixham]] and of [[Jacques de Perthes]] in [[France]], the [[Royal Society]], the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], and the British Association agreed that the excavations had established the antiquity of humanity.<ref name="russell109"/>

In 1865 the British Association created a committee, led by Pengelly, to fully explore the cave system over the course of fifteen years.<ref name="pike5"/> It was Pengelly's party that discovered Robert Hedges' stalagmite inscription, and from the stalagmite's growth since that time deduced that human-created artifacts found under the formation could be half a million years old.<ref>Pike, 5-6</ref> Pengelly plotted the position of every bone, flint, and other artifact he discovered during the excavations, and afterwards continued working with the Torquay Natural History Society until his death at his home less than 2 [[kilometre|km]] from the caves in 1892.<ref>Russell, 110</ref>

In 1954 a bottle was discovered in a recess containing the message "Entered this vault for the first time on Monday [[3 December]] [[1877]] &mdash; J L Widger. How wonderful are thy works O God."<ref>Chips Barber, Torquay (Exeter: Obelisk Publications, 1992), 23</ref>

=== As a tourist attraction ===

In 1903 Kents Cavern, then part of Lord Haldon's estate, was sold to Francis Powe, a carpenter who originally used the caves as a workshop while making [[beach hut]]s for the Torquay sea front.<ref name="bbc3867385"/> Powe's son, Leslie Powe, turned the caves into a tourist attraction by laying [[concrete]] paths and installing [[electric lighting]], and building visitor facilities which were later improved in turn by his son John Powe.<ref>bbc.co.uk, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2003/kents_cavern.shtml Kents Cavern in Torquay celebrates 100 years under the same ownership]", BBC (accessed 2007-02-18)</ref> The caves, now owned by Nick Powe, celebrated 100 years of Powe family ownership on [[23rd August]] [[2003]] with special events including an arch<U+00E6>ological dig for children and a display by a cave rescue team.<ref>bbc.co.uk, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/family_friendly/kents_cavern_100.shtml Special events mark Kents Cavern's centenary]", BBC (accessed 2007-02-18)</ref> A year later a new [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]500,000 visitor centre was opened, including a [[restaurant]] and [[gift shop]].<ref name="bbc3867385"/>

Attracting 80,000 tourists a year, Kents Cavern is an important tourist attraction and this was recognised in 2000 when it was awarded Showcave of the Year award and later in November of 2005 when it was awarded a prize for being Torbay's Visitor Attraction of the year.
