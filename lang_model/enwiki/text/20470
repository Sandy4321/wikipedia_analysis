'''Edgar Thomas Towner''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (19 April 1890 &ndash; 18 August 1972) was an [[Australia]]n recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. A lieutenant in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], Towner was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1918 following his gallantry during an attack on [[Mont St. Quentin]]. Commanding a machine gun section, he inflicted severe casualties on the German force and was instrumental in capturing a party of twenty-five German soldiers as prisoners in conjuction with seizing two German machine guns.

Born in Queensland, Towner acquired a [[grazing]] property and was developing the land before he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1915. Allotted to the transport section of the 25th Battalion, he served on Egypt until moving to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Transferring to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion, Towner was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a lieutenant and [[Mentioned in Despatches]] twice for his leadership. During June 1918, Towner led a section of machine guns in attack near [[Morlancourt]] and assisted the infantry in reaching its objectives under heavy machine gun and sniper fire; he was subsequently awarded the [[Military Cross]].

Discharged in August 1919, Towner returned to his property. He was appointed a director of the Russleigh Pastoral Company, and briefly returned to service during the [[Second World War]], where he was promoted to major. A keen geographer, Towner was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal in 1956 for his geographical work. Unmarried, he died in 1972 at the age of 82.

==Early life==
Towner was born on 19 April 1890 at Glencoe Station, near [[Blackall, Queensland|Blackall]], [[Queensland]], to Edgar Thomas Towner, a grazing farmer, and his Irish wife Greta (n<U+00E9>e Herley).

During July 1916, the 25th Battalion took part in its first major French action at [[Battle of Pozi<U+00E8>res|Pozi<U+00E8>res]], as part of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]]. The battalion suffered 785 casualties as a result of its involvement in the battle between 25 July and 7 August.

On the night of 10&ndash;11 June 1918, Towner was in command of a machine gun section during an attack to the south of [[Morlancourt]].

===Victoria Cross===
On 1 September 1918, Towner was in command of No. 3 Section of the 7th Machine Gun Company during an attack on [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|Mont St. Quentin]], near [[P<U+00E9>ronne, Somme|P<U+00E9>ronne]].<ref name="AF"/> Comprising of four [[Vickers machine gun]]s,<ref name="VCrec">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0056.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=30 January 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> the section was attached to the right flank of the 24th Australian Infantry Battalion during the engagement. The 24th Battalion's principal objective was to seize the summit of Mont St. Quentin. To achieve this, the battalion had to advance through the village of Feuillaucourt, before moving down onto the P<U+00E9>ronne road. For his actions during the battle, Towner was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross; the third of six Australians to do so during the fighting around Mont St. Quentin and P<U+00E9>ronne.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="VCs109">{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=109}}</ref>

Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the Australian advance commenced at 06:00 with Towner's section covering a front of {{convert|1400|m|yd}}.<ref name="VCrec"/><ref name="VCs109"/> Due to rain, visibility was limited and the Australians soon began to suffer casualties.<ref name="VCs109"/> Early in the advance, Towner witnessed a German machine gun causing heavy casualties on the advancing troops. Locating the gun's position, he rushed ahead and single-handedly killed the crew with his revolver. Capturing the gun, Towner then turned the weapon on the Germans, inflicting a number of casualties.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="VCrec"/> Soon after, the Australians succeeded in taking Feuillaucourt.<ref name="VCs109"/>

Proceeding across the P<U+00E9>ronne road, strong German resistance was encountered firing from a [[copse]]; thus halting the advance.<ref name="VCrec"/><ref name="VCs109"/> It was at this stage that the German troops were observed amassing a large force for a counter-attack. Moving forward with several of his men and two Vickers guns in conjunction with the captured German gun, Towner inflicted heavy casualites on the Germans.<ref name="AF"/> Attempting to retire, a party of twenty-five German soldiers were cut off by machine gun fire from Towner's guns; the group was consequently taken as [[prisoners of war]].<ref name="VCrec"/>

[[File:Edgar Towner full length J03070.JPG|thumb|upright|right|175px|Full length portrait of Lieutenant Edgar Towner c.1918]]

Alone, Towner reconnoitred over open ground while subject to strong machine gun and sniper fire, searching for the best locations from which his guns could fire.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="VCrec"/> Moving his section forward, the party was able to bring severe machine fire upon further groups of German soldiers. The section's actions enabled the infantry to revive its advance, and move into the cover of a sunken section on the P<U+00E9>ronne road.<ref name="VCrec"/><ref name="VCs109"/> On moving his guns up to the sunken road, Towner found the section was growing short of ammunition. Making his way back across the open ground under heavy fire, he located a German machine gun and brought it forward along with several boxes of ammunition to the sunken road. Towner, on mounting the gun, then proceeded to fire the weapon "in full view of the enemy".<ref name="AF"/><ref name="VCrec"/> His effective fire forced the German force to retire further, allowing the infantry on one of the flanks to advance, having previously been held up.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="VCrec"/>

German machine gunners held a commanding position over Towner's section on the sunken road, and began raining heavy fire within the party's vicinity. One of the bullets struck Towner's helmet, inflicting a gaping wound to his scalp. Despite this, he refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued firing his machine gun as the situation grew critical.<ref name="VCs110"/><ref name="VCrec2">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0057.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross (Cont)|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=18 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> Later during the day, the Australian infantry was forced to retire slightly and one machine gun was left behind&mdash;its crew having all become casualties. Alone, Towner dashed out over [[no man's land]] and acquired the weapon. He brought the gun back to the Australian lines under intense fire, before bringing it into action. Firing the gun, Towner "continued to engage the enemy whenever they appeared" and put a German machine gun out of action with his accurate fire.<ref name="VCrec2"/>

The following night, Towner frequented the frontlines and "continued to fight and&nbsp;... inspire his men".<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="VCrec2"/> As the 21st Australian Infantry Battalion assaulted a heavily fortified crater on the summit, Towner moved one of his machine guns up in order to provide supporting fire. Throughout the night, Towner reconnoitred the German position and reported on German troop movements.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="VCrec2"/> The next morning, Towner's section assisted in repulsing large German force, before he was evacuated with exhustion thirty hours after being wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0058.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross (Cont #2)|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=18 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> Initially admitted to the 41st Casualty Clearing Station, Towner was transported by train to the 2nd Red Cross Hospital at [[Rouen]].<ref name="AIF"/>

{{quote|''War Officer, 14th December, 1918.''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Warrant Officer, Non-commissioned Officers and Men: <U+2014>

Lt. Edgar Thomas Towner, M.C., 2nd Bn., Aus. M.G. Corps.

For most conspicuous bravery, initiative and devotion to duty on 1st September, 1918, in the attack on Mont St. Quentin, near Peronne, when in charge of four Vickers guns. During the early stages of the advance he located and captured, single-handed, an enemy machine-gun which was causing casualties, and by turning it on the enemy inflicted severe losses.

Subsequently, by the skilful, tactical handling of his guns, he cut off and captured twenty-five of the enemy.

Later, by fearless reconnaissance under heavy fire, and by the energy, foresight and promptitude with which he brought fire to bear on various enemy groups, he gave valuable support to the infantry advance.

Again, when short of ammunition, ie secured an enemy machine-gun, which lie mounted and fired in full view of the enemy, causing the enemy to retire further, and enabling our infantry to advance. Under intense fire, although wounded, he maintained the fire of this gun at a very critical period.

During the following night he steadied and gave valuable support to a small detached post, and by his coolness and cheerfulness inspirited the men in a great degree.

Throughout the night he kept close watch by personal reconnaissance on the enemy movements, and was evacuated exhausted thirty hours after being wounded.

The valour and resourcefulness of Lt. Towner undoubtedly saved a very critical situation, and contributed largely to the success of the attack.}}

===Later war service===
Following recuperation, Towner was granted three weeks leave to England from 14 September 1918. Re-joining his unit on 12 October, Towner was attached to the School of Instruction for a six-day stint. Granted thirteen days leave in France during late November, he returned to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion on 12 December.<ref name="AIF"/> On 10 April, Towner attended an investiture ceremony in the ballroom of [[Buckingham Palace]], where he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Military Cross by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref name="VCs110"/> Three weeks later, he boarded HT ''Karagola'' and commenced his return to Australia. Disembarking at Sydney on 14 June 1919, he made his way to Brisbane. Towner was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 August 1919.<ref name="AIF"/>

==Later life==
After his discharge, Towner re-settled on his property. He sold Valparaiso in 1922, after he was unable to raise sufficient funds to stock the property, and spent the following three years working as a [[Stockman|jackaroo]]. During 1925, he entered into a partnership on Kaloola station, a property located near [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="VCs111">{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=111}}</ref> Towner later bought out his partner, and assumed another partnership with the Russleigh Pastoral Company, [[Isisford, Queensland|Isisford]].

On 8 August 1939, Towner enlisted in the [[Citizens Military Force]] and was appointed to the 26th Battalion as a [[Captain (land)|captain]].<ref name="AF2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&VeteranID=495954|title=Towner, Edgar Thomas|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=18 February 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> After a period as a company commander with the battalion, he was promoted to temporary [[major]] and appointed second-in-command of the unit under Lieutenant Colonel [[Harry Murray]]. Due to ill health, Towner retired from the army on 21 February 1942, and returned to his property at Kaloola.<ref name="AF2"/><ref name="VCs111"/>

Towner was a keen [[geographer]], and would often disappear into the bush for weeks on end for study or exploration.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="VCs111"/> A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales,<ref name="AF2"/> Towner took a particular interest in researching the life of [[Thomas Mitchell|Sir Thomas Mitchell]]. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the [[Australian Government|Government]] to issue a [[postage stamp]] commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="VCs111"/> During 1955, Towner addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane, and he was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was later published in a booklet titled ''Lake Eyre and its Tributaries'' in 1957.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="AF2"/>

Unmarried, Towner died at Longreach Base Hospital on 18 August 1972. His funeral took place three days later, with a large proportion of Longreach citizens lining the streets as Towner's coffin was placed atop a gun carriage. Following a service at St Andrew's Church, he was buried with full military honours at the Longreach Town Cemetery. By the time of his death, Towner had amassed an 80,000 acre farm containing 25,000 sheep.<ref name="VCs111"/> Following an essay written by a local youth in Towner's birth town of Blackall, the local community was inspired to erect a monument to Towner. Enough money was subsequently raised by the community to commission a statue of Towner, which is expected to be unveiled on 25 April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|first=Clare|last=Kermond|title=Country boy's essay inspires tribute to hero|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/country-boys-essay-inspires-tribute-to-hero-20090105-7aj0.html|work=theage.com.au|publisher=The Age|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref>
