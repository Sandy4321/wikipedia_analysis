"'''Waterloo'''", first called "Honey Pie"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abbasite.com/infocus/index.php?id=1435 |title= Waterloo <U+2013> 30 years since ABBA<U+2019>s breakthrough
|accessdate= 2008-07-29 |publisher= ABBA - The Site }}</ref>, was the first single from Swedish pop group [[ABBA]]'s second album ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'', their first for [[Epic Records|Epic]] & [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. 

The Swedish version was the song that won ABBA the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Eurovision Song Contest]] and began their path to worldwide fame. The Swedish version single was coupled with "[[Honey, Honey]]" (Swedish Version), the English with "Watch Out" as the [[B-side]].

==History==
"Waterloo" was originally written as a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Eurovision Song Contest]], after the group finished 3rd with "[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]" in the previous year's national heats. Since it focused on lead vocalists [[Agnetha F<U+00E4>ltskog]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]] chose it in place of another of their songs, "[[Hasta Ma<U+00F1>ana]]". "Waterloo" is about a girl who is about to surrender to romance, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had to surrender at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.

The song proved to be a good choice. It sailed through the Swedish heats (in [[Waterloo (Swedish version)|Swedish]]) in February 1974 and won that year's Eurovision Song contest (ESC) final on [[April 6]] by six points.

"Waterloo" was one of ABBA's few songs to be written with simultaneous [[rock music]] and [[jazz]] beats, something later discarded in favour of more [[disco]]-esque rhythms. The song broke the "dramatic ballad" tradition of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] by its flavour and rhythm, as well as by its performance. By the end of the show, ABBA had given something the audience had never seen before in ESC: flashy and flamboyant costumes, silver platform boots, a group singing not in their native language, a catchy "uptempo" song and a simple, still unseen before, choreography.  

Though it isn't well-known, Polar accidentally released a different version of "Waterloo" shortly after ABBA's Eurovision win before pulling it off the shelves and replacing it with the more famous version. The alternate version had a rockier sound, omitting the saxophones, plus an additional "oh yeah" in the verses. The alternate version was commercially released in 2005 as part of ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings]]'' box set. However, it was this version that ABBA performed in the 1979 Europe/North American tour.

==Reception==
The "Waterloo" single introduced the world to the phenomenon that was to become ABBA. The song shot to No.1 in the [[UK]] & stayed there for two weeks, becoming the 1st of the band's 9 UK chart-toppers. It also hit No.1 in [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[West Germany]] and [[South Africa]], while reaching the Top 3 in ABBA's native [[Sweden]] (in both its Swedish (No.2) & English (No.3) formats), [[Austria]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] & [[Spain]]. Amazingly, for a Eurovision winning song, "Waterloo" also reached the Top 10 in [[Zimbabwe]] (then [[Rhodesia]]), [[New Zealand]] & [[Australia]]. Unusually, for a Eurovision entry, the song made it up to No. 6 in the [[United States]]. Yet, despite all this success, "Waterloo" only reached No.14 in Italy. "Waterloo" is the only song that has competed in Eurovision to reach the Top 10 in 15 countries.

The ''Waterloo'' album performed similarly well in Europe, although in the U.S., it failed to match the success of the single. Though it would be another twelve months before the group repeated their success, "Waterloo" introduced the world to a fresh-faced and vibrant group of individuals who were determined not to be Eurovision one-hit wonders.

ABBA had originally cited Wood & the [[Wizzard]] song "See My Baby Jive" as influences & in the wake of their Eurovision victory, were quoted as saying that it would not surprise them if artists such as Wizzard would consider entering the Eurovision contest in future.

In 1994, "Waterloo" - together with several other ABBA hits - was included in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]''. It was re-released in 2004 (with the same B-side), to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary, reaching No. 20 on the UK charts.

On October 22, 2005, during the fiftieth celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest, "Waterloo" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.

Contrary to what the song claims, [[Napoleon]] did not surrender at Waterloo; he surrendered at [[Rochefort]] on the French Atlantic coast four weeks later.
