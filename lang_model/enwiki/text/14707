'''Moorgate''' was one of the minor gates of the old [[London Wall]].  Though the gate itself was demolished in 1761, the name survives as a major street in the heart of the [[City of London]].  The street connects the city to [[Islington]], and was constructed around 1846 for the formation of new approaches to [[London Bridge]].

The name "Moorgate" derives from the surrounding area of [[Moorfields]], which was one of the last pieces of open land in the city.  Today this region is a [[financial]] centre, and is home to several of the [[United Kingdom]]'s major [[investment bank|investment]] and [[commercial banks|commercial]] banks.  The street also showcases historic and contemporary office buildings, including the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] and the [[Moorhouse (building)|Moorhouse]].

The [[Moorgate station]] on the [[London Underground]] is widely remembered for the [[Moorgate tube crash]] of 1975.  In the incident, a train terminating at the station failed to stop and crashed into a brick wall, and 43 people were killed.  This resulted in systems being installed on the Underground which automatically stop trains at dead-ends, which have become known as [[Moorgate control]].

==History==
[[Image:Moorgate gate.jpg|left|140px|thumb|An engraving showing Moorgate before it was demolished in 1762.]]
The earliest descriptions of Moorgate date from the early 15th century, where it was described as only a [[postern]] in the [[London|London city wall]]. Located between [[Bishopsgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] and leading to a [[moor]] known as [[Moorfields]], it was not one of the larger or more important of the city gates.

In 1415 an [[ordinance]] enacted that the old postern be demolished.  It was replaced with a newer and larger structure located further to the west, which included a wooden [[gate]] to be shut at night.  This gate was enlarged again in 1472 and 1511, and then damaged in the [[Great Fire of London]].  Although the city gates had ceased to have any modern function apart from decoration, it was replaced along with [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Temple Bar]] with a stone gate in 1672.

Moorgate was demolished with all the other London city wall gates in 1761, and the resulting stone was sold for <U+00A3>166 to the [[Corporation of London]] to support the [[Starling (architecture)|starlings]] of the newly widened centre arch of the [[London Bridge]]. Little Moorgate was a gate opposite [[Little Winchester Street]] leading into [[Moorfields]]. It was demolished by 1755, however it gave its name to a street taken down by the construction of the railways.

The [[Moorfields]] were one of the last pieces of open land in the City of London. The fields were divided into three areas: the Moorfields proper, just inside the City boundaries, north of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (also known as Bedlam, the world's oldest [[psychiatric hospital]]), and Middle and Upper Moorfields (both also open fields) to the north. Much of Moorfields was developed in 1777 and turned into present day [[Finsbury Circus]]. 

[[Image:Rocque_e1_MoorgateCrop.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Map of [[London Wall]], Moorgate, [[Moorfields]] and [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] from ''John Rocque's Map of London'', dated 1746.]]
Today, the name survives in the names of a short street parallel to Moorgate which contains some entrances to Moorgate station, as well as one of the pedestrian "streets" at high level in the [[Barbican Estate]], a major housing estate in the neighbourhood incorporating the [[Barbican Centre]] and several major buildings, which is known as Moorfields Highwalk.

In addition, the London Dispensary for curing diseases of the Eye and Ear was founded on the Moorfields in 1805, and evolved to become the present [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], which is now located on [[City Road]] (known popularly from the second verse of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]''), and is close to [[Old Street station]].

Moorfields was the site of the first [[hot air balloon]] flight in [[England]], when Italian [[Vincenzo Lunardi]] took off on the afternoon of [[15 September]] [[1784]]. Lunardi flew in a [[hydrogen]] balloon from the area of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] near Moorfields (where it still is to this day, occupying a site next to City Road). The ascent took place in front of 100,000 spectators as well as the then [[Prince of Wales]], [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Duke of Cornwall]]. The envelope of the balloon was made of oiled [[silk]], and had a diameter of 33&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (10&nbsp;[[metre]]s) which resulted in a volume of 18,200&nbsp;[[cubic feet]] (515&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<U+00B3>]]). Due to the size of the balloon, it took all of the previous evening and early morning to fill it. Lunardi first landed at [[Welham Green]] (North Mymms), [[Hertfordshire]], 13&nbsp;[[mile]]s (21&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) north of [[London]] (where the landing is commemorated with a stone, at a location now known as Balloon Corner) and then continued his flight to land at [[Ware]], [[Hertfordshire]] after flying a total of 24&nbsp;miles.

==Moorgate Street and neighbourhood==
[[Image:MoorHouse.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Moorhouse (building)|Moorhouse]]]]
The contemporary dual carriage street of Moorgate runs north from [[Princes Street]] and [[Lothbury]] near the location of the [[Bank of England]], past London Wall and the location of the old gate, and then continues north. It is located inside the [[London EC2]] postal district. After leaving the [[City of London]] in the direction of the [[London Borough of Islington|Borough of Islington]], the street is known as [[Finsbury Pavement]], which at one time was known as Moor Fields Pavement, and then City Road. The street was constructed around 1846 as one of the new approaches to [[London Bridge]]. While the street was formally known as "Moorgate Street", the street part of the name eventually fell out of use. 

The street is lined with offices of several major [[commercial bank]]s and [[investment bank]]s. A new commercial development on Moorgate, known as [[Moorhouse (building)|Moorhouse]], is scheduled to open in 2005. The building is located at the corner of Moorgate and London Wall, and was designed by [[Foster and Partners]]. The building has 28,000&nbsp;[[m<U+00B2>]] of office space in 19 storeys, and is built in the location of a smaller office building built in the 1960s known as Moor House. The building incorporates part of [[Crossrail]]'s new station and ticket hall serving Liverpool Street and Moorgate.

There is a campus of the [[London Metropolitan University]], formerly a part of the [[London Guildhall University]], on Moorgate. The campus houses its business school, a [[library]], and other administrative facilities. There is a small side street to the east off of Moorgate, known as Moorgate Place. It now connects to another side street known as Swan Alley, in turn connecting to Moorgate. The side street is the location of the Chartered Accountants' Hall, home of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]],

The [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is connected to [[Moorgate station]] via Bassishaw Highwalk. The Guildhall is the home of the [[Corporation of London]] and the centre of City government since the [[Middle Ages]]. Adjacent and internally connected to the Guildhall is the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]], which houses the art collection of the City of London. It occupies a stone building in a semi-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style which was completed in 1999 to replace an earlier building destroyed in 1941.

Finsbury Circus, an oval-shaped [[circus]], branches east out of Moorgate, sitting on the site of the old Bethlem Hospital and part of Moorfields. The gardens in the centre of the circus occupy a 5,000 square metre (1.2&nbsp;[[acre]]s) plot enclosed by railings, and include the immaculate lawn of the City of London Bowls Club.  Built in 1814, it is unusual amongst London's [[Town square|square]]s in being [[ellipse|elliptical]], with the [[major axis]] oriented west-east. According to the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]], the garden is [[listed building|Grade II listed]]. 

The London branch of the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi]] is located at 12-15 Finsbury Circus. [[BP]]'s headquarters were previously at 1 Finsbury Circus (it is now at 1 [[St. James' Square]]).

Moorgate is also the birthplace of [[John Keats]], one of the principal [[poetry|poets]] in the [[England|English]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement.  Keats was born in 1795 in the Swan and Hoop Inn at 199 Moorgate, where his father was an [[ostler]]. The pub is now called "The John Keats at Moorgate", having previously been known as "The Moorgate Coffee House" and "The Moorgate", only a few yards from Moorgate station.
