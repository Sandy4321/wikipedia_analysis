The '''Lufthansa heist''' was a robbery at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] on December 11, 1978. An estimated $5 million in cash and $875,000 in jewels were stolen, at the time making it the largest cash robbery ever committed on American soil.<ref name="NYTDec14">{{cite news |first= Leslie |last=Maitland  |title=Airport Cash Loot Was $5 Million; Bandits' Van Is Found in Canarsie |url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20715FD355413728DDDAD0994DA415B888BF1D3 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |page=A1 |date=December 14, 1978 |accessdate=26 August 2009 }}</ref>  This robbery was the subject of two television films, ''The 10 Million Dollar Getaway'' and ''[[The Big Heist]]'', and is a key plot element in the 1990 film ''[[Goodfellas]]''.

==Planning and execution==
As investigators later determined, the crime was planned by [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]], an associate of the [[Lucchese crime family]], and carried out by several of his associates. The plot began when bookmaker [[Martin Krugman]] told [[Henry Hill (mobster)|Henry Hill]] (an associate of Jimmy Burke's) about millions of dollars in untraceable money: American currency flown in once a month from monetary exchanges for servicemen and tourists in [[West Germany]]. After arriving via [[Lufthansa]], the currency was then stored in a vault at Kennedy Airport. The information had come from [[Louis Werner]], a worker at the airport who owed Krugman $20,000 in gambling debts, and from his co-worker [[Peter Gruenwald]].<ref name="Wiseguy"/>  Werner and Gruenwald had previously been successful in stealing $22,000 in foreign currency from their employer, Lufthansa, in 1976.

Louis Werner helped Krugman throughout the planning, even telling him where the robbers should park.  A Ford Econoline 150 van would be used to transport the cash, and a "crash car" would accompany the van to run vehicular interference should the plot be interrupted and a chase ensue.   Burke decided on [[Tommy DeSimone]], [[Joe Civitello, Sr.]], [[Louis Cafora]], and [[Angelo Sepe]] and Sepe's ex-[[brother-in-law]], [[Tony Rodriguez]], as inside gunmen. [[Paolo LiCastri]], a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] shooter, was later included as a representative of the [[Gambino crime family]], which had been promised a tribute payment to sanction the crime.  [[Parnell Edwards|Parnell 'Stacks' Edwards]], an African American associate of Burke's gang who served as a "gofer" and chauffeur was also included to dispose of the van used in the heist.<ref>{{cite web

Once everyone was together, Jimmy told Lucchese family Underboss [[Paul Vario]], who sent his son, Peter, to collect his 'end' of the loot. Vinne Asaro, who was the Gambino family's crew chief at the airport, would also be owed money because Burke, a Lucchese associate, was performing the robbery on territory belonging to the Gambino family.

On December 11, at 3:12 a.m., cargo agent Kerry Whalen, returning from making a transfer,  spotted a black [[Ford]] [[Econoline]] van pulling into a bay near a loading platform for vaults. When Whalen walked toward the loading bay to investigate, he was struck over the head with a .45 pistol. Whalen saw a series of armed men running into the cargo terminal and then another man took his wallet and said that they knew where his family was and that they had men ready to visit them. Whalen nodded to indicate that he would co-operate with the robbers.
 
Senior agent Rolf Rebmann heard a noise by the loading ramp, and when he went to investigate, six armed, masked men forced their way in and handcuffed him. They then used a one-of-a-kind key from Werner and walked through a maze of corridors to where the two other employees would be. Once these two men had been rounded up, two gunmen ventured downstairs to look for unexpected visitors. The other men marched the employees to a lunch room, where the other employees were on a 3 a.m. break.<ref name="Wiseguy"/> 

The gunmen burst into the lunch room; brandishing their firearms, they showed a bloodied Whalen as an indication of their intentions if anyone got out of line. They knew each employee by name and forced them onto the ground. They made John Murray, the terminal's senior cargo agent, call Rudi Eirich on the intercom. The robbers knew that Eirich was the only guard that night who knew the right combination to open the double door vault. Murray was made to pretend to Eirich that there was a problem with a load from [[Frankfurt]] and told Eirich to meet him in the cafeteria. As Eirich approached the cafe he was met by two shotguns and he saw the other employees bound and gagged on the cafeteria floor. One gunman kept watch over the ten employees and the other three took Eirich at gun point down two flights of stairs to the double door vault. 

Eirich later reported that the men were informed and knew all about the safety systems in the vault, including the double door system, whereby one door must be shut in order for the other one to be opened without activating the alarm. The men ordered Eirich to open up the first door, to a 10-by-20 foot room. They knew that if he opened the second door he would activate an alarm to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], which maintained a police force at the airport. Once inside, they ordered Eirich to lie on the ground and began sifting through invoices and freight manifests to determine which parcels they wanted from among the many similarly wrapped ones. 

Finally, they began hurling parcels of cash through the door. Around 40 parcels were removed. Eirich was then made to lock the inner door before unlocking the outer door. Two of the gunmen were assigned to load the parcels into the van while the others tied up Eirich.  The employees were told not to call the Port Authority until 4:30 a.m. When the men left it was 4:16 a.m. According to the cafeteria clock no calls were made until 4:30, when a report of the theft was made. The robbery took only 64 minutes and was the largest cash robbery ever committed on American soil at the time.

==Investigation==
Driver [[Parnell Edwards|Parnell "Stacks" Edwards]] was supposed to take the van used in the burglary to a car compactor to have it destroyed; instead, jubilant from the gang's easy heist, he got high on [[marijuana]] while en route to the junkyard, drove the van to his girlfriend's apartment, conspicuously parked it in a no-parking zone, and spent the evening getting drunk and snorting [[cocaine]], apparently intending to deliver the van to the junkyard the next day.

The next day, while Edwards was still asleep in his girlfriend's apartment, the van was discovered by the police and quickly identified as the vehicle used in the burglary.<ref name="NYTDec14"/> Edwards himself successfully fled the complex without being apprehended. His finger prints were later found on the wheel of the vehicle, and a muddy shoe print found at the airport was matched to a pair of [[Puma AG|Puma]] tennis shoes Edwards owned. 

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] had two suggestions of who led the heist, the [[John Gotti]] crew or the [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]] crew, and within 3 days since the robbery, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] knew it was the [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]] crew. The [[FBI]] set up surveillance of the Burke crew, following them in helicopters and installing listening devices in their vehicles. According to Henry Hill, Jimmy Burke became paranoid and agitated once he realized how much heat Edwards' failure had drawn, and resolved to kill anyone who could implicate him in the heist, starting with Edwards.

With the violent deaths of most of the heist associates and planners, there was little evidence and few witnesses to the involvement of Burke or his crew in the execution of the heist.  The authorities were able to gather enough evidence to prosecute inside man [[Louis Werner]] for helping to plan the heist.

The stolen cash and jewelry were never recovered.

==Violent deaths of heist associates==
Edwards was shot to death in his apartment on December 18, 1978 by Tommy DeSimone and Angelo Sepe at the request of Jimmy Burke after his failure to properly dispose of the truck was discovered.<ref name="Wiseguy"/> This was the first in a series of players, or their acquaintances, who were murdered after the heist at Burke's orders:<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/gang/heist/1.html|title = All about the Lufthansa Heist|accessdate = 2007-10-29|author = May, Allan|publisher = CrimeLibrary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/lucchese2/1.html|title = Lucchese Crime Family Epic: Descent into Darkness Part II|accessdate = 2007-10-29|author = Jones, Thomas L.|publisher = CrimeLibrary.com|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071001000613/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/lucchese2/1.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate = 2007-10-01}}</ref>
