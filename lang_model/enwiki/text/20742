'''Maria Torribia''' (d. ~1175) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] peasant woman who is believed to have married [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore]].  She herself was eventually [[beatified]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and is known in Spain as '''Santa Mar<U+00ED>a de la Cabeza''' (in [[English language|English]], "'''Saint Mary of the Head'''").

Torribia is believed to have been born in [[Uceda]], in the Spanish province of [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]].  She subsequently lived in [[Torrelaguna]], in [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid Province]], close to [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]].  There, she met and married Isidore, a simple farmer from [[Madrid]] (who, according to some sources, had fled there as a result of the [[Almoravids|Almoravid]] invasion),<ref>[http://www.archimadrid.es/jesusmedinaceli/sanisidro.htm Vida De San Isidro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with whom she would have her only son.  According to legend, the child one day fell down a deep well, leaving the parents with no recourse but prayer.  Miraculously, the water level suddenly rose to the level of the ground, and the floating baby was easily rescued unharmed.  As a result of this, she and her husband committed themselves to sexual abstinence as a form of devotion, and, from that time on, lived in different homes.  However, their son would later die in childhood.

Torribia substantially outlived her husband, who died in 1130.  After his death, she lived as a hermit, performed miracles, and had visions.  For instance, legend suggests that every night she dreamed of the [[Virgin Mary]], who would cross the [[Jarama|Jarama River]] while extending her pure cloak over the waters.

==Veneration==
It appears that her remains were officially transferred to Torrelaguna in 1615, more than 400 years after her estimated death between 1175 and 1180.  She was beatified by [[Pope Innocent XII]] on August 11, 1697.  The somewhat unusual title "Santa Mar<U+00ED>a de la Cabeza" is derived from the most prominent [[relic]] associated with Torribia, a head said to be her own.  This relic is often used in processions, and is traditionally an intercessory tool for the relief of drought {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  Revered by farm workers throughout the Catholic world, she shares a feast day with her husband (May 15), while also having her own on September 9.
