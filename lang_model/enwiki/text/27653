=== Hip hop birthplace ===
1520 Sedgwick Avenue has been called "an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] and hard along the [[Major Deegan Expressway]]." As hip hop grew from throughout the Bronx, 1520 was a starting point where Clive Campbell, later known as [[DJ Kool Herc]], presided over parties in the community room at a pivotal point in the genre's history.<ref>David Gonzalez, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/nyregion/21citywide.html "Will Gentrification Spoil the Birthplace of Hip-Hop?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref><ref>Jennifer Lee, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/tenants-might-buy-the-birthplace-of-hip-hop "Tenants Might Buy the Birthplace of Hip-Hop"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 15, 2008, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>

==== August 11, 1973 ====
On August 11, 1973, Clive Campbell DJed for his sister Cindy's back-to-school party in the recreation center at 1520 Sedgwick. After spending months perfecting a new technique involving "playing the frantic grooves at the beginning or in the middle of the song" with two turntables, a mixer, and two copies of the same record, Campbell unveiled the technique at his sister's party. After renting the recreation room for US$25, Cindy charged 25 cents for females and 50 cents for males to attend. "I wrote out the invites on index cards, so all Herc had to do was show up. With the party set from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., our mom served snacks and dad picked up the sodas and beer from a local beverage warehouse." With the exhibition of his new style, Campbell's friend [[Coke La Rock]] demonstrated another innovation called [[rapping]]. Attendees, or people who later claimed to be there, include [[Grandmaster Caz]], leader of the [[Cold Crush Brothers]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Busy Bee]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Sheri Sher]], [[Mean Gene]], [[Red Alert]], and [[KRS-One]].<ref>Gonzales, M.

=== Ownership and maintenance ===
Starting in the early 2000s, building owners threatened to turn 1520 into high rent units. Senator Schumer led a rally in 2007 focused on maintaining the affordable costs of the housing in order to maintain its working class roots.<ref>Wellborn, M. (July 23, 2007) [http://www.observer.com/2007/birthplace-hip-hop-danger-losing-affordable-housing-label "Schumer to Lead Rally to Keep Birthplace of Hip Hop Affordable"], "The Observer." Retrieved 9/4/10.</ref> The [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] recognized the building as the "birthplace of hip hop" on July 5, 2007.<ref name="xxlmag.com"/>

Starting in 2007 the building's owners sought to repeal the status afforded to the building by the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]], which allowed it to maintain [[rent control]] for low-income and working class residents. Despite work by groups such as the [[Urban Homesteading Assistance Board]] and the Tenants and Neighbors Association to preserve the building<U+2019>s Mitchell-Lama status,<ref name="cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com"/> the courts allowed the building's status to be repealed.<ref>Lee, J. (September 26, 2008) [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/judge-rules-sale-of-bronx-hip-hop-building-can-proceed/ "Court Rules Sale of Bronx <U+2018>Hip-Hop<U+2019> Building Can Proceed"], ''New York Time''. Retrieved 9/4/10.</ref> In 2008 the building was sold to a real estate group that included [[Mark Karasick]], a prominent real estate investor, which intended to turn the building into market-rate housing. However, after the [[United States housing bubble]] burst a period of neglect and threats of forced evictions daunted residents,<ref name="Dolnick, S">Dolnick, S.</ref> and despite promises to the opposite, the building fell into decline.<ref>[http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/01/19/nyregion/1247466533739/a-building-in-decline.html?ref=foreclosures "A Building in Decline"], ''New York Times.'' Retrieved 9/4/10.</ref> 

In 2010 [[Government of New York City|the city's]] [[Housing Development Fund Corporation (HDFC)|Housing Development Corporation]] provided a $5.6 million loan to allow [[Winn Development]] and a new group called Workforce Housing Advisors to buy the building<U+2019>s mortgage from [[Sovereign Bank]] for $6.2 million. [[Rafael E. Cestero]], the commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]], said they supported the sale in order to help provide sustainable housing for working-class families.<ref name="Dolnick, S"/>

On November 7, 2011 following a foreclosure auction with no active bidders, Workforce Housing Advisors were able to take title of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Several residents, who were present at the auction along with tenant advocacy group [http://www.uhab.org Urban Homesteading Assistance Board], wept with joy when the auctioneer announced no bids had been registered.  

John Crotty of Workforce Housing Advisors told the [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/for-birthplace-of-hip-hop-new-life/ New York Times] that his group intends to renovate the distressed building and work with tenants to recognize its importance. The group<U+2019>s investors are more interested in steady, secure returns than in making money quickly. 
 
Some money for renovations will be provided by New York City<U+2019>s department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the Housing Development Corporation. The new owner intends to pursue a listing for on the National Register of Historic Places, for which the building was deemed eligible in 2007 but former owner Mark Karasick declined to accept. 

The new ownership of 1520 Sedgwick is seen by public officials and housing advocates as a huge victory in the struggle to preserve affordable housing in New York City. It is a big step forward in the fight to rescue low income housing from the disastrous impact overleveraging has had on this vulnerable resource. The rescue of 1520 Sedgwick was largely made possible through a sustained organizing campaign within the tenant body. Residents of this iconic building fought for over 5 years to maintain the affordability of their home and rescue it from speculative landlords.  Their story is told at [http://thesurrealestate.org/2011/11/07/the-birthplace-of-hip-hop-reborn-at-last/ The Surreal Estate].
