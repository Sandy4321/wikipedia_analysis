'''Infanterie-Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' (mot)'''<br>
'''Panzergrenadier-Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'''''<br>
'''Panzer-Korps ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'''''<br>

The ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' [[Division (military)|Division]] (lit. Greater Germany Division) was an <U+00E9>lite [[Germany|German]] [[German Army|Heer]] combat unit which saw action during [[World War II]]. 

Gro<U+00DF>deutschland is sometimes mistakenly perceived as being a part of the [[Waffen-SS]], whereas it was actually a [[German Army|Heer]] unit. It was, along with the [[German Panzer Lehr Division|Panzer Lehr Division]], the best equipped unit in the [[Wehrmacht]], receiving equipment before all other units (including Waffen-SS units). The ''GD'' Division served exclusively on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It was annihilated near [[Pillau]] in May [[1945]].

==Early History - Wachregiment Berlin==
[[Image:Gddivpen.gif|left]]The roots of the Division can be traced to 1921, and the formation of the initial guard units in Berlin that would become [[Infantry Regiment Gro<U+00DF>deutschland]].  The Regiment saw action in France in 1940, and was attached to Panzer Group 2 in the opening phases of Barbarossa, being all but annihilated in the fighting outside of Moscow in late 1941. On the last day of February 1942, Rifle Battalion GD (all that was left of the original Regiment) was disbanded and two battalions formed a new GD Regiment out of reinforcements arriving from Neuruppin. The Regiment moved to Orel after a period in the front line, and on 1 Apr 1942, arising out of the need for new motorized formations for the summer offensives of 1942, an announcement was made at a regimental parade at Rjetschiza:

:"Effective immediately the former [[Infantry Regiment Gro<U+00DF>deutschland]] is expanded to the Infantry Division Gro<U+00DF>deutschland."{{ref|lineage}}

==Infantry Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' 1942==
[[Image:Gdmap1942.gif|right|thumb|350px|Map courtesy of [http://www.deutschesoldaten.com deutschesoldaten.com].]]
While resting and refitting near Orel, the [[Infantry Regiment Gro<U+00DF>deutschland]] reorganized and expanded to become '''Infanterie-Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' (mot)'''. The existing Regiment became  Infanterie-Regiment ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland 1'', and was joined by the newly formed Infanterie-Regiment ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland 2''.  Supporting units in the form of a [[Panzer]] battalion, an [[assault gun]] battalion and increased [[flak]], [[artillery]] and [[engineers]] were added with the upgrade to divisional status.

After the reorganization, the ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' Division was assigned to [[German XLVIII Panzer Corps|XLVIII.Panzerkorps]] during the opening phases of [[Fall Blau]], the assault on [[Stalingrad]]. The division took part in the successful attacks to cross the upper [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] and to capture [[Voronezh]]. In August, the division was pulled back to the north bank of the [[Donets]] and held as a mobile reserve and ''fire-brigade'' counterattack force. After the Soviet [[Operation Uranus]], the Division was involved in heavy winter fighting near [[Rzhev]]. The exhausted division then took part in ''Generaloberst'' [[Erich von Manstein]]<U+2019>s abortive [[Operation Wintergewitter]], the operation to relieve Stalingrad.

===Kharkov===
In January-February 1943, ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' and XLVIII.Panzerkorps, along with the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] took part in the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]]. The division fought alongside the [[Leibstandarte|1.SS Division ''Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler'']], [[SS Division Das Reich|2.SS Division ''Das Reich'']] and [[SS Division Totenkopf|3.SS Division ''Totenkopf'']] during these battles. After the fall of Kharkov, the ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' was again pulled back and refitted. At this time, the division was equipped with a company of [[Tiger tank|Tiger 1]]s, an unusual addition making GD the only Panzergrenadier division to have its own heavy tanks, and the only non-Waffen SS division at that time to have its own Tigers (they were normally deployed in independent heavy tank battalions).

==Panzergrenadier Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland''==
In June 1943, with the addition of armoured personnel carriers and Tigers the division was redesignated '''Panzergrenadier-Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland''''', though in reality it now had more armoured vehicles than most full scale panzer divisions.

[[Image:GD Tiger1.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A Tiger I of the 10./III.Abteilung of the "Gro<U+00DF>deutschland" Panzer Regiment. Karachev, 1943.]]

===Kursk===
The newly re-equipped division was attached to the [[German Fourth Panzer Army|4.Panzer-Armee]] of ''Generaloberst'' [[Hermann Hoth]], and was to take a major role (again paired with the SS-Panzerkorps) in [[Operation Citadel]], the battles to sever the [[Kursk]] salient. During the buildup period, a battalion of new [[Panther tank|Panther Ausf. D]] tanks came under the operational control of ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland''. After the launch of Citadel, the division was heavily engaged in the fight to penetrate the southern flank of the salient. The new Panthers were plagued by technical problems, suffering from engine fires and mechanical breakdowns, many before reaching the battle. The division fought on until it was pulled back to [[Tomarovka]] on 18 July 1943.

===Defensive battles===

After the cancelled Kursk offensive, the division was transferred back to Heeresgruppe Mitte, and resumed its role as mobile reserve.  The Tiger tank company was expanded to an entire battalion, becoming the III. Bataillon of the Panzer Regiment.  GD saw heavy fighting around [[Karachev]] before being transferred back to [[XLVIII Panzerkorps]] in late August. For the rest of 1943, ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' was engaged in the fighting withdrawal from the eastern Ukraine, taking part in battles around Kharkov, [[Belgorod]], and finally on the [[Dnieper]], ending the year fighting strong enemy forces near [[Michurin-Rog]], east of [[Krivoi-Rog]].  It was during this period that the division earned the nickname ''"die Feuerwehr"'' (The Fire Brigade).

==1944==
[[Image:Gdmapretreat.gif|frame|center|Grossdeutschland's Retreat - 1944.]]
[[Image:Gdmaptargul.gif|right|350px]]
''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' continued fighting in the area of Krivoi-Rog early in January 1944 until it was transferred west for rest and refit. During this period, 1./Panzer Regiment 26 (Panther) joined the Panzer Regiment GD, and GD's I. Bataillon moved to France to refit and train with the new tanks; they did not rejoin the Division until after the [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]. 

Over the next months, the division continued moving from crisis-point to crisis-point across the front. Panzer Regiment ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' saw action in the battles to relieve the [[Cherkassy pocket]] in late January 1944 while the rest of the division was involved in heavy fighting from the [[Dniester]] to Northern [[Bessarabia]].  On 4 March 1944 the First, Second and Third Ukrainian Fronts launched a major attack on the north, central and southern flanks of Army Group South, and GD moved to Kirovgrad, bolstering weak parts of the line until withdrawn to Rovnoye to the southwest. On 16 March the division began the move to the Dniester River, and by the end of March had entered Romania.

In April 1944, GD. as a part of [[German LVII Panzer Corps|LVII.Panzerkorps]]. fought defensive battles near [[Jassy]], slowly retreating to T<U+00E2>rgul Frumos in Bessarabia. Fighting for the town raged for over a month.  A renewed Soviet offensive began on 2 May, aimed at breaking through GD and onto the Romanian oil fields. The defensive action at the [[Battle of T<U+00E2>rgul Frumos]] was the focus of several [[NATO]] studies during the [[Cold War]].

In mid May, the infantry and reconnaissance components of the division were equipped with [[SdKfz_251|Sch<U+00FC>tzenpanzerwagen]] and other armoured vehicles. The F<U+00FC>silier regiments were downsized from four battalions to three. The division was then sent back to the front, where it was involved in the fighting around Podul. After a brief rest in early July, the division was again committed to heavy fighting in northern [[Romania]].

[[Image:SPW GD Fus Reg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Sd.Kfz 251/1s of Grenadierregiment-2 ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' in Northern Bessarabia, June 1944]]

In late July, the division was transferred to [[East Prussia]]. Over the next months, ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' was involved in heavy fighting in both East Prussia and the [[Baltic States]], suffering immense casualties in both men and materiel. The division was virtually annihilated during the battles in the [[Memel]] bridgehead.

==Panzerkorps "Gro<U+00DF>deutschland"==

In November 1944, while the division retained its status as a Panzergrenadier division, several attached units were expanded to divisional status, and the '''Panzerkorps ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland''''' was formed. 

The Corps was made up primarily of two Divisions - ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' and the [[Brandenburgers|''Brandenburg'' Division]], which had a lineage which was strongly linked to the ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland''. 

By March 1945, the Panzergrenadier Division ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' had been reduced to around 4,000 men. These escaped by ferry from the collapsing Memel bridgehead. They landed at [[Pillau]] and were put straight back into combat. By 25 April 1945, the division ceased to exist, having been completely destroyed in the battles around Pillau.  Of the few survivors a few hundred were able to make their way to [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and surrendered to British forces.  The majority of the men were left behind and were forced to surrender to the Russians where they were to face an often fatal and indefinite amount of time in Russian Forced Labor Camps  ([[Gulags]]).

Panzergrenadier Division ''Kurmark'' had been created out of ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' remnants in early 1945 and had fought throughout the last months of the war.  Men of both the Brandenburg and Kurmark units were entitled to wear ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' insignia.

As a celebration of their elite status, the ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' was permitted to wear unique insignia. An intertwined GD was displayed on the shoulder straps, and a [[cuff title]], of the type granted to Waffen-SS units, was also distributed. Some examples of the green cuff title worn by [[Infantry Regiment Gro<U+00DF>deutschland]] were still seen late in the war, but the most common title was the pattern introduced in 1940, with [[S<U+00FC>tterlin|S<U+00FC>tterlin script]] on a black backing.  All divisional elements were granted this cuff title. As an Army formation, ''Gro<U+00DF>deutschland'' was ordered to wear their cuff title on the right sleeve, since the SS wore theirs on the left.

==Personal Accounts==
The unit became known in the West through the book [[The Forgotten Soldier]], by the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] veteran [[Guy Sajer]] (a pseudonym), who served as a volunteer. The book was first published in 1967 in France as ''Le Soldat Oubli<U+00E9>''. While the historical accuracy of Sajer's autobiographical work has been questioned, it nevertheless offers a vivid and moving account of the horrors of war on the Eastern Front. A more recent account was written by Alfred Nowotny, entitled ''The Good Soldier'', which focuses on both his experiences in Panzerf<U+00FC>silier Regiment GD from 1944, but also his captivity in the Soviet Union after the German surrender.

====Divisional Escort Company====
On formation of GD as a Panzergrenadier Division, a 219 man Divisional Escort Company was added to Divisional headquarters.  Modelled after the escort companies of Waffen SS Divisions, this unit was intended to guard divisional headquarters, serve as a mobile reserve, and was in essence a small battle group suited to all operational circumstances. It included, according to varying sources, some or all of the following:  
*rifle platoon
*motorcycle platoon
*heavy machinegun/mortar platoon
*infantry gun Platoon
*heavy Anti-tank platoon
*self-propelled FlaK Platoon
*mixed Anti-Tank (Panzerj<U+00E4>ger) platoon.
====Feldgendarmerie (Military Police)====
[[Image:Gdmilitarypolice.png|right]] 
Military Police Troop - Numbering one platoon of men, the Military Police detachment (recruited like the rest of the Army's MPs from civilian police) were equipped with light cars and motorcycles.   Almost all military policemen not holding officer rank were NCOs (Unteroffizier or higher) excepting some drivers, in order to provide authority for their duties - including maintenance of discipline, but most importantly collection of prisoners and traffic control duties.  GD had several hundred motorized vehicles which had to be moved over great distances both rapidly and efficiently.

====Kriegsberichter (War Correspondent Platoon)====
[[Image:Gdwarco.png|right]] 
Responsible for recruitment and propaganda literature. GD was fairly unique in having its own correspondents permanently assigned to the division.

==War Crimes==
[[Image:Pancevo.jpg|thumb|right|350px|GD officer gives the ''[[Coup de gr<U+00E2>ce]]'' to executed civilians, Pancevo, 1941.]]
The book ''German Army and Genocide'' (ISBN 1565845250) mentions the following incident, from the invasion of Yugoslavia:

:''When one German soldier was shot and one seriously wounded in Pancevo, Wehrmacht soldiers and the Waffen SS rounded up about 100 civilians at random...the town commander, Lt. Col. Fritz Bandelow conducted the Court's Martial...The presiding judge, SS-Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer Rudolf Hoffmann sentenced 36 of those arrested to death. On April 21, 1941, four of the civilians were the first to be shot...On the following day eighteen victims were hanged in a cemetery and fourteen more were shot at the cemetery wall by an execution squad of the Wehrmacht's '''Grossdeutschland regiment'''.'' (Page 42)

Part of the photographic presentation for the book included the photo at right. The GD cuff title on the officer is clearly visible.  The official GD history by Helmuth Spaeter  mentions only that "Draconian measures were occasionally required to halt looting by the civilian population" in Belgrade.  The events of 21 April in Pancevo are not discussed directly, though many references are made to "security duties" in Yugoslavia.

The subject of Grossdeutschland's complicity in war crimes was the subject of the book by Omer Bartov ''The Eastern Front, 1941-45, German Troops, and the Barbarization of Warfare'' (1986, ISBN 0-312-22486-9).  The link, however, between GD's and atrocities is never fully realized.  A complete discussion is available at the [http://members.shaw.ca/grossdeutschland/crime.htm GD for CM website].
