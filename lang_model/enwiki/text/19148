The '''Sarus Crane''' (''Grus antigone'') is a large non-[[bird migration|migratory]] [[Crane (bird)|crane]] found in parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Australia]]. The tallest of the flying birds, standing at a height of up to 1.8&nbsp;m (5.9&nbsp;ft),<ref name=wood/> they are conspicuous and iconic<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vyas, Rakesh|title=Status of Sarus Crane ''Grus antigone antigone'' in Rajasthan and its ecological requirements|journal=Zoos' Print Journal|volume=17|year=2002|issue=2|pages=691<U+2013>695|url=http://www.zoosprint.org/ZooPrintJournal/2002/February/691-695.pdf}}</ref> species of open [[wetland]]s. The Sarus Crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by the overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on [[marsh]]es and shallow [[wetland]]s for [[root]]s, [[tuber]]s, insects, [[crustacean]]s and small vertebrate [[prey]]. Like other cranes, they form long-lasting [[Pair bond|pair-bonds]] and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship [[Display (zoology)|displays]] that include loud trumpeting, leaps and dance-like movements. In India they are considered symbols of marital [[fidelity]], believed to mate for life and pine the loss of their mates even to the point of starving to death. The main breeding season is during the [[wet season|rainy season]], when the pair builds an enormous nest "island", a circular platform of reeds and [[grass]]es nearly two metres in diameter and high enough to stay above the shallow water surrounding it. Sarus Crane numbers have declined greatly in the last century and it has been estimated that the current population is a tenth or less (perhaps 2.5%) of the numbers that existed in the 1850s. The stronghold of the species is [[India]], where it is traditionally revered and lives in agricultural lands in close proximity to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been [[extirpated]] in many parts of its former [[range (biology)|range]].

== Description ==
[[File:Sarus Crane I IMG 8628.jpg|thumb|left|In flight the black primaries contrast with the grey ([[Bharatpur, India]])]]
The adult Sarus Crane is very large with grey wings and body; a bare red head and part of the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed [[beak|bill]]. In flight, the long neck is held straight, unlike  that of an [[heron]], which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear [[Covert (feather)|covert]] patch, an orange-red [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a yellowish base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.<ref name=pcr/>

The bare red skin of the adult's head and neck is brighter during the breeding season. This skin is rough and covered by [[hair follicle|papillae]], and a narrow area around and behind the head is covered by black bristly [[feather]]s. The sexes do not differ in [[plumage]] although males are on average larger than females; male Sarus of the Indian population can attain a maximum height of about 180&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;ft) making them the world's tallest [[Extant taxon|extant]] flying bird. The weight of [[nominate race]] individuals is 6.8<U+2013>7.8&nbsp;kg (16&nbsp;lb), while five adult ''sharpii'' averaged 8.4&nbsp;kg (18.5&nbsp;lb). Across the distribution range, the weight can vary from 5 to 12&nbsp;kg (11<U+2013>26&nbsp;lbs), height typically from 115 to 167&nbsp;cm (45<U+2013>69&nbsp;in) and the wingspan from 220 to 250&nbsp;cm (87<U+2013>100&nbsp;in).<ref name=johnsgard/> Birds from Australia tend to be smaller than birds from the north.<ref name=jones/>

In [[Australia]], the Sarus can easily be mistaken for the more widespread [[Brolga]]. The Brolga has the red colouring confined to the head and not extending into the neck.<ref name=johnsgard/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The species has historically been widely distributed on the lowlands of India along the [[Ganges|Gangetic]] plains, extending south to the [[Godavari River]], west to coastal [[Gujarat]], the [[Tharparkar District]] of [[Pakistan]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Rec.

 In the semi-arid regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan, flocks favour reservoirs and other perennial wetlands to roost. Flock size tends to increase as extent of wetlands reduces on the landscape even in less dry areas like the Gangetic flood-plains suggesting that wetlands are preferred habitats for Sarus Cranes.{{cn|date=November 2010}} the available citation is an unpublished report

==Taxonomy and systematics==
[[File:GrusAntigoneClaw.jpg|thumb|left|All cranes have a raised and much reduced hind toe.]]
This species was described by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758 and placed in the genus ''Ardea'' that included the larger herons.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gmelin, JF|year=1788|title=Systema Naturae|edition=13|volume=1|part=2|page=622| url=http://www.archive.org/stream/carolilinnsy01linn#page/622/mode/1up/}}</ref> [[Edward Blyth]] published a [[monograph]] on the cranes in 1881 in which he considered the "Sarus Crane" of India to be made up of two species, ''Grus collaris'' and ''Grus antigone''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924000102149#page/n71/mode/2up/ |pages=45<U+2013>51|title= The natural history of the cranes | author= Blyth, Edward | year=1881 | authorlink =Edward Blyth| publisher=R H Porter}}</ref> Most modern authors recognise one species with three disjunct populations that have been treated as subspecies, although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain. The [[Nominate_subspecies#Nominate_subspecies|nominate subspecies]] from India is the largest, and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by [[race (biology)|race]] ''sharpii'' that extends into the Southeast Asian islands. The [[nominate race|nominate]] form from the [[Indian subcontinent]] is well marked and differentiated by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary [[remiges]]. Some authors consider ''antigone'' and ''sharpii'' as representatives of a formerly continuous population that varied [[cline (biology)|clinally]].<ref name=jones/> The race in Australia, initially placed in ''sharpii'' (sometimes spelt ''sharpei'' but amended to conform to the rules of [[Latin grammar]]<ref name=pcr>{{cite book|author=Rasmussen, PC & JC Anderton |year=2005| title= Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide|volume=2 |publisher= Smithsonian Institution and Lynx Edicions|pages=138<U+2013>139}}</ref>) has been separated and named as the race ''gilliae'' (sometimes spelt ''gillae'' or even ''gilli''). The Australian race was designated only in 1988, with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1969 and regarded as a recent immigrant. Native Australians, however, differentiated the Sarus and the Brolga and called the Sarus "the crane that dips its head in blood". The Australian race has a distinctively darker [[plumage]] and a larger grey patch of ear coverts.<ref group=note>Meine & Archibald (1996) p. 126</ref> This race is the most recently diverged with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia.<ref name=wood/> An additional subspecies ''luzonica'' has been suggested for the population once found, but now extinct, in the Philippines. It may be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with either ''gilliae'' or ''sharpii''.<ref name=meine>{{cite book|year=1996|title=The cranes: Status survey and conservation action plan|publisher=IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=2831703263|author=Meine, Curt D. and George W.

===Etymology===
The [[common name]] of ''sarus'' is from the [[Hindi]] name ("s<U+0101>ras") for the species. The Hindi word is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''sarasa'' for the "lake bird", (sometimes corrupted to  ''s<U+0101>rhans''). While Indians held the species in veneration, British soldiers in colonial India hunted the bird, calling it the ''serious''<ref>{{cite book|author=Yule, Henry, Sir. |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Unlike many other cranes that make long [[bird migration|migration]]s, the Sarus Crane is largely non-migratory; it may however make short-distance movements in response to rain or dry weather conditions. The only migratory population is in South-east Asia.<ref name="sarusreview2"/> Breeding pairs maintain territories that are defended from other cranes using a large repertoire of calls and displays. Non-breeding birds occur as flocks of various sizes that vary from 1<U+2013>430 birds.<ref name="sarusreview"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Livesey,TR |year=1937|title=Sarus flocks|journal= J.

In areas with perennial water supply, like in the western plains of Uttar Pradesh, breeding pairs maintain perennial territories. The largest known flocks are from the 29&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> [[Keoladeo National Park]]<ref name=bharatpur/> <U+2013> as many as 430 birds, and from wetlands in Etawah and Mainpuri districts in Uttar Pradesh, ranging from 245<U+2013>412 birds. Flocks of over 100 birds are also regularly reported from Gujarat<ref>{{cite journal|author=Acharya,Hari Narayan G|year=1936|title=Sarus flocks|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume= 38|issue=4|page=831}}</ref> and Australia. During the breeding season, breeding pairs displace non-breeding birds from some wetland sites, and local populations can appear to decline.

They roost in shallow water, where they may be safe from some ground predators.<ref name=johnsgard/> Adult birds do not [[moult]] their [[feather]]s annually and replace them only once every two or three years.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hartert, Ernst & F Young|year=1928|title=Some observations on a pair of Sarus Cranes at Tring|journal=Novitates Zoologicae |volume=34|pages=75<U+2013>76|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/novitateszoologi34lond#page/74/mode/2up}}</ref>

===Feeding===
[[File:Saus Crane I IMG 8663.jpg|thumb|left|Foraging in marshland ([[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]])]]
Sarus Cranes forage in shallow water (usually with less than 30&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;ft) depth of water) or in fields, frequently probing in mud with their long bills. They are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], eating insects (especially grasshoppers), aquatic plants, fish (perhaps only in captivity<ref>{{cite journal|author=Law,SC|year=1930|title=Fish-eating habit of the Sarus Crane (''Antigone antigone'')|journal=J.

===Courtship and breeding===
[[File:SarusTrachea.jpg|thumb|The long coiled trachea that produces the trumpeting calls]]
Sarus Cranes have loud trumpeting calls. These calls are, as in other cranes, produced by the elongated [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] that form coils within the sternal region.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fitch, WT|year=1999|title=Acoustic exaggeration of size in birds via tracheal elongation: comparative and theoretical analyses|journal= J.
