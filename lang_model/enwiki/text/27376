[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-25.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Railway bridge on the Trans-Siberian across the [[Kama River]] near [[Perm]].]]
The '''Eurasian Land Bridge''', sometimes called the '''New Silk Road''', is a term used to describe the [[rail transport]] route for moving freight and/or passengers overland from [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] seaports in eastern [[Russia]] and [[mainland China]] to seaports in [[Europe]]. The route, a [[transcontinental railroad]] and [[Land bridge (rail)|rail land bridge]], comprises the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which runs through Russia and is sometimes called the [[Northern East West Freight Corridor|Northern East-West Corridor]] and the [[New Eurasian Land Bridge]] or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge, running through China and [[Kazakhstan]]. As of November 2007, about 1% of the $600 billion in goods shipped from Asia to Europe each year were delivered by inland transport routes.<ref>Berk.</ref>

Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects [[Moscow]] with Russian Pacific seaports such as [[Vladivostok]]. From the [[1960s]] until the early [[1990s]] the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several issues caused the use of the railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One issue is the railways of the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] (USSR) use a wider [[rail gauge]] than most of the rest of Europe and China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.

In 1990 China linked its rail system to the Trans-Siberian via [[Kazakhstan]].{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} China calls its uninterrupted rail link between the Chinese port city of [[Lianyungang]] and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in [[Central Asia]], including [[Iran]], but do not connect all the way to Europe through south Asia.

Proposed expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge includes construction of a railway across Kazakhstan that is the same gauge as Chinese railways, rail links to [[India]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], construction of a rail tunnel or bridge [[Bering Strait crossing|across]] the [[Bering Strait]] to connect the Trans-Siberian to the [[North America]]n rail system, and construction of a rail tunnel between [[Japan<U+2013>Korea Undersea Tunnel|Korea and Japan]]. The [[United Nations]] has proposed further expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge, including the [[Trans-Asian Railway]] project.

==Background==
[[File:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|right|Silk Road trading routes during the [[1st century]] [[Anno Domini|CE]].]]
Commercial traffic between Europe and Asia took place along the [[Silk Road]] from at least the 2nd millennium [[Common Era|BCE]]. The Silk Road was not a specific thoroughfare, but a general route used by traders to travel, much of it by land, between the two continents along the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s through Central Asia. The {{convert|5000|mi|km|-1}} long route was used to exchange goods, ideas and people primarily between China and India and the [[Mediterranean]] and helped create a single-world system of trade between the civilisations of Europe and Asia.<ref>Christian; <U+014C>tsuka, p. 42.</ref>

Exports from Asia transported along the Silk Road included fabrics, carpets, furs, weapons, utensils, metals, farm produce, livestock and slaves. Civilisations active in trading during the road's history included [[Scythia]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient]] and [[Byzantine Greece]], the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], [[Rouran]], [[Sogdiana]], [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Yuezhi]] and the [[Mongol Empire]].<ref>Christian.</ref>

Beginning in the [[5th century]] CE, new land routes between Asia and Europe developed further to the north, in the [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]. Many of these routes passed through [[Yugra]] and extended to the [[Baltic region]]. The [[Khazars]], [[Volga Bulgaria]], and the [[Rus' Khaganate]] were active in trading along the northern trade routes.<ref>Christian.</ref>

Traffic along the southern Silk Road routes greatly diminished with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the [[15th century]] and development of the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the [[16th century]]. By the [[18th century]], European influence on trade and new national boundaries severely restricted the movement of traders along all land routes between Europe and China, and overland trade between East Asia and Europe virtually disappeared.<ref>Christian; <U+014C>tsuka, p. 42.</ref>

== Trans-Siberian Railway ==
{{Main|Trans-Siberian Railway}}
The Trans-Siberian Railway and its various associated branches and supporting lines, completed in 1916, established the first rail connection between Europe and Asia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. The line, at {{convert|9200|km|mi|-1}}, is the longest rail line in the world.<ref>Rodrigue; Wehrfritz.</ref>

[[File:Map Trans-Siberian railway.png|thumb|left|Map of the Trans-Siberian (red) and Baikal-Amur (green) Railways]]
Currently, the Trans-Siberian connects the Russian Pacific ports of  [[Vladivostok]] and [[Nakhodka]] with Moscow. Rail links at Moscow allow passengers and freight to connect to train lines running further west into Europe. By making further transfers, passengers and freight can eventually reach [[Western Europe]]an seaports.<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref>  The Trans-Siberian also connects with [[North Korea]] (e.g. via [[Dandong]] in [[Northeastern China]], or directly at [[Khasan]] south of Vladivostok).<ref>Hisako Tsuji, p. 13</ref><ref>[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=89 Trans-Korean Main Line] (At the official [[Russian Railways]] site)</ref>

A fully electrified and double-tracked line, the Trans-Siberian Railway line is capable of transporting around 100 million tons of freight annually. The management believes that the line can handle up to 200,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] of containerized international transit freight per year.<ref>[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=87 Transsiberian Railway] (At the [[Russian Railways]] official site)</ref>

A more northerly east-west route across Siberia, parallel to the Trans-Siberian line and known as the [[Baykal-Amur Mainline]] was mostly completed in 1989. It terminates at the Pacific ports of [[Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai|Vanino]] and [[Sovetskaya Gavan]]. Although this line is comparatively little used (the management mentions 6 million tons of freight per year, not indicating the year), the management expects the line to be fully used in the foreseeable future for oil and copper ore export, and has  plans to double-track it.<ref>[http://eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=88 Baikal - Amur Main Line] (At the [[Russian Railways]] official site)</ref>

While the Trans-Siberian has always been used by the [[Russian Empire|Czarist]], [[Soviet]] and modern Russian government to project political power into their territories in Asia, in the 1960s it was opened by the USSR as an international trade route connecting the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] with Europe. Freight shipments on the Trans-Siberian, however, experienced increasing problems over time with dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of containers and geopolitical tension. As a result, use of the railway for international trade declined to almost zero by the 1990s.<ref>Rodrigue, <U+014C>tsuka, p. 49; Wehrfritz.</ref>

According to [[Hofstra University]], there is presently renewed interest in using the Trans-Siberian as a route across Asia to Europe. An advantage of the Trans-Siberian route over the China-Central Asian railway route (detailed below) is that trains must change bogies only once, at the borders of the former USSR.<ref><U+014C>tsuka, p. 49.</ref>  Also, the Trans-Siberian links directly to railways which ultimately connect, via [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] to the year-round ice-free port of [[Narvik]] in [[Norway]].  At Narvik, freight can be transshipped to ships to cross the [[Atlantic]] to [[North America]]. Total transit time between Vladivostok and [[New York City|New York]] using this route is reportedly 10 days.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Rail links from Russia also connect to [[Rotterdam]], but may encounter greater congestion along this route with resulting delays. The trade route between the east coast of North America and eastern Russia using the Trans-Siberian is often called the [[Northern East West Freight Corridor]].<ref>Rodrigue.</ref>

In an effort to attract use of the Trans-Siberian to transport goods from Japan, China, and Korea to Europe, in the mid-1990s Russia lowered tariffs on freight using the railway. As a result, freight volume over the rail line doubled in 1999 and 2000.<ref>Wehrfritz.</ref>

==China and the land bridge==
===Direct connections between Russia and China===
[[File:ManzhouliTracks.jpg|thumb|[[Manzhouli]], China's oldest and busiest rail gate to Russia]]
The original Moscow-Vladivostok route, completed in 1904, cut across China's [[Northeast China|northeastern provinces]], known in the west as [[Manchuria]]; the section of the railway located within China was known as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. While the more northerly Trans-Siberian route as we known it, located entirely on Russian soil, was completed in 1916, the former Chinese Eastern Railway route continues as an important connector between the two countries' railway networks.<ref name=cer>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1d5nd0j7/ Guide to the Photograph Album of the Chinese Eastern Railway]</ref>

The western border point ([[Zabaykalsk]]/[[Manchouli]]) and the line connecting it to the Trans-Siberian main line, are now being upgraded, with the goal of enabling the railway by 2010 to pass 30 freight trains in each direction across the border, each one up to 71 cars long. The cross-border freight volume at this rail crossing is expected to reach 25.5 million tons by 2010.<ref>[http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=98  <U+0417><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0436><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0437><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0434><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0433><U+0430>  | <U+0418><U+043D><U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0446><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442> "<U+042E><U+0436><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0445><U+043E><U+0434>"  | <U+041E><U+0431><U+0449><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0441><U+0432><U+0435><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F>] (Transbaikal Railway: The Southern Branch investment project: General information) (Not dated, but appear to be written ca. 2005) {{ru icon}}</ref> Besides  cargo (principally, Russian oil exported to China), this crossing sees a direct weekly passenger train, Moscow-Beijing, as well as some local passenger trains.<ref name=zabGauge>[http://zabzd.rzd.ru/isvp/public/zabzd?STRUCTURE_ID=93&layer_id=4069&refererLayerId=3307&id=102261 <U+0420><U+0435><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0443><U+043A><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0443><U+043D><U+043A><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043A><U+0438> <U+0432><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>: <U+0412> <U+043A><U+0440><U+0443><U+0433><U+043B><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443><U+0442><U+043E><U+0447><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C>  <U+0440><U+0435><U+0436><U+0438><U+043C><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0446><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0417><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A> <U+0417><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0436><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0437><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0434><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438> <U+0432><U+0435><U+0434><U+0435><U+0442><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0440><U+0435><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0443><U+043A><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0443><U+043D><U+043A><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043F><U+0430><U+0441><U+0441><U+0430><U+0436><U+0438><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0445> <U+0432><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>] ("Reconstruction of the bogie exchange facility: workers at Zabaykalsk Station of the Transbaikalian Railway are working round the clock, renovating the passenger railcar bogie exchange facility").

The third, little known and even less used, rail connection between Russia and China two countries was built farther south, between

===Russia to China via Mongolia===
The [[Trans-Mongolian Railway|Trans-Mongolian line]], connecting [[Ulan-Ude]] on the Trans-Siberian with China's [[Erenhot]] via the Mongolian capital [[Ulan Baator]], both serves as landlocked Mongolia's lifeline to the outside world, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and [[Beijing]]. This line's capacity, however, is limited by its being single-track.<ref>''Economist Intelligence Unit''; Hisako Tsuji, [http://www.erina.or.jp/en/Research/dp/pdf/0409e.pdf A competitive environment for linking the TSR & TKR].

===Kazakhstan to China===
[[File:20060426023243.jpg|thumb|right|Terminus of the Lanxin railway at [[Alataw Pass]] where the Chinese rail system connects with that of Kazakhstan at Dostyk.]]
While the USSR had long been connected with China via the rail links in [[Northeastern China]] and [[Mongolia]], since the 1950s plans existed to connect the two countries' rail networks at the [[Kazakhstan]]/[[Xinjiang]] border. The Soviets completed their line from Aktogay (a station on the [[Turksib]] in eastern Kazakhstan) to their border station Druzhba (now [[Dostyk]]), but the construction on the Chinese side stopped because of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s. In 1985 construction commenced on the [[Lanxin railway#The northern branch|Beijiang Railway]] to link the Chinese and Russian rail networks via Kazakhstan. The section between [[<U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi]] and [[Alashankou Railway Station|Alashankou]] was completed on September 16, 1990, linking the railway lines of the two countries at Dostyk. In July 1991 the first [[goods train]] travelled along the line from China to Kazakhstan's then-capital of [[Almaty]].<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref>  Because Kazakhstan was once a member of the USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, as well as the other Central Asian republics of [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 42<U+2013>43, 48.</ref>

From Kazakhstan, four major north-south railways connect with the Russian rail system.  Two connect with the Trans-Siberian Railway (the [[Turksib]] and the [[Shu, Kazakhstan|Shu]]-[[Astana]]-[[Petropavl]] meridional line) while the other two (the [[Trans-Aral Railway]], and the connection via [[Atyrau]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]) go directly to [[European Russia]]. These links to the Russian rail system are sometimes called the Eurasian Railway.<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 45<U+2013>46.</ref>

===Through service between China and Western Europe===
{{See also|Trans-Eurasia Logistics}}
In January 2008 China and [[Germany]] inaugurated a long distance freight train service between [[Beijing]] and [[Hamburg]]. Travelling a total of {{convert|10000|km|mi|-1}}, the train uses the China Railways and the [[Trans-Mongolian Railway|Trans-Mongolian line]] to travel from [[Xiangtan]] (in [[Hunan]] Province) to [[Ulan Bator]], where it then continues north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching the end of the Trans-Siberian at [[Moscow]] the train continues to Germany via rail links in [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the [[Fujitsu]] company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.<ref>Rodrigue; International Railway Journal; Underhill; Batbayar.</ref><ref>Jonas M. Helseth [http://balticstudies.utu.fi/master/thesisarchive/jonas_master_thesis.pdf The N.E.W. Corridor and the Northern Axis] (Master's Thesis, [[University of Turku]]). Page 31, and the map on p. 32.</ref>

[[Hartmut Mehdorn]], chairman of [[Deutsche Bahn]] (DB), stated in March 2008 that regularly scheduled, weekly China-Germany freight services should be in operation by 2010.<ref>International Railway Journal.</ref>  In April 2009, however, DB postponed the service indefinitely because of the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic crisis]].<ref>Batbayar.</ref>

===New Eurasian Land Bridge===
{{Main|New Eurasian Land Bridge}}
The New Eurasian Land Bridge, also called the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China's rail link with Central Asia. The route includes China's east-west railways which, in addition to the Beijiang line, are the [[Longhai Railway]] and the [[Lanxin railway]]. Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of [[Lianyungang]] and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports.<ref>''China Daily'', <U+014C>tsuka, pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref>  China intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.<ref>Ren.</ref>

From Almaty in Kazakhstan, the railway extends to [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan and then to [[Tejen]], [[Turkmenistan]]. From Tejen, another line continues to [[Ashgabat]], the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at [[T<U+00FC>rkmenba<U+015F>y, Turkmenistan]], a port on the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name="Otsuka 44"><U+014C>tsuka, p. 44.</ref>

In 1996 a branch railway from Tejen was constructed across the border with [[Iran]] (at [[Serakhs]]) and linked to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Railways]]. The link potentially enables rail freight from China to reach ports on the [[Persian Gulf]] and via other train lines, to reach into the [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]].<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 42, 44; Mirak-Weissbach.</ref>  The central Asian route, however, does not extend all the way into Europe. There is no rail link yet across the [[Bosphorus]] though the [[Marmaray]] link is being built and is expected to be completed in 2012.<ref><U+014C>tsuka, pp. 42, 44.</ref>  Iranian rail lines use 1,435mm (4 ft 8<U+00BD> in) gauge, requiring freight cars transiting from China into Iran to change wheel gauges twice. The train ferry across [[Lake Van]] is also a capacity restriction.<ref name="Otsuka 44" />

Chinese state media claims that the New Eurasian Land/Continental Bridge extends from Lianyungang to [[Rotterdam]], a distance of {{convert|11870|km|mi|-1}}. The exact route used to connect the two cities, whether through Mongolia or Kazakhstan, however, is unclear.<ref>Xinhua, "NW China mulls 'New Silk Road' exhibition park".</ref>

===Break of gauge issues===
[[File:WheelChanging.jpg|thumb|Changing wheel sets at the Sino-Mongolian border]]
Former countries of the USSR, as well as Mongolia, use a track gauge of {{convert|1520|mm|in}}. The international standard rail gauge used in most of Europe and China is {{convert|1435|mm|in}}. As a result, trains cannot run from China or European countries into or out of the former USSR without [[Break-of-gauge|changing bogies]].  Large facilties to carry out this procedure exist at most border crossing between the "Russian" and "standard" gauge territories (e.g., at [[Zabaykalsk]]<ref name=zabGauge/> or [[Erenhot]]<ref>Rolf Potts, "[http://www.salon.com/travel/diary/pott/1999/11/09/siberia1 Horse races, open spaces and the fate of Genghis Khan's balls]".

Quote: "a set of huge hydraulic cranes at the Sino-Mongolian border that lifted each train-car off the ground as the wheels were changed to fit the new track-gauge"</ref>)
Changing the [[bogie]]s on a rail car takes 5-6 hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, [[shipping container|containerized]] freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead of changing the bogies. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.<ref>''China Daily''; <U+014C>tsuka, p. 48; Rodrigue.</ref>

It has been suggested that on some lines [[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]] would achieve significant time savings in comparison to [[bogie exchange]]. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either [[retrofitting]] or replacement of existing rolling stock.<ref>United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, "Development of the Trans-Asian Railway", pp. 56-58</ref>

==Proposed development==
===Expansion projects===
{{See also|Trans-Asian Railway|Japan<U+2013>Korea Undersea Tunnel}}
[[File:ChinaRailwaysNetwork.png|thumb|right|China's rail system. The link with Kazakhstan is at the upper left corner of the map.]]
On March 10, 2004 the Kazakhstan Railway Company Ltd announced that it was looking for investors to fund the construction of a railway stretching {{convert|3083|km|mi|-1}} from China across Kazakhstan that would be the same gauge as Chinese railways. Thus, the railway would allow trains from China to cross Kazakhstan without having to change bogies. The reported construction cost of the new railway was $3.5 billion. Chinese media reported that the railway would complete the link between China and Europe via central Asia, but it is unclear where the actual link to Europe would be. Also unclear is whether construction has yet to begin on the project.<ref>''China Daily''.</ref>

The governments of [[India]] and [[Burma]] have proposed building, with China's cooperation, a link to the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India or Burma and connect to China's rail system in [[Yunnan]]. The route would allow freight from India and Burma to travel overland to Europe. The link would also give rail access for China to the [[Indian Ocean]]. One proposed starting point for the route is [[Kyaukpyu]]. The governments of [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] are also studying the feasibility of establishing rail links with China.<ref>Wehrfritz; ''The Statesman''; Xinhua, "Experts propose developing SW corridor of third Asia-Europe land-bridge".</ref>

Both Russia and China are seeking to establish a permanent rail link with [[South Korea]] by way of [[North Korea]] to allow South Korean goods to be shipped to Europe via the Eurasian Land Bridge. According to Choi Yeon-Hye, a professor of marketing and management at the Korea National Railway College, a rail connection from [[Busan]] to Rotterdam would cut shipping time from 26 to 16 days and save $800 per container of freight.<ref>Wehrfritz; Funabashi.</ref> The South Korean government announced on December 2, 2009 that it would conduct an economic and technical study on the feasibility of constructing undersea tunnels for transporting goods and people to and from the country directly to [[Kyushu]], [[Japan]] and [[Shandong]], China.<ref>Kyodo;  Wehrfritz also describes a proposal to construct a rail tunnel from [[Busan]] to Japan in order to provide access for Japanese trains to the Trans-Siberian Railway. Wehrfriz, however, does not mention any involvment in the proposal by the Korean government, stating simply, ''"Some have proposed extending the line with a tunnel linking the South Korean port of Pusan to Japan."''</ref>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has advocated greater regional integration along the Eurasian Land Bridge, including development of rail links between the countries of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], called the [[Trans-Asian Railway]] project.<ref>Xinhua, "China northwest city to host UN meet on Eurasia continental bridge 29 June to 4 July"; Islam.</ref> Chinese leaders have called for the establishment of [[free trade zone]]s at both ends of the Eurasian Land Bridge to facilitate development.<ref>Xinhua, "China: Congress deputies propose free trade zones along continental bridge".</ref>  Said Khalid Malik, United Nations [[Resident Coordinator]] in China, "If this comes true, it will enable the continental bridge to play its due role in enhancing co-operation between Asia and Europe, and promoting world peace and development."<ref>Fu.</ref>

===Bering Strait link===
{{Details|Bering Strait crossing}}
[[File:BeringBridge.jpg|thumb|right|Possible route of a bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait.]]
In April 2007 the Russian government announced that it was considering building a rail tunnel under the [[Bering Strait]] between [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] and [[Alaska]]. The tunnel, as projected, would be {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} long and would include oil and gas pipelines, [[fiber optic]] cables and power lines.<ref>Blomfield.</ref> The tunnel project was estimated to cost $65 billion and take 15-20 years to build. In addition to the Russian government, sponsors of the project apparently include [[Transneft]] and RAO United Energy Systems.<ref>Hearst; Associated Press, "Bering Strait tunnel proposed".</ref>

The project, as envisioned, would connect the Trans-Siberian via [[Yakutsk]] in Siberian Russia with the [[North American rail network]] at [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], a distance of {{convert|3700|mi|km|-1}}. A significant hurdle for the project is that the nearest major road to the Russian end of the tunnel is {{convert|1000|mi|km|-1}} away. In addition, [[Alaska]] has no direct rail link to either Canada or the [[continental United States]].<ref>Blomfield; Hearst.</ref>  Others, including [[Wally Hickel]], the [[14th Dalai Lama]], [[Lyndon LaRouche]] and [[Sun Myung Moon]] have also advocated the construction of a tunnel or bridge across the strait.<ref>Nicholson; DiBenedetto; Church & State; Sciacca; ''Virginian-Pilot''; Qazwini.</ref>

===High speed rail===
It was reported in the press in March 2007 that China intends to build a high speed rail link between China and Western Europe<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/europe-asia-days-proposed-high-speed-rail-network/story?id=10048404&page=2 China's Railway Calls for High-Speed Diplomacy]</ref><ref>[http://www.comparecarhire.co.uk/news/china-to-launch-global-high-speed-rail-53815399.html DVICE - China plans massive high-speed train network across Asia and Europe]</ref><ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/chinas-16-000-mile-17-nation-railroad-faces-bumpy-ride/37611/ the Atlantic - China's 16,000-Mile, 17-Nation Railroad Faces Bumpy Ride]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2010/gb20100316_622801.htm Business Week - China Explores Rail Routes to Europe]</ref> with the possibility of a high speed rail journey from Beijing to London taking just two days.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1256647/Fast-train-link-London-Beijing-days.html Mail Online - 'New Orient Express' fast train could get travellers to Beijing from London in TWO days]</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7397846/Kings-Cross-to-Beijing-in-two-days-on-new-high-speed-rail-network.html Daily Telegraph - King's Cross to Beijing in two days on new high-speed rail network]</ref>
