*The Ground Command and Control Element
:This small group comprised the overall ground commander, Brig. Gen. Shomron, and the communications and support personnel.

*The Assault Element
:Led by Lt. Col. Netanyahu, this force was composed entirely of commandos from [[Sayeret Matkal]], and were given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element's assault teams, Matan Vilnai led another.

*The Reinforcement Element
# Securing the area, and preventing any hostile [[ground forces]] from interfering with the C-130 Hercules aircraft and the actual rescue.
# Destroying the squadron of MiG fighter jets on the ground, to prevent any possible interceptions by the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan Air Force]].
# Providing protection for and assisting in the loading of the hostages aboard the transports.
# Assisting in the ground refuelling of the air transports.

==The raid==
[[Image:Entebbe Aerial.jpg|thumb|240px|Aerial photo of the city of [[Entebbe]] and the [[Entebbe International Airport]] in sunset]]
The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe an hour before midnight, with their [[cargo bay]] doors already open. A black [[Mercedes-Benz 600|Mercedes]] and accompanying [[Land Rover]]s were taken along to give the impression that the Israeli troops driving from the landed [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] to the terminal building were an escort for a returning Amin, or other high-ranking official.<ref name="Back to Entebbe" /><ref name="Larry Domnitch">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39910/|title=Remembering Entebbe,Larry Domnitch|date=1 July 2009|publisher=The Jewish Press|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> The Mercedes and its escort vehicles were quickly driven by the Israeli assault team members to the airport terminal in the same fashion as Amin. Along the way, two Ugandan sentries, who were aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes to replace his black one, ordered this procession of vehicles to stop. The commandos shot at the sentries with silenced pistols, missing both of them.<ref name="Back to Entebbe" /> As they pulled away, an Israeli commando in one of the Land Rovers that followed the Mercedes noticed that they had failed to eliminate the sentries and immediately killed them with a burst from his [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]].<ref name="Back to Entebbe" /> Fearing premature alerting of associates to the hijackers, the assault team was quickly sent into action.<ref name="Larry Domnitch" />

The Israelis sprang from their vehicles and bursted towards the terminal. During this brief but intense moment, a Ugandan [[sniper]] in the [[Control tower|airport control tower]] shot and killed Commander [[Yonatan Netanyahu]]. He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation.<ref name="General Dan Shomron" /> The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Upon entering the terminal, the commandos were shouting through a megaphone, "Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers." in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and English.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html Special: Entebbe's unsung hero - Israel News, Ynetnews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A 19-year-old French Jew named Jean-Jacques Maimoni<U+2014>who chose to identify himself as an Israeli Jew to the hijackers even though he had a French passport<U+2014>stood up,<ref name="autogenerated2" /> but was killed by the Israeli commandos, who mistook him for a hijacker. Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, manager of an Israeli medical insurance fund, was also fatally wounded by gunfire, either from the hijackers or accidentally by the Israeli commandos.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], was killed in the crossfire.<ref name="unsung">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html "Entebbe's unsung hero"], ''[[Ynetnews]].com.'' 2006.</ref>

After the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages on board. Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process.

==Background==
Israeli firms were often involved in building projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s. One reason the raid was so well-planned was that the building in which the hostages were being held was built by [[Solel Boneh]], an Israeli construction firm, which still had the [[blueprint]]s, and supplied them to the government of Israel. Additionally, [[Mossad]] built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of militants and the involvement of Ugandan troops from the released hostages in Paris.<ref name="TimeMagazine" /> While planning the military operation, the Israeli army built a partial replica of the airport terminal with the help of some Israeli civilians who had helped build it in the first place. A very high level of secrecy was maintained, and the civilian [[General contractor|contractors]] who had built the replica were detained as "guests" of the military until the rescue was declared a success.<ref>[http://www.operationentebbe.com/p1_preparation.php Preparation for the Raid on Entebbe] Answers 2000 Ltd. Verified 14 Dec 2008.</ref>

According to a 5 July 2006, [[Associated Press]] interview with raid organizer "Muki" Betser, [[Mossad]] operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released.<ref name="betzer">[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-04-palestinian-pressure_x.htm "Israel marks 30th anniversary of Entebbe."] ''Associated Press'' in ''USA Today''. 5 July 2006.</ref> As a result, another source of information was a French-Jewish passenger who had been mistakenly released with the non-Jewish hostages. Betser reports that the man had military training and "a phenomenal memory," allowing him to give information about the number and arms of the hostage-takers, among other useful details.<ref name="betzer"/>

In the week prior to the raid, Israel had tried a number of political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch "Burka" Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, attempting to obtain the release of the hostages, without success.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914380,00.html "Vindication for the Israelis."] ''Time Magazine''. 26 July 1976]</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914382,00.html "War of Words over a Tense Border."] ''Time Magazine''. 26 July 1976.</ref>

==Aftermath==
The [[Politics of Uganda|government of Uganda]] later convened a session of the [[United Nations Security Council]] to seek official condemnation of the Israeli raid,<ref>Teltsch, Kathleen.

(Section: The Week In Review)</ref> as a violation of Ugandan [[sovereignty]]. The Security Council ultimately declined to pass any resolution on the matter. In his address to the Council, Israeli ambassador [[Chaim Herzog]] said:

{{quote|We come with a simple message to the Council: we are proud of what we have done because we have demonstrated to the world that a small country, in Israel's circumstances, with which the members of this Council are by now all too familiar, the dignity of man, human life and human freedom constitute the highest values.

===Claim of Israeli involvement===
According to a UK government file on the crisis, an unnamed contact within the Euro-Arab Parliamentary Association attempted to convince a British diplomat in Paris, shortly after the hijacking, that the Israeli Secret Services and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), had acted together to seize the plane. According to this version, the [[Shin Bet]] helped design the operation to undermine the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO's]] standing in France and its rapprochement with the USA.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6710289.stm |title=Israel hijack role 'was queried'|accessdate=1 June|accessyear=2007 |last=Parkinson |first=Daniel |year=2007 |month=June |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Israel denied the contact's claim about Israeli involvement,<ref>[http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Diplomacy/11465.htm "Eitam: UK claims of Israeli collusion in 1976 hijacking 'audacious'."] ''[[Israelinsider|Israel Insider]]''. 2 June 2007.</ref> with officials in the Vice Premier's office calling it "foolishness" and "not worthy of comment."<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/127461 Israel: "BBC Entebbe Story 'Ridiculous'."] Israel National News. 2 June 2007.</ref> The absence of specific details supporting the allegation led to claims that there had been a deliberate act of disinformation, an attempt to develop a [[conspiracy theory]].<ref name="mideastweb">Hochstein, Joseph M.
