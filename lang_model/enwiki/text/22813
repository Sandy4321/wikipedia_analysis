'''Roger Philip Bresnahan''' (June 11, 1879&nbsp;<U+2013> December 4, 1944), nicknamed "The Duke of [[Tralee]]", was an American player and [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). As a player, Bresnahan competed in MLB for the [[Washington Senators (1891-1899)|Washington Senators]] (1897), [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Orphans]] (1900), [[New York Yankees|Baltimore Orioles]] (1901<U+2013>1902), [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] (1902<U+2013>1908), [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1909<U+2013>1912) and [[Chicago Cubs]] (1913<U+2013>1915). Bresnahan also managed the Cardinals (1909<U+2013>1912) and Cubs (1915). He was a member of the [[1905 World Series]] champions.

Bresnahan opened his MLB career as a [[pitcher]]. He also served as an [[outfielder]], before becoming a regular [[catcher]]. For his MLB career, Bresnahan had a .279 [[batting average]] in 4,480 [[at bat]]s and a 328<U+2013>432 managerial [[win-loss record]]. Bresnahan popularized the use of protective equipment in baseball. He introduced [[shin guard]]s to be worn by a catcher in 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Suehsdorf|first=A.

After retiring as a player, Bresnahan remained active in professional baseball. He owned the [[minor league baseball|minor league]] [[Toledo Mud Hens]] and [[coach (baseball)|coached]] for the Giants and [[Detroit Tigers]]. He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945|1945]] by the [[Veterans Committee]].<ref>His Hall of Fame plaque states, in part: "He was one of the game's most natural players and might have starred at any position.

==Early life==
Bresnahan was born on June 11, 1879 in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. He was the seventh child of Michael and Mary Bresnahan, who had immigrated to the United States from [[Tralee]], Ireland. Bresnahan used to claim that he was also from Tralee, and early in his life, he earned the nickname "The Duke of Tralee".<ref name=ghost>{{cite book|title=Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown: Sixteen Forgotten Members of the Hall of Fame |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0tZCr_c4UPUC&pg=PA32&dq=%22roger+bresnahan%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yWE5T9nEOoPXiALF-sizCg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22roger%20bresnahan%22&f=false  |last=Fleitz  |first=David L.  |publisher=Morgan & Company  |year=2004  |origmonth=January  |isbn=0-7864-1749-8  |chapter=Roger Bresnahan  |pages=32<U+2013>46}}</ref>

Bresnahan began playing baseball in grade school, becoming one of the best known [[sandlot ball|sandlot]] baseball players.<ref name=ghost33/> He continued to play baseball at Toledo's Central High School.<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/90202b76|title=Roger Bresnahan |first=Joan M.|last=Thomas|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career (1895<U+2013>1902)===
At 16, Bresnahan signed with a [[semi-professional]] team from [[Manistee, Michigan]]. After he graduated high school, Bresnahan signed with Lima of the [[Ohio State League]], where he played primarily as a [[pitcher]], but also as a [[catcher]] in 1895 and 1896.<ref name=ghost33/><ref name=sabr/>

On August 10, 1897, the [[Washington Senators (1891-1899)|Washington Senators]] of the [[National League]] (NL) in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) purchased Bresnahan from Lima. He began his MLB career as a [[pitcher]], throwing a six-hit [[shutout]] in his MLB debut against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] on August 27, 1897, recording three [[strikeout]]s and [[base on balls|walking]] two batters.<ref name=ghost33/><ref name=sabr/> He had six [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 16 [[at bats]] (a .375 [[batting average]]) and had a 4<U+2013>0 [[win-loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] for the [[1897 Washington Senators season|1897 Senators]]. However, the Senators released Bresnahan after the season over a salary dispute, when he attempted to hold out for more money.<ref name=sabr/><ref name=irish136/> The Senators offered Bresnahan $2,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1898}}}} in current dollar terms), but Bresnaham wanted $2,400 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2400|1898}}}} in current dollar terms).<ref name=ghost34>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 34</ref>

Bresnahan played for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] of the [[Interstate League]] and the [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]] in 1898, and the Millers and [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the Western League in 1899. Bresnahan appeared in two games at catcher for the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Orphans]] of the NL in 1900, which served as a tryout.<ref name=sabr/><ref name=irish136/>

With the formation of the [[American League]] (AL) as a competitor to the NL, Bresnahan, among others, jumped to the AL from the NL.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0713FE345F13738DDDAE0894DA415B838DF1D3|title=War that Crippled National League: Ban Johnson's Campaign Swept Star Players Out of the Old Organization|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 7, 1913|accessdate=March 23, 2012|format=PDF}}</ref> [[John McGraw]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[New York Yankees|Baltimore Orioles]] of the AL saw Bresnahan pitch for Chicago, and decided to sign him for the Orioles before the 1901 season. For the Orioles, Bresnahan filled in at catcher behind [[Wilbert Robinson]], and also appeared in the outfield. A faster baserunner than the average catcher, Bresnahan had two [[inside the park home run]]s on May 30, 1902.<ref name=ghost34/>

===New York Giants (1902<U+2013>1908)===
With the Orioles reportedly in significant debt, part-owner [[John Mahon (baseball)|John Mahon]] purchased shares of the team from star players [[Joe Kelley]] and [[John McGraw]], who had resigned from the team and signed with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] of the NL, becoming the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, he sold his interest in the Orioles to [[Andrew Freedman]], principal owner of the Giants, and [[John T. Brush]], principal owner of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released Bresnahan, Kelley, [[Joe McGinnity]], [[Jack Cronin]], [[Cy Seymour]], and [[Dan McGann]] from their contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, Gilbert, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new [[player-manager]], on the Giants.<ref>{{cite book|url=Total Ballclubs: The Ultimate Book of Baseball Teams|first1=Donald|last1=Dewey|first2=Nicholas|last2=Acocella|isbn=1-894963-37-7|publisher=Sportclassic Books|year=2005|page=37}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30912F8385417738DDDAD0994DA415B808DF1D3 |title=Dan McGann a Suicide&nbsp;<U+2013> Giants' Former Captain Shoots Him- self in a Hotel at Louisville |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 14, 1910 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:New York Giants team picture.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Bresnahan ''(third from right)'' with the [[1905 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] before playing in the [[1905 World Series]]]]
With [[Frank Bowerman]] and [[Jack Warner (catcher)|Jack Warner]] established as the Giants' catchers, McGraw played Bresnahan as the [[center fielder]] for the Giants.<ref name=ghost34/> In 1903, Bresnahan batted .350, trailing [[Honus Wagner]]'s .355 average atop the NL.<ref name=ghost34/> Bresnahan batted .284 in the 1904 season, playing 96 games in the outfield, ten games at [[first base]], four games at [[shortstop]], and one game apiece at [[second base]] and [[third base]], as the Giants were champions of the NL.<ref name=ghost35>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 35</ref>

Bresnahan shifted to catcher full-time in 1905, as Bowerman became less effective and Warner left the Giants.<ref name=sabr/> [[Christy Mathewson]] preferred pitching to Bresnahan.<ref name=ghost35/> Bresnahan caught all five games in the [[1905 World Series]], including three [[shutout]]s by Mathewson, and one shutout thrown by [[Joe McGinnity]].<ref name=ghost36>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 36</ref> Bresnahan led the Giants with a .313 batting average in the World Series.<ref name=ghost36/>

On [[Opening Day]] in 1907, Bresnahan began to experiment with protective gear. Though [[Negro league]] catcher [[Chappie Johnson]] wore protective gear and [[Nig Clarke]] wore similar gear in MLB in 1905, most catchers did not wear any protective equipment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame|pages=41<U+2013>42|first=Bill|last=James|year=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-684-80088-8}}</ref> Bresnahan practiced in [[shin guard]]s that are worn in [[cricket]] during [[spring training]], and debuted them on April 11, 1907.<ref name=ghost3738>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref> Fans, used to seeing catchers play without protective equipment, threw snowballs on the field, and without police at the game, umpire [[Bill Klem]] called off the game, with the Giants forfeiting to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The press also criticized the use of shin guards. However, other catchers began to adopt Bresnahan's idea.<ref name=ghost38>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 38</ref> Though [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] manager [[Fred Clarke]] protested Bresnahan's gear to the league, the protest was denied and the equipment was approved. Bresnahan caught a career-high 138 games in 1908, batting .283 and leading the NL in walks.<ref name=ghost38/><ref name=ghost39>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 39</ref>

Bresnahan also developed the first batting helmet. He was hit in the head with a pitch by [[Andy Coakley]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on June 18, 1907.<ref name=ghost38/> Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his [[last rites]].<ref name=ghost38/> Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s.<ref name=ghost39 /> Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.<ref name=ghost38/>

===St. Louis Cardinals (1909<U+2013>1912)===
The Giants obtained younger and faster players in 1909; McGraw had [[Chief Meyers]] ready to succeed Bresnahan at catcher.<ref name=ghost39/> [[Stanley Robison]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] became interested in hiring Bresnahan to be a player-manager. As McGraw did not want to block Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for [[Red Murray]], [[Bugs Raymond]] and [[Admiral Schlei]] after the 1908 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C17FD3A5A17738DDDAC0994DA415B888CF1D3 |title=Bresnahan's Ambition&nbsp;<U+2013> Hopes to Reconstruct Cardinals Into a Championship Club |newspaper=The New York Times |page=7|date=December 15, 1908 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910.<ref name=ghost39/> Attendance increased from 205,000 fans in 1908 to 299,000 fans in 1909, and 355,000 fans in 1910.<ref name=ghost40/>

[[File:Roger Bresnahan, St. Louis, NL, Miller Huggins in background (baseball) (LOC).jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Miller Huggins]] ''(left)'' and Bresnahan with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]]]
Grateful for the improvement at the box office, Robison signed Bresnahan to a five-year contract to manage the team for a salary of $10,000 per season (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1911}}}} in current dollar terms), plus ten percent of the club's profits.<ref name=sabr/> Robison died in March 1911, and ownership of the team transferred to [[Helene Hathaway Britton]], his niece.<ref name=sabr/>

On July 11, 1911, with the Cardinals only three games out of first place, the team was involved in a [[Lists of rail accidents|train wreck]] while riding the [[Federal Express (passenger train)|''Federal Express'']] from [[Philadelphia]] to Boston.<ref name="trainwreck">[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1911JULY.stm#day11 Tuesday, July 11] from BaseballLibrary.com</ref> Fourteen passengers were killed after the train derailed and plunged down an {{convert|18|ft|m|1|sing=on}} embankment outside [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].<ref name="trainwreck"/> None of the Cardinals were seriously injured, due to a fortuitous pre-trip change in the location of their [[Pullman car]], requested by Bresnahan. The Cardinals helped remove bodies and rescue the injured.<ref name="trainwreck"/>

Bresnahan and Britton feuded publicly in 1912, as the Cardinals fell to sixth place in the NL. The Cardinals fired Bresnahan after the 1912 season due to various arguments Bresnahan had with Britton, including over Bresnahan's desire to sell [[Miller Huggins]] to another franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1081EFD385813738DDDAA0A94D8415B828DF1D3|title=Roger Bresnahan Out as Manager; Officials of St. Louis Nationals Dismiss Leader of Team&nbsp;<U+2013> Suit May Follow|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1912|accessdate=February 13, 2012|format=PDF}}</ref> Britton cited decreased profits as a sign that Bresnahan was disinterested in the job.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F16FD355E13738DDDAF0A94D9415B828DF1D3|title=Roger Didn't Try Hard.; Woman Owner of St. Louis Club Gives Reason for Dropping Bresnahan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1912|accessdate=February 13, 2012|format=PDF}}</ref> Huggins succeeded Bresnahan as Cardinals' manager, as she preferred Huggins' "gentlemanly" manner, as opposed to Bresnahan's rougher personality.<ref name=koppett84>{{cite book |title=The Man in the Dugout: Baseball's Top Managers and How They Got That Way|authorlink=Leonard Koppett|first=Leonard|last=Koppett|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-56639-745-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TCdRaxPVmKQC&pg=PA83&dq=miller+huggins&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lAGOT7CNDsWiiQKCy-GQDw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=miller%20huggins&f=false|page=84|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> Brenahan hired an attorney to obtain the remainder of his salary.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GSBQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nAoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3767,4018525&dq=roger-bresnahan&hl=en|title=Interest Settles on N.L.

Following his termination by the Cardinals, the NL declared Bresnahan a free agent.

Bresnahan stood approximately {{convert|5|ft|9|in}}.<ref name=ghost33/> He was described as "highly strung and almost abnormally emotional" by a reporter.<ref name=irish136>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6PtSUmB7WTMC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22highly+strung+and+almost+abnormally+emotional%22&source=bl&ots=OY_uKHx8gY&sig=J4xjez56TfH-1JIkRldxsGd_CPE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EmA5T6mvH-itiQKqpNlQ&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22highly%20strung%20and%20almost%20abnormally%20emotional%22&f=false|title=The Irish in baseball: an early history|first=David L.|last=Fleitz|page=136|publisher=McFarland|year=2009|isbn=0786434198|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref> [[Bill James]] wrote that Bresnahan "was one of those guys that if you were on his team and played hard he was as nice to you as could be, but if you got on his bad side you'd think he was the Breath of Hell."<ref name=ghost36/>

Bresnahan was known for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few occasions escorted from the field by police.<ref name=ghost36/> A 1911 directive by NL president [[Thomas Lynch (baseball executive)|Thomas Lynch]], compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing batters with verbal abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.<ref name=ghost40>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 40</ref>

Bresnahan was elected to the Hall of Fame the year after his death. He had received 47 votes of the 226 electors in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|1936 Hall of Fame balloting]], and between 43 and 67 votes each time from [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937|1937]] through [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1942|1942]].<ref name=ghost32>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown, p. 32</ref> In the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945|1945 balloting]], occurring one month after Bresnahan's death, he received 133 votes, still falling short of enshrinement. However, the [[Veterans Committee|Permanent Committee]] noticed the surge in votes and elected him in April 1945.<ref name=ghost33>Fleitz, ''Ghosts in the Gallery at Cooperstown'', p. 33</ref>

Regarding his Hall of Fame induction, James has criticized the election, saying that Bresnahan "wandered in the Hall of Fame on a series of miscalculations", and regarding his election, that "the Hall of Fame had, for the first time, selected a player who clearly had no damn business being there".<ref name=ghost44/>

==Commemorations==
Bresnahan was mentioned in the poem ''[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]'' by [[Ogden Nash]]:
{{Quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= left |bgcolor= #F0DC82 |qalign= center | title=''Baseball Hall of Fame plaque''|quote=''Battery mate of [[Christy Mathewson]] with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], he was one of the games most natural players and might have starred at any position.  The "Duke of Tralee" was one of the few major league catchers fast enough to be used as a [[lead off|leadoff]] man }}
