'''<U+00D6>gedei Khan''' ({{lang-mn|<U+04E8><U+0433><U+044D><U+0434><U+044D><U+0439>}}, ''<U+00D6>gedei''; also  '''Ogotai''' or '''Oktay''';  '''Ogodei''') (c. 1186 <U+2013> December 11, 1241) was the third son of [[Genghis Khan]] and second [[Great Khan]] ([[Khagan]]) of the [[Mongol Empire]] by succeeding his father. He continued the expansion of the empire that his father had begun, and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the [[mongol invasion of Europe|invasions of Europe]] and [[Mongol invasion of East Asia|Asia]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders-The History of the Mongol Conquests, p.74</ref> Like all of Genghis' primary sons, he participated extensively in conquests in [[China]], [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]].

==Background==
<U+00D6>gedei was the third son of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[B<U+00F6>rte]] Ujin. He participated in the turbulent events of his father's rise. When he was 17 years old, Genghis Khan experienced the disastrous defeat of [[Khalakhaljid Sands]]. <U+00D6>gedei was heavily wounded and lost on the battlefield.<ref>Secret history of the Mongols, $3, II</ref> His father's adopted brother and companion Borokhula rescued him. Although already married, in 1204 his father gave him [[Toregene]], the wife of a defeated [[Merkit]] chief. 
[[Image:Genghis Khan and three of his four sons.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan and three of his four sons.]]
After Genghis was proclaimed Emperor or [[Khagan]] in 1206, myangans (1000's) of the [[Jalayir]], Besud, [[Suldus]], [[Khongqatan]] clans were given to him as his [[appanage]]. <U+00D6>gedei's territory occupied the [[Emil]] and [[Hobok]] rivers. According to his father's wish, [[Ilugei]], the commander of the Jalayir, became <U+00D6>gedei's [[tutor]].

<U+00D6>gedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November, 1211 against the [[Jin Dynasty (1115<U+2013>1234)]]. He was sent to ravage the land south through [[Hebei]] and then north through [[Shanxi]] in 1213. <U+00D6>gedei's force drove the Jin garrison out of the [[Ordos]] and he rode to the juncture of the [[Xi Xia]], Jin and Song domains.<ref>Marvin C Whiting-Imperial Chinese Military History, p.355</ref>

During the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Mongol conquest of Eastern Persia]], <U+00D6>gedei and [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] massacred the residents of [[Otrar]] after a five-month siege in 1219-20 and joined [[Jochi]] who was outside the walls of [[Urganch]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders-The History of the Mongol Conquests, p.57</ref> Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, <U+00D6>gedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch.<ref>John Powell-Magill's Guide to Military History: Jap-Pel, p.1148</ref> They captured the city in 1221. When the rebellion broke out in south east Persia and Afghanistan, <U+00D6>gedei also pacified [[Ghazni]].<ref>Richard Ernest Dupuy, Trevor Nevitt Dupuy-The encyclopedia of military history, p.336</ref>

==Ascendancy to Supreme Khan==
[[Image:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|Coronation of <U+00D6>gedei in 1229. [[Rashid al-Din]], early 14th century.]]
The Empress Yisui and Borte,(Genghis' first wife) insisted that Genghis Khan designate an heir before the invasion of [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1219. After the terrible brawl between Jochi and Chagatai, they agreed that <U+00D6>gedei was to be chosen as heir. Genghis confirmed their decision.

Genghis Khan died in 1227, and Jochi had died a year or two year earlier. <U+00D6>gedei's younger brother held the regency until 1229. 

He was elected supreme khan in 1229, according to the [[kurultai]] held at Kodoe Aral on the [[Kherlen River]] after Genghis' death, although this was never really in doubt as it was Genghis' clear wish that he be succeeded by <U+00D6>gedei. After ritually declining three times, <U+00D6>gedei was proclaimed Khagan of the [[Mongols]] on September 13, 1229.<ref>Michael Prawdin, Gerard (INT) Chaliand-The Mongol empire, p.237</ref> Chagatai continued to support his younger brother's claim.

Genghis Khan saw <U+00D6>gedei's characteristic as courtesy and generosity.<ref>The Secret history of the Mongols</ref> His charisma is partially credited for his success in keeping the Empire on his father's path. Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and the personal charisma of <U+00D6>gedei, the affairs of the Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. To this it must again be added that <U+00D6>gedei was an extremely pragmatic man, however, he made some mistakes during his reign. He had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer, and used the abilities of those he found most capable.

== World conquests ==
{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}
=== Expansion in the Middle East ===
{{Main|Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|l1=Mongol conquest of Persia}}
After destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against [[Hsi Hsia]] in 1226. In 1226, however, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to [[Persia]] to revive the empire lost by his father, [[Muhammad <U+2018>Ala al-Din II.]] The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at [[Dameghan]]. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of [[Isfahan]], but was unable to follow up that success.

With <U+00D6>gedei<U+2019>s consent to launch a campaign at last, [[Chormaqan]] left [[Bukhara]] at the head of 30 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers.  He occupied Persia and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the [[Amu Darya River]] in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through it quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Noyan, who had further instructions to invade western [[Afghanistan]]. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered the northern section of Persia known as Mazandaran in the autumn of 1230. In doing so, he avoided the mountainous area south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. That region was controlled by the [[Ismailis]].

Upon reaching the city of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]]. From there, he sent armies into the regions of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to their Mongol overlords rather than to see their states ravaged. Meanwhile further east, Dayir steadily achieved his goals in capturing [[Kabul]], Ghazni, and Zawulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.

=== The fall of the Jin Dynasty ===
{{seealso|Mongol-Jin War}}
At the end of 1230, responding to the Jin's unexpected defeat of the Mongol general Doqulkhu, the Khagan went south to [[Shanxi]] province with [[Tolui]], clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of [[Fengxiang]]. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in [[Henan]], cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin's rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was besieged in his capital of [[Kaifeng]]. <U+00D6>gedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the [[Song Dynasty]], destroyed the Jin in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]] which were now ruled by the Mongols.

In addition to the [[Mongol-Jin War]], <U+00D6>gedei crushed the [[Puxian Wannu|Eastern Xia Dynasty]] in 1233, pacifying southern [[Manchuria]]. <U+00D6>gedei subdued the [[Water Tatars]] in northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.

=== Conquest of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia ===
{{main|Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia}}
[[Image:Geor tamro aandersen.GIF|250px|thumb|<U+00D6>gedei conquered the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] (including its subordinate [[Armenia]]) and [[Azerbaijan]]]]
The Mongols under Chormaqan returned to [[Caucasus]] in 1232. [[Ganjak]]<U+2019>s walls were breached by [[catapult]] and [[battering ram]] in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of [[Irbil]] agreed to send a yearly tribute to the court of the khagan. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of [[Mongke Khan|Mongke]] was also active to the north Caucasus.<ref>Timothy May-Mongol Empire: Chormaquan and the Mongol Conquest of the Middle East</ref> After subduing [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Greater Armenia]], Chormaqan took [[Tiflis]]. In 1238, the Mongols captured [[Lorhe]] whose ruler, [[Shahanshah]], fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After a putting up a spirited defense at [[Hohanaberd]], the city<U+2019>s ruler, [[Hasan Jalal]], submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince [[Avak]]. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around it and its prince Avak surrendered soon. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]], forcing the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] nobles to surrender.

=== Invasion of Korea ===
{{main|Mongol invasions of Korea}}
In 1224 a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying [[tribute]].<ref>Michel Ho<U+00E0>ng, Ingrid Cranfield-Genghis Khan, p.159</ref> <U+00D6>gedei dispatched Saritai (Sartaq) to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to [[Mongol invasions of Korea|invade Korea]] in order to subdue the kingdom. The [[Goryeo]] King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept [[darugachi|Mongol overseers]]. When they withdrew for the summer, however, [[Choe U]] moved the capital from [[Kaesong]] to [[Ganghwa]] Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them. 

<U+00D6>gedei announced plans for the conquest of the [[Koreans]], the [[Southern Song]], the [[Kipchak]]s and their [[Europe]]an allies, all of whom killed Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. <U+00D6>gedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, the defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo asked the peace treaty in 1238, <U+00D6>gedei demanded the king to summon before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with 10 noble boys to [[Mongolia]] as [[hostage]]s, temporarily ending the war in 1241.<ref>J.Bor-Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II, p.197</ref> It is said that <U+00D6>gedei recruited his [[kheshig]] with [[Koreans]].

=== Europe ===
{{main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}
[[File:<U+0421>apture of the Mongol-Tatars Russian city.jpg|230px|thumb|The Mongol army captures a [[Rus']] city]]
The Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]] to subdue the Russian steppe and the rest of [[Europe]]. Their western conquests included almost all of [[Russia]] (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal), [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]]. During the siege of [[Kolomna]], the Khagan's half brother Khulgen<ref>he was the son of Genghis Khan by Khulan khatun of the Merkid clan</ref> was killed by an arrow. 

After the conquest of [[Volga-Bulgaria]], [[Alania]], and Rus principalties, <U+00D6>gedei's son [[G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Khan|G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k]] and Chagatai's grandson [[Buri]] ridiculed Batu and the Mongol camp suffered dissention. The Khagan harshly criticized Guyuk that "You broke the spirit of every man in your army...Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men".Then he sent Guyuk back to continue the conquest of Europe. <U+00D6>gedei's sons [[Kadan]] and [[G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Khan|G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k]] attacked Poland and [[Transylvania]], respectively.

<U+00D6>gedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the "Great Sea," the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and only his death prevented the possible invasions of [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]], and [[Spain]], and the remaining small European principalities. Indeed, Mongol forces were moving on [[Vienna]], launching a fierce winter campaign against Austria and Germany in the first wave into Western Europe, when <U+00D6>gedei died.  Some historians believe only his death prevented the complete conquest of Europe.<ref>The [[alterante history]] trilogy "The Year of Longdirk" by [[Ken Hood]] depicts a history where <U+00D6>gedei Khan did survive and did indeed conuer the whole of Europe by 1244 [http://www.uchronia.net/bib.cgi/label.html?id=hoodyearso]</ref>

=== Conflict with the Song China ===
{{main|Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty}}
In a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by <U+00D6>gedei's sons penetrated deep into the Song Dynasty and reached [[Chengdu]], [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and [[Yangtze River]]. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and number of the Song troops. However, <U+00D6>gedei's son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, <U+00D6>gedei's another son Khuden dispatched a subsidiary expedition to [[Tibet]]. The situation between the two nations worsened when the Song officers murdered <U+00D6>gedei's envoys headed by Selmus.<ref>Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank -The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States, p.263</ref> 

The Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of <U+00D6>gedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the [[Silk Road]], the primary trading route between East and West.

=== India ===
{{main|Mongol invasion of India}}
<U+00D6>gedei appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in [[Qonduz]]. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the [[Indus valley]] and besieged [[Lahore]]. Dayir died storming the town, however, on December 30, 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref>Islamic Culture Board-Islamic culture, p.256</ref>

Some time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded [[Kashmir]], stationing a [[darughachi]] there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.<ref>Thomas T. Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.84</ref> Around the same time, a Kashmiri [[Buddhist]] master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of <U+00D6>gedei.

== Administration ==
[[Image:Ogadai Khan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of <U+00D6>gedei Khagan (the 14th century). Recreation of a Yuan portrait in the National Palace Museum in Taipei.]]
<U+00D6>gedei began bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three culture constituted his administration: 
*the [[Christian]] eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], represented by Chinqai, the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[scribe]] and the [[Kerait]]s.
*the Islamic cycle, represented by two [[Khorazm]]ians, Mahumud Yalavach and Masud Beg
*the [[North Chinese]] [[Confucian]] circle, represented by [[Yelu Chucai]], a [[Kidan]], and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].

Mahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to [[tax farmer]]s who collect payments in [[silver]]. Yelu Chucai encouraged <U+00D6>gedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents, and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, [[loan]]ed at higher [[interest rate|interest]] the silver needed for tax payments. At the same time the Mongols began circulating [[paper currency]] backed by silver reserves. 

<U+00D6>gedei abolished  the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of the Mongol ruled China into 10 routes according to the suggestion of Yel<U+00FC> Chucai. He also divided the empire into [[Beshbalik]] administration, [[Yanjing]] administration while the Headquarter in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. [[Turkestan]] was administered by Mahamud Yalavach while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. <U+00D6>gedei appointed [[Shigi Khutugh]] chief judge in China. In [[Iran]], <U+00D6>gedei appointed first Chin-temur, a [[Kara-kitai]], and then [[Korguz]], an Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai's duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver.<ref>David Morgan-The Mongols, p.102</ref> The Ortoq or partner merchants lent <U+00D6>gedei's money at exorbitant rates of [[interest]] to the peasants, however, <U+00D6>gedei considerably banned higher rates. Despite it proved profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.  

<U+00D6>gedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the [[Taoist]] priest Li Zhichang and built schools and [[academy]]. <U+00D6>gedei Khan also decreed to issue [[paper currency]] backed by [[silk]] reserves and founded a Department which was responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to <U+00D6>gedei that his large-scale distribution of [[appanage]]s in Iran, [[Western China|Western]] and North China, and Khorazm, could lead to a [[disintegration]] of the Empire.<ref>Chunjiang Fu, Asiapac Editorial, Liping Yang-Chinese History, p.148</ref> <U+00D6>gedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.

The Khagan proclaimed the Great [[Yassa]] as integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances, while adding his own. <U+00D6>gedei codified rules of dress, conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the Empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations ([[Yam (route)|Yam]]) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders' needs.<ref>Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach-Medieval Islamic Civilization, p.632</ref> Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations on them. The attached households were exempt from other taxes but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. <U+00D6>gedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. The Khagan prohibited the nobility from issuing [[paiza]]s (tablet that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and [[jarliq]]s. <U+00D6>gedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 [[sheep]] of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a [[herd]] for the imperial table.<ref>Mongolia Society - Occasional Papers<U+200E> - p.17</ref>

== Karakorum ==
[[File:Karakorum - Tortue Sud.jpg|thumb|[[Bixi (tortoise)|Stone tortoise]] of Karakorum]]
{{main|Karakorum}}
From 1235-38 <U+00D6>gedei constructed a series of [[palace]]s and [[Pavilion (structure)|pavilion]]s at stopping places in his annual [[nomad]]ic route through central [[Mongolia]]. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese [[artisan]]s. The [[Emperor]] urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, [[Karakorum]] (<U+0425><U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+043C>), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win <U+00D6>gedei's favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded a city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in [[East Asia]]. There was a [[castle]] with doors like the gates of the [[garden]] and a series of [[lake]]s where many water fowl gathered. <U+00D6>gedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a [[calendar]] on the Chinese model.

== Character ==
[[Image:<U+00D6>gedei Khan Statue.JPG|thumb |180px|Statue of <U+00D6>gedei Khagan in [[Mongolia]]]]
He was considered to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult <U+00D6>gedei was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial and very charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the [[Mongol Empire]] on the path that his father had set.

To encourage trade caravans he paid extremely high prices for all manner of goods whether he needed them or not. <U+00D6>gedei squandered much of his wealth, passing out pearls, golds, coins and other precious stones to the people. The constant [[outflow]] from the Imperial [[treasury]] had to be made up by taxes, principally on North China.

<U+00D6>gedei kept peace among his family, criticizing his son and Chagatai's grandson. The sudden death of [[Tolui]] seems to have affected him deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, having a drink in shamanist ritual in order to save <U+00D6>gedei who was suffering from illness.<ref>Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Rudi Paul Lindner, Valentin Aleksandrovich-The Uralic and Altaic Series, p.176</ref> <U+00D6>gedei fell victim to [[alcoholism]]. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but <U+00D6>gedei managed to drink anyway. When he died at dawn on December 11, 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui's widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the Khagan's own lack of self control had killed him. 

<U+00D6>gedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and was willing to listen and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a [[dictator]].<ref>David Morgan-The Mongols, p.104</ref> Like all [[Mongols]] at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan he was a part of his father's plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals, and adapt to the circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end, rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.

However, he used violence to strengthen his authority. In 1237 <U+00D6>gedei dispatched his imperial army to punish the [[Oirat]] and seize their lands after the forest people refused to give tributes. Around 4,000 young girls became subject to [[War rape|war violence]].<ref>Jack Weatherford - [[The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire]], p.91</ref>

==Aftermath of <U+00D6>gedei's death==

<U+00D6>gedei had nominated his grandson Shiremun as his heir, but G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow T<U+00F6>regene Khatun. However, Batu, the Khan of the [[Kipchak Khanate]] (the Ulus of Jochi) in Russia, nominally accepted Guyuk, who died on the way to confront Batu. It was not until 1255, well into the reign of [[Mongke]] Khan, that Batu felt secure enough to again prepare to invade Europe. Fortunately for the Europeans, he died before his plans could be implemented.

When [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan Dynasty]] in 1271, he had <U+00D6>gedei Khan placed on the official record as Taizong ({{zh|<U+592A><U+5B97>|T<U+00E0>iz<U+014D>ng}}).

== Children ==
<U+00D6>gedei had many khatuns and concubines. <U+00D6>gedei married first Borakchin and then Toregene. Other wives included Mukha and Jachin.

He had 7 sons:

*[[Guyuk Khan|Guyuk]], the 3rd Great Khan of the Mongols
*Koden (Khuden), the first buddhist Mongol prince
*Kochu, died [[Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty|during the campaign in Song China]].
*Korachar
*Kashi, the father of [[Kaidu]]
*[[Khadan]]
*Meliq
