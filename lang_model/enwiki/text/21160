An '''improvised explosive device''' ('''IED''') is a formal name for [[explosive]] devices as often used in [[unconventional warfare]] or assymetrical warfare by [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s or [[commando]] forces in a [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]]. In the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]], the insurgents have made the IED (often referred to by the press as '''roadside bombs''') one of their main weapons against coalition forces.  

==Background==
An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, [[pyrotechnic]], or [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] [[Chemical industry|chemicals]] and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, to facilitate another type of attack. IEDs may incorporate [[military]] or commercially-sourced explosives, and often combine both types.

An IED typically consists of an explosive charge (potentially assisted by a "booster" charge), a [[detonator]] and an initiation system which is a mechanism that initiates the electrical charge that sets off the device. IEDs are extremely diverse in design, and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, and explosive loads. In some cases, IEDs also contain metal objects such as nails or ball bearings. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infra-red or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires. In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a "daisy-chain", to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway.

IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to [[Detonation|detonate]], and in some cases actually detonate on either the maker or the emplacer of the device (these unintended early detonations are known as "pre-detonations"). However, some groups have been known to produce sophisticated devices that are constructed with components scavenged from conventional [[munition]]s and standard consumer[[Electronics|electronic]] components, such as [[mobile phone]]s or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.

The majority of IEDs use conventional [[Explosive material|high-explosive]] charges as their explosive load. However, the threat exists that toxic [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], or radioactive ([[dirty bomb]]) material may be added to a device, thereby creating a host of other life-threatening effects beyond shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. A '''VBIED''' is a '''vehicle borne IED''', a U.S. military term describing a [[car bomb]] or truck bomb.

==Detecting and disarming an IED==
[[Image:IED detonator.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldier in Iraq shown with an IED detonator for use to dispose of buried devices.]]
Since these devices are nonstandard, there are no specific guidelines for [[bomb disposal|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD) personnel to use to positively identify or categorize them. EOD personnel are trained in the [[render safe procedure|rendering safe]] and disposal of IEDs. The use of [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[radioactivity|radiological]], or [[radioactivity|nuclear]] (CBRN) material in an IED requires additional precautions.  As with other missions, the EOD CP provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission.

===U.S. countermeasures===

According to a March 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, U.S. Gen. [[John Abizaid]] wrote to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] shortly after the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]] that "IEDs are the number one killer of American troops" and asked for a "[[Manhattan Project]]-like effort" to defeat IEDs. The U.S. Military has used [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]-sensors, electronic counter-measures, and other technical solutions to detect and defeat IEDs. 

However, technology is only part of the solution in the effort to defeat IEDs; experience, training and awareness remain key factors in combating them. For example, there are some signs which may suggest the existence of an IED, such as recently turned-over soil or sand near a roadway, or an abandoned car beside a roadway. In 2005, the [[U.S. military]] spent $3.3 billion to defeat IEDs, mostly for improved armor for vehicles and soldiers (body armour) and better technology, such as sensors, radio jammers and robotic bomb-disposal devices.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11904429/site/newsweek/</ref>

==History==
===World War II===
One of the first examples of coordinated large-scale use of IED's was the Belarusian "Rail War" launched by Belarusian guerillas against the Nazis during [[World War II]]. Both command-detonated and delayed-fuse IEDs were used to derail thousands of Nazi trains during 1943-1944.

===Northern Ireland===
Roadside bombs were extensively used by the group, the [[Provisional IRA]] in [[Northern Ireland]], during the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997]]. A typical roadside bomb was placed in a drain or "culvert" along a rural road and exploded by remote control when [[British Army]] or other security forces vehicles were passing. The most lethal example of these attacks came in 1979, when 18 British soldiers were killed by two "culvert bombs" at [[Warrenpoint]]. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military had to stop transport by road in certain areas and use helicopter transport instead. In addition, in the 1980s and 1990s, all culverts were welded and concreted shut, so that explosives could not be placed in them.

Nowadays, [[nail bomb]]s and [[blast bomb]]s are sometimes used in civil disorder (along with fireworks and [[petrol bomb]]s), and [[pipe bomb]]s are frequently used by paramilitaries/criminals. Incendiary devices continue to be used also, for example in attacks on property.

===Vietnam===

IEDs were used during the [[Vietnam War]] by the [[Vietcong]] against land- and river-borne vehicles as well as personnel.  They were commonly constructed using materials from unexploded American [[ordnance]].  33 percent of U.S. casualties in Vietnam and 28 percent of deaths were officially attributed to mines; these figures include losses caused by both IEDs and commercially manufactured mines.<ref>http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/vietnam/minesouthviet.htm</ref><ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/series/pt_05.html</ref><ref>http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/gen1/General-03.htm</ref>

===Afghanistan===

Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]] by the [[USSR]] on [[27 December]] [[1979]], the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] were supplied with large quantities of military supplies from many [[Muslim]] states and from the United States. Among those supplies were many types of [[anti-tank mine]]s. The Afghan Mujahideen often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combine the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. Often the foreign anti-tank mines were enclosed in plastic containers, making them difficult to detect. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin-cans, the Afghan Mujahideen made them easier to detect. After an IED was exploded, the Afghan Mujahideen often used direct fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.

Afghan Mujahideen operating far from the border with [[Pakistan]] did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make mines from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The anti-tank mines were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] and its supporters have used IEDs against  American, [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. While the number of such attacks has been far lower than those in Iraq, the number has been steadily increasing.

===Lebanon===

[[Hezbollah]] pioneered the use of IEDs against military forces after the [[1982 invasion of Lebanon]] by [[Israel]].  Israel withdrew from most of [[Lebanon]] in 1985 but still kept troops stationed in a [[buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon.  Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli vehicles in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal in [[May 2000]]. 

One such bomb killed Israeli [[Brigadier General]] [[Erez Gerstein]] on [[February 28]], [[1999]], the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon.
Also in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], a [[Merkava]] Mark II [[tank]] was hit by a [[Hezbollah]] IED killing all 4 [[IDF]] servicemen on board, the first of two IED's damaging a [[Merkava]] tank.

===Chechnya===

IEDs have also been popular in [[Chechnya]], where [[Russia]]n forces are currently engaged in fighting with rebels.  While no concrete statistics are available on this matter, bombs have accounted for many Russian deaths in both the [[First Chechen War]] ([[1994]]-[[1996]]) and the [[Second Chechen War|Second]] ([[1999]]-present).

===Iraq===
[[Image:Iedcontrolledexplotion.png|thumb|right|300px|Controlled explosion of IED, US Army in Iraq.]]
Beginning in [[July 2003]], the [[Iraqi insurgency]] used IEDs&mdash;more often referred to as roadside bombs by the press&mdash;to target American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] vehicles.

Common locations for placing these bombs in include [[animal]] [[carcass]]es, [[soft drink can]]s, and [[box]]es.  Typically they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage.  However, as [[vehicle armor]] was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on [[traffic sign|road signs]] or [[tree]]s, in order to hit less protected areas.

IEDs in Iraq may be made with [[artillery]] or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[projectile|shell]]s or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade [[explosive]]s.

IEDs have accounted for (as of October 2005) about one-third of all American deaths in Iraq <ref>http://icasualties.org/oif/IED.aspx</ref>.  Despite the increased [[armor]], IEDs have been killing soldiers with greater frequency; in a ten month period in 2005, 302 U.S. soldiers were killed by such devices.<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aftH7bcepI8I&refer=us</ref> According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (of 650,000 tons total) of Iraqi ordnance were looted, providing a nigh-endless source of ammunition for the insurgents.<ref>http://hammernews.com/lootedhopes.htm</ref>

In [[October 2005]], [[Britain]] charged that [[Iran]] was supplying insurgents with the technological know-how to make [[shaped charge]]s, which focus the blast upwards and can pierce even the most heavily armed vehicle.  Iran has denied this. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4312516.stm</ref> <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4315924.stm</ref> <ref>http://nyjtimes.com/cover/11-11-05/IranWarnedNotToMeddle.htm</ref>

Recently, IEDs have been deployed in the form of [[Explosively Formed Penetrator]]s, a special type of shaped charge that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more). These are especially problematic to counter because they can be emplaced so far from their intended targets.<ref>http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/archive/index.php/t-10384.html</ref>

Another possibility is platter charges. Platter charges are rectangular or circular pieces of flat metal (usually steel) with plastic explosives pressed onto one side of the platter. The amount of explosive used is usually equal, by weight, to the weight of the platter. The explosives propel the platter into the target. The effective range can be as far as 50 meters.

The British also accused Iran and [[Hezbollah]] of teaching Iraqi fighters to use [[infrared]] light beams to trigger IEDs. As the occupation forces become more sophisticated in interrupting radio signals around their convoys, the Iraqis adapt their triggering methods. Thus far <!-- as of when? -->the British have failed to present any evidence to substantiate their charges.

Insurgents now use the bombs to target not only American and Coalition vehicles, but Iraqi police and civilian transportation as well.
