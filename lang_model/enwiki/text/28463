The '''Norfolk Southern''' {{reporting mark|NS}}, is a major [[Class I railroad]] in the [[United States]], owned by the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. The company operates 21,500 route miles in 22 eastern states, the [[District of Columbia]] and the province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The most common commodity hauled on the railroad is [[coal]] from mines in [[Kentucky]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]]. The railroad also offers an extensive [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] network in eastern North America. The current system was planned in [[1982]] with the formation of the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]], merged on [[December 31]], [[1990]] with the lease of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] by the renamed [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]], and augmented in [[1998]] with the acquisition of over half of [[Conrail]].

== History of the railroad ==
Norfolk Southern was created from predecessor railroads which date back to the early portion of the [[19th century]]. Prior to current times, the three main branches of the current corporate family tree were for many years themselves  systems: [[Norfolk and Western]], formed in 
[[1881]], [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway System]] in [[1894]], and [[Conrail]], formed much later, in 1976. Each of these grew from many smaller local and regional lines as the industry grew.

=== Southern Railway ===
The [[South Carolina Canal and Rail Road]], the earliest predecessor line, was chartered in December [[1827]] and ran the nation's first regularly scheduled [[passenger train]] on [[December 25]], [[1830]]. The [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] (R&D), formed in [[1847]], which expanded into a large system after the [[American Civil War]] under the leadership of [[Algernon S. Buford]]. 

When the R&D fell on hard times financially in the early 1890s, it became a major portion of the newly created [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] in [[1894]]. Financier [[J.P. Morgan]] selected veteran railroader [[Samuel Spencer (Southern Railway)|Samuel Spencer]] as President to head the firm, which became well-known as both profitable and innovative. Southern Railway was the first major U.S. railroad to completely switch to more efficient [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s from steam in 1953.

=== Norfolk and Western ===
The [[City Point Railroad]] was a nine-mile railroad just south of [[Richmond, Virginia]] established in 1838 which ran from [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]] (now part of the independent [[Hopewell, Virginia|City of Hopewell]]) on the navigable portion of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. It was acquired by the [[South Side Railroad (Virginia)|South Side Railroad]] in 1854. After the War, it became part of the [[Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad]] (A,M&O), a trunk line across Virginia's southern tier formed by mergers in 1870 by [[William Mahone]], who had been builder of the [[Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad]] in the 1850s. The A,M&O was the oldest portion of the [[Norfolk and Western]] (N&W) when it was formed in 1881, under new owners with a keen interest and financial investments in the [[coal]] fields of Western Virginia and West Virginia, a product which came to define and enrich the railroad. 

In the second half of the 20th century, the profitable N&W had already acquired the [[Virginian Railway]], the [[Wabash Railway]], and the [[Nickel Plate Road]], among others, before it combined with the also profitable Southern Railway to form the new Norfolk Southern.

=== 1982 merger ===
NS was created in [[1982]] from the merger of the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Southern Railway Company, both profitable companies. An earlier company, also named the [[Norfolk Southern Railway (former)|Norfolk Southern Railway]], serving primarily [[North Carolina]] and the southeastern tip of [[Virginia]], had been acquired by the Southern Railway in [[1974]]. The older company was the namesake for the [[1982]] combination. Headquarters for the newly established Norfolk Southern were established in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

The 1982 combination of the profitable Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway was done to compete in the eastern United States with the [[Chessie System]]-[[Seaboard Coast Line]] merger which had been approved by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in [[1980]], resulting in formation of [[CSX Transportation]].

=== Conrail ===
[[Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail) was an 11,000-mile (18000 km) system which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. Conrail had become profitable after the [[Staggers Act]] in 1980 largely deregulated the U.S. railroad industry. 

On [[June 23]], [[1997]], Norfolk Southern and [[CSX Transportation]] filed a joint application with the [[Surface Transportation Board]] (STB) for authority to purchase, divide and operate the assets of Conrail. On [[June 6]], [[1998]], the STB approved the Norfolk Southern-CSX application and set [[August 22]], [[1998]], as the effective date of its decision. 

Norfolk Southern acquired 58% of Conrail<U+2019>s assets (CSX got the remaining 42%). As a result of the transaction, Norfolk Southern's rail operations grew to include some 7,200 miles (11500 km) of the Conrail system (predominantly the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]). Norfolk Southern began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on [[June 1]], [[1999]].

{{expand list}}

== Major businesses ==
The railroad is a large exporter of [[West Virginia]] [[bituminous coal]], transported on portions of the well-engineered former [[Virginian Railway]] and the famous former [[Norfolk and Western]]'s double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its [[Lambert's Point]] coal transload facility on [[Hampton Roads]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to [[steel mill]]s and [[power plant]]s around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. Norfolk Southern was the first railway to employ [[roadrailer]]s, which are highway truck trailers with interchangeable wheel sets. 

According to Norfolk Southern<U+2019>s [[2003]] Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2003, the Norfolk Southern Railway had more than 28,160 employees, 3,468 locomotives, and 101,095 freight cars.

At the end of 2003, the transport of coal, coke and iron ore made up 23% of the total amount of traffic hauled by Norfolk Southern. Intermodal containers made up 19% of the total; [[autorack]]s 14%; chemical tankers 12%; metals, construction materials, agriculture commodities, and consumer products 11%; paper, clay, and forest products 10%.

== Track network and facilities ==
{{main|List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines}}
Largely an eastern United States railway, the Norfolk Southern directly owns and operates 21,500 miles of track in 21 states: [[Alabama]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]]. In addition, Norfolk Southern owns track in [[Washington D.C.]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. It operates three primary hubs in its system, in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[Chicago]] and [[Atlanta]].

Furthermore, Norfolk Southern has rights to operate its trains with its own crews on competing railroads' tracks. These [[trackage rights]] permit Norfolk Southern to operate as far west as [[Dallas, Texas]], as far north as [[Waterville, Maine]], and as far south as [[Miami, Florida]].  NS locomotives also occasionally operate on competitors' tracks throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] due to the practice of locomotive leasing and sharing undertaken by the Class I railroads.

Not including second, third and fourth main line trackage, yard trackage, and siding trackage, the Norfolk Southern directly operates some 21,500 miles (34,601 kilometers) of track. When the additional tracks are counted, however, the amount of track the Norfolk Southern Railway has direct control over rises to over 38,000 miles (61,155 kilometers).

The company has 26 major rail [[classification yard]]s, located in:

=== Chicago To Fort Wayne ===
This is probably the easiest route for NS trains to take from Chicago to Fort Wayne or vice versa. This route has many passing sidings which allow trains coming from one direction to stop while another train passes. The longest passing siding on this section of the railroad is located in [[Hobart, Indiana]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== Chicago Bypass ===
''See'' [[Kankakee Belt Route]]

== Locomotives ==
Norfolk Southern is currently still buying [[direct current|DC]] traction [[diesel]] locomotives. In fact, the only [[alternating current|AC]] traction diesels on their roster are [[EMD SD80MAC]]s which all were inherited from Conrail.

Norfolk Southern's GE Dash-9 locomotives are often called "catfish" by [[railfan]]s, as the stripes are said to look like catfish whiskers.  The locomotive numbered 4610, a [[General Motors Electro-Motive Division|GM]]-[[EMD GP59]], is painted in predecessor [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] colors of green and white with gold trim and is a favorite of [[railfan]]s.  The work was done at the [[Debutts Yard]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] during the summer of 1994 and the locomotive received a repaint in the summer of 2004. Sadly. the builders plates on this unit were stolen within a year of its original commemorative painting.  [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN) enthusiasts are hoping that Norfolk Southern will paint another commemorative locomotive in VGN colors and livery for the upcoming centennial of that NS predecessor which will occur in 2007.

The current paint scheme for NS is black and white.  Many of the locomotives are painted with a rearing horse on the nose (consistent with prior marketing campaigns where NS billed itself as "The Thoroughbred").

In 2005, Norfolk Southern added two new types of locomotives to the system the [[EMD SD70M-2]]s, which when all are delivered, will be numbered 2649-2778, and [[GE ES40DC]]s, which will be numbered 7500-7664.

== Reporting Marks ==
Railroads use initials as reporting marks, a universal system intended to help keep track of rolling stock and financial transactions between railroads. Although it has been widely known as simply Norfolk Southern since 1982, the corporate structure and reporting marks are more complicated. In [[1990]], Southern Railway Company was renamed Norfolk Southern Railway Co. Its Norfolk and Western Railway company was merged into the Norfolk Southern Railway in [[1997]]. In [[1999]], when most of [[Conrail]]'s ex-[[Pennsylvania Railroad]] trackage was sold to the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Pennsylvania Railway Lines was created, and PRR reporting marks used on the former [[Conrail]] motive power and rolling stock. 

=== List of reporting marks ===
* '''AGS''' - [[Alabama Great Southern Railroad]]
* '''CG''' sometimes '''CoG'''{{Fact|date=February 2007}} - [[Central of Georgia Railway]]
* '''CNTP''' - [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway]] (CNO&TP)

== Awards and recognition ==
As of May, 2006, Norfolk Southern has been selected as the Group A [[E.H. Harriman Award|Gold Harriman Award]] recipient for a record 17 consecutive years beginning in 1989.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nscorp.com/nscorp/application;JSESSIONID_nscorp=E0D2wDZLZ8t844Gn6WZDlSVqmCEM2UEJtEicpNZ1tBcpy4wFlISk!-1862265230?origin=content.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=NS+News&contentId=english/nscorp/news/whats_new/whats_new/news051606.html| title= Railroads Set Another Employee Safety Record in 2005| author=Association of American Railroads (reprinted by Norfolk Southern Railroad)| year=[[2006-05-16]]| accessdate=2006-05-24|}}</ref>  This record was extended on [[May 17]] [[2007]], when Norfolk Southern was again awarded the Gold medal for Group A.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.aar.org/Index.asp?NCID=4002| title=Railroad Employees Post Safest Year Ever in 2006| publisher=Association of American Railroads| date=[[2007-05-17]]| accessdate=2007-05-18| }}</ref>  The Harriman Award is intended to recognize railroads with outstanding safety achievements.

== Milestones ==
*The Southern Railway in 1953 was the first [[Class 1 railroad|Class 1 U.S. Freight Railroad]] to completely convert to [[diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] motive power. (Excepting later steam-powered excursions). On [[June 17]], the last steam-powered freight run arrives in Chattanooga, Tennessee behind Heavy Mikado No. 6330 and the fires are dropped for the final time since [[Christmas Day, 1830]], when the "Best Friend of Charleston" made its first run on the South Carolina Canal & Railroad Company.

*The Norfolk and Western Railway in 1960 was the last Class 1 U.S. Freight Railroad to discontinue [[steam locomotive|steam]] motive power operations. (Also excepting later steam-powered excursions)

*CONRAIL in 1981 was the last Class 1 U.S. Freight Railroad to discontinue motive power using [[electric locomotive]]s powered by [[overhead wires]].
