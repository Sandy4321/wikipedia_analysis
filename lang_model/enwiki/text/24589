[[File:Fish Kill 745F2A9C-65B8-D693-7ABA3282F6A1ECE4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|There are many causes of fish kill, but [[oxygen depletion]] is the most common cause.]] 

The term '''fish kill''', known also as '''fish die-off''' and (in Britain) as '''[[fish mortality]]''', is a localized die-off of [[fish]] populations which may also be associated with more generalised mortality of aquatic life.<ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www.epa.gov/305b/98report/98brochure.pdf "The Quality of Our Nation<U+2019>s Waters - A Summary of the National Water Quality Inventory: 1998 Report to Congress."] Document no. EPA-841-S-00-001. p. 18.</ref><ref>University of Florida. Gainesville, FL (2005). [http://aquat1.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/fiskil.html "Fish kill."] ''Plant Management in Florida's Waters.''</ref> The most common cause is reduced oxygen in the water, which in turn may be due to factors such as [[drought]], [[algae bloom]], [[overpopulation]], or a sustained increase in water temperature. [[Fish diseases and parasites|Infectious diseases and parasites]] can also lead to fish kill. [[Toxicity]] is a real but far less common cause of fish kill.<ref>Noga, Fish Disease: Diagnosis and Treatment, 2010, John Wiley and Sons ISBN 0813806976, p. 316</ref> 

==Indicators of environmental stress== 
[[File:Dead and dying Cyprinus carpio carpio in Lake Albert.jpg|thumb|right|Dead and dying [[European carp]] in [[Lake Albert]]. Fish kills are often a sign of environmental stress.]]

Fish kills are often the first visible signs of [[environment]]al stress and are usually investigated as a matter of urgency by environmental agencies to determine the cause of the kill. Many fish species have a relatively low tolerance of variations in environmental conditions and their death is often a potent indicator of problems in their environment that may be affecting other animals and plants and may have a direct impact on other uses of the water such as for [[drinking water]] production. Pollution events may affect fish species and [[Age class structure|fish age classes]] in different ways. If it is a cold-related fish kill, juvenile fish and/or species that are not cold-tolerant may be selectively affected. If [[toxicity]] is the cause, species are more generally affected and the event may include amphibians and shellfish as well. A reduction in [[dissolved oxygen]] may affect larger specimens more than smaller fish as these may be able to access oxygen richer water at the surface, at least for a short time.

==Causes==
Fish kills may result from a variety of causes, most frequently [[hypoxia (environmental)|ecological hypoxia]] (oxygen depletion). The hypoxic event may be brought on by factors including high [[temperatures]]<ref>Oregon State University (2006). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-dhe103006.php "Deadly hypoxic event finally concludes"],</ref>, [[weather]], [[drought]], [[thermal pollution]] and [[algal bloom|algae bloom]]s. Fish kills may also occur due to the presence of [[disease]], [[agricultural runoff|agricultural]] and [[sewage]] [[surface runoff|runoff]], [[oil]] or [[chemical]] spill, [[hazardous waste]] spills, [[earthquake|sea-quake]]s, inappropriate re-stocking of fish, [[poaching]] with chemicals, underwater [[explosion]]s, and other catastrophic events that upset a normally stable aquatic population.<ref>University of Florida. Gainesville, FL (2005). [http://aquat1.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/fiskil.html "Fish kill."] ''Plant Management in Florida's Waters.''</ref>

[[File:Scheme eutrophication-en.svg|thumb|300px|left|Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. [[Eutrophication]] can have devastating consequences for the health of [[Benthos|benthic life]]]]
===Oxygen depletion===
Oxygen enters the water through [[diffusion]]. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water depends on the [[atmospheric pressure]], the water temperature and whether the water is salty.<ref>http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/oxygen-solubility-water-d_841.html</ref> For example, at 20<U+00B0>C (68<U+00B0>F) and one atmosphere of pressure, a maximum of 8 mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in [[sea water]] (35 mg/l [[salinity]]) while a maximum of 9 mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in fresh water. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the water decreases by about 1 mg/l for each 10<U+00B0>C increase in water temperature above 20<U+00B0>C. 

Many cold water fish that have evolved to live in clean cold waters become stressed when oxygen concentrations fall below 8 mg/l whilst warm water fish generally need at least 5 ppm (5 mg/l) of dissolved oxygen. Fish can endure short periods of reduced oxygen. Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. Oxygen levels normally fluctuate even over the course of a day and are affected by weather, temperature, the amount of sunlight available, and the amount of living and dead plant and animal matter in the water.<ref name = "BGWM">A Beginner<U+2019>s Guide to Water Management <U+2013> Fish Kills, Information Circular 107, University of Florida IFAS Extension, 2003 [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_fish_kills read online]</ref>  In temperate zones oxygen levels in [[eutrophic]] rivers in summertime can exhibit very large [[diurnal]] fluctuations with many hours of oxygen [[supersaturation]] during daylight followed by [[oxygen depletion]] at night.<ref>[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Dissolved Oxygen]</ref> Associated with these [[photosynthetic]] rhythms there is a matching [[pH]] rhythm as [[bicarbonate ion]] is metabolised by plant cells. This can lead to pH stress even when oxygen levels are high.

Additional dissolved organic loads are the most common cause of oxygen depletion and such organic loads may come from [[sewage]], [[farm]] waste, tip [[leachate]] and many other sources

===Drought===
A [[drought]] can lead to lower water volumes so that even if the water contains a high level of dissolved oxygen, the reduced volume may not be enough for the fish population.  Droughts often occur in conjunction with high temperatures so that the oxygen [[carrying capacity]] of the water may also be reduced. Low river flows also reduce the available dilution for permitted discharges of treated sewage or [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial waste]]. The reduced dilution increases the organic demand for oxygen further reducing the oxygen concentration available to fish

===Algae bloom===
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|A large algal bloom off the southern coast of England in 1999]]
{{See also|Algae bloom}}

An [[algae bloom]] is the appearance of a large amount of [[algae]] or [[scum]] floating on the surface of a body of water.  Algae blooms are a natural occurrence in nutrient-rich lakes and rivers, though sometimes increased nutrient levels leading to algae blooms are due to fertilizer or animal waste [[Land runoff|runoff]].  A few species of algae produce [[toxin]]s, but most fish kills due to algae bloom are a result of decreased oxygen levels.  When the algae die, [[decomposition]] uses oxygen in the water that would be available to fish. A fish kill in a lake in Estonia in 2002 was attributed to a combination of algae bloom and high temperatures.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zGqUHtmTCuoC&pg=PA67&dq=%22fish+kill%22&hl=en&ei=ESMVTY7LFIyqsAPrkq3GCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22fish%20kill%22&f=false Fish kill in Estonia lake in 2002 due to combination of algae bloom and high temps]</ref>   When people manage algae blooms in [[fish pond]]s,  it is recommended that treatments be staggered to avoid too much algae dying at once, which may result in a large drop in oxygen content.

===Biological decay===
Just as an algae bloom can lead to oxygen depletion, introduction of a large amount of [[decay]]ing biological material in general to a body of water leads to oxygen depletion as [[microorganism]]s use up available oxygen in the process of breaking down [[organic matter]].  For example, a 10-mile-long fish kill in September, 2010, in the [[Sangamon River]] in Illinois was traced to discharge of animal waste into the river from a large [[dairy]] operation.  The illegal discharge resulted in a complete kill of fish, frogs, [[mussel]]s and [[mudpuppy|mudpuppies]].<ref>[http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/09/iepa-investigates-10-mile-long-fish-kill-in-illinois.html  Read the news story online at chicagobreakingnews.com]</ref>

===Water temperature===
A fish kill can occur with rapid fluctuations in temperature or sustained high temperatures.  Generally, cooler water has the potential to hold more oxygen, so a period of sustained high temperatures can lead to decreased dissolved oxygen in a body of water.  An August, 2010, fish kill in [[Delaware Bay]] was attributed to low oxygen as a result of high temperatures.<ref>[http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/fish-kill-in-delaware-bay-still-a-mystery-to-nj-dep August 2010 fish kill in Delaware Bay linked to high temperatures <U+2013> low oxygen]</ref>

A massive (hundreds of thousands) fish kill at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] in Louisiana, September, 2010, was attributed to a combination of high temperatures and low tide.  Such kills are known to happen in this region in late summer and early fall, but this one was unusually large.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/slideshow?articleId=USRTR2IDT7  Reuter<U+2019>s News Service report of massive fish kill at the mouth of the Mississippi River in September, 2010. The Division of Wildlife stated that the fish kill was unrelated to the oil spill that had recently occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.  [http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ read related story online]</ref>

A short period of hot weather can increase temperatures in the surface layer of water, as the warmer water tends to stay near the surface and be further heated by the air.  In this case, the top warmer layer may have more oxygen than the lower, cooler layers because it has constant access to atmospheric oxygen. If a heavy wind or cold rain then occurs (usually during the autumn but sometimes in summer), the [[Stratification (water)|layers can mix]].  If the volume of low oxygen water is much greater than the volume in the warm surface layer, this mixing can reduce oxygen levels throughout the [[water column]] and lead to fish fill.

Fish kills can also result from a dramatic or prolonged drop in air (and thus, water) temperature. This kind of fish kill is selective - usually the dead fish are species that cannot tolerate cold. This has been observed in cases where a fish native to a more tropical region has been introduced to cooler waters, such as the introduction of the [[tilapia]] to bodies of water in Florida. Native to Africa<U+2019>s Nile River, the tilapia stop feeding when water temperatures drop below 60<U+00B0>F and die when it reaches 45<U+00B0>F. Thus, tilapia that have survived and successfully reproduced in Florida are occasionally killed by a winter cold front.<ref name="BGWM"/> 

In January, 2011, a selective fish kill affecting an estimated 2 million juvenile [[Spot croaker|spot fish]] was attributed to a combination of cold stress and overpopulation after a particularly large spawn.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/06/maryland.fish.kill/index.html?iref=obinsite CNN story on Jan 6, 2011 Fish kill in Maryland]</ref>

===Spawning fatalities===
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|right|A [[salmon]] which has died after spawning]]

Some species of fish exhibit mass simultaneous mortality as part of their natural life cycle.
Fish kill due to spawning fatalities can occur when fish are exhausted from [[Spawn (biology)|spawning activities]] such as courtship, nest building, and the release of eggs or [[milt]] (sperm). Fish are generally weaker after spawning and are less resilient than usual to smaller changes in the environment.  Examples include the [[Atlantic salmon]] and the [[Sockeye salmon]] where many of the females routinely die immediately after spawning.

===Overstocking===
Fish kill due to insufficient oxygen is really a matter of too much demand and too little supply for whatever reason(s).  [[Overstock]]ing of fish (or an unusually large [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]) can thus lead to fish kill by itself.  Recommended [[Fish stock|stocking densities]] are available from many sources for bodies of water ranging from a home [[aquarium]] or backyard pond to commercial [[aquaculture]] facilities.

===Disease===
{{See also|Fish diseases and parasites}}

Fish are subject to various viruses, bacteria and fungi in addition to parasites such as protozoans, flukes and worms, or crustaceans.  These are naturally occurring in many bodies of water, and fish that are stressed for other reasons, such as spawning or suboptimal water quality, are more susceptible.  Signs of disease include sores, missing scales or lack of slime, strange growths or visible parasites, and abnormal behavior <U+2013> lazy, erratic, gasping at the water surface or floating head, tail or belly up.   

[[File:Cadmans Pool, New Forest. - geograph.org.uk - 61031.jpg|thumb|left|This pond in [[New Forest]], England, has been restored following a [[viral infection]] which killed all the fish.]]

For example, since 2004 fish kills have been observed in the [[Shenandoah River]] basin in the spring, from the time water temperatures are in the 50s (<U+00B0>F) until they reach the mid-70s.  So far, investigators suspect certain [[bacteria]], along with environmental and contaminant factors that may cause [[immune suppression]].<ref>[http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkill.html information from the Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia, USA]; see also [http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkillhistory.html History of fish kills in the Shenandoah watershed, Virginia]</ref>

In [[fish farming]], where populations are optimized for the available resources,  [[parasites]] or [[disease]] can spread quickly.  In [[channel catfish]] [[Aquaculture of catfish|aquaculture ponds]], for example, the <U+201C>hamburger gill disease<U+201D> is caused by a [[protozoan]] called ''Aurantiactinomyxon'' and can kill all the fish in an affected pond.  In addition to altered behavior, affected fish have swollen gills that are mottled and have the appearance of ground hamburger meat.<ref name="BGWM"/> 

Some early warning signs of fish suffering from disease or parasite infections include:<ref>[http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/420/420-252/420-252.pdf Fish Kills - Their Causes and Prevention, Virginia Tech, Virginia Cooperative Extension Publication 420-252, 2009]</ref>
#Discoloration, open sores, reddening of the skin, bleeding, black or white spots on the skin
#Abnormal shape, swollen areas, abnormal lumps, or popeyes
#Abnormal distribution of the fish such as crowding at the surface, inlet, or pond edges (though crowding at the surface during specific times of day, such as early morning, is more likely a sign of low oxygen)
#Abnormal activity such as flashing, twisting, whirling, convulsions, loss of buoyancy
#Listlessness, weakness, sluggishness, lack of activity
#Loss of appetite or refusal to feed

===Underwater explosions===
[[Image:Blastfishing.jpg|thumb|right|Fish kill induced by [[blast fishing]]]]

[[Underwater explosion]]s can lead to fish kill, and fish with [[swim bladder]]s are more susceptible. Sometimes underwater explosions are used on purpose to induce fish kills, a generally illegal practice known as [[blast fishing]]. Underwater explosions may be accidental or planned, such as for construction, [[seismic]] testing, mining or blast testing of structures under water.  In many places, an assessment of potential effects of underwater explosions on marine life must be completed and preventive measures taken before blasting.<ref>Lewis, 1996, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Life in the Sea, report DSTO-GD-0080 to the Australian Department of Defence [http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3763/1/DSTO-GD-0080%20PR.pdf read online];  Govoni, et al., 2008, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Larval Fish: Implications for a Coastal Engineering Project, Journal of Coastal Research 2(S):228-233 doi: 10.2112/05-0518.1</ref>

===Toxins===
[[Agricultural runoff]], [[sewage]], [[surface runoff]], [[chemical spill]]s, [[hazardous waste]] spills can all potentially lead to water [[toxicity]] and fish kill.  Some algae species also produce toxins.  In Florida, these include ''[[Aphanizomenon]]'', ''[[Anabaena]]'' and ''Microcystis''.  Some notable fish kills in Louisiana in the 1950s were due to a specific [[pesticide]] called [[endrin]].<ref>Larson et al., 1997, Pesticides in Surface Waters: distribution, trends and governing factors. CRC Press ISBN 1575040069 p. 278</ref>

Natural instances of toxic conditions can occur, especially in poorly [[Buffer solution|buffer]]ed water. [[Aluminium]] compound can cause complete fish kills, sometimes associated with autumn turn-over of lakes leading to complex chemical interactions between pH, [[calcium]] ions and complex [[polymer|polymeric]] salts of Aluminium <ref>[http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf]</ref>

Human-induced fish kills are unusual, but occasionally a spilled substance causes direct toxicity or a shift in water temperature or pH that can lead to fish kill.  For example, in 1997 a [[phosphate]] plant in [[Mulberry]], Florida, accidentally dumped 60 million gallons of acidic process water into Skinned Sapling Creek, reducing the pH from about 8 to less than 4 along for about 36 miles and resulting in the death of about 1.3 million fish.<ref name="BGWM"/> 

It is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a potential toxin is the direct cause of a fish kill.  For example, hundreds of thousands of fish died after an accidental spill of [[bourbon]] into the [[Kentucky River]] near Lawrenceburg. However, officials could not determine whether the fish kill was due to the bourbon directly or to oxygen depletion that resulted when aquatic [[microbe]]s rapidly began to consume and digest the liquor.<ref name="BGWM"/> 

[[Cyanide]] is a particular toxic compound that has been used to poach fish. In cyanide poisoning the gills turn a distinctive cherry red. [[Chlorine]] introduced as alkaline hypochlorite solution is also extremely toxic <ref>[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/202794/nsw-fish-kill.pdf Fish Kills in New South Wales]</ref> leaving pale mucilaginous gills and an over-production of mucilage across the whole body. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] produces similar symptoms but is also often associated with milk eyes.

==Estimation ==
Estimating the magnitude of a kill presents a number of problems.<ref name= "Labay">{{cite journal |last1=Labay |first1=Andrew A. |last2=Bizan |first2=Dave |year=1999 |title=A Comparison of Fish Kill Counting Procedures on a Small, Narrow Stream |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=209-214 |publisher=American Fisheries Society |doi=10.1577/1548-8675(1999)019<0209:ACOFKC>2.0.CO;2  |url=http://afsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8675%281999%29019%3C0209:ACOFKC%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate= }}</ref>
#Polluted waters are often very [[turbidity|turbid]] or have low transparency making it difficult or impossible to see fish that have sunk
#Rivers and streams can move fish downstream out of the investigation area.
#Small fish and [[Fry (biology)|fry]] can decompose  or become buried in sediments very quickly and are lost from the count.
#[[Predator]]s and [[scavenger]]s remove and eat fish.
#Stressed fish may swim up tributaries and die there
#Many kills are reported only when dead fish resurface due to decompositional gas formation, often several hours after the kill has occurred.  
Some very large fish kills may never be estimated because of these factors. The discharge of red aluminium [[sludge]] from a reservoir in [[Hungary]] into the Marcai River is acknowledged as causing environmental devastation,<ref>
{{cite news |title=Hungarian chemical sludge spill reaches Danube |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11491412 |newspaper=BBC News |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate= }}</ref> The loss of adult fish also can have long term impacts on the success of the fishery as the following year's [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] stock may have been lost and recovery of the  pre-kill population may take years to recover. The loss of food supplies or recreational income may be very significant to the local economy.<ref>Environment Agency, UK (2009). [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/Preventing_fish_mortalities_-_Life_after_a_fish_mortality.pdf "Life after a fish mortality."]</ref>

==Prevention==
Fish kills are difficult to predict. Even when conditions that contribute to fish kill are known to exist, prevention is hard because often conditions cannot be improved and fish cannot be safely removed in time. In small ponds, mechanical [[water aeration|aeration]] and/or removal of decaying matter (such as fallen leaves or dead algae) may be reasonable and effective preventive measures.

==Investigation==
Many countries in the developed world have specific provisions in place to encourage the public to report fish kills<ref>[http://research.myfwc.com/fishkill/submit.asp Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute - Submit A Fish Kill Report]</ref> so that a proper investigation can take place.<ref>Environment Agency, UK (2010-12-22). [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/commercial/40101.aspx "Fish mortality investigations."]</ref> Investigation of the cause of a kill requires a multi-disciplinary approach including on-site [[Water quality#Measurement|environmental measurements]], investigation of inputs, review of meteorology and past history, toxicology, fish autopsy, invertebrate analysis and a robust knowledge of the area and its problems.<ref>Pierce, Robert A.; May, Thomas W.; Suppes, V.
