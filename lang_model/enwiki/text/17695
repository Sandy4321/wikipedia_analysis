'''Shun Tak Centre''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese:]] <U+4FE1><U+5FB7><U+4E2D><U+5FC3>) is a commercial and transport complex on the northern shore of [[Hong Kong Island]] in [[Sheung Wan]], [[Hong Kong]].  It comprises a 4-storey podium containing a shopping centre and car park, two 38-storey office towers, and the [[Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong|Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal]].

Shun Tak Centre is the headquarters of [[Shun Tak Group]], the principal Hong Kong operating company of [[Stanley Ho|Dr. Stanley Ho]], the [[Macau]] casino tycoon.

==History==
The Shun Tak Centre was built on the site of the old Macau Ferry Piers and the Sheung Wan night market.  The first part, completed in 1984, was the easternmost section and No. 1 Tower, now known as China Merchants Tower.  Originally No. 1 Tower was partly occupied by the Hotel Victoria, but this was never a success, and No. 1 Tower was later converted to all office use.{{fact}}  No. 2 Tower, now called Western Tower, was built on a different orientation, giving the property on close examination a slightly asymmetric appearance.

==Transport==
Shun Tak Centre is a minor transport hub, with direct access to the [[Sheung Wan (MTR)|Sheung Wan Station]] of the MTR, a [[bus terminal]] adjacent to the east, a large taxi stand, and the piers for ferry services to Macau and China.  It is also convenient to the southern portal of the [[Western Harbour Crossing]].{{fact}}
