==Sections of interest (north to south)==
From about halfway between Cromer and Overstrand to Mundesley the road parallels the disused course of the [[Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway]], which can be glimpsed from time to time.

A quarter mile stretch at [[Walcott, Norfolk|Walcott]] is the only section of this "coast road" that actually runs beside and within sight of the sea.
