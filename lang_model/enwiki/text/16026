'''The Ray''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]], all [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

The first Ray was a [[Quality Comics]] character who was one of those purchased by DC Comics. He was later [[retconned]] as a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].<ref name="dc-free">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Freedom Fighters | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 131 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = .}}</ref> His son, the second Ray, and Stan Silver, the third, were created by DC.

==Fictional character biography==
===Lanford "Happy" Terrill===
Prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] reboot, Happy Terrill was originally described as having been exposed to lightning and sunlight at the same time while ballooning, and gained energy-based super-powers.

His post-Crisis origin is more involved. Before World War II, the government established a secret group known as RONOL (Research on the Nature of Light).  One RONOL member, Dr. Dayzl, theorized that the light that originated millennia ago where Earth now orbits would eventually circumnavigate the universe and return as a dangerous, conscious entity.

The only way to stop the "Light Entity," Dayzl believed, was to talk to it.  Tricking a reporter named Happy Terrill into joining them, Dayzl and his assistants staged an upper atmosphere ballooning "accident," making certain Terrill was exposed to a genetic "light bomb."  Dayzl calculated that Terrill's offspring would be a unification of human and light energy, a potential liaison to the Light Entity.  Unaware of the truth, Terrill used his resulting powers to become the super-heroic Ray.  Simultaneously, RONOL lost government backing due to Dayzl's unorthodox beliefs. Dayzl's fate remains unknown. 

In 1950, after learning the truth, Terrill vowed to quit his Ray identity. Happy and his first wife, had a child named Joshua.  For a time Joshua accompanied Ray on missions as his sidekick "Spitfire".  However Joshua was prone to violent outbursts, he was place in suspended animation in the 1950s only to wake up again in the future, still only 10 years old.  After a brief association with his old team, the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] in the 70s, he had married and settled down.  Everything seemed normal until Happy saw his newborn son glowing with crackling energy in the hospital nursery. Happy was convinced Dayzl's theories were correct.  He now knew his son would one day have the power to confront the Light Entity.  Not wanting to put his wife through torment, Happy told her that the baby had died and then set up his son with a foster father (Happy's brother Thomas).

In the 2008 ''Freedom Fighters'' series, Terrill is asked by [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] to ask [[Neon the Unknown]] for help. When Neon, completely detached from humanity, refuses, Terrill drinks from the waters of his oasis, becoming a new Neon the Unknown, known simply as "Neon".

===Ray Terrill===
{{main|Ray (Ray Terrill)}}
Ray Terrill was told he was hyper-sensitive to light and exposure to sunlight would kill him.  Privately tutored in his window-darkened home, Ray's most earnest wish was for normalcy.  The media called him Night Boy.  His only friend during his formative years was his neighbor, Jennifer Jurden.  At eighteen, by his supposed father's deathbed, Ray learned his life was a lie.  He was not allergic to light, nor did he have to live in darkness.  Most disturbing of all, he discovered his true father was the 40s war-time super-hero, the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Ray.

===Stan Silver===

The reformed Freedom Fighters have a member called the Ray, who has similar powers to the Terrills. The new Ray is '''Stan Silver'''. He was described by Justin Gray as being "capable of turning his body into a living laser light" and "the playboy of the group".<ref>{{cite web| title ="MEETING THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS WITH GRAY & PAMIOTTI" | accessdate = 2007-05-12| date = 2006-05-11| publisher = Newsarama| url =http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/USFF_INT.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507103253/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/USFF_INT.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-07}}</ref> Stan likes to show off in front of the media.

Working as a [[foreign correspondent]] for the Washington Sun, Silver was exposed to upper atmosphere radiation while covering a story, thus gaining power over various forms of light. Recruited by [[S.H.A.D.E.]], Silver begins using his powers in the service of his government. He is, however, something of a womanizing egomaniac in his civilian persona. Silver later defects from S.H.A.D.E. to join [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]]'s new group of Freedom Fighters.

In ''Uncle Sam and Freedom Fighters'' # 6, Silver reveals that he is a double agent still loyal to S.H.A.D.E. He turns on his teammates and kills the [[Invisible Hood]]. Immediately after, the colors of his "costume" were inverted, becoming blue instead of yellow.

In ''Uncle Sam and Freedom Fighters'' # 7, he battles his former teammates and is defeated by Ray Terrill, and is sent back to [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]]. He is later seen outside the White House with S.H.A.D.E.'s other super-soldiers, who join Father Time in the timestream after the battle ends.

==Powers and abilities==
*All versions of the Ray can absorb, store and process pure light and use the energy to fly and create dazzlingly strong and powerful bursts of light. In his Golden Age appearances, Happy Terrill was able to manipulate other forms of energy such as electricity and magnetism. 
*The Terrills were also capable of manipulating and controlling light externally to create illusions and even solid light constructs, as well as render themselves invisible.
*Later in Happy's career (while mentoring/antagonising his son), he was shown to have a greater mastery of his abilities. For example, by using "solid light vibrations," essentially resonating the target's inner ear, he was able to approximate telepathic communication.
*Ray Terrill is capable of converting his body completely into light energy. No physical harm can come to him in this form. ([[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Main article]])
*Stan Silver's full abilities and powers are largely undocumented.  As noted above, he is apparently "capable of turning his body into a living laser light."

==Other versions==
*In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-10". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-X, including the Quality characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to the "Happy" Terrill Ray appears.<ref>

*The 2007 series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' introduces several alternate versions of the Ray. On Earth-6, the former [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] ([[Ray Palmer (comics)|Ray Palmer]]) has become his world's Ray, a [[Nazism|Nazi]] Ray exists on "Earth-10" and his closest Earth-50 parallel is prominent [[Wildstorm Universe]] character [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]], a [[Superman]] [[pastiche]] who debuted in the early 90s. It is strange to note that on Earth-10, Ray's Freedom Fighters are supposed to be the opposition of the fascist JL-Axis (the fascist Ray's costume matches Ray Terril's new uniform, so the heroic Ray on the Freedom Fighters could be his father, Happy), and Apollo is more commonly viewed as a Superman parallel (he is placed with the Rays apparently due to his light-based powers).

*A version of the Ray appears in the book ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' as one of the heroes loyal to Superman.  He is also mentioned in being instrumental in stripping the radiation out of the Kansas soil both for the construction of the Gulag and Superman's reclamation of the land at the end of the story.  It is not specified which incarnation of the Ray this is, although in promo art he is referred to as Ray II. In the final issue of ''52'', the setting of ''Kingdome Come'' was designated Earth-22 in the new Multiverse.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Ray makes several background appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series, although he is not given any lines. The ''Justice League Unlimited'' comic book established in #17 that this was Ray Terrill, and included Happy as a member of the Freedom Fighters.
* The Lanford Terrill version of Ray appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Cry Freedom Fighters" voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].
