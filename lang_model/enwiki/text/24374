}}'''King Solomon "Sol" White''' (June 12, 1868 - August 26, 1955) was an American professional [[baseball]] [[infielder]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] and executive, and one of the pioneers of the [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]]. An active sportswriter for many years, he wrote the first definitive history of black baseball in 1907. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2006|2006]].

== Early life ==

Born in [[Bellaire, Ohio]], White's early life is not well-documented. According to the 1870 and 1880 U.S. Census, his family (parents and two oldest siblings) came from Virginia. His father, Saul Solomon White, apparently passed away when White was very young. White's mother, Judith, supported Sol and four siblings with her work as a "washer woman."<ref>White 2014, p. xii</ref> White "learned to play ball when quite a youngster."<ref name="White 1995, p. 5">White 1995, p. 5.</ref>

== Playing career ==

As a teenager White was a fan of the Bellaire Globes, local amateurs. The journalist Floyd J. Calvin recounts the story of how White got a chance to play for his team. The Globes were playing a team from Marietta, Ohio. "One of the Globes players got his finger smashed and since they all knew Sol, the captain pushed him into the game. Sol will always remember that game for the captain and second baseman of the Marietta team was none other than [[Ban Johnson|Ban B. Johnson]], in later years president of the [[American League]] and a leading sportsman of the West. Sol takes pride in having played against Ban when he was an obscure captain of a hick town club."<ref name="Calvin, March 12, 1927">Calvin, March 12, 1927.</ref>

[[File:1887 Wheeling.JPG|left|thumb|1887 Wheeling Green Stockings, with Sol White standing second from left.]]
White quickly made a name for himself as a ballplayer. By the time he was 16, he "attracted the attention of managers of independent teams throughout the Ohio Valley and his services were in great demand."<ref name="White 1995, p. 5"/> Originally a shortstop, White eventually "developed into a great all-round player filling any position from catcher to right field."<ref>White 1995, p.5.</ref> In 1887 he joined the [[Pittsburgh Keystones (baseball)|Pittsburgh Keystones]] of the [[National Colored Base Ball League]][http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/pirates/s_460150.html] as a left fielder and later second baseman. He was batting .308 when the league folded after a week of play.<ref name="Riley 1994, p. 836">Riley 1994, p. 836.</ref> He then joined the Wheeling (West Virginia) Green Stockings of the [[Ohio State League]] and batted .370 with a slugging percentage of .502 as the team's third baseman.

In the off-season the Ohio State League renamed itself the [[Tri-State League]] and banned black players, including White. [[Weldy Walker]], an African American catcher for the league's Akron club, wrote an eloquent open letter to league officials protesting the decision. It was published in [[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|The Sporting Life]] in March 1888, and within a few weeks the ban was rescinded.<ref>Walker, March 14, 1888.</ref><ref>White 1995, pp. 79-81.</ref> White was resigned and sent to join his team on the road, but the Wheeling manager, [[Al Buckenberger]], refused to accept him, and he was released.<ref>White 2014, p. xiv.</ref> He rejoined the Pittsburgh Keystones, and played in a "Colored Championship" tournament held in New York City, in which the Keystones finished second to the [[Cuban Giants]].<ref>White 1995, p. 16</ref>

[[File:Cuban Giants 1890.gif|left|thumb|1890 York Colored Monarchs]]
White spent 1889 with the [[New York Gorhams]], a black team that spent part of the season in the [[Middle States League]].<ref>Lomax 2003, p. 98.</ref> White played both catcher and second base for the Gorhams.<ref>White 1995, p. 5</ref> The next year, he joined the [[York Colored Monarchs]] of the [[Eastern Interstate League]], a white-owned team that signed up most of the 1889 [[Cuban Giants]]. White played second base, hit .350, and stole 21 bases in 54 games. In 1891 he played for the [[New York Gorhams|Big Gorhams]] of New York, a team that he later called "without a doubt one of the strongest teams ever gotten together, white or black."<ref>White 1995, p. 20.</ref> The Gorhams briefly represented [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], in the [[Connecticut State League]].<ref>Lomax 2003, p. 115.</ref>

In 1895 White batted .385 as a second baseman for [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] of the [[Western Interstate League]].<ref name="Riley 1994, p. 836"/> Later that year, White joined [[Bud Fowler]]'s barnstorming [[Page Fence Giants]] team, batting .404 as the Giants finished with a 118-36-2 record and played in 112 towns in 7 states.<ref>Riley 1994, pp. 596, 836.</ref>

White enrolled in [[Wilberforce University]] as a theology student in 1896, spending the next four years alternating between professional baseball with the [[Cuban X-Giants]] in the summer and college in the fall and winter.<ref>Hurd, October 7, 2011.</ref><ref>White 1995, p.5</ref> He was still listed as an athletic instructor at Wilberforce in 1900.<ref name="columbia1900" />

After a year as shortstop for the [[Chicago Columbia Giants]] in 1900 and one last season with the Cuban X-Giants in 1901, White moved to Philadelphia where he co-founded the [[Philadelphia Giants]]. His playing time was gradually curtailed as he concentrated on management.

According to research by Bob Davids, White spent all or part of five seasons in organized minor leagues, playing 152 games and hitting .359 with 169 runs scored, 231 hits, 40 doubles, and 41 stolen bases.<ref>White 1995, p. 161.</ref>

== Managerial career ==

[[File:1904 Philadelphia Giants.jpg|thumb|left|1904 Philadelphia Giants]]
Along with [[Walter Schlichter]], a sportswriter for the [[Philadelphia Item]], and Harry Smith, a baseball writer for the [[Philadelphia Tribune]], White founded the [[Philadelphia Giants]] in 1902. He served as the team's captain and manager. The Giants were at first paid on a profit-sharing "cooperative plan," but in 1903 White reorganized the team and put all the players on salary.<ref name="Calvin, March 12, 1927"/> The Giants lost a playoff for the colored championship to the [[Cuban X-Giants]] and their ace pitcher, [[Rube Foster]]. The following season White signed Foster, outfielder [[Pete Hill]], and second baseman [[Charlie Grant]], and the Philadelphia Giants won a championship series from the X-Giants, five games to two.

For 1905 White brought in [[Home Run Johnson]] of the X-Giants, and made the Philadelphia Giants into what he considered "the strongest organization of the time." The Giants went undefeated against [[New England League]] teams and swept four games from the Newark [[International League]] team.<ref name="Calvin, March 12, 1927"/> The Giants played a total of 158 games, winning 134, losing 21, and tying 3.<ref>White 2014, p. 92</ref> The powerful baseball promoter and team owner [[Nat Strong]] declared the 1904-1905 Philadelphia Giants "the best team in the history of the game."<ref>Wilson, January 16, 1926.</ref>

[[File:Sol White 1902 Philadelphia Giants.jpg|thumb|right|Sol White, 1902 Philadelphia Giants]]
Despite losing Johnson to the [[Brooklyn Royal Giants]] in 1906, the Giants won both the informal "colored championship" and the pennant of the racially-integrated [[International League of Independent Professional Base Ball Clubs]]. More player losses followed in 1907, as Rube Foster defected to the [[Leland Giants]] of Chicago. But White brought in eventual Hall of Famer [[John Henry Lloyd]] to play shortstop along with catcher [[Bruce Petway]], and the Giants finished first in the [[National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States and Cuba]], an all-black league. This marked the fourth consecutive year in which the Philadelphia Giants claimed the black professional championship.<ref>White 2014, p. xviii.</ref>

The Giants lost [[Pete Hill]] to the Lelands in 1908, and in 1909 Sol White left the team after a disagreement with Schlichter.<ref>White 2014, pp. xviii-xix.</ref> White managed the [[Philadelphia Quaker Giants]] for a year. In 1910 he was hired to manage the [[Brooklyn Royal Giants]], but had trouble controlling some of the players, and left after the season.<ref>White 2014, p. xix.</ref> For the following season [[Jess McMahon]] and his brother Eddie hired White to manage their new team, the [[Lincoln Giants|New York Lincoln Giants]]. White assembled another collection of top players, including [[John Henry Lloyd]], [[Spot Poles]], and [[William Francis (baseball)|Bill Francis]]. In July 1911 he raided his old team, the Philadelphia Giants, for their star rookie battery, [[Dick Redding]] and [[Louis Santop]]. As a result Schlichter could no longer keep the team running, and disbanded it.<ref>Walton, August 3, 1911.</ref> However, White quit the Lincolns before the season was over, replaced as manager by Lloyd.<ref name="White 2014, p. xx">White 2014, p. xx.</ref>

White was next hired to manage the [[Fe (baseball)|Fe]] club of the [[Cuban League]] for the 1911-12 winter season. He brought along Rube Foster and a number of American black players, but the team lost five of its first six games, and White and most of his players were released.<ref name="White 2014, p. xx"/><ref>Seamheads.com Negro Leagues Database, 1911-12 Fe</ref> After a year managing an obscure team called the Boston Giants, White retired from baseball, and returned to Bellaire.<ref name="Calvin, March 12, 1927"/>

He returned to baseball to serve as secretary for the [[Columbus Buckeyes (Negro leagues)|Columbus Buckeyes]] of the [[Negro National League (1920-1931)|Negro National League]] in 1921, and helped bring in his old player, John Henry Lloyd, as player-manager. White  then took on his last two managerial jobs, both in Cleveland: in 1922 he guided an independent club, the Fears Giants of Cleveland, and in 1924 he managed the [[Cleveland Browns (baseball)|Cleveland Browns]] of the Negro National League.<ref>Holway, p. 7</ref><ref>White 2014, p. xxi-xxii.</ref> His last job in baseball was as a coach for the 1926 [[Newark Stars]] of the [[Eastern Colored League]].<ref>White 2014, p. xxii.</ref>

== Negro league writings ==

[[File:History of Colored Base Ball 1907 cover.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of "History of Colored Base Ball" by Sol White, 1907]]
Sol White is perhaps best known for writing ''History of Colored Base Ball'', also known (on the title page) as ''Sol White<U+2019>s Official Base Ball Guide''. A small, 128-page, soft-covered pamphlet, ''History of Colored Base Ball'' was sold at [[Philadelphia Giants]] games in the spring of 1907.<ref>White 2014, p. xxiv-xxv.</ref><ref name="White 1995, p. xlvii">White 1995, p. xlvii.</ref>

The first chapter, "Colored Base Ball," begins with the organization in 1885 of the first professional colored baseball team, discusses the brusque removal of all black players from predominantly white teams during the next four years, and then traces the growing strength of "colored base ball" into the early years of the 20th century. This short book-within-a-book is history, but it can also be described as an almanac, a scorecard, an archive, a who's who of African-American baseball up to 1907.

In addition to White<U+2019>s narrative of the history of black professional teams, the book featured chapters on <U+201C>Colored Baseball as a Profession,<U+201D> <U+201C>The Color Line,<U+201D> and <U+201C>Managers<U+2019> Troubles,<U+201D> among others. [[Rube Foster]], one of White<U+2019>s former players, contributed a chapter on <U+201C>How to Pitch,<U+201D> and [[Home Run Johnson]] wrote a short essay on the <U+201C>Art and Science of Hitting.<U+201D> The book was also illustrated with 57 photographs of players, manager, and owners, many of them found nowhere else.<ref name="White 1995, p. xlvii"/>

White<U+2019>s ''History of Colored Base Ball'' was the first book devoted to black professional baseball, and it would remain the only one for more than 60 years, until [[Robert W. Peterson (writer)|Robert W. Peterson]] published ''Only the Ball Was White'' in 1970.  Today only five copies are known to exist.<ref>Ceresi & McMains.</ref>

Sol White<U+2019>s career as a baseball writer would continue with a series of articles on <U+201C>colored baseball<U+201D> in the ''Cleveland Advocate'', a black newspaper, in 1919.<ref>Thorn, March 26, 2014</ref> After he moved to the east coast in the 1920s he wrote articles and columns for the ''[[New York Age]]'' and the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]''.

In 1927 the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'' reported that White <U+201C>has a new book he would like to publish, a kind of second edition to his old one, bringing the game from 1907 down to date, and if there is anybody anywhere in sports circles who thinks enough of what has gone before to help Sol print his record, he will be glad to hear from them. Without a doubt this record will prove valuable in years to come.<U+201D> This second book on black baseball by Sol White never appeared.<ref name="Calvin, March 12, 1927"/>

== Personal life ==
[[File:Sol White plaque HOF.jpg|right|thumb|Sol White's plaque at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]]]
Sol White married Florence Fields on March 15, 1906. Their first child, a son named Paran Walter White (named after Sol's older brother), was born later that year. A second son, a boy, died when he was only two days old in August 1907. Paran died of kidney disease in April 1908. A third child, a daughter named Marion, lived to adulthood and survived her father. Florence and Sol White appear to have become separated at some point before 1930.<ref name="Thorn, May 26, 2014">Thorn, May 26, 2014.</ref>

When White was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2006, no family member was present, so Commissioner of Baseball [[Bud Selig]] accepted his plaque on the family's behalf.<ref name="Thorn, May 26, 2014"/>

== Death ==

White died at age 87 in [[Central Islip, New York]]. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Frederick Douglass Cemetery in the [[Oakwood, Staten Island|Oakwood]] neighborhood of Staten Island, New York City, until 2014, when the [[Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project]] installed a new headstone at his burial site. He had been the only  deceased member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] left lying in an unmarked grave. He remains the only Hall of Famer buried on Staten Island.<ref>Whirty, May 4, 2014.</ref><ref>Thorn, May 12, 2014.</ref>
