The '''magnetosphere of Jupiter''' is the cavity created in the [[solar wind]] by [[Jupiter|the planet]]'s immensely strong [[magnetic field]]. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of [[Saturn]] in the opposite direction, Jupiter's [[magnetosphere]] is the largest and most powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the [[Solar System]], and the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the [[heliosphere]]. Wider and flatter than the [[Earth's magnetosphere]], Jupiter's is stronger by an [[order of magnitude]], while its [[magnetic moment]] is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions at the end of 1950s and was directly observed by the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' spacecraft in 1973.

Jupiter's internal magnetic field is generated by electrical currents flowing in its outer core, which is composed of [[metallic hydrogen]]. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] eject large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas into space, forming a large [[gas torus|torus]] around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same [[angular velocity]] and direction as the planet's rotation. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is powered by Io's plasma and its own rotation, rather than by the [[solar wind]] like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents flowing in the magnetosphere generate permanent [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can thought of as a very weak [[radio pulsar]]. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including [[infrared]], [[visible light|visible]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[soft X-rays]].

The action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of [[particle radiation|radiation]] similar to Earth's [[Van Allen belts]], but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest [[Galilean moons|moons]] markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and are affected by the motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous [[Rings of Jupiter|planetary ring system]]. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and, potentially, humans.

==Structure==
Jupiter's magnetosphere is a complex structure comprizing a [[bow shock]], [[magnetopause]], [[magnetotail]], magnetodisk and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates from a number of different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the [[solar wind]], which carries the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].<ref name=Khurana12>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 12&ndash;13</ref>

===Internal magnetic field===
The bulk of Jupiter's magnetic field, like [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]]'s, is generated by an internal [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its [[outer core]]. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten [[iron]] and [[nickel]], Jupiter's is composed of [[metallic hydrogen]].<ref name=Russell1993-694/> As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a [[dipole]], with north and south magnetic poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis.<ref name=Khurana3/> However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere.<ref name=Kivelson303/>{{#tag:ref|The north and south poles of the Earth's dipole should not be confused with Earth's [[North magnetic pole]] and [[South magnetic pole]], which lie in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.|group=note}} Jupiter's field also has [[quadrupole]], [[octupole]] and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong.<ref name=Khurana3>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 3&ndash;5</ref>

The dipole is tilted roughly 10<U+00B0> from Jupiter's axis of rotation; the tilt is similar to that of the Earth (11.3<U+00B0>).<ref name=Smith/><ref name=Khurana3/> Its equatorial field strength is about 420&nbsp;[[microtesla|&mu;T]] (4.3&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]), which corresponds to a dipole [[magnetic moment]] of about 1.6{{Esp|20}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]]&middot;[[cubic meter|m<sup>3</sup>]]. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field 10 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment about 18,000&nbsp;times larger.<ref name=Russell1993-694>[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, p. 694</ref>{{#tag:ref|The magnetic moment is proportional to the product of the equatorial field strength and cube of the Jupiter's radius, which is 11 times larger than that of the Earth.|group=note}} Jupiter's magnetic field [[rotational period|rotates]] at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9&nbsp;h&nbsp;55&nbsp;m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] spacecraft in the mid-1970s.{{#tag:ref|For instance, the azimuthal orientation of the dipole changed by less than 0.01<U+00B0>.<ref name=Khurana3/>|group=note}}

===Size and shape===
Jupiter's internal magnetic field prevents the [[solar wind]], a stream of ionized particles emitted by the [[Sun]], from interacting directly with [[atmosphere of Jupiter|its atmosphere]], and instead diverts it away from the planet, effectively creating its own region, called a magnetosphere, composed of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] different from that of the solar wind.<ref name=Khurana1>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 1&ndash;3</ref> The  Jovian magnetosphere is so large that the [[Sun]] and its visible [[corona]] would fit inside it with room to spare.<ref name=Russell1993-715>[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, p. 715</ref> If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the [[full moon]] in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.<ref name=Russell1993-715/> 

As with Earth's magnetosphere, the boundary separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Jupiter's magnetosphere is called the [[magnetopause]]. The distance from the magnetopause to the center of the planet is from 45 to 100 R<sub>j</sub> (where R<sub>j</sub>=71,492&nbsp;km is the radius of Jupiter) at the [[subsolar point]]&mdash;the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer.<ref name=Khurana1/> The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on [[solar activity]].<ref name=Russell2001-1016>[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1015&ndash;1016</ref> In front of the magnetopause (at a distance of about 84 R<sub>j</sub> from the planet) lies the [[bow shock]], a [[wake]]-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp15>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 15&ndash;16</ref><ref name=Russell1993-725>[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, pp. 725&ndash;727</ref>  The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the [[magnetosheath]].<ref name=Khurana1/> 
[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's concept of a magnetosphere, where plasmasphere refers to the plasma torus and sheet]]
At the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing [[magnetotail]], which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of [[Saturn]].<ref name=Khurana17/> The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail [[current sheet]] (orange layer in the middle).<ref name=Khurana17>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 17&ndash;18</ref> Like Earth<U+2019>s, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the [[radiation belt]]s at distances closer than 10&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from Jupiter.<ref name=Khurana6>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 6&ndash;7</ref>

The shape of Jupiter's magnetosphere described above is sustained by the neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail plasma sheet, the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman-Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause.<ref name=Kivelson303/> These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana17/> They also interact substantially with the solar wind.<ref name=Kivelson303>[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 303&ndash;313</ref>

Jupiter's magnetosphere is traditionally divided into three parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>) and outer (further than 40&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).<ref name=Khurana1/>

===Role of Io===
[[Image:iotorus.jpg|thumb|300 px|Io's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. The Io plasma torus is in yellow.]]
Although overall the shape of Jupiter<U+2019>s magnetosphere resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different.<ref name=Russell2001-1016/> Jupiter's volcanically active moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000&nbsp;kg of new material every second.<ref name=Khurana5>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 5&ndash;7</ref> Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]], a major part of which is [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] into atoms and [[ionization|ionized]] by the solar [[ultraviolet radiation]], producing ions of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]]: S<sup>+</sup>, O<sup>+</sup>, S<sup>2+</sup> and O<sup>2+</sup>.<ref name=Krupp3>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 3&ndash;4</ref> These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus; a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near the moon's orbit.<ref name=Khurana5/> The plasma temperature within the torus is 10&ndash;100&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (100,000&ndash;1,000,000&nbsp;K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts&mdash;10&nbsp;keV (100 million&nbsp;K). The plasma in the torus is forced into co&ndash;rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation.<ref name=Krupp4/> The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp1>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 1&ndash;3</ref>

As a result of various processes the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. The main escape mechanisms are [[diffusion]] and interchange instability (see details below).<ref name=Krupp4>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 4&ndash;7</ref> As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co&ndash;rotation.<ref name=Khurana1/> These radial currents are also the source of the magnetic field's  azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation.<ref name=Khurana13/> The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000&nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in the Io torus to about 0.2&nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at a distance of 35&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>.<ref name=Khurana10>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 10&ndash;12</ref> In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from Jupiter, co&ndash;rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet.<ref name=Khurana1/> Eventually at the distances greater than 40&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail.<ref name=Russell2001-1024>[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1024&ndash;1025</ref> As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low&ndash;density plasma (temperature 20&nbsp;[[Kiloelectronvolt|keV]] (200 million&nbsp;K) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana10/> This plasma, [[adiabatic heating|adiabatically heated]] as it approaches Jupiter,<ref name=Khurana20>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 20&ndash;21</ref> forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana5/>

===Magnetodisk===
While Earth's magnetic field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and "wobbles" periodically about its axis.<ref name=depths/> The main reason for this disk-like configuration is the [[centrifugal force]] from the co&ndash;rotating plasma, which stretches Jupiter's [[magnetic field line]]s, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from the planet.<ref name=Russell2001-1021>[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1021&ndash;1024</ref> The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane,<ref name=Krupp3/> approximately near the [[magnetic equator]]. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it.<ref name=Russell2001-1016/> The load of plasma from Io greatly expands the size of the Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind.<ref name=Krupp15/> In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>, whereas it is actually 75&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> on average.<ref name=Khurana1/> 

The configuration of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal [[ring current]] (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet.<ref name=Kivelson315>[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 315&ndash;316</ref> The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a [[centripetal force]], which keeps the co&ndash;rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90&ndash;160 million amps.<ref name=Khurana1/><ref name=Khurana13>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 13&ndash;16</ref>

==Dynamics==
===Co&ndash;rotation and radial currents===
[[File:Currents in Jovian Magnetosphere.png|thumb|right|300px|The magnetic field of Jupiter and co&ndash;rotation enforcing currents]]
The main driver of Jupiter<U+2019>s magnetosphere is the planet's rotation.<ref name=Blanc250>[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 250&ndash;253</ref> In this respect Jupiter is similar to a device called a [[Unipolar generator]]. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points in the direction of the rotation,<ref name=Kivelson303/> the [[Lorentz force]], which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator.<ref name=Cowley1069>[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1069&ndash;76</ref> As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of the Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the [[electrical circuit]] is closed through it.<ref name=Cowley1069/> A current called the direct current{{#tag:ref|The direct current  in the Jovian magnetosphere is not to be confused with the [[direct current]] used in electrical circuits. The latter is the opposite of the [[alternating current]].|group=note}} flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or [[Birkeland current]]s.<ref name=Khurana13/> The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co&ndash;rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.<ref name=Cowley1069/>

The current flowing from the ionosphere to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet.<ref name="Cowley1069"/> As mentioned above, co&ndash;rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched.<ref name=Blanc254>[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 254&ndash;261</ref> The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about {{nowrap|16 <U+00B1> 1}}<U+00B0> from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral ovals]]. (See below.)<ref name=Cowley1083>[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1083&ndash;87</ref> The return current flowing from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60&ndash;140&nbsp;million [[ampere|amp]]s.<ref name=Khurana13/><ref name=Cowley1069/>

The acceleration of the plasma into the co&ndash;rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the [[kinetic energy]] of the plasma.<ref name=Khurana1/> In that sense, the Jovian magnetosphere is powered by the planet's rotation, whereas the Earth<U+2019>s magnetosphere is powered mainly by the solar wind.<ref name=Krupp1/>

===Interchange instability and reconnection===
The main problem encountered in deciphering the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>.<ref name=Blanc254/> The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability]] in [[hydrodynamics]].<ref name=Krupp4/> In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, [[centrifugal force]] plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp4/> The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of the [[flux tube]]s filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter.<ref name=Krupp4/> This interchange of flux tubes is a form of  magnetospheric [[turbulence]].<ref name=Russell2008>[[#Russell2008|Russell]], 2008</ref>
[[File:Jovian magnetosphere (view from the north pole).png|thumb|left|The magnetosphere of Jupiter as viewed from above the north pole<ref name=Krupp2007-216/>]]
This highly hypothetical picture of the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the [[Galileo spacecraft]], which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp4/> These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so&ndash;called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere suddenly penetrates into the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field.<ref name=Krupp7>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 7&ndash;9</ref> No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.

When flux tubes loaded with the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a [[reconnection]] process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma.<ref name=Blanc254/> The former returns to the inner magnetosphere in the form of flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of [[plasmoid]]s&mdash;large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2&ndash;3 days.<ref name=Krupp11/> The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co&ndash;rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp11>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 11&ndash;14</ref> The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.<ref name=Krupp3/><ref name=Khurana18>[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 18&ndash;19</ref>

The reconnection events are analogues to the [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic_substorms_and_storms|magnetic substorm]]s in the Earth's magnetosphere.<ref name=Blanc254/> The difference seems to be their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which moves down the tail.<ref name=Russell2001-1011>[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, p. 1011</ref> Conversely, in Jupiter<U+2019>s magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.<ref name=Krupp11/>

===Influence of the solar wind===
Whereas the dynamics of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depends on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well,<ref name=Nichols>[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 393&ndash;394</ref> particularly as a source of high-energy [[proton]]s.{{#tag:ref|The Jovian [[ionosphere]] is another significant source of protons.<ref name=Khurana5/>|group=note}}<ref name=Khurana5/> The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn&ndash;dusk asymmetry.<ref name=Khurana13/> In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector.<ref name=Khurana13/> In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed.<ref name=Khurana17/> All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the [[Dungey cycle]], may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.<ref name=Blanc254/><ref name=Nichols/>

The extent of the solar wind's influence on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown;<ref name=Krupp18>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 18&ndash;19</ref> however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated [[solar activity]].<ref name=Nichols404>[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 404&ndash;405</ref> The auroral radio,<ref name=Zarka375/> optical and X-ray emissions,<ref name=Elsner/> as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.<ref name=Krupp11/>

==Emissions==
===Aurorae===
[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.mod.jpg|thumb|400 px|Image of Jupiter's northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the magnetosphere's of Jupiter's natural satellites]]
Jupiter demonstrates bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000&nbsp;km in width) circular features located at approximately 16<U+00B0> from the magnetic poles;<ref name=Palier1171/> the satellite auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting their ionospheres with the ionosphere of Jupiter, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals.<ref name=Palier1171>[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1171&ndash;73</ref><ref name=Bhardwaj311>[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 311&ndash;316</ref> Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3&nbsp;keV), they are brightest in the mid&ndash;infrared (wavelength 3&ndash;4&nbsp;<U+03BC>m and 7&ndash;14&nbsp;<U+03BC>m) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80&ndash;180&nbsp;nm).<ref name=Bhardwaj342>[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, p. 342</ref>

The main ovals are the dominant part of the Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations,<ref name=Bhardwaj311/> but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure&mdash;the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae.<ref name=Cowley2-49>[[#Cowley2|Cowley]], 2003, pp. 49&ndash;53</ref> As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere.<ref name=Bhardwaj316>[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 316&ndash;319</ref> These electrons carry [[field aligned current]]s, which maintain the plasma's co&ndash;rotation in the magnetodisk.<ref name=Blanc254/> The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents.<ref name=Cowley1083/> The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10&ndash;100&nbsp;keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission.<ref name=Bhardwaj306>[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 306&ndash;311</ref> The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10&ndash;100&nbsp;[[terawatt|TW]].<ref name=Bhardwaj296>[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, p. 296</ref> In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as [[Joule heating]].

Spots were found to correspond to three Galilean moons: Io, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].{{#tag:ref|Callisto may have a spot as well; however, it would be unobservable because it would coincide with the main auroral oval.<ref name=Clarke/>|group=note}}<ref name=Clarke>[[#Clarke|Clarke]], 2002</ref> They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed in the vicinity of moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to [[Alfven waves|Alfven current]]s flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa<U+2019>s and Ganymede<U+2019>s spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.<ref name=Blanc277>[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 277&ndash;283</ref> 

Bright arcs and spots sporadically appear within the main ovals. These transient phenomena are thought to be related to interaction with the solar wind.<ref name=Bhardwaj311/> The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail.<ref name=Bhardwaj311/> The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval may be related to the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar [[Aurora_(astronomy)#Solar_wind_and_the_magnetosphere|cusp]]s.<ref name=Palier1170>[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1170&ndash;71</ref> The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet.<ref name=Blanc254/> The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of [[spectral line]]s of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.<ref name=Elsner>[[#Elsner|Elsner]], 2005, pp. 419&ndash;420</ref>

===Jupiter as a pulsar===

Jupiter is a powerful source of [[radio wave]]s in the spectral region stretching from several [[kilohertz]] to tens [[megahertz]]. Radio waves with [[radio frequency|frequencies]] of less than about 0.3&nbsp;MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1&nbsp;km) are called the Jovian [[kilometer|kilometric]] radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3&ndash;3 MHz (with wavelengths of 100&ndash;1000&nbsp;m) are called the [[hectometer|hectometric]] radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3&ndash;40&nbsp;MHz (with wavelengths of 10&ndash;100&nbsp;m) are referred to as the [[decameter|decametric]] radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from the Earth, and its approximately 10&nbsp;hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io-Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.<ref name=Zarka20160>[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20,160&ndash;168</ref>{{#tag:ref|The non-Io-DAM is much weaker than the Io-DAM, and is actually the high&ndash;frequency tail of the HOM emissions.<ref name=Zarka20160/>|group=note}}
[[File:Radio emissions of Solar System planets.png|thumb|left|300px|The spectrum of Jovian radio emissions compared with spectra of four other magnetized planets, where (N,T,S,U)KR means (Neptunian, Terrestrial, Saturnian and Uranian) kilometric radiation]]
The majority of these emissions are thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce back and forth between the poles. The electrons, which are involved in the generation of radio waves, are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk.<ref name=Zarka20173>[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20,173&ndash;181</ref> The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100&nbsp;GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10&nbsp;GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1&nbsp;GW.<ref name=Zarka20160/>

Jupiter's radio and particle emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, which makes the planet somewhat similar to a [[pulsar]].<ref name=Hill>[[#Hill|Hill]], 1995</ref> This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotational axis as well as by high&ndash;latitude [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]]. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions is similar to that of radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small [[radio pulsar]] too.<ref name=Hill/> In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on [[solar activity]].<ref name=Zarka20160/> 

In addition to relatively long&ndash;wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits [[synchrotron radiation]] (also known as the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies in the range of 0.1&ndash;15&nbsp;GHz (wavelength from 3&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;cm),<ref name=Zarka/> which is the [[bremsstrahlung radiation]] of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100&nbsp;MeV,<ref name=Santos-Costa>[[#Santos-Costa|Santos-Costa]], 2001</ref> while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1&ndash;20&nbsp;MeV.<ref name=Bolton>[[#Bolton|Bolton]], 2002</ref> This radiation is well&ndash;understood and was used since the beginning of 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts.<ref name=Zarka384>[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 384&ndash;385</ref> The particle in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana20/>

Jupiter's magnetosphere ejects streams of high-energy electrons and ions (energy up to tens [[megaelectronvolt]]s), which travel as far as the Earth's orbit.<ref name=Krupp17>[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 17&ndash;18</ref> These streams are highly [[collimated]] and vary with the rotational period of the planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.<ref name=Hill/>

==Interaction with rings and moons==
{{seealso|Rings of Jupiter|Ganymedian magnetosphere|Space weathering}}
Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere envelops its ring system and the orbits of all four [[Galilean satellites]].<ref name=Kivelson2-2/> Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere interact with their surfaces. Those particles [[sputtering|sputter]] off material and alter the properties of those bodies.<ref name=Johnson-1>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 1&ndash;2</ref> The plasma's co&ndash;rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries.<ref name=Johnson-3>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 3&ndash;5</ref> In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons do contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.<ref name=Kivelson2-2/>
[[File:Jupiter's radiation belts (Cassini).jpg|thumb|Jupiter's variable radiation belts]]
Close to Jupiter, the planet's rings and small moons absorb high-energy particles (energy above 10&nbsp;keV) from the radiation belts.<ref name=Burns1/> This creates noticeable gaps in the belts' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric synchrotron radiation. In fact, the existence of Jupiter's rings was first hypothesized based on data from the ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' spacecraft, which detected a sharp drop in the number of high-energy ions close to the planet.<ref name=Burns1>[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 1&ndash;2</ref> The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub-micron ring particles as well, which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Their behavior is similar to that of co&ndash;rotating [[ion]]s.<ref name=Burns12>[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 12&ndash;14</ref> The resonant interaction between the co&ndash;rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter's innermost halo ring (located between 1.4 and 1.71&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>), which consists of sub-micron particles on highly [[Inclination|inclined]] and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits.<ref name=Burns10>[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 10&ndash;11</ref> The particles originate in the main ring; however, when they drift  toward Jupiter, their orbits are modified by the strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance located at 1.71&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>, which increases their inclinations and eccentricities.{{#tag:ref|A Lorentz resonance is one that exists between a particle's orbital speed and the rotation period of a planet's magnetosphere. If the ratio of their angular frequencies is m:n (a [[rational number]]) then scientists call it an m:n Lorentz resonance. So, in the case of a 3:2 resonance, a particle at a distance of about 1.71&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> from Jupiter makes three revolutions around the planet, while the planet's magnetic field makes two revolutions.<ref name=Burns17/>|group=note}} Another 2:1 Lorentz resonance at 1.4&nbsp;Rj defines the inner boundary of the halo ring.<ref name=Burns17>[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 17&ndash;19</ref>

All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres  with surface pressures in the range 0.01&ndash;1&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|nbar]], which in turn support substantial [[ionosphere]]s with electron densities in the range of 1,000&ndash;10,000&nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>.<ref name=Kivelson2-2>[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 2&ndash;4</ref> The co&ndash;rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfven wings.<ref name=Kivelson2-8>[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 8&ndash;10</ref> The interaction of the large moons with the co&ndash;rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the non-magnetized planets like [[Venus]], although the co&ndash;rotational speed is usually [[subsonic]] (the speeds vary from 74 to 328&nbsp;km/s), which prevents the formation of a [[bow shock]].<ref name=Kivelson2-1>[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 1&ndash;2</ref> The pressure from the co&ndash;rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co&ndash;rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent.<ref name="Kivelson2-2"/> In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfven wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede).<ref name=Cooper137>[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 137,139</ref>
[[Image:PIA04433 Jupiter Torus Diagram cr.jpg|thumb|left|Plasma tori created by Io and Europa]]
The icy Galilean moons, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], all generate induced magnetic moments in response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate for changes in the ambient field.<ref name=Kivelson2-2/> The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for the existence of oceans was one of the most important discoveries made in the 1990s by [[Galileo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]].<ref name=Kivelson2-10>[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 10&ndash;11</ref>

The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons.<ref name=Kivelson2-10/> Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside the Jupiter<U+2019>s magnetosphere with the diameter equal to approximately two diameters of Ganymede, creating a mini-magnetosphere within the Jupiter's magnetosphere. The moon's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around Ganymede<U+2019>s magnetosphere. It also protects the equatorial regions of Ganymede, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike the poles, where the field lines are open.<ref name=Kivelson2-16>[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 16&ndash;18</ref> Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts.<ref name=Williams1>[[#Williams|Williams]], 1998, p. 1</ref> The energetic electrons entering the thin atmosphere of Ganymede are responsible for the observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.<ref name=Kivelson2-16/>

Charged particles have a considerable influence on the surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and [[sodium]] ions farther from the planet,<ref name=Cooper154>[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 154&ndash;156</ref> where they are implanted preferably on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede.<ref name=Johnson-15>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 15&ndash;19</ref> On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, the sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere.<ref name=Hibbitts>[[#Hibbitts|Hibbitts]], 2000, p. 1</ref> The plasma may cause other differences between trailing and leading hemispheres of the Galilean moons&mdash;the trailing hemispheres (again except Callisto) are darker than the leading ones, which may indicate that the former were altered by the plasma from the magnetosphere.<ref name=Johnson-3/> Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard the ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing [[radiolysis]] of water and non-ice [[chemical compound]]s. The energetic particles break water into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].<ref name=Johnson-8/> If organics or [[carbonate]]s are present, [[carbon dioxide]], [[methanol]] and [[carbonic acid]] can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur the likely products include sulfur dioxide, [[hydrogen disulfide]] and [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name=Johnson-8>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 8&ndash;13</ref> The [[oxidant]]s produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans, thus serving as the energy source for possible life.<ref name="Cooper154"/>

==Discovery and exploration==
[[File:Ulysses at Jupiter.jpg|thumb|The path of the Ulysses spacecraft through the magnetosphere of Jupiter in 1992]] 

The first evidence for the existence of Jupiter's magnetic field came in 1955, with the discovery of the [[decameter|decametric]] radio emission or DAM.<ref name=Burke>[[#Burke|Burke]], 1955</ref> As the DAM's spectrum extended up to 40&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]], astronomers concluded that Jupiter must possess a magnetic field with a strength of about 1&nbsp;milli[[tesla]] (10&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|Gauss]]).<ref name=Zarka>[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 371&ndash;375</ref> In 1959, observations in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1&ndash;10&nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]) led to the discovery of the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was [[synchrotron radiation]] emitted by [[Relativistic electron beam|relativistic electrons]] trapped in the planet's radiation belts.<ref name=Drake>[[#Drake|Drake]], 1959</ref> These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic field strength.<ref name=Khurana5/> The modulation of Jupiter's DAM by [[Io (moon)|Io]] (so called Io-DAM) was discovered in 1964, and allowed Jupiter's [[rotation period]] to be precisely determined.<ref name=Zarka375>[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 375&ndash;377</ref> The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973, when the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft flew near the planet.<ref name=Smith>[[#Smith|Smith]], 1974</ref>{{#tag:ref|Pioneer 10 carried a helium vector [[magnetometer]], which measured the magnetic field of Jupiter directly. The spacecraft also made observations of plasma and energetic particles.<ref name=Smith/>|group=note}}

As of 2009 a total of eight spacecraft have flown around Jupiter and all have contributed to the present knowledge of the Jovian magnetosphere. The first space probe to reach Jupiter was [[Pioneer 10]] in December 1973, which discovered the planet's magnetic field.<ref name=Smith/> Its twin [[Pioneer 11]] visited Jupiter a year later traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1.6&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>. It provided the best coverage available of the inner magnetic field. The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than ''Pioneer'''s designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probe would not survive; however, with a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, saved in large part by the fact that Jupiter's magnetosphere had "wobbled" slightly upward at that point, moving away from the spacecraft. However, it did lose most images of Io, as the radiation had caused its imaging photo [[polarimeter]] to receive a number of spurious commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the massive radiation levels.<ref name=depths>[[#Wolverton|Wolverton]], 2004, pp. 100&ndash;157</ref>

Voyagers 1 and 2 arrived to Jupiter in 1979&ndash;1980 and traveled almost in its equatorial plane. [[Voyager 1]] was the first probe which encountered the Io plasma torus, and [[Voyager 2]] discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana1/>

The [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]], which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, provided a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at the distances up to 100&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub>. The studied regions included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk sectors of the magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana1/> While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's [[gyroscope]]s often exhibited increased errors. Several times [[electrical arc]]s occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter [[safe mode]], which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable [[quartz oscillator]].<ref name=Fieseler>[[#Fieseler|Fieseler]], 2002</ref> 

When the [[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]] spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo.<ref name=Khurana1/> The last spacecraft to visit Jupiter was [[New Horizons]] in 2007, which carried out a unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail traveling as far as 2500&nbsp;R<sub>j</sub> along its length.<ref name=Krupp2007-216>[[#Krupp2007|Krupp]], 2007, p. 216</ref> The coverage remains much poorer for the Jupiter<U+2019>s magnetosphere than for the Earth<U+2019>s magnetic field. Future missions ([[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]], for instance) are important to further understand the processes in the Jovian magnetosphere.<ref name=Khurana1/>

In 2003, [[NASA]] conducted a conceptual study called "Human Outer Planets Exploration" (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the [[outer solar system]]. The possibility was mooted of building a surface base on Callisto, due to the low radiation levels at the moon's distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only one of Jupiter's Galilean satellites of which human exploration is feasible. The levels of [[ionizing radiation]] on Io, Europa and Ganymede are hostile to human life, and adequate protection is still unavailable.<ref name=Trautman>[[#Trautman|Trautman]], 2003</ref>
