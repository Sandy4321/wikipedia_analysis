The '''Commonwealth of the Philippines''' was the political designation of the [[Philippines]] from [[1935]] to [[1946]] when the country was a [[commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] with the [[United States]]. Before 1935, the Philippines was an [[insular area]] with non-commonwealth status, and before that, it had been a [[United States territory|U.S. territory]].<ref name="US-influence"/>

The creation of the Commonwealth was envisioned under the Philippine Independence Act, popularly known as the [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]] as a ten-year transitional government in preparation for full Philippine independence and sovereignity,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tydings-McDuffie Act|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073977/Tydings-McDuffie-Act|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Text of the Tydings-McDuffie Act|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/tydingsmcduffieact.htm|publisher=The ChanRobles Group|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> which was promised through the Philippine Autonomy Act or [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Law]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jones Act|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043951/Jones-Act |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref><ref>Philippine Historical Commission. "Philippine Legislature, 100 Years. Quezon City: Philippine Historical Commission, 2000: chapter 4. ISBN 971-92245-0-9</ref> 

It marked the end of the colonial eras as well as the transition of the nomenclature of the Philippines from the plural ''"Las Islas Filipinas"'' and "Philippine Islands" of the Spanish and American colonial periods, to the singular, "Philippines", which is a sign of unity, sovereignty, and national identity.

==Structure==

The Commonwealth had its own constitution, which remained effective until 1973,<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutions of the Philippines|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/philsupremelaw.htm |publisher=The ChanRobles Group|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> and was self-governing<ref>{{cite web|title=Text of the 1935 Constitution|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1935constitutionofthephilippines.htm|publisher=The ChanRobles Group|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required the approval of the American president. <ref name="uslc-20">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Commonwealth Politics|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/20.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

It featured a very strong [[President of the Philippines|executive]], a unicameral [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]],<ref>Agoncillo, Teodoro "The Fateful Years: Japan's Adventure in the Philippines." (1) Hayden, J. Ralston "The Philippines: A Study in National Development."</ref>  and a [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Yamashita Standard|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/justice/world_issues_yam.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> all composed entirely of Filipinos, as well as an elected [[Resident Commissioners from the Philippines|Resident Commissioner]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] (as [[Puerto Rico]] does today). An American [[High Commissioner of the Philippines|High Commissioner]] and an American [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines|Military Advisor]],<ref name="pinas" /> were also present in the government while an American [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|Field Marshall]] was in charge of the [[Philippine Army]]. 

In 1939-40, after an amendment in the Constitution, a bicameral [[Philippine Congress|Congress]],<ref name="arab news" /> consisting a of [[Philippine Senate|Senate]],<ref name="arab news" /> and of a [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],<ref name="arab news" /> was restored replacing the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]].<ref name="arab news">{{cite web|title=A History of Plebiscites in the Philippines

===Creation===

In December 1932, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act]] with the premise of granting Filipinos independence. Provisions of the bill included reserving several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hare-Hawes-Cutting-Act|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9039248/Hare-Hawes-Cutting-Act|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref><ref name="US-influence">{{cite web|title=Philippines, The period of U.S. influence|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-23717/Philippines|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> It was vetoed by President [[Herbert Hoover]] but the American Congress overrode his veto in 1933 and passed the bill.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 345-346</ref> The bill, however, was opposed by the then Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and was also rejected by the [[Philippine Senate]].<ref name="uslc-20"/>

This led to the creation and passing of a new bill known as Tydings-McDuffie Act, which allowed the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippine with a ten-year period of peaceful transition to full independence.<ref name="US-influence"/>

===Pre-War===

In October [[Philippine presidential election, 1935|1935, presidential elections]] were held and candidates included former president [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and ''[[Philippine Independent Church|Iglesia Filipina Indepediente]]'' leader [[Gregorio Aglipay]]. [[Manuel L. Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osme<U+00F1>a]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]] were proclaimed winners, winning the seats of president and vice-president, respectively.<ref name="US-influence"/> 

The new government embarked on ambitious nation-building policies in preparation for economic and political independence.<ref name="US-influence"/> These included national defense (such as the [[National Defense Act of 1935]], which organized a [[draft]] service in the country), greater control over the economy, the perfection of democratic institutions, reforms in education, improvement of transport, the promotion of local capital and industrialization, and the colonization of Mindanao. 

However, uncertainties, espescially in the diplomatic and military situation in [[Southeast Asia]], in the level of U.S. commitment to the future [[Republic of the Philippines|Republic]], and in the economy due to the [[Great Depression]], proved to be major problems. The situation was further complicated by the presense of agrarian unrest, and of power struggles between Osme<U+00F1>a and Quezon,<ref name="US-influence"/> especially after Quezon was permited to be reelected after a six-year term.

A proper evaluation of the policies' effectiveness or failure is  difficult due to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion during [[World War II]].

===World War II===
{{main|Military history of the Philippines during World War II}}
[[Image:City action009 pp4 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The War as seen in Manila.]]

[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched a surprise [[Battle of the Philippines (1942)|attack on the Philippines]] on [[December 8]] [[1941]]. The Commonwealth government drafted the [[Philippine Army]] into the [[U.S. Army Forces Far East]], which would resist Japanese occupation. Manila was declared an [[open city]] to prevent its destruction<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 390</ref> and was occupied by the Japanese on [[January 2]] [[1942]].<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 392</ref> Meanwhile, battles against the Japanese continued in [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]], [[Battle of Corregidor|Correigidor]], and [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on May 1942.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 168</ref>

Quezon and Osme<U+00F1>a were escorted by troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States. There, they set up a government in exile,<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 415</ref> which participated in the [[Pacific War Council]] as well as the [[Declaration by United Nations]]. During exile, Quezon became ill with tuberculosis, and eventually died. Osme<U+00F1>a later replaced him as president.

Meanwhile, the Japanese military organized a new government in the Philippines known as the [[Second Philippine Republic]], which was headed by President [[Jos<U+00E9> P. Laurel]]. This government ended up being unpopular.<ref name="uslc-21">{{cite web|title=Philippines - World War II|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/21.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

The resistance continued in the Philippines. This included the  [[Hukbalahap]] ("People's Army Against the Japanese"), which comprised of 30,000 armed people and controlled much of [[Central Luzon]].<ref name="uslc-21"/> Remnants of the [[Philippine Army]] also fought the Japanese through guerrilla warfare and were successful since all but twelve of the forty-eight [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] were liberated. <ref name="uslc-21"/>

MacArthur's [[Allied forces]] landed on Leyte on [[October 20]] [[1944]] and were welcomed as liberators,<ref name="US-influence"/> as other landings followed. Fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on [[September 2]], [[1945]]. Estimates for Filipino casualties reached one million, and Manila was extensively damaged .<ref name="uslc-21"/>

After the [[Philippines campaign, 1944-45|war]], the Commonwealth was restored and one-year transitional period in preparation for independence began. Elections followed in April 1946 with [[Manuel Roxas]] winning as the first president of the independent [[Republic of the Philippines]] and [[Elpidio Quirino]] winning as vice-president.

===Independence===
{{main|Filipino-American Friendship Day}}

The Commonwealth ended when the [[United States]] recognized [[Philippine independence]] on July 4, 1946, as scheduled.<ref name="pinas">{{cite web|title=Philippine History|url=http://pinas.dlsu.edu.ph/history/history.html|publisher=DLSU-Manila|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Colony and Philippine Commonwealth 1901 - 1941 |url=http://www.ualberta.ca/~vmitchel/fw5.html|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>  However, the [[Economy of the Philippines|economy]] remained dependent to the U.S..<ref name="uslc-23">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Economic Relations with the United States|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/23.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> This was due to the [[Bell Trade Act]], otherwise known as the Philippine Trade Act, which was a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States.<ref name="beterano">{{cite web|title=Balitang Beterano: Facts about Philippine Independence|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/tl/tl012375.htm|publisher=Philippine Headline News Online|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

==Policies==

===Uprisings and agrarian reform===
[[Image: estanciauruguay.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a ''hacienda'' in Uruguay]]

At the time, [[tenant]] farmers held grievances often rooted to debt caused by the [[sharecropping]] system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population, which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers' families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philippine history - American Colony and Philippine Commonwealth (1901-1941)|url=http://www.asia.msu.edu/seasia/Philippines/History/hist_AmerColony.html|publisher=Windows on Asia|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> As a result, an [[agrarian reform]] program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners.

An example of these clashes includes one intitiated by [[Benigno Ramos]] through his ''[[Sakdalista]]'' movement,<ref>Republic of the Philippies, Philippine Almanac'', p. 140</ref> which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or ''[[hacienda]]s'', and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon on May, 1935, claimed about a hundred lives.

===National language===

Due to the diverse number [[Philippine languages]], a program for the "development and adoption of a common national language based on the existing native dialects" was drafted in the 1935 Philippine constitution.<ref name= "almanac" /> The Commonwealth created a ''Surian ng Wikang Pambansa'' (National Language Institue), which was composed of President Quezon and six other members from various [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]]. A deliberation was held and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]<ref name= "almanac" /> (due to its extensive literary traditon) was selected as the basis for the "national language" to be called "Pilipino".  

In 1940, the Commonwealth authorized the creation of a dictionary and grammar book for the language. On the same year, Commonwealth Act 570 was passed, allowing [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] to become an official language upon independence.<ref name= "almanac">Republic of the Philippies, Philippine Almanac'', p. 338</ref>

===Mindanao===

The Commonwealth also had a policy involving the colonization of [[Mindanao]].

==Economy==
[[Image:Quezon Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Manuel L. Quezon]] visiting [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Washington D.C]].]]
The economy of the Commowealth was mostly agricultural based. Products included abaca, coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber.<ref name= "filipinas library" />

The performance of the economy was initially good despite challenges from various agrarian uprisings. Taxes collected from a robust coconut industry helped boost the economy by funding infrastructure and other development projects. However, growth was halted due to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. <ref name= "filipinas library">{{cite web|title=American Colony and Philippine Commonwealth (1901-1941)

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics_of_the_Philippines#1941}}

In 1941, the estimated population of the Philippines reached 17,000,000 while [[Manila]]'s population was 684,000. The number of [[Filipino Chinese|Chinese]] rose to 117,000. There were also 30,000 [[Japanese Filipino|Japanese]], with 20,000 living in [[Davao City|Davao]], and 9,000 [[Americans in the Philippines|Americans]]. [[English language|English]] was spoken by 27% of the population, while [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was spoken by only 3%.

The following is the estimated number of speakers of the dominant languages:<ref name= "almanac" />

*[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: 4,068,565
