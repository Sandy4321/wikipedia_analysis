[[Image:Retired Pacific hurricane tracks.png|right|thumb|300px|Retired [[Pacific hurricane]]s]]
This is a '''list of all [[Pacific hurricane]]s that have had their names retired'''. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricane]] names are retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in a meeting in March or April of each year. Those hurricanes that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms that often become household names in the regions they affected. Storm names are retired following a request made at the WMO meeting by one or more of the countries affected by a hurricane. At least five tropical cyclone names have been retired since the start of [[List of previous tropical cyclone names|tropical cyclone naming]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], including two storms named by the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]].

==General information==
Since 1960, 11 storms have had their names removed from the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names|List of Pacific hurricane names]], including two from the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center|Central Pacific]]. Of these, two names, Adolph and Israel, were retired for political considerations.<ref name="aoml">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett, Jack Beven, and James Lewis Free|year=2006|title=What names have been retired in the Atlantic and East Pacific basin?|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2006-12-08|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B3.html}}</ref> Two names prior to the start of modern naming in 1978 were removed from the lists for unknown reasons: Hazel was removed following its usage in 1965 and Adele was removed following its usage in 1970. The former made landfall on northwestern [[Mexico]] as a minimal tropical storm with no known effects, while Adele remained at sea for its duration. However, the name [[Hurricane Hazel]] was previously retired in the [[List of retired Atlantic hurricanes|Atlantic basin]]. Since the standardization of Pacific hurricane naming in 1978, several names have been retired due to pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because they represented a significant human disaster, but both Knut in 1987 and Iva in 1988 were removed from naming lists without either having affected any landmass. [[Hurricane Fico|Hurricanes Fico]] and [[Hurricane Fefa|Fefa]] were removed from lists, as well. It is unknown whether the names were removed due to the previous reasons or due to their respective damages on [[Hawaii]].<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2006|title=Regional Association IV (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) Hurricane Operational Plan|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/OperationPlans/TCP30-2006%20EN.pdf}}</ref>

Multiple names were altered slightly by changing the spelling of a tropical cyclone name. Kirsten in 1966 became Kristen in [[1970 Pacific hurricane season|1970]], though was reverted back to Kirsten in [[1974 Pacific hurricane season|1974]].<ref name="atwc">{{cite web|author=Atlantic Tropical Weather Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Retirement|publisher=Ablaze Productions, Inc.|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.atwc.org/pachist.txt}}</ref> The name Dalilia, which was used in [[1983 Pacific hurricane season|1983]] and [[1989 Pacific hurricane season|1989]], was changed, perhaps inadvertently, to Dalila in [[1995 Pacific hurricane season|1995]], a change which remains intact on the naming list.<ref name="dalila1995">{{cite web|author=Edward N. Rappaport|year=1995|title=Tropical Storm Dalila Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995dalila.html}}</ref> The name Dolores, which was used in [[1979 Pacific hurricane season|1979]] and [[1985 Pacific hurricane season|1985]], was changed to Delores for the [[1991 Pacific hurricane season|1991]] and [[1997 Pacific hurricane season|1997]] seasons. In [[1970 Pacific hurricane season|2003]] it was reverted back to Dolores, a change which remains on the list of Pacific tropical cyclone names.<ref name="atwc"/>

Prior to 1957, two storms in the Central [[Pacific Ocean]] received [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] names and were never re-used. From 1957 until the late 1970s, names in the basin received names from the list of typhoon names for its year, though none were retired. Since the modern system of Central Pacific tropical cyclone naming began in the early 1980s, two names were retired for their effects on [[Hawaii]]. [[Hurricane Iwa|Iwa]] was replaced with Io following its usage in 1982, and [[Hurricane Iniki|Iniki]] was replaced with Iolana following its usage in 1992.<ref name="atwc"/>

==Lists of retired names==
===Listed by intensity===
[[Image:Hurricane Kenna 24 oct 2002 1750Z.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Hurricane Kenna]] near its peak intensity]]
{{Saffir-Simpson small}}
This lists all retired hurricanes by their peak intensity, which is determined by measurements of the minimum central [[pressure]].

While the intensity of [[tropical cyclone]]s is measured solely by central pressure, wind speeds are also estimated; the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] is used in the [[Pacific basin]] to rank hurricanes according to their strongest 1-minute sustained winds. While most hurricanes do not make landfall at their peak intensity, they are often referred to by their strongest Saffir-Simpson Category rather than by their landfall Category.

Of the storms in the Pacific whose names have been retired, two peaked as Category 1 hurricanes, one peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, three peaked as Category 4 hurricanes, and one peaked as a Category 5 hurricane. Many storms of high intensities have not had their names retired because most Pacific hurricanes do not make landfall.

This lists all retired Pacific hurricanes by their total damages (in 2006 [[USD]]). Hurricane names are generally retired for one of two reasons, either because they were particularly damaging or particularly deadly. Some data may be incomplete and account for damages in only one location while the storm affected several. Calculation of modern-day damage amounts is done using the [[Consumer Price Index]].<ref name="frbm">{{cite web|author=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|year=2006|title=What is a dollar worth?|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/calc/}}</ref>

===Listed by death toll===
[[Image:Hurr-pauline-vis1.gif|right|thumb|250px|[[Hurricane Pauline]] near peak intensity]]
This lists all retired Pacific hurricanes by the number of deaths they caused. Hurricane names are generally retired for one of two reasons, either because they were particularly damaging or particularly deadly.  While many damaging storms caused little loss of life, most deadly storms also caused heavy damage. Most storms cause fatalities not by their high winds but rather through flooding - either [[storm surge]] or inland flooding due to rainfall. Storm surge has the highest potential for deaths; with modern forecasting, warning, and evacuation storm surge deaths can be almost eliminated, but the potential is still very high for catastrophe in places where warning systems are not in place or if warnings are ignored. Inland flooding, by contrast, is unpredictable because it depends heavily on a hurricane's interaction with the terrain and with other nearby weather systems.

There have been several deadlier hurricanes than the following that were not retired. [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons|Hurricane Tara]] killed at least 500 people in southern [[Mexico]] in 1961,<ref name="tony">{{cite web|author=Tony Burton|year=2001|title=Mexico in November - A Historical Review|publisher=Mexico Connect|accessdate=2006-12-08|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/tonysarticles/tbthismonthnovember.html}}</ref> and [[Hurricane Liza (1976)|Hurricane Liza]] caused at least 425 deaths along the [[Baja California Peninsula]] in [[1976 Pacific hurricane season|1976]].<ref name="1976mwr">{{Cite web|author=Emil B.

==Landfalls==
[[Image:Hurricane Ismael Landfall 95.JPG|right|thumb|210px|[[Hurricane Ismael]] near its landfall on Mexico]]
[[Landfall (meteorology)|Landfall]] of a [[tropical cyclone]] is defined as the moving of the center of the [[eyewall|eye]] over land. Damages from a tropical cyclone are usually greatest where it makes landfall. In the below list, the retired hurricanes are listed in chronological order with their landfall locations listed under columns designating their strength on the [[Saffir-Simpson Scale]] at the time of landfall. Within a cell, landfalls are listed in chronological order. Three retired hurricanes, [[Hurricane Fico|Hurricanes Fico]], [[Hurricane Iwa|Iwa]], and [[Hurricane Fefa|Fefa]] never made landfall anywhere at any intensity. They are omitted from this list.
