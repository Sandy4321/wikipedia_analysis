'''Quantum cryptography''' describes the use of [[quantum mechanical]]
effects (in particular [[quantum communication]] and [[quantum computation]]) to perform [[cryptographic]] tasks or to break [[cryptographic]] systems.

Well-known examples of quantum cryptography are the use of quantum
communication to securely exchange a key ([[quantum key distribution]]) and the hypothetical use of [[quantum computers]]
that would allow the breaking of various popular [[public-key encryption]] and [[Digital signature|signature]] schemes (e.g., [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and [[ElGamal]]).

The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical (i.e. non-quantum) communication (see below for examples). For example, quantum mechanics guarantees that measuring quantum data disturbs that data; this can be used to detect eavesdropping in quantum key distribution.

== History ==
Quantum cryptography was proposed first by [[Stephen Wiesner]], then at Columbia University in New York, who, in the early 1970s, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding. His seminal paper titled "Conjugate Coding" was rejected by IEEE Information Theory but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News (15:1 pp.&nbsp;78<U+2013>88, 1983). In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two "conjugate observables", such as linear and circular polarization of light, so that either, but not both, of which may be received and decoded. He illustrated his idea with a design of unforgeable bank notes. A decade later, building upon this work, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles H. Bennett]], of the IBM [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]],  and [[Gilles Brassard]], of the Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al, proposed a method for secure communication based on Wiesner<U+2019>s "conjugate observables". In 1990, independently and initially unaware of the earlier work, [[Artur Ekert]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College, University of Oxford]], developed a different approach to quantum key distribution based on peculiar quantum correlations known as quantum entanglement.

== Quantum key distribution ==
{{Main|Quantum key distribution}}

The most well known and developed application of quantum cryptography is [[quantum key distribution]] (QKD). QKD describes the process of using quantum communication to establish a shared key between two parties (usually called [[Alice and Bob]]) without a third party (Eve) learning anything about that key, even if Eve can eavesdrop on all communication between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by Alice encoding the bits of the key as quantum data and sending them to Bob; if Eve tries to learn these bits, the messages will be disturbed and Alice and Bob will notice. The key is then typically used for [[encrypted]] communication.

The security of QKD can be proven mathematically without imposing any restrictions on the abilities of an eavesdropper, something not possible with classical key distribution. This is usually described as "unconditional security", although there are some minimal assumptions required including that the laws of quantum mechanics apply and that Alice and Bob are able to authenticate each other, i.e. Eve should not be able to impersonate Alice or Bob as otherwise a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] would be possible.

== Quantum commitment ==
Following the discovery of quantum key distribution and its unconditional security, researchers tried to achieve other cryptographic tasks with unconditional security. One such task was [[Commitment scheme|commitment]]. A commitment scheme allows a party Alice to fix a certain value (to "commit") in such a way that Alice cannot change that value while at the same time ensuring that the recipient Bob cannot learn anything about that value until Alice decides to reveal it. Such commitment schemes are commonly used in cryptographic protocols. In the quantum setting, they would be particularly useful: Cr<U+00E9>peau and Kilian showed that from a commitment and a quantum channel, one can construct an unconditionally secure protocol for performing so-called [[oblivious transfer]].<ref name="crepeau88ot"/> [[Oblivious transfer]], on the other hand, had been shown by Kilian to allow implementation of almost any distributed computation in a secure way (so-called [[secure multi-party computation]]).<ref
name="kilian88founding"/> (Notice that here we are a bit
imprecise: The results by Cr<U+00E9>peau and Kilian<ref name="crepeau88ot"/> and Kilian<ref name="kilian88founding"/> together do not directly imply that given a commitment and a quantum channel one can perform secure multi-party computation. This is because the results do not guarantee "composability", that is, when plugging them together, one might lose security. Later works showed, however, how composability can be ensured in this setting.)

Unfortunately, early quantum commitment protocols<ref
name="brassard93commitment"/> were shown to be flawed. In fact,
Mayers showed that (unconditionally secure) quantum commitment is
impossible: a computationally unlimited attacker can break any quantum commitment protocol.<ref name="mayers97commitment"/>

Yet, the result by Mayers does not preclude the possibility of
constructing quantum commitment protocols (and thus secure multi-party computation protocols) under assumptions that are much weaker than the assumptions needed for commitment protocols that do not use quantum communication. The bounded quantum storage model described below is an example for a setting in which quantum communication can be used to construct commitment protocols.

== Bounded- and noisy-quantum-storage model ==
One possibility to construct unconditionally secure quantum
[[Commitment scheme|commitment]] and quantum [[oblivious transfer]] (OT) protocols is to use the bounded quantum storage model (BQSM). In this model, we assume that the amount of quantum data that an adversary can store is limited by some known constant Q. We do not, however, impose any limit on the amount of classical (i.e., non-quantum) data the adversary may store.

In the BQSM, one can construct commitment and oblivious transfer
protocols.<ref name="damgaard05bounded"/> The underlying idea is the following: The protocol parties exchange more than Q quantum bits ([[qubits]]). Since even a dishonest party cannot store all that information (the quantum memory of the adversary is limited to Q qubits), a large part of the data will have to be either measured or discarded. Forcing dishonest parties to measure a large part of the data allows to circumvent the impossibility result by Mayers;<ref name="mayers97commitment"/> commitment and oblivious transfer protocols can now be implemented.

The protocols in the BQSM presented by Damg<U+00E5>rd, Fehr, Salvail, and
Schaffner<ref name="damgaard05bounded"/> do not assume that
honest protocol participants store any quantum information; the
technical requirements are similar to those in [[quantum key distribution|QKD protocols]]. These protocols can thus, at least in principle, be realized with today's technology. The communication complexity is only a constant factor larger than the bound Q on the adversary's quantum memory.

The advantage of the BQSM is that the assumption that the adversary's quantum memory is limited is quite realistic. With today's technology, storing even a single qubit reliably over a sufficiently long time is difficult. (What "sufficiently long" means depends on the protocol details. By introducing an artificial pause in the protocol, the amount of time over which the adversary needs to store quantum data can be made arbitrarily large.)

An extension of the BQSM is the [[noisy-storage model]] introduced by Wehner, Schaffner and Terhal.<ref name="wehner07noisy"/> Instead of considering an upper bound on the physical size of the adversary's quantum memory, an adversary is allowed to use imperfect quantum storage devices of arbitrary size. The level of imperfection is modelled by noisy quantum channels. For high enough noise levels, the same primitives as in the BQSM can be achieved <ref name="koenig09noisy"/> and the BQSM forms a special case of the noisy-storage model.

In the classical setting, similar results can be achieved when
assuming a bound on the amount of classical (non-quantum) data that
the adversary can store.<ref name="cachin98memory"/> It was proven,
however, that in this model also the honest parties have to use a
large amount of memory (namely the square-root of the adversary's
memory bound).<ref name="dziembowski04initial"/> This makes these
protocols impractical for realistic memory bounds. (Note that with
today's technology such as hard disks, an adversary can cheaply store large amounts of classical data.)

== Position-based quantum cryptography ==
The goal of position-based quantum cryptography is to use the ''geographical location'' of a player as its (only) credential. For example, one wants to send a message to a player at a specified position with the guarantee that it can only be read if the receiving party is located at that particular position. In the basic task of ''position-verification'', a player Alice wants to convince the (honest) verifiers that she is located at a particular point. It has been shown by Chandran ''et al.'' that position-verification using classical protocols is impossible against colluding adversaries (who control all positions except the prover's claimed position).<ref name="chandran09classical"/> Under various restrictions on the adversaries, schemes are possible.

Under the name of 'quantum tagging', the first position-based quantum schemes have been investigated in 2002 by Kent. A US-patent<ref name="kent06patent"/> was granted in 2006, but the results only appeared in the scientific literature in 2010.<ref name="kent10first"/> After several other quantum protocols for position verification have been suggested in 2010,<ref name="Lau10insecurity"/><ref name="Malaney10location"/> Buhrman et al. were able to show a general impossibility result:<ref name="buhrman10impossible"/> using an enormous amount of [[quantum entanglement]], colluding adversaries are always able to make it look to the verifiers as if they were at the claimed position. However, this result does not exclude the possibility of practical schemes in the bounded- or noisy-quantum-storage model (see above).

== Post-quantum cryptography ==
{{Main|Post-quantum cryptography}}

In a predictive sense, [[quantum computers]] may become a technological reality; it is therefore important to study cryptographic schemes that are (supposedly) secure even against adversaries with access to a quantum computer. The study of such schemes is often referred to as [[post-quantum cryptography]]. The need for post-quantum cryptography arises from the fact that many popular encryption and signature schemes (such as RSA and its variants, and schemes based on elliptic curves) can be broken using [[Shor's algorithm]] for [[Integer factorization|factoring]] and computing [[discrete logarithms]] on a quantum computer. Examples for schemes that are, as of today's knowledge, secure against quantum adversaries are [[McEliece_cryptosystem|McEliece]] and [[Lattice-based cryptography|lattice-based]] schemes. Surveys of post-quantum cryptography are available.<ref name="pqcrypto.org"/><ref name="bernstein09pqc"/>

There is also research into how existing cryptographic techniques have to be modified to be able to cope with quantum adversaries. For example, when trying to develop [[Zero-knowledge proof|zero-knowledge proof systems]] that are secure against quantum adversaries, new techniques need to be used: In a classical setting, the analysis of a zero-knowledge proof system usually involves "rewinding", a technique that makes it necessary to copy the internal state of the adversary. In a quantum setting, copying a state is not always possible ([[no-cloning theorem]]); a variant of the rewinding technique has to be used.<ref name="watrous09qzk"/>
