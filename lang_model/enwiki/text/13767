==Early life==
Egmont Prinz<ref group="Notes">since all nobility titles were abolished after the establishment of the [[First Austrian Republic]] his official name was Egmont zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld instead of Prinz (''Prince'') zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld from then on</ref> or zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld was born on 14 July 1918 in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]] as a member of the aristocratic [[House of Lippe]]. His father was Prinz Alfred zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld and his mother Anna Wei<U+00DF>enfeld, ne<U+00E9> Countess Go<U+00EB><U+00DF>. Egmont was the only son of four children. His sisters Carola, Sophie and Dora were all younger than Egmont. The family lived in an old castle in [[Upper Austria]] called ''Alt Wartenburg''.<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 129, 199.</ref> 

Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld in his younger years was very enthusiastic about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting. At the same time he was also very much interested in music and sports and discovered his love for flying at the [[Gaisberg]] near [[Salzburg]]. Here he attended the glider flying school of the Austrian A<U+00EB>ro Club. He attended a basic flying course with the second air regiment in [[Graz]] and [[Wiener Neustadt]] even before he joined the military service.<ref>Knott 2008, p. 133.</ref>

==Military service==
Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld joined the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Bundesheer]] in 1936 at the age of 18, initially serving in the infantry. In the aftermaths of the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'', the incorporation of Austria into Greater Germany by [[Nazi Germany]], he transferred to the German Luftwaffe and was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' in 1939. He had earned his Lufwaffe Pilots Bade on 5 October 1938 and underwent further training at [[F<U+00FC>rstenfeldbruck]], [[Schlei<U+00DF>heim]] and [[Vienna]]-[[Aspern]].<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 134, 149.</ref> His Luftwaffe career started with the II. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Gruppen|Gruppe]]'' (group) of the [[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 76]] (ZG 76) before he was transferred to the night fighter wing [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]] (NJG 1) on 4 August 1940.<ref group="Notes">For an explanation of the meaning of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designation see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].</ref> The unit was based at [[G<U+00FC>tersloh]] where he familiarised himself with the methods of the night fighters.<ref name="Helden der Wehrmacht p136">''Helden der Wehrmacht II - Unsterbliche deutsche Soldaten'' 2003, p. 136.</ref>

By the summer of 1940, the first night fighters were transferred to [[Leeuwarden]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld was one of the pilots included in this small detachment. As early as 20 October 1940, he had taken over command of an independent night fighter commando at [[Schiphol]] and later at [[Bergen]]. On his first encounter with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bomber, in the night of 16 to 17 November 1940, he claimed a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber from the [[No. 115 Squadron RAF]] shot down at 0205 hours.<ref name="Knott p149">Knott 2008, p. 149.</ref> His second victory was claimed on the night of 15 January 1941, when he shot down an [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] of the [[No. 58 Squadron RAF]] over northern [[Holland]].<ref name="Knott p149"/> He was wounded in action on 13 March 1941, while flying [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110 D-2]] (''W.Nr.'' 3376 &mdash; factory number) of the 4./NJG1 with his radio operator Josef Renette when he made an emergency landing at Bergen after their aircraft was hit by the defence fire, wounding them both.<ref name="Knott p163">Knott 2008, p. 163.</ref> Shortly after midnight on 10 April 1941, Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld claimed a [[No. 12 Squadron RAF]] Wellington over the [[Ijsselmeer]], raising NJG 1's victory score to 100. This achievement was celebrated at the Amster Hotel in [[Amsterdam]] with ''General'' [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Wolfgang Falck]], [[Werner Streib]], [[Helmut Lent]] and others attending.<ref>Knott 2008, p. 152.</ref> On 30 June 1941 while flying Bf 110 C-4 (''W.Nr.'' 3273) on a practice intercept mission, he collided with Bf 110 C-7 (''W.Nr.'' 2075) of the 4./NJG 1 and crashed near Bergen aan Zee.<ref name="Knott p163"/> On 19 June 1941 he earned his first of four references in the daily ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]''. By July 1941 his number of aerial victory claims stood at 10. Promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' he became ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' of the 5th ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Staffel|Staffel]]'' of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG 2) on 15 November 1941. By the end of 1941 he had claimed a total of 15 aerial victories.<ref name="Helden der Wehrmacht p136"/>

In January 1941 Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld became acquainted with Hannelore Ide, nicknamed ''Idelein''. She was a secretary for a Luftgau. The two shared a close relationship and spent as much time together as the war permitted, listening to music and sailing on the Zuiderzee until his death in 1944.<ref>Knott 2008, p. 169.</ref>

He was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold (''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold'') on 25 January 1942 and the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') on 16 April 1942 after he had shot down 4 RAF bombers in the night of 26 to 27 March 1942, his score standing at 21 aerial victories. This feat earned him his third reference in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' on 27 march 1942. In July 1942 he was one of the leading German night fighter aces with 37 aerial victories.<ref name="Helden der Wehrmacht p137">''Helden der Wehrmacht II - Unsterbliche deutsche Soldaten'' 2003, p. 137.</ref>

Promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'', Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld was made ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of the I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] on 1 October 1942, where he claimed 3 further aerial victories. He was transferred again, taking command of the III. ''Gruppe'' of NJG 1 on 31 May 1943.

He and his crew, ''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'' Josef Renette and ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Kurt R<U+00F6>ber, were killed in a flying accident on 22 March 1944 on a routine flight from [[Parchim]] to [[Athies-sous-Laon]]. His [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110 G-4]] C9+CD (''W.Nr.'' 720 010) crashed into the [[Ardennes]] mountains near [[Saint-Hubert, Belgium|St. Hubert]] in bad weather.<ref>Obermaier 1989, p. 57.</ref> The funeral service was held in the city church of [[Linz]] on 15 March 1944.<ref>Knott 2008, p. 201.</ref> Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld and Prinz [[Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein|Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]] are buried side by side at [[Ysselsteyn]] in the [[Netherlands]].<ref>Knott 2008, p. 206.</ref>
