The [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) is a [[Desegregation|desegregated]] force, made up of troops of all races working and fighting alongside each other. In 1776 and 1777, a dozen black Marines served in the [[American Revolutionary War]], but from 1798 to 1942, the USMC followed a racially discriminatory policy of denying blacks the opportunity to serve as Marines. For more than 140 years, the Marines recruited primarily [[white American]]s and [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white Hispanics]], along with a few [[Asian Americans]].

The USMC opened its doors to blacks in June 1942, with the acceptance of [[African Americans]] as recruits in segregated all-black units. Other races were accepted somewhat more easily, joining white Marine units. For the next few decades, the incorporation of black troops was not widely accepted within the Corps, nor was desegregation smoothly or quickly achieved. Spurred by [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]] in 1941 and 1948, the integration of non-white USMC personnel proceeded in stages from segregated battalions in 1942, to unified training in 1949, and finally full integration in 1960.<ref name=Ebony1969/>

==Background==
[[File:William W. Burrows.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marine Commandant [[William Ward Burrows I|William Ward Burrows]] enforced a policy against enlisting "Blacks and Mulattoes".<ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/>]]
In America, blacks fought alongside whites in the [[Continental Army]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and in every war up to the [[War of 1812]]. The first black American to fight in a Marine role was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig [[USS Reprisal (1776)|USS ''Reprisal'']]. Martin served with the Marine platoon on the ''Reprisal'' for a year and a half, involved in hard ship-to-ship fighting, but was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777.<ref name=ShawDonnelly2002>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Blacks%20in%20the%20Marine%20Corps%20%20PCN%2019000306200_1.pdf |title=Blacks in the Marine Corps |last1=Shaw |first1=Henry I., Jr. |last2=Donnelly |first2=Ralph W. |publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters USMC |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref> At least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776<U+2013>1777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the Marine Corps was officially re-instituted, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[James McHenry]] specified in its rules: "No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted".<ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/> Marine Commandant [[William Ward Burrows I|William Ward Burrows]] instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, "You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them."<ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/> This policy was in line with long-standing British naval practice which set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines so that they would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies.<ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/>

In the [[United States Civil War]], some 180,000 African Americans joined the [[Union Army]] and mostly served in support roles as teamsters, laborers, construction workers and cooks. Some fought the [[Confederate Army]] under white officers in segregated units. In later conflicts, the [[United States Army]] used black soldiers in the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] and in [[World War I]]. However, when the [[United States Army Air Service]] was formed, only white people were allowed.<ref name="MacGregor Ch.1">{{cite book |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-01.htm |title=I: Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940<U+2013>1965 |chapter=Introduction |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J., Jr. |publisher=US Army, Center of Military History |location=Washington, DC |year=1985 |series=Defense Studies}}</ref> Mexican Americans served in World War I integrated with whites in all of the service arms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valerosos.com/HispanicsMilitary.html |title=America's Hispanics in America's Wars |last=Villahermosa |first=Gilberto |work=Army Magazine |month=September |year=2002 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] used black sailors as cooks, stewards, construction workers and unskilled labor, but did not train them to fight. The Marine Corps, being a combat arm of the Navy, did not recruit any black soldiers. Instead, the USMC was serviced by US Navy supply personnel including black laborers. After World War I, the number of blacks in both the Navy and the Army was reduced to about 1.5% of the total number of active servicemen, a proportion much lower than the number of blacks in the general population.<ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/>

==1930s==
===African American civil rights pressure===
In the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], the growing political power of African Americans was increasingly felt in Washington, DC. Civil rights groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[National Urban League]], and the [[National Negro Congress]] called for greater equality between the races. In 1938, the [[Committee on Participation of Negroes in the National Defense Program]] was formed by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a newspaper with a large black readership. Further calls to increase the proportion of blacks in the military were published in 1939.<ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/>

[[File:FDRfiresidechat2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] prohibited racial discrimination in the military.]]
After wars broke out in the late 1930s in Africa, China and Europe, black community leaders determined to use the black workforce's loyalty as leverage to gain greater racial equality at home. In June 1940, the NAACP's magazine, ''[[The Crisis]]'', published a declaration that the fighting around the world was certainly bad, "but the hysterical cries of the preachers of democracy for Europe leave us cold. We want democracy in Alabama, Arkansas, in Mississippi and Michigan, in the District of Columbia, in the Senate of the United States."<ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/> During the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]], both parties courted the black vote. Incumbent President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was re-elected, partly because substantial numbers of black voters crossed previous party lines and voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate.

==1941==
In April 1941 the US Navy convened its General Board to discuss expansion of the USMC. Major General [[Thomas Holcomb]], Commandant of the Marines, said that African Americans had no right to serve as Marines. He said, "If it were a question of having a Marine Corps of 5,000 whites or 250,000 Negroes, I would rather have the whites."<ref name=Integration>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RIsbUaQf-DkC&pg=PA100 |pages=100<U+2013>102 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940<U+2013>1965 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1981 |editor=Center of Military History, U.S. Army |isbn=0160019257}}</ref>

In 1941, Roosevelt was pressured by civil rights activists [[Bayard Rustin]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], and [[A. J. Muste]] to order fair employment for blacks in the federal government. The activists threatened to march on Washington, DC, in July 1941, and Roosevelt intended to prevent such a public relations disaster for his presidency. On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]]; the elimination of racial discrimination from federal departments, agencies, the military, and from private defense contractors. The black activists canceled their planned march.

Directed by Roosevelt and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|US Navy Secretary]] [[Frank Knox]] to accept black recruits, Holcomb proposed a separate battalion of African Americans, a seacoast defense unit armed with anti-aircraft and anti-shipping artillery. To make this battalion self-supporting, Holcomb determined that it would contain a rifle company, special weapons platoons, and a light tank platoon<U+2014>all manned by black Marines.<ref name=Integration/>

==World War II==
===Code talkers===
In early 1942, [[Philip Johnston (code talker)|Philip Johnston]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and a U.S. Army veteran of World War I, suggested to the USMC that they follow the example of the Army and recruit native speakers of the [[Navajo language]] to pass important tactical messages by radio, to serve as [[code talkers]] on the battlefield. On May 5, 1942, the first group of 29 Navajo recruits were accepted at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]].<ref name=WW2Faq>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq61-2.htm |publisher=U.S. Naval Historical Center |title=Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> From 1942 to 1945, some 375 to 420 Navajos trained as code talkers, part of about 540 Marines who were native Navajo speakers during World War II.

===African-American recruits===
On June 1, 1942, the initial group of black USMC recruits were admitted, but they were not immediately trained because separate, segregated facilities had not been completed. Black volunteers began their basic training in August at [[Camp Gilbert H. Johnson|Montford Point]] in North Carolina, a satellite base to Marine Barracks, New River, later called [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]]. The first black recruit to arrive in camp was Howard P. Perry on August 26, followed that day by 12 others.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_8E27gNaezoC&pg=PA5 |pages=5<U+2013>6 |last=DeClouet |first=Fred |title=First Black Marines: Vanguard of a Legacy |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2000 |isbn=1588201201}}</ref> These and subsequent recruits were organized into the 51st Composite Defense Battalion,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/storyview.aspx?SID=2444 |title=Montford Point Marines pioneered Corps<U+2019> history |publisher=Marine Corps Base Quantico |first=Meloney R. |last=Moses |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> a static artillery unit intended to hold land against attack.

By October 29, only 647 of a planned 1,200 recruits had passed entrance examinations<U+2014>to avoid forming segregated training units to teach typing, truck driving and other specialist skills necessary to run the battalion, Holcomb required more than half of the recruits to demonstrate proficiency in these skills prior to acceptance.<ref name=Integration/> This requirement was dropped in view of the delay it caused in bringing the battalion up to strength. Recruits were taught specialist skills by white USMC instructors brought in to Montford Point, or they were sent to nearby Army classes.<ref name=Integration/>

The black recruits were not allowed in Camp Lejeune unless accompanied by a white Marine, and their service papers were stamped "Colored".<ref name=AARegistry>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/marine-corps-integrates |title=Marine Corps Integrates! |publisher=African American Registry |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> Although the U.S. was by this time fully engaged in war, the recruits were assigned to inactive duty in the Marine Corps Reserve. Their units were segregated<U+2014>all the enlisted servicemen were black, with white officers and [[drill instructor]]s. The commander of the black Marines at Montford Point was Samuel A.

After accepting more black recruits, the USMC formed the 52nd Defense Battalion.

==1948 to 1960==
[[Image:Chicago Defender July 31 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' announces [[Executive Order 9981]] in 1948]]
After World War II, the USMC reduced in size; the number of black Marines dropped to 2,000 men; one-tenth wartime levels.<ref name=Ebony1969/> In 1947 black Marines were made to choose between leaving the service or becoming a steward (a food service position).<ref name=Ebony1969/> A few non-white Marines advanced in grade, such as Chew-Een Lee, a Chinese-American soldier who was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1946. Lee earned the [[Navy Cross]] under fire in Korea in September 1950, serving in the [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]]; at the time a primarily white unit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/military//korea/factsheets/asian.html |title=Asian-Americans in the United States Military during the Korean War |publisher=New Jersey Korean War Memorial |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey |work=Factsheet |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref>

On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued [[Executive Order 9981]] establishing equality of treatment and opportunity in the U.S. military regardless of race. In January 1949, the [[Fahy Committee]] met to hear concerns about new executive order, and both the Army and the Marine Corps leadership defended their practices of segregation. However, the Navy and the newly formed [[United States Air Force]] announced their intention to follow the order. The USMC revealed that it had only one black officer among 8,200 white ones.<ref name=TrumanChronology>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/desegregation/large/index.php?action=chronology |title=Desegregation of the Armed Forces: Chronology |publisher=Harry S.

The very few black USMC officers were assigned exclusively to black units; they were not asked to lead white Marines into combat. In 1952 after two years of the [[Korean War]], black Marines were being cautiously integrated into combat units.<ref name=Ebony1969/> In the late 1950s, black Marines were not rewarded with preferred or high-visibility assignments such as embassy guard duty and guard duty in the nation's capital.<ref name=Ebony1969/> By 1960, full integration of the races had been completed by the USMC, though not without racial tensions flaring up through the next decade.<ref name=Ebony1969/>
