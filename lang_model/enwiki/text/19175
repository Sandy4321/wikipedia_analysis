The nature of '''cyberwarfare in the People's Republic of China''' is difficult to assess. Government officials in India and the United States have traced various attacks on corporate and [[infrastructure]] computer systems in their countries to computers in the [[People's Republic of China]].

The United States has accused the People's Republic of China of implementing cyberwarfare and cyberespionage against American interests, accessing the networks of important military, commercial, research, and industrial organisations.
