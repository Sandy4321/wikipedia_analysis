==Background==

{{TOC right|limit=2}}
The [[United States Senate|Senate]] proposed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 18, 1917. Having been approved by 36 states, the 18th Amendment was ratified on January 16, 1919 and effected on January 17, 1920.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vick|first=Dwight|title=Drugs and Alcohol in the 21st Century: Theory, Behavior, and Policy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fwRF5tFand8C&pg=PA128&dq=%22alcohol+prohibition+became+law+on+january+17%22&hl=en&ei=kf01Tf70NoeqhAfQta3PCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22alcohol%20prohibition%20became%20law%20on%20january%2017%22&f=false|accessdate=2011-01-18|year=2010|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9780763774882|page=128}}</ref>

On November 18, 1918, before the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, the United States Congress passed the temporary Wartime Prohibition Act, which banned the sale of alcoholic beverages having an alcohol content of greater than 2.75%.<ref>Miller, William D. ''Pretty Bubbles in the Air: American in 1919'', [[University of Illinois Press]], 1991, p. 151. ISBN 0-252-01823-0</ref>  (This act, which was intended to save grain for the war effort, was passed after the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.)  The Wartime Prohibition Act took effect June 30, 1919, and July 1, 1919 became widely known as the "Thirsty-First".<ref>[http://www.burlingtonhistory.org/Newsletters/2010%20March%20newsletter-1.htm Burlington Historical Society 2010 March newsletter]</ref><ref>Fitzgerald, F.

[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Volstead Act]], the popular name for the National Prohibition Act, over [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[veto]] on October 28, 1919, and established the legal definition of intoxicating liquor, as well as penalties for producing it.<ref name="nih2006">"Beer: A History of Brewing in Chicago", Bob Skilnik, Baracade Books, 2006, ISBN 978-1569803127</ref> Though the Volstead Act prohibited the sale of alcohol, the federal government did little to enforce it. By 1925, in [[New York City]] alone, there were anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 [[speakeasy]] clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/volstead-act/ |title=Teaching With Documents: The Volstead Act and Related Prohibition Documents  |publisher=United States National Archives |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref>

While Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor consumed, it stimulated the proliferation of rampant underground, organized and widespread criminal activity.<ref name="t100524">{{Cite news | first=David | last=Von Drehle | title=The Demon Drink | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1989146,00.html| work= | publisher=Time | location=New York, New York | pages= 56 | date=24 May 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> The bulk of America became disenchanted after the [[Saint Valentine's Day massacre|St. Valentine's Day massacre]] in 1929.<!---please do not change this.

On March 22, 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] signed into law an amendment to the Volstead Act known as the [[Cullen-Harrison Act]], allowing the manufacture and sale of certain kinds of alcoholic beverages.  On December 5, 1933, the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] repealed the Eighteenth Amendment. However, United States federal law still prohibits the manufacture of [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] without meeting numerous licensing requirements that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal beverage use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttb.gov/faqs/genalcohol.shtml#g1 |title=TTBGov General Alcohol FAQs |publisher=United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau |date=2006-04 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] supporting the temperance movement, January 1846]]
Alcohol and alcoholism have been a contentious topic in America since the colonial period.

In May of 1657, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] made  the sale of strong liquor "whether known by the name of [[rum]]me, [[whisky|strong water]], [[wine]], [[brandy]], etc." illegal.<ref>{{cite book | author=Blue, Anthony Dias | title=The Complete Book of Spirits : A Guide to Their History, Production, and Enjoyment | publisher=[[HarperCollins]] | year=2004 | isbn=0-06-054218-7 | page= 73}}</ref>

In general, informal social controls in the home and community helped maintain the expectation that the abuse of alcohol was unacceptable. "Drunkenness was condemned and punished, but only as an abuse of a God-given gift. Drink itself was not looked upon as culpable, any more than food deserved blame for the sin of [[gluttony]]. Excess was a personal indiscretion."<ref name="AaronMusto1981">Aaron, Paul and Musto, David. Temperance and Prohibition in America: An Historical Overview. In: Moore, Mark H., and Gerstein, Dean R. (eds.) Alcohol and Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition. Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1981. pp. 127-181.</ref> When informal controls failed, there were always legal ones.

One of the foremost physicians of the late 18th century, [[Benjamin Rush]], argued in "The Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind" in 1784 that the excessive use of alcohol was injurious to physical and psychological health and went so far as to label drunkenness as a disease (he believed in moderation rather than prohibition).<ref>{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|pages=10}}</ref>  Apparently influenced by Rush's widely discussed belief, about 200 farmers in a [[Connecticut]] community formed a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] association in 1789. Similar associations were formed in [[Virginia]] in 1800 and [[New York]] in 1808. Within the next decade, other temperance organizations were formed in eight states, some being statewide organizations.  The words of Rush and other early temperance reformers served to dichotomize the use of alcohol for men and women.  While men enjoyed drinking and often considered it vital to their health, women who began to embrace the ideology of 'true motherhood' refrained from consumption of alcohol. Middle-class women were considered the moral authorities of their households and consequently rejected the drinking of alcohol, which was considered a threat to the home.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|pages=16}}</ref>

In 1830, the average American consumed 1.7 bottles of [[hard liquor]] per week, three times the amount consumed in 2010.<ref name="t100524"/>

===Development of the Prohibition movement===
{{Main|Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Volstead Act}}

The [[American Temperance Society]] (ATS), 1826, helped to initiate the first temperance movement and consequently served as a foundation for many later groups.  By 1835, the ATS had reached 1.5 million members, with women constituting between 35-60% of individual chapters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|pages=14}}</ref>

The prohibition, or "dry", movement continued in the 1840s, spearheaded by [[Pietism|pietistic]] religious denominations, especially the [[Methodist]]s. The late 19th century saw the [[temperance movement]] broaden its focus from abstinence to all behavior and institutions related to alcohol consumption. Preachers such as [[Mark A. Matthews|Reverend Mark A. Matthews]] linked liquor-dispensing saloons with [[prostitution]].

Some successes were registered in the 1850s, including [[Maine law|Maine's total ban]] on the manufacture and sale of liquor, adopted in 1851. However, the ban in Maine was repealed in 1856. The movement soon lost strength, and was marginalized during the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865).

The issue was revived by the [[Prohibition Party]], founded in 1869, and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), founded in 1873. The WCTU advocated the prohibition of alcohol. Women supported prohibition as a method for preventing the abuses of alcoholic husbands.  Through the late 19th Century, women were legally disadvantaged and did not possess the rights to their own property or often to their own children.  The women of the WCTU fought to preserve the sanctity of the home despite these legal barriers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordin|first=Ruth|title=Women and Temperance: The Quest for Power and Liberty, 1873-1900|year=1981|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|pages=8}}</ref>  One of its methods to achieve that goal was education. It was believed that if it could "get to the children" it could create a "dry" sentiment leading to prohibition. (Supporters of prohibition were nicknamed "Dry"; opponents were called "Wet".) [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the second president of the WCTU, held the aims of the organization were to create a "union of women from all denominations, for the purpose of educating the young, forming a better public sentiment, reforming the drinking classes, transforming by the power of Divine grace those who are enslaved by alcohol, and removing the dram-shop from our streets by law."<ref>{{cite book|last=Willard|first=Frances E.|title=Let Something Good Be Said: Speeches and Writings of Frances E. Willard|year=2007|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|pages=78}}</ref> This organization also supported suffrage and helped women to insert themselves into the political sphere - by 1890 women were allowed to vote on school issues in 17 states at a time when women were denied true voting privileges across the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|pages=74}}</ref> While still denied universal voting privileges, women in the WCTU followed Frances Willard's "Do Everything" doctrine and used temperance as a method of entering into politics and furthering other progressive issues such as prison reform and labor laws.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movement: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|pages=13}}</ref>

In 1881, [[Kansas]] became the first state to outlaw alcoholic beverages in its [[Kansas Constitution|Constitution]], with [[Carrie Nation]] gaining notoriety for enforcing the provision herself by walking into saloons, scolding customers, and using her hatchet to destroy bottles of liquor. Nation recruited ladies into the Carrie Nation Prohibition Group, which Nation also led. While Carrie Nation's vigilante techniques were rare, other activists enforced the cause by entering saloons, singing, praying, and urging saloon keepers to stop selling alcohol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/carry1.htm |title=Carry A.

Many court cases also debated the subject under different lights and for different situations, there was an overall lean towards prohibition, however, many cases still ruled opposed to the believed effects.  In Mugler v. Kansas, 1887, Justice Harlan, wrote, "We cannot shut out of view the fact, within the knowledge of all, that the public health, the public morals, and the public safety, may be endangered by the general use of intoxicating drinks; nor the fact established by statistics accessible to every one, that the idleness, disorder, pauperism and crime existing in the country, are, in some degree... traceable to this evil."<ref name="Hopkins, Richard J 1925">Hopkins, Richard J. "The Prohibition and Crime". The North American Review. Volume: 222. Number: 828. September, 1925. 40-44.</ref> In support of prohibition, Crowley v. Christensen, 1890, said, "The statistics of every state show a greater amount of crime and misery attributable to the use of ardent spirits obtained at these retail liquor saloons than to any other source."<ref name="Hopkins, Richard J 1925"/>

In the [[Progressive Era]] (1890<U+2013>1920), hostility to saloons and their political influence became widespread, with the [[Anti-Saloon League]] superseding the Prohibition Party and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union as the most influential advocate of prohibition, when the latter two groups chose to piggyback other social reform issues, such as women's suffrage, onto their prohibition platform.

Prohibition was an important force in state and local politics from the 1840s through the 1930s. The political forces involved were ethnoreligious in character, as demonstrated by numerous historical studies.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System 1853-1892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures.'' (1979) pp 131-39; Paul Kleppner, ''Continuity and Change in Electoral Politics, 1893-1928.'' (1987); Ballard Campbell, "Did Democracy Work? Prohibition in Late Nineteenth-century Iowa: a Test Case."

''American Political Science Review'' 1992 86(4): 938-950.</ref> Prohibition was demanded by the "dries" <U+2013> primarily [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestant denominations, especially the [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Northern Baptist Convention|Northern Baptist]]s, [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Quakers]] and [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. They identified saloons as politically corrupt and drinking as a personal sin. Other active organizations included the Women's Church Federation, the Women's Temperance Crusade, and the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction. They were opposed by the "wets" <U+2013> primarily liturgical [[Protestantism|Protestants]] ([[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]], German Lutherans) and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], who denounced the idea that the government should define morality.<ref>Jensen (1971) ch 5. [Fuller reference needed.]</ref> Even in the wet stronghold of [[New York City]] there was an active prohibition movement, led by [[Norway|Norwegian]] church groups and [[African-American]] labor activists who believed that Prohibition would benefit workers, especially African-Americans. Tea merchants and soda fountain manufacturers generally supported Prohibition, thinking a ban on alcohol would increase sales of their products.<ref>Lerner, Michael A. ''Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2007.</ref>

Prohibition represented a conflict between urban and rural values emerging in the United States. Given the mass influx of immigrants to the urban dwellings of the United States, many individuals within the prohibition movement associated the crime and morally corrupt behavior of the cities of America with their large immigrant populations. In a backlash to the new emerging realities of the American demographic, many prohibitionists subscribed to the doctrine of <U+201C>nativism<U+201D> in which they endorsed the notion that America was made great as a result of its white Anglo-Saxon ancestry. This fostered xenophobic sentiments towards urban immigrant communities who typically argued in favor of abolishing prohibition.<ref>Lerner, Michael A. ''Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2007 p.96-97</ref> Additionally, these nativist sentiments were a part of a larger process of Americanization taking place during the same time period.<ref>[http://science.jrank.org/pages/8266/Americanization-U-S-American-National-Identity-Ideologies-Americanization.html Us Americanization <U+2013>American National Identify and Ideologies of Americanization]</ref>
[[File:3b49095u.tif|thumb|250px|Political cartoon describing the alliance between the prohibition and women suffrage movements.]]

Two other amendments to the constitution were championed by "dries" to help their cause. The [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Federal income tax]] replaced the alcohol taxes that funded the federal government.<ref name="Last Call">Okrent, Daniel. (2010). ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition''. New York: Scribner. ISBN 0-7432-7702-3. {{oclc|419812305}}
</ref>{{sup|p.57}}   Also, since women tended to support prohibition, temperance organizations supported [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|women suffrage]].<ref name="Last Call"/>

In the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916 presidential election]], both Democratic incumbent [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Republican candidate [[Charles Evans Hughes]] ignored the Prohibition issue, as was the case with both parties' political platforms. Democrats and Republicans had strong wet and dry factions, and the election was expected to be close, with neither candidate wanting to alienate any part of his political base.

In January 1917, the 65th Congress convened, in which the dries outnumbered the wets by 140 to 64 in the Democratic Party and 138 to 62 among Republicans. With America's declaration of war against [[Germany]] in April, [[German-American]]s<U+2014>a major force against prohibition<U+2014>were widely discredited and their protests subsequently ignored. In addition, a new justification for prohibition arose: prohibiting the production of alcoholic beverages would allow more resources<U+2014>especially the grain that would otherwise be used to make alcohol<U+2014>to be devoted to the war effort. While "war prohibition" was a spark for the movement,<ref>''E.g.'', "The Economics of War Prohibition", pp. 143-144 in: Survey Associates, Inc., ''The Survey'', Volume 38, April<U+2013>September, 1917.</ref> by the time Prohibition was enacted, the war was over.

A resolution calling for an [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amendment]] to accomplish nationwide Prohibition was introduced in Congress and passed by both houses in December 1917. By January 16, 1919, the Amendment had been ratified by thirty-six of the forty-eight states. On October 28, 1919, the amendment was implemented by the Volstead Act. Prohibition began on January 17, 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. A total of 1,520 Federal Prohibition agents (police) were given the task of enforcing the law.

Although it was highly controversial, Prohibition was widely supported by diverse groups. Progressives believed that it would improve society as generally did women, southerners, those living in rural areas and African-Americans. There were a few exceptions such as the Woman<U+2019>s Organization for Prohibition Reform who fought against it. [[Will Rogers]] often joked about the southern pro-prohibitionists: "The South is dry and will vote dry. That is, everybody sober enough to stagger to the polls." Supporters of the Amendment soon became quite confident that it would not be repealed, to the point that one of its creators, Senator [[Morris Sheppard]], joked that "there is as much chance of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a humming-bird to fly to the planet Mars with the Washington Monument tied to its tail."<ref>Kyvig, David E: "Women Against Prohibition." ''American Quarterly''.  28, no. 4 (Autumn, 1976), 465-482.</ref>

At the same time, songs emerged decrying the act; after [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]], returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] following his 1919 tour of [[Canada]], he recounted to his father, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], a ditty he'd heard at a border town:

The issue of Prohibition became a highly controversial one among medical professionals, because alcohol was widely prescribed by physicians of the era for therapeutic purposes. Congress held hearings on the medicinal value of beer in 1921. Subsequently, physicians across the country lobbied for the repeal of Prohibition as it applied to medicinal liquors.<ref>Appel, Jacob M. "Physicians Are Not Bootleggers:  The Short, Peculiar Life of the Medicinal Alcohol Movement." ''The Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (Summer, 2008)</ref>

While the manufacture, sale and transport of alcohol was illegal in the U.S., Section 29 of the Volstead Act allowed the making at home of wine and cider from fruit (but not beer). Up to 200 gallons per year could be made, and some [[vineyard]]s grew grapes for home use. Also, one anomaly of the Act as worded was that it did not actually prohibit the ''consumption'' of alcohol; many people actually stockpiled wines and liquors for their own use in the latter part of 1919 before sales of alcohol became illegal the following January.

Alcoholic drinks were not always illegal in all neighboring countries. Distilleries and breweries in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]] flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or illegally imported to the U.S. The [[Detroit River]], which forms part of the border with Canada, was [[Rum-running in Windsor|notoriously difficult to control]]. [[Chicago]] became a haven for Prohibition dodgers during the time known as the ''[[Roaring Twenties]]''. Many of Chicago's most notorious gangsters, including [[Al Capone]] and his enemy [[Bugs Moran]], made millions of dollars through illegal alcohol sales. By the end of the decade Capone controlled all 10,000 [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] in Chicago and ruled the [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] business from Canada to [[Florida]]. Numerous other crimes, including theft and murder, were directly linked to criminal activities in Chicago and elsewhere in violation of prohibition.

===Repeal===
{{Main|Repeal of Prohibition}}
[[File:Repeal of Prohibition newsreel ca1933.ogv|thumb|left|1933 newsreel]]
As Prohibition became increasingly unpopular, especially in the big cities, "Repeal" was eagerly anticipated. On March 23, 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] signed an amendment to the Volstead Act known as the [[Cullen-Harrison Act]], allowing the manufacture and sale of "3.2 beer" (3.2% alcohol by weight, approximately 4% alcohol by volume) and light wines.  The original Volstead Act had defined "intoxicating beverage" as one with greater than 0.5% alcohol.<ref name="nih2006"/> Upon signing the amendment, Roosevelt made his famous remark; "I think this would be a good time for a beer."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954983-6,00.html | work=Time | title=F.D.R.'s Disputed Legacy | date=February 1, 1982 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | first1=Otto | last1=Friedrich | first2=Hays | last2=Gorey}}</ref> The Cullen-Harrison Act became law on April 7, 1933, and on April 8, 1933, [[Anheuser-Busch]], Inc. sent a team of [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale horses]] to deliver a case of Budweiser to the [[White House]]. The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed on December 5, 1933 with ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]]. Despite the efforts of [[Heber J. Grant]] and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], a [[Utah]] convention helped ratify the 21st Amendment.<ref>Reeve, W. Paul, [http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/from_war_to_war/prohibitionfailedtostoptheliquorflowinutah.html "Prohibition Failed to Stop the Liquor Flow in Utah"]. ''Utah History to Go.'' (First published in ''History Blazer'', February 1995)</ref> While Utah can be considered the deciding 36th state to ratify the Amendment and make it law, the day Utah approved the Amendment, both [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]] approved it as well.

One of the main reasons why enforcement of prohibition did not proceed smoothly was the inefficient means of enforcing the laws set forth by the 18th amendment. From its very inception, the law lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the public who had previously been drinkers and yet completely law-abiding citizens. The public in some instances viewed the laws as being <U+201C>arbitrary and unnecessary<U+201D> and therefore were willing to breach them. Consequently, law enforcements agents who had not been bribed to turn a blind eye, found themselves overwhelmed by the dramatic rise in alcohol related offenses that were being violated on such a wide scale due to the Volstead Act. The enormity of the task was not anticipated and consequently the necessary resources to pursue it were not allocated. Additionally, enforcement of the 18th amendment lacked centralized authority and many attempts to impose prohibitionist laws were deterred due to the lack of transparency between federal and state authorities. Furthermore, the reality of American geography contributed significantly to the difficulties in enforcing prohibition. The terrain of valleys, mountains, lakes and swamps as well as the extensive seaways, ports and massive borders running along Canada and Mexico made it exceedingly difficult for prohibition agents to stop bootleggers given their lack of resources. Ultimately it was recognized with its repeal that the means by which the law was to be enforced was not pragmatic, and that in many cases the legislature did not match the general public opinion.<ref>Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States. National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement. Dated January 7th 1931 "Bad Features of the Present Situation and Difficulties in the Way of Enforcement</ref>

Prohibition was a major blow for the alcohol industry and repeal was therefore a step toward the amelioration of one sector of the economy. A perfect example for this is the case of St. Louis. The city had been one of the most important alcohol producers before prohibition started and was ready to take back its position as soon as possible. Its major brewery had "50,000 barrels" of beer ready to be sent since March 22. It was the first alcohol producer to refill the market, but others followed. This slowly allowed stores to obtain alcohol after, of course, having obtained a license. The restart of beer production allowed thousands of workers to find jobs again.<ref>New York Times, 50,000 barrels ready in St Louis, March 23rd 1933</ref>

Prohibition created a [[black market]] that competed with the formal economy, which already was under pressure.{{clarify|A total ban is different from government control. Today's regulation may create a "black market" but bans did away with legal production altogether and replaced it with nothing. An economist might suggest that the Black Market in alcohol helped the economy as opposed to a total ban|date=February 2011}} Roosevelt was elected based on the [[New Deal]], which promised improvement to the economy that was only possible if the formal economy competed successfully against various economic forces, including the effects of prohibition's black market. This influenced his support for ratifying the 21st amendment, which repealed the 18th amendment that had established prohibition.<ref>Prohibition, Repeal, and Historical Cycles, Dwight B Heath, Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies</ref>

The Twenty-first Amendment explicitly confirms the right of states to restrict or ban the purchase or sale of alcohol. This led to a patchwork of laws in which alcohol may be legally sold in some but not all towns or counties within a particular state. After repeal of the 18th amendment, some states continued to enforce prohibition laws. [[Mississippi]], which had made alcohol illegal in 1907, was the last state to repeal Prohibition in 1966. [[Kansas]] did not allow sale of liquor "by the drink" (on-premises) until 1987. To the present day, there are still numerous "dry" counties and towns in America that restrict or prohibit liquor sales.<ref>{{cite web|author=Burkhart, Jeff|url=http://nationalgeographicassignmentblog.com/2010/08/19/the-great-experiment-prohibition-continues/ |title= The Great Experiment: Prohibition Continues|publisher=National Geographic Assignment |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> Additionally, many tribal governments prohibit alcohol on [[Indian reservations]].

.{{refimprove|does not seem correlated to Prohibition by a scholarly source. Idle speculation only.|date=April 2011}} 
Many [[Social issues of the 1920s|social problems]] have been attributed to the Prohibition era. [[American Mafia|Mafia]] groups limited their activities to prostitution, gambling, and theft until 1920, when organized [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] manifested in response to the effect of Prohibition.<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/11944/Organized-Crime-American-Mafia.html Organized Crime - American Mafia], Law Library - American Law and Legal Information</ref> A profitable, often violent, black market for alcohol flourished. Powerful gangs corrupted law enforcement agencies, leading to [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]]. In essence prohibition provided a financial basis for organized crime to flourish.<ref>Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States. National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement. Dated January 7th 1931</ref>  Rather than reducing crime it seemed prohibition had transformed the cities into battlegrounds between opposing bootlegging gangs. In a study of over 30 major U.S cities during the prohibition years of 1920 and 1921, the number of crimes increased by 24%. Additionally, theft and burglaries increased by 9%, homicide by 12.7%, assaults and battery rose by 13%, drug addiction by 44.6% and police department costs rose by 11.4%. It has been speculated{{clarify|by whom?|date=April 2011}} that this was largely the result of <U+201C>black-market violence<U+201D> as well as law enforcing resources having been diverted elsewhere. Despite the beliefs of the prohibitionist movement that by outlawing alcohol crime would surely be reduced, the reality was that the Volstead Act led to worse social conditions than were experienced prior to prohibition as demonstrated by more lethal forms of alcohol, increased crime rates, and the establishment of a black market dominated by criminal organizations.<ref>Charles Hanson Towne, The Rise and Fall of Prohibition: The Human Side of What the Eighteenth Amendment Has Done to the United States (New York: Macmillan, 1923) p.159-162</ref>{{Clarify|The words about "worse social conditions" overall, are patently untrue. Too broad. Crime rates correlated by age? Lots of young people coming of age then. I agree with the "criminal organization." Probably should omit generalization and give facts. Charles Hanson Towne" is not notable. Since this is controversial, he should be a notable scholar to be quoted this precisely IMO|date=May 2011}}

Furthermore, stronger liquor surged in popularity because its potency made it more profitable to smuggle. To prevent bootleggers from using industrial ethyl alcohol to produce illegal beverages, the government ordered the [[Denatured alcohol|poisoning of industrial alcohols]].  In response, bootleggers hired chemists who successfully renatured the alcohol to make it drinkable.  As a response, the Treasury Department required manufacturers to add more deadly poisons, including the particularly deadly [[methyl alcohol]]. New York City medical examiners prominently opposed these policies because of the danger to human life. As many as 10,000 people died from drinking denatured alcohol before Prohibition ended.<ref>Blum, Deborah. [http://www.slate.com/id/2245188 "The Chemist's War: The Little-told Story of how the U.S. Government Poisoned Alcohol During Prohibition, with Deadly Consequences"], Slate. Washington Post, Feb. 2010. Web. 19 Feb. 2010.</ref>

Another lethal substance that was often substituted for alcohol was "canned heat," also commonly known as [[Sterno]]. By forcing the substance through a make-shift filter, such as a handkerchief, to create a rough liquor substitute.  However, the result was poisonous, though not often lethal.  Many of those who were poisoned as a result united to sue the government for reparations after the end of Prohibition.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932">Lusk, Rufus S. "The Drinking Habit". ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. Volume: 163. Prohibition: A National Experiment. September, 1932. 46-52.</ref>

Making alcohol at home was very common during Prohibition. Stores sold grape concentrate with warning labels that listed the steps that should be avoided to prevent the juice from fermenting into wine. As well, some drug stores would sell a "medical wine" with around a 22% alcohol content; in order to justify the sale, the wine was given a medical taste.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Home-distilled hard liquor was referred to as <U+201C>bathtub gin<U+201D> in northern cities, and [[moonshine]] in the rural areas of [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Tennessee]]. Home-brewing good hard liquor was easier than brewing good beer.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Since selling privately distilled alcohol was illegal and bypassed taxation by the government, the law relentlessly pursued manufacturers.<ref name="Communications, Aug 1998">Oldham, Scott. "NASCAR Turns 50." Popular Mechanics. Hearst Communications, Aug. 1998. Web. 23 Nov. 2009.</ref> In response, the bootleggers in southern states started creating their own [[Hot rod|souped-up]], stock-looking cars by enhancing their cars<U+2019> engines and suspensions to create a faster vehicle. Having a faster vehicle during Prohibition, they presumed, would improve their chances of outrunning and escaping agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF), commonly called "revenue agents" or "revenuers". These cars became known as <U+201C>moonshine runners<U+201D> or "'shine runners".<ref>"NASCAR, an Overview - Part 1." Suite101.com. Google. Web. 22 Nov. 2009.</ref> Ships were also known to collaborate with the underground liquor market, by loading their stocks with ingredients for liquors, which anyone could legally purchase (these include: benedictine, vermuth, scotch mash, and even ethyl alcohol).<ref>Willing, Joseph K. "The Profession of Bootlegging". ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. Volume: 125. Modern Crime: Its Prevention and Punishment. May, 1926. 40-48.</ref>

Prohibition also had a large effect on the music industry in the United States, specifically with [[jazz]]. [[Speakeasy|Speakeasies]] became far more popular during that time and the effects of the Great Depression caused a migration that led to a greater dispersal of jazz music. Movement began from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and went north through [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and  to New York. This also meant developing different styles in the different cities. Because of its popularity in speakeasies and the development of more advanced recording devices, jazz became very popular very fast. It was also at the forefront of the minimal integration efforts going on at the time, as it united mostly black musicians with mostly white crowds.<ref>Erenberg, Lewis A. ''Swingin' the Dream : Big Band Jazz and the Rebirth of American Culture'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press), 1998.</ref><!--page#?-->

Along with other economic effects, the enactment of prohibition and the resulting enforcement and the resources dedicated to that enforcement increased. During the 1920s, the annual budget of the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] went from $4.4 million to $13.4 million. Additionally, the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] spent an average of $13 million annually on prohibition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bureau of Prohibition, Statistics Concerning Intoxicating Liquors|year=1930|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=2}}</ref> These numbers do not take into account the costs to local and state governments.

When repeal of Prohibition occurred in 1933, organized crime lost nearly all of its [[black market]] alcohol profits in most states (states still had the right to enforce their own laws concerning alcohol consumption) because of competition with low-priced alcohol sales at legal liquor stores.

Prohibition had a notable effect on the alcohol brewing industry in the United States. When Prohibition ended, only half the breweries that previously existed reopened. Wine historians also note Prohibition destroyed what was a fledgling wine industry in the United States. Productive wine quality grape vines were replaced by lower quality vines growing thicker skinned grapes that could be more easily transported. Much of the institutional knowledge was also lost as winemakers either emigrated to other wine producing countries or left the business altogether.<ref>[[Karen MacNeil]], ''The Wine Bible'', pp.630-631.</ref> Hard-liquor was popularized during the interim, as good beer became more difficult to find.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Because this form of liquor was much harder than the popular drinks had before 18th amendment, other forms of the drinks were developed; mixing and watering down the hard alcohol became popular, especially rum and gin.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/>

At the end of Prohibition, some supporters openly admitted its failure. A quote from a letter, written in 1932 by wealthy industrialist [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], states:<blockquote>''"When Prohibition was introduced, I hoped that it would be widely supported by public opinion and the day would soon come when the evil effects of alcohol would be recognized. I have slowly and reluctantly come to believe that this has not been the result. Instead, drinking has generally increased; the [[speakeasy]] has replaced the saloon; a vast army of lawbreakers has appeared; many of our best citizens have openly ignored Prohibition; respect for the law has been greatly lessened; and crime has increased to a level never seen before."''<ref>Letter on Prohibition - see Daniel Okrent, ''Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center'', New York: Viking Press, 2003. (pp.246/7).</ref></blockquote>

===Prohibition and Christianity===
Prohibition in the early to mid-twentieth was fueled by the Protestant denominations in the U.S.<ref>Kee, Howard Clark. Christianity : A Social and Cultural History. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998.p. 486</ref> Churches in the U.S. saw the opportunity to curtail intoxication, gluttony, and overindulgence of alcohol which was a successful venture. Revivalism in the 19th century seemed to set the stage for the relationship of Christianity and the surge towards prohibition in the United States. <U+201C>The greater prevalence of revival religion within a population, the greater support for the Republican and Prohibition parties within that population.<U+201D><ref>Thomas, George M. Revivalism and Cultural Change : Christianity, Nation Building, and the Market in the Nineteenth-Century United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989.p.65</ref> Author Nancy Koester speaks to the understanding of which the  law of Prohibition was a <U+201C>victory for progressives and social gospel activists battling poverty<U+201D>.<ref>Koester, Nancy. Fortress Introduction to the History of Christianity in the United States. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007. p. 154.</ref> Prohibition was an obvious political issue in which Christians in the U.S. took seriously. It was something that seemed to unite progressives and revivalists alike. After the passage of prohibition it quite possibly gave more political power to a growing Christian presence within the national make-up of the United States.

===Unintended outcomes===
As a result of prohibition, the advancements of [[industrialization]] were essentially reversed. This was achieved by large scale alcohol producers being shut down for the most part and individual citizens taking it upon themselves to produce alcohol illegally. This process reversed the efficiency of mass producing and retailing alcoholic beverages. Closing manufacturing plants and taverns resulted in economic reversal. The [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] originally did not have this effect on the industry due to its failure to define what an <U+201C>intoxicating<U+201D> beverage was. The [[Volstead Act]]<U+2019>s definition of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume constituting <U+201C>intoxicating<U+201D> shut down the brewers who had expected to still be able to produce beer of moderate strength.<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243">{{cite journal|last=Blocker, Jr.|first=Jack S.|title=Did Prohibition Really Work?|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2006|month=February|volume=96|issue=2|pages=233<U+2013>243}}</ref>

Illegal marketeers had to attract new clients. One notable group of new drinkers were women. Those who were not in support of prohibition could drink in the new semi-public environment of [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]].This was a result of the masculinity of drinking being reduced as a result of the [[Western saloon|saloon]] dying out and the norm of women drinking in public was much more acceptable.<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243"/>

Heavy drinkers and alcoholics were among the most affected parties during prohibition. Those who were determined to find liquor could still do so, but those who saw their drinking habits as destructive typically had difficulty in finding the help they sought. The self-help societies had withered away along with the alcohol industry and in 1935 a new self-help group was founded: [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]].<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243"/>

===Post-repeal===
Not until the 1960s <!---and Baby Boomers, but the ref didn't say that!--> did the consumption of alcohol surpass pre-Prohibition levels.

==Winemaking during Prohibition==
The Volstead Act specifically allowed individual farmers to make certain wines "on the legal fiction that it was a non-intoxicating fruit-juice for home consumption",<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742105,00.html Time magazine article from 1931 on wine bricks]</ref> and many people did so.  Enterprising grape farmers produced liquid and semi-solid grape concentrates, often called "wine bricks" or "wine blocks".<ref>{{cite web | title=Prohibition in Wine Country| publisher=''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' |. url=http://www.napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/real-napa/article_ed8bdf22-4a81-11df-bb7d-001cc4c002e0.html | accessdate=2010-04-18 | date=2010-04-18 | last=Burnham | first=Kelsey}}</ref> This demand led [[California (wine)|California]] grape growers to increase their land under cultivation by about 700% in the first five years of prohibition. The grape concentrate was sold with a warning: "After dissolving the brick in a gallon of water, do not place the liquid in a jug away in the cupboard for twenty days, because then it would turn into wine."<ref name="AaronMusto1981" /> One grape block producer sold nine varieties: Port, Virginia Dare, [[Muscatel]], [[Angelica (wine)|Angelica]], [[Tokay (wine)|Tokay]], Sauterne, [[Riesling]], [[Claret]] and [[Burgundy (wine)|Burgundy]].
