'''Nahuel Huapi Lake''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Lago Nahuel Huapi''') is a [[lake]] of the lake region of northern [[Patagonia]] between the provinces of [[R<U+00ED>o Negro Province|R<U+00ED>o Negro]] and [[Neuqu<U+00E9>n Province|Neuqu<U+00E9>n]], in [[Argentina]]. It is of [[Glacial lake|Glacial]] origin is a [[Moraine-dammed lake]].


Nahuel Huapi lake, located within the [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]], has a surface of 529 [[square kilometres|km<U+00B2>]], rests 2,510 feet (765m) over the sea level, and has a maximum measured depth (as of 2007) of 1,437 feet (438m).


Its seven branches are named ''Blest'' (36 [[km2]]), ''Huemul''  (21.5 km2), ''de la Tristeza'' (18.5 km2), ''Campanario'' (7.9 km2) , ''Machete'', ''del Rinc<U+00F3>n'' and ''<U+00DA>ltima Esperanza''. It is connected to other smaller lakes such as ''Guti<U+00E9>rrez'', ''Moreno'', ''[[Lago_Espejo|Espejo]]'' and ''Correntoso''. The deep-blue waters hold a number of islands, most notably ''Isla Victoria'' with 31 km<U+00B2>. 


This breathtaking lake harbors several spices of trout including [[Rainbow Trout]], [[Brown Trout]] and [[Brook Trout]] which attract [[anglers]] from the world over. [http://www.bariloche.org/paginas/2007/02/27/la_fauna_del_parque_nacional_nahuel_huapi/] 


A curios fact about this lake is that despite being nowhere near any ocean and being at high altitude, it is also home for [[Kelp Gull]] and the [[Cormorant|Blue Eyed Cormorant]] (Phalacrocorax atriceps), otherwise strictly marine birds. [http://www.birdsoman.com/Birds/017-Cormorants/BlueeyedCormorant/BlueeyedCormorant.htm]  [http://www.ripioturismo.com.ar/np-nh.htm] [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-5422(198608)88%3A3%3C393%3AROCPOJ%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W]


The lake<U+2019>s crystal clear waters are very susceptible to climate changes and have an average surface temperature of 45<U+00BA>F (7<U+00BA>C), this makes it both beautiful and treacherous. [[Hypothermia]] is one of the risks bathers must undertake. [[Kayaking]] is a popular sport on this and adjacent lakes.
The lake is also the starting point of the [[Limay River]].


==''Nahuelito''==
At the beginning of the 20th century, and following an old aboriginal legend, the rumor of a giant creature living in the deep waters of the lake took up. The ''creature'' is known locally as ''[[Nahuelito]]''. Reported sightings of it predate [[Nessie]] and [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)]].  [http://www.strangemag.com/nahuelito.html]


Local aborigines ([[Mapuche]]) called the creature ''el Cuero'' (leather) for its smooth skin.  The neighboring lake [[Lago Lacar]], has also been the site for accounts of another creature, more consistent with a [[plesiosaur]], with aborigines describing it as a ''sea-cow'' with ''teeth'' all around it.


Members of the [[Buenos Aires Zoo]] visited the lake in 1922 trying to corroborate the reports of sightings of the prehistoric animal, but found no evidence to support the theory of such a creature.
