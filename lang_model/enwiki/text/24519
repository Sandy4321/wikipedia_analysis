The '''Battle of Greece''' (also known as '''Operation Marita''', {{lang-de|Unternehmen Marita|links=no}})<ref name="C3-4">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm |title=THE GERMAN CAMPAIGN IN THE BALKANS (SPRING 1941): PART III |publisher=Army.mil |date=1940-10-28 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref> is the common name for the invasion of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in April 1941. It followed a previous, unsuccessful Italian invasion known as the [[Greco-Italian War]]. It is usually distinguished from the [[Battle of Crete]] that came after mainland Greece had been subdued. These operations were part of the greater [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] of Nazi Germany in [[World War II]].

At the time of the German invasion, Greece was already at war with Italy, following the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940. Greece successfully defeated the initial attack and the counterattack of March 1941. When Operation Marita began on 6 April, the bulk of the Greek army was on the Albanian border, from which the Italians were trying to enter Greece. German troops invaded through Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece had already received a small reinforcement from [[British Empire]] forces in anticipation of the German attack but no more help was sent after the invasion began. The Greek army found itself vastly outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the Bulgarian defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans who then outflanked the Greek forces in the Albanian borders, forcing their surrender. The British Empire forces then performed a tactical retreat with an ultimate goal of evacuation. The German army reached the city of Athens on 27 April{{Cref|a}} and Greece's southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British Empire forces,{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=102<U+2013>6}} and ending the battle to their complete victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its conquest, Greece was occupied by military forces of Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria.

Looking back near the end of the war, as Germany's inevitable and impending defeat loomed ever closer, Hitler attributed great blame to Mussolini's Greek fiasco as the cause of his own subsequent catastrophe.<ref>''The Testament of Adolf Hitler. The Hitler-Bormann Documents February <U+2013> April 1945'', ed.

At the outbreak of World War II, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]<U+2014>then [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictator]] of Greece and former [[General]]<U+2014>sought to maintain a position of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. However, Greece was subject to increasing pressure from Italy, culminating when the Italian submarine ''[[Italian submarine Delfino (1930)|Delfino]]'' sank the cruiser [[Greek cruiser Elli (1912)|''Elli'']] on 15 August 1940.<ref name="H">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=[[Helios (encyclopedia)|Helios]]}}</ref> Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was irritated that [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] had not consulted him on his war policy and wished to establish his independence.{{Cref|b}} He hoped to match the Germans' military success by taking Greece, which he regarded as an easy opponent.<ref name="BG">{{harvnb|Buckley|1984|p=18}}<br>* {{harvnb|Goldstein|1992|p=53}}</ref> On 15 October 1940, Mussolini and his closest advisers finalised their decision.{{Cref|c}} In the early hours of 28 October, Italian Ambassador Emanuele Grazzi<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2003/luglio/30/Grecia_1940_notte_dell_ultimo_co_0_030730066.shtml | title = Grecia 1940, la notte dell' ultimo inganno | work=Corriere della Sera | date=30 July 2003 | accessdate = 2013-01-25}}</ref> presented Metaxas with a three-hour ultimatum, demanding free passage for troops to occupy unspecified "strategic sites" within Greek territory.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=17}} Metaxas rejected the ultimatum (the refusal is commemorated as Greek national holiday [[Ohi Day]]), but even before its expiration, Italian troops had invaded Greece through Albania.{{Cref|d}} The principal Italian thrust was directed toward [[Epirus]].

Neither a change in Italian command nor the arrival of substantial reinforcements improved the position of the Italian army.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=18<U+2013>20}}

After weeks of inconclusive winter warfare, the Italians launched a large-scale counterattack across the center of the front on 9 March 1941, which failed, despite the Italians' superior forces. After one week and 12,000 casualties, Mussolini called off the counterattack and left Albania twelve days later.<ref name="BB">{{harvnb|Bailey|1979|p=22}}<br>* [http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm More U-boat Aces Hunted down], OnWar.Com</ref> Modern analysts believe that the Italian campaign failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to the campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men),{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=119}} failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support.<ref name="R29">{{harvnb|Creveld|1972|p=41}}<br>* {{harvnb|Rodogno|2006|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref> Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken.{{sfn|Neville|2003|p=165}} Nor had Mussolini considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production that Italy would not be able to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=146}}

During the six-month fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made territorial gains by eliminating Italian [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]s. Nevertheless, Greece did not have a substantial armaments industry and both its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. In order to man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Eastern Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]]. Available Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.<ref name="C72">{{harvnb|Blau|1986|pp=70<U+2013>71}} [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm]</ref>

Hitler intervened on 4 November 1940, four days after British troops arrived at [[Crete]] and [[Lemnos]]. Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion, the British troops that were sent as defensive aid created the possibility of a frontier to the German southern flank. The ''[[F<U+00FC>hrer]]'' ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in [[Romania]] and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases.<ref name="CHel">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 5<U+2013>7]<br>* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Helios}}</ref> On 12 November, the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Armed Forces High Command]] issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against [[Gibraltar]] and Greece for the following January.

The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on 13 December 1940, outlining the Greek campaign under the code designation "Operation Marita".

On 17 November 1940, Metaxas proposed a joint offensive in the Balkans to the British government, with Greek strongholds in southern Albania as the operational base. The British were reluctant to discuss Metaxas' proposal, because the troops necessary for implementing the Greek plan would seriously endanger operations in North Africa.{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1997|p=285, 288}} During a meeting of British and Greek military and political leaders in Athens on 13 January 1941, [[strategos|General]] [[Alexandros Papagos]]<U+2014>[[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Hellenic Army]]<U+2014>asked Britain for nine fully equipped divisions and corresponding air support.

==Prelude==
===Topography===
To enter Northern Greece, the German army had to cross the [[Rhodope Mountains]], which offered few river valleys or [[mountain pass]]es capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of [[Kyustendil]]; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and [[Nestos River|Nestos]] rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, as part of the larger [[Metaxas Line]]. This system of concrete [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es and field fortifications, constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles similar to those of the [[Maginot Line]]. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.<ref name="CB75">{{harvnb|Bailey|1979|p=37}}<br>* {{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 75]</ref>

===Strategic factors===
[[File:Churchill-in-quebec-1944-23-0201a.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill believed it was vital for Britain to take every measure possible to support Greece. On 8 January 1941, he stated that "there was no other course open to us but to make certain that we had spared no effort to help the Greeks who had shown themselves so worthy."{{sfn|Lawlor|1994|p=191<U+2013>192}}]]

Greece's mountainous terrain favored a defensive strategy and the high ranges of the Rhodope, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Pindus]] and [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many [[defile (geography)|defile]]s. Although an invading force from [[Albania]] could be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.<ref name="CB77">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 77]</ref>

Following a March conference in Athens, the British believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the [[Haliacmon]] Line<U+2014>a short front facing northeastward along the [[Vermio Mountains]] and the lower [[Haliacmon]] river. Papagos awaited clarification from the Yugoslav government and later proposed to hold the [[Metaxas Line]]<U+2014>by then a symbol of national security to the Greek populace<U+2014>and not withdraw divisions from Albania.<ref name="PMc">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=106<U+2013>107}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html]<br>* {{harvnb|Papagos|1949|p=115}}<br>* {{harvnb|Ziemke}} {{Wayback |date=19981205074151 |url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_7.html |title=Balkan Campaigns }}</ref> He argued that to do so would be seen as a concession to the Italians. The strategically important port of [[Thessaloniki]] lay practically undefended and transportation of British troops to the city remained dangerous.<ref name="Mc106-107">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 106<U+2013>107]</ref> Papagos proposed to take advantage of the area's terrain and prepare fortifications, while also protecting Thessaloniki.

General Dill described Papagos' attitude as "unaccommodating and defeatist",<ref name="L168">Lawlor (1994), 168</ref> and argued that his plan ignored the fact that Greek troops and artillery were capable of only token resistance. The British believed that the Greek rivalry with Bulgaria<U+2014>the Metaxas Line was designed specifically for war with Bulgaria<U+2014>as well as their traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs<U+2014>left their north-western border largely undefended.{{sfn|Bailey|1979|p=37}} Despite their awareness that the line was likely to collapse in the event of a German thrust from the Struma and [[Axios River|Axios]] rivers, the British eventually acceded to the Greek command. On 4 March, Dill accepted the plans for the Metaxas line and on 7 March agreement was ratified by the [[British Cabinet]].<ref name="LM">{{harvnb|Lawlor|1994|p=168}}<br>*{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=107<U+2013>108}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 107<U+2013>108]</ref> The overall command was to be retained by Papagos and the Greek and British commands agreed to fight a delaying action in the northeast.<ref name="CB77"/> Nevertheless, the British did not move their troops, because General Wilson regarded them as too weak to protect such a broad front. Instead, he took a position some {{convert|40|miles|km|abbr=off}} west of the Axios, across the Haliacmon Line.<ref name="Zi">{{harvnb|Svolopoulos|1997|p=290}}<br>* {{harvnb|Ziemke}} {{Wayback |date=19981205074151 |url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_7.html |title=Balkan Campaigns }}</ref> The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Hellenic army in Albania and to deny German access to Central Greece. This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options, while allowing more preparation time. However, it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, which was unacceptable to the Greeks for political and psychological reasons. Moreover, the line's left flank was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] gap in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|pp=40<U+2013>45}} However, the rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army and a German thrust into the rear of the [[Vermio, Kozani|Vermion]] position was not expected.<ref name="CB77"/>

The German strategy was based on using so-called "''[[blitzkrieg]]''" methods that had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe. Their effectiveness was confirmed during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. The German command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into the territory. Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of [[Piraeus]] became principal targets. The loss of Piraeus and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces.<ref name="CB77"/>

(Australian War Memorial, Canberra)]]

The Fifth Yugoslav Army took responsibility for the southeastern border between [[Kriva Palanka]] and the Greek border. However, the Yugoslav troops were not fully mobilised and lacked adequate equipment and weapons. Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from [[Western Thrace]]. By this time, Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totaled roughly 70,000 men (sometimes labeled the "Greek Second Army" in English and German sources, although no such formation existed). The remainder of the Greek forces<U+2014>14 divisions (often erroneously referred to as the "Greek First Army" by foreign sources)<U+2014>was committed in Albania.<ref name="CB79">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79]</ref>

On 28 March, Greek forces in Central Macedonia<U+2014>the [[12th Infantry Division (Greece)|12th]] and [[20th Infantry Division (Greece)|20th]] Infantry Divisions<U+2014>were put under the command of General Wilson, who established his headquarters northwest of [[Larissa]]. The New Zealand division took position north of [[Mount Olympus]], while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the [[Aegean Sea]]. These [[Logistics|logistical]] problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.<ref name="CB79-80">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79<U+2013>80]</ref>

The [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Twelfth Army]]<U+2014>under the command of [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm List]]<U+2014>was charged with the execution of Operation Marita. His army was composed of six units:

# First Panzer Group, under the command of General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]].
# [[XL Panzer Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Georg Stumme]].
# XVIII Mountain Corps, under Lieutenant General [[Franz B<U+00F6>hme]].
# XXX Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General [[Otto Hartmann (general)|Otto Hartmann]].
# L Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General [[Georg Lindemann]].
# 16th Panzer Division, deployed behind the Turkish-Bulgarian border to support the Bulgarian forces in case of a Turkish attack.<ref name="CB81">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 81]</ref>

===German plan of attack and assembly===
The German plan of attack was influenced by their army's experiences during the [[Battle of France]]. Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.<ref name="CB82-83">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82<U+2013>83]</ref>

The Yugoslav ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' led to a sudden change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via [[Ni<U+0161>]] toward [[Belgrade]]. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.<ref name="CB83-84">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 83<U+2013>84]</ref>

==German invasion==
===Thrust across Southern Yugoslavia and the drive to Thessaloniki===
[[File:Battle of Greece - 9 April 1941.png|thumb|German advance until 9 April 1941, when the 2nd Panzer Division seized Thessaloniki.]]
{{See also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

At dawn on 6 April, the German armies invaded Greece, while the [[Luftwaffe]] began an intensive bombardment of [[Belgrade]]. The XL Panzer Corps<U+2014>planned to attack across southern Yugoslavia<U+2014>began their assault at 05:30. They pushed across the Bulgarian frontier at two separate points. By the evening of 8 April, the [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|73rd Infantry Division]] captured [[Prilep]], severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki and isolating Yugoslavia from its allies. On the evening of 9 April, Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for attack toward [[Florina]]. This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W Force in the area of Florina, [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] and [[Katerini]].<ref name="Mc160">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c8-2.html 160]</ref> While weak security detachments covered his rear against a surprise attack from central Yugoslavia, elements of the [[9th Panzer Division]] drove westward to link up with the Italians at the Albanian border.<ref name="CB86">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 86]</ref>

The [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of 6 April and advanced westward through the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, [[Land mine|mine]]s and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day's objective, the town of [[Strumica]]. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counterattack against the division's northern flank was repelled and the following day the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the Greek [[19th Motorized Infantry Division (Greece)|19th Motorised Infantry Division]] units stationed south of [[Doiran Lake]]. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April.<ref name="CB87">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 87]</ref> Thessaloniki's capture took place without a struggle and was followed by the surrender of the Greek East Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on April 10.

===Metaxas Line===
{{details|Battle of the Metaxas Line}}
The Metaxas Line was defended by the [[Eastern Macedonia Army Section]], which comprised the [[7th Infantry Division (Greece)|7th]], [[14th Infantry Division (Greece)|14th]] and [[18th Infantry Division (Greece)|18th]] Infantry Divisions under the command of Lieutenant General [[Konstantinos Bakopoulos]]. The line ran for about {{convert|170|km|miles|abbr=off}} along the river Nestos to the east and then further east, following the Bulgarian border as far as [[Belasica|Mount Beles]] near the Yugoslav border. The fortifications were designed to garrison over 200,000 troops, but the actual number was roughly 70,000. As a result the line's defences were thinly spread.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=30<U+2013>33}}

The Germans had to break the line to capture Thessaloniki, Northern Greece's biggest city, with a strategic port. The attack started on 6 April with one infantry unit and two divisions of the XVIII Mountain Corps. Due to strong resistance, the first day of the attack yielded little progress in breaking the line.<ref name="BCB">{{harvnb|Buckley|1984|p=50}}<br>* {{harvnb|Blau|1986}} [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 88]</ref> A German report at the end of the first day described how the German [[5th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Mountain Division]] "was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties".{{sfn|Beevor|1994|p=33}} Of the 24 forts that made up the Metaxas Line, only two had fallen and then only after they had been destroyed.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=50}}
In the following days, the Germans pummelled the forts with [[artillery]] and [[dive bomber]]s and reinforced the 125th Infantry Regiment. A 7,000 foot (2100 meter) high snow-covered mountainous passage considered inaccessible by the Greeks was successfully crossed by the [[6th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Mountain Division]], which reached the rail line to Thessaloniki on the evening of 7 April. The 5th Mountain Division, together with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, penetrated across the Struma river under great hardship, attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective location on 7 April. Heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw. The 72nd Infantry Division advanced from [[Gotse Delchev, Blagoevgrad Province|Nevrokop]] across the mountains. Its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery and mountain equipment. Only on the evening of 9 April did it reach the area northeast of [[Serres]].<ref name="CB88">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 88]</ref> Most fortresses<U+2014>like Rupel, [[Echinos]], Arpalouki, Paliouriones, Perithori, Karadag, Lisse and Istibey<U+2014>held until the Germans occupied Thessaloniki on 9 April,{{sfn|Sampatakakis|2008|p=23}} at which point they surrendered under General Bakopoulos' orders. Nevertheless, minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them. This gave time for some retreating troops to evacuate by sea.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1984|p=61}}<br>*{{harvnb|Blau|1986|p=89}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm]</ref>

Although eventually broken, the Metaxas Line proved much stronger than expected, inflicting significant damage to the German force.

===Capitulation of the Hellenic army in Macedonia===
The XXX Infantry Corps on the left wing reached its designated objective on the evening of 8 April, when the 164th Infantry Division captured [[Xanthi]]. The 50th Infantry Division advanced far beyond [[Komotini]] towards the Nestos river. Both divisions arrived the next day. On 9 April, the Greek forces defending the Metaxas Line capitulated unconditionally following the collapse of Greek resistance east of the Axios river. In a 9 April estimate of the situation, Field Marshal List commented that as a result of the swift advance of the mobile units, his 12th Army was now in a favorable position to access central Greece by breaking the Greek buildup behind the Axios river. On the basis of this estimate, List requested the transfer of the 5th Panzer Division from First Panzer Group to the XL Panzer Corps. He reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to the German thrust through the Monastir gap. For the continuation of the campaign, he formed an eastern group under the command of XVIII Mountain Corps and a western group led by XL Panzer Corps.<ref name="CB89-91">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 89<U+2013>91]</ref>

===Breakthrough to Kozani===
{{See also|Battle of Vevi (1941)}}
By the morning of 10 April, the XL Panzer Corps had finished its preparations for the continuation of the offensive and advanced in the direction of [[Kozani]]. Against all expectations, the Monastir gap had been left open and the Germans exploited the error. First contact with Allied troops was made north of [[Vevi]] at 11:00 on 10 April. German SS troops seized Vevi on 11 April, but were stopped at the Klidi Pass just south of town, where a mixed Empire-Greek formation<U+2014>known as [[Iven Mackay|Mackay]] Force<U+2014>was assembled to, as Wilson put it, "...&nbsp;stop a ''blitzkrieg'' down the Florina valley."<ref>[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/greatrisk/greatrisk05.html The Roof is Leaking], Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs</ref> During the next day, the SS regiment reconnoitered the Allied positions and at dusk launched a frontal attack against the pass. Following heavy fighting, the Germans broke through the defence.<ref name="CB91">{{harvnb|Blau|1986|p=91}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 91]</ref> By the morning of 14 April, the spearheads of the [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|9th Panzer Division]] reached Kozani.

===Olympus and Servia passes===
Wilson faced the prospect of being pinned by Germans operating from Thessaloniki, while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap. On 13 April, he withdrew all British forces to the Haliacmon river and then to the narrow pass at [[Thermopylae]].{{sfn|Hondros|1983|p=52}} On 14 April, the 9th Panzer Division established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river, but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense Allied fire. This defence had three main components: the [[Platamon]] tunnel area between Olympus and the sea, the Olympus pass itself and the [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] pass to the southeast. By channeling the attack through these three [[defile (geography)|defile]]s, the new line offered far greater defensive strength. The defences of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade, 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 16th Australian Brigade. For the next three days, the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94]<br>* {{harvnb|Long|1953}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf]</ref>

A ruined castle dominated the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon. During the night of April 15, a German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge, but the Germans were repulsed by the [[21st New Zealand Battalion]] under Colonel Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day, a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion, but the New Zealanders held. After being reinforced during the night of the 15th<U+2013>16th, the Germans assembled a tank battalion, an infantry battalion and a motorcycle battalion. The infantry attacked the New Zealanders' left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later.<ref name="CB98">{{harvnb|Blau|1986|p=98}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm]</ref>
[[File:AWM 007647 vevi.jpg|thumb|Australian anti-tank gunners resting, soon after their withdrawal from the Vevi area.]]

The New Zealand battalion withdrew, crossing the [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Pineios]] river; by dusk, they had reached the western exit of the Pineios Gorge, suffering only light casualties.<ref name="CB98"/> Macky was informed that it was "essential to deny the gorge to the enemy until 19 April even if it meant extinction".<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 96]</ref> He sank a crossing barge at the western end of the gorge once all his men were across and set up defences. The 21st Battalion was reinforced by the [[2/2nd Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/2nd Battalion]] and later by the [[2/3rd Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd]]. This force became known as "Allen force" after Brigadier [[Arthur Samuel Allen|"Tubby" Allen]]. The [[2/5th Battalion (Australia)|2/5th]] and [[2/11th Battalion (Australia)|2/11th battalions]] moved to the [[Elatia]] area south-west of the gorge and were ordered to hold the western exit possibly for three or four days.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 96<U+2013>97]</ref>

On 16 April, Wilson met Papagos at Lamia and informed him of his decision to withdraw to Thermopylae. General Blamey divided responsibility between generals Mackay and [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Freyberg]] during the leapfrogging move to Thermopylae. Mackay's force was assigned the flanks of the New Zealand Division as far south as an east-west line through Larissa and to oversee the withdrawal through [[Domokos]] to Thermopylae of the [[Stanley Savige|Savige]] and Zarkos Forces and finally of Lee Force; Freyberg's [[1st Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Brigade]] was to cover the withdrawal of Savige Force to Larissa and thereafter the withdrawal of the 6th Division under whose command it would come; overseeing the withdrawal of Allen Force which was to move along the same route as the New Zealand Division. The British Empire forces remained under attack throughout the withdrawal.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 98<U+2013>99]</ref>

On the morning of 18 April, the struggle for the Pineios gorge aka [[Battle of Tempe Gorge]] was over, when German armoured infantry crossed the river on floats and 6th Mountain Division troops worked their way around the New Zealand battalion, which was subsequently dispersed. On 19 April, the first XVIII Mountain Corps troops entered Larissa and took possession of the airfield, where the British had left their supply dump intact. The seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled the spearhead units to continue without ceasing. The port of [[Volos]], at which the British had re-embarked numerous units during the prior few days, fell on 21 April; there, the Germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil.<ref name="CB100">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 100]</ref>

===Withdrawal and surrender of the Greek Epirus Army===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-163-0318-09, Griechenland, griechische Soldaten in Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|Retreating Greek soldiers, April 1941.]]
As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the Hellenic Army Section of Epirus (<U+03A4><U+03A3><U+0397>) operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat. General Wilson described this unwillingness as "the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians."{{sfn|Beevor|1994|p=39}} It was not until 13 April that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies' retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Hellenic army in a rearguard action. An elite SS formation<U+2014>the ''[[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]'' brigade<U+2014>was assigned the mission of cutting off the Greek Epirus Army's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the [[Metsovon]] pass and from there to Ioannina.{{sfn|Bailey|1979|p=32}} On 14 April, [[Battle of Kleisoura Pass|heavy fighting took place]] at [[Kleisoura, Kastoria|Kleisoura pass]], where the Germans blocked the Greek withdrawal. The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front, with the Italians in hesitant pursuit.<ref name="CB94">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94]</ref>

General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack. On 18 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade<U+2014>which had by then reached [[Grevena]]<U+2014>erupted.<ref name="CB94"/> The Greek units lacked the equipment necessary to fight against a motorised unit and were soon encircled and overwhelmed. The Germans advanced further and on 19 April captured Ioannina, the final supply route of the Greek Epirus Army.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 95]</ref> Allied newspapers dubbed the Hellenic army's fate a modern day [[Greek tragedy]]. Historian and former war-correspondent Christopher Buckley<U+2014>when describing the fate of the Hellenic army<U+2014>stated that "one experience[d] a genuine Aristotelian [[catharsis]], an awe-inspiring sense of the futility of all human effort and all human courage."{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=113}}

On 20 April, the commander of Greek forces in Albania<U+2014>General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]]<U+2014>accepted the hopelessness of the situation and offered to surrender his army, which then consisted of fourteen divisions.<ref name="CB94"/> Historian [[John Keegan]] writes that Tsolakoglou "was so determined&nbsp;... to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that&nbsp;... he opened [a] quite unauthorised parley with the commander of the German SS division opposite him, [[Sepp Dietrich]], to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone."{{sfn|Keegan|2005|pp=158}} On strict orders from Hitler, negotiations were kept secret from the Italians and the surrender was accepted.<ref name="CB94"/> Outraged by this decision, Mussolini ordered counterattacks against the Greek forces, which were repulsed. It took a personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to organize Italian participation in the armistice that was concluded on 23 April.{{sfn|Keegan|2005|pp=158}} Greek soldiers were not rounded up as [[prisoners of war]] and were allowed instead to go home after the demobilisation of their units, while their officers were permitted to retain their side arms.<ref>{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94<U+2013>96]<br>*{{harvnb|Hondros|1983|p=90}}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-163-0319-07A, Griechenland, Artilleriestellung auf freiem Feld.jpg|thumb|German artillery firing during the advance through Greece.]]
As early as 16 April, the German command realised that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The campaign then took on the character of a pursuit. For the Germans, it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to its limited mobility. The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.<ref name="CB103">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 103]</ref>

To allow an evacuation of the main body of British forces, Wilson ordered the rearguard to make a last stand at the historic Thermopylae pass, the gateway to Athens. General Freyberg was given the task of defending the coastal pass, while Mackay was to hold the village of Brallos. After the battle Mackay was quoted as saying "I did not dream of evacuation; I thought that we'd hang on for about a fortnight and be beaten by weight of numbers."<ref name="L143">{{harvnb|Long|1953}},[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/06.pdf 143]</ref> When the order to retreat was received on the morning of 23 April, it was decided that the two positions were to be held by one brigade each. These brigades, the 19th Australian and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. The Germans attacked at 11:30 on 24 April, met fierce resistance, lost 15 tanks and sustained considerable casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Bailey|1979|p=33}}<br>* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Brallos Pass|encyclopedia=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles}}</ref> The Allies held out the entire day; with the delaying action accomplished, they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes{{sfn|Bailey|1979|p=33}} The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and difficult hairpin bends.<ref name="CB104">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 104]</ref>

===German drive on Athens===
{{Quote box

Mussolini, alas, insisted on a glorious entry into the city for his Italian troops. The ''F<U+00FC>hrer'' yielded to the Italian demand and together the German and Italian troops marched into Athens.

After abandoning the Thermopylae area, the British rearguard withdrew to an improvised switch position south of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where they erected a last obstacle in front of Athens. The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division, which had crossed to the island of [[Euboea]] to seize the port of [[Chalcis]] and had subsequently returned to the mainland, was given the mission of outflanking the British rearguard. The motorcycle troops encountered only slight resistance and on the morning of 27 April 1941, the first Germans entered Athens, followed by [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s and [[infantry]]. They captured intact large quantities of POL ([[petroleum]], oil and [[lubricant]]s) several thousand tons of ammunition, ten trucks loaded with sugar and ten truckloads of other rations in addition to various other equipment, weapons and medical supplies.<ref name="CB111">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 111]</ref> The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans for several days and confined themselves to their homes with their windows shut. The previous night, Athens Radio had made the following announcement:

[[File:Archibald Wavell.jpg|thumb|In the morning of 15 April 1941, Wavell sent to Wilson the following message: "We must of course continue to fight in close cooperation with Greeks but from news here it looks as if early further withdrawal necessary."<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=104<U+2013>105}}, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf]</ref>]]

General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the commander of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece from 11<U+2013>13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General [[Freddie de Guingand]] to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action; the suggestion had to come from the Greek Government. The following day, Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn. Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April, [[Rear admiral]] H. T.

5,200 men, mostly from the 5th New Zealand Brigade, were evacuated on the night of 24 April, from [[Porto Rafti]] of [[East Attica]], while the 4th New Zealand Brigade remained to block the narrow road to Athens, dubbed the ''24 Hour Pass'' by the New Zealanders.{{sfn|Macdougall|2004|p=194}} On 25 April ([[Anzac Day]]), the few RAF squadrons left Greece (D'Albiac established his headquarters in [[Heraklion]], Crete) and some 10,200 Australian troops evacuated from [[Nafplio]] and [[Megara]].<ref name="MR">{{harvnb|Macdougall|2004|p=195}}<br>* {{harvnb|Richter|1998|pp=584<U+2013>585}}</ref> 2,000 more men had to wait until 27 April, because ''Ulster Prince'' ran aground in shallow waters close to Nafplio.

On 25 April the Germans staged an airborne operation to seize the bridges over the [[Corinth Canal|Corinth canal]], with the double aim of cutting off the British line of retreat and securing their own way across the [[Isthmus of Corinth|isthmus]].

The Dutch troop ship {{SS|Slamat||2}} was part of a convoy evacuating about 3,000 British, Australian and New Zealand troops from [[Nafplio]] in the Peloponnese.

The erection of a temporary bridge across the Corinth canal permitted 5th Panzer Division units to pursue the Allied forces across the Peloponnese.

===Triple occupation===
On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued Directive No. 27, including his occupation policy for Greece.{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp=602}} He finalised jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June.{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp=615}} Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. German forces occupied the strategically more important areas, namely Athens, Thessaloniki, [[Central Macedonia]] and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=616}} Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Greece,<ref>Marshal L.

The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through [[Alexandroupoli]] and [[Svilengrad]] west of the [[Evros River]].{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp=616<U+2013>617}} The remainder of Greece was left to Italy. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, [[Thessaly]]; and on 12 June, most of [[Attica]].{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=615}}

The occupation of Greece<U+2014>during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger<U+2014>proved to be a difficult and costly task. Several [[Greek Resistance|resistance group]]s launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.{{sfn|Carlton|1992|p=136}}

===Battle of Crete===

{{details|Battle of Crete}}

On 25 April 1941, King George II and his government left the Greek mainland for Crete, which was attacked by Nazi forces on 20 May 1941.<ref name="HKG">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Crete, Battle of| encyclopedia=Helios}}<br>* {{cite encyclopedia|title=George II|encyclopedia= Helios}}</ref> The Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion and attacked the three main airfields of the island in [[Maleme]], [[Rethymno]] and [[Heraklion]]. After seven days of fighting and tough resistance, Allied commanders decided that the cause was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from [[Sfakia]]. By 1 June 1941, the evacuation was complete and the island was under German occupation. In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the elite [[German 7th Flieger Division|7th ''Fliegerdivision'']], Hitler forbade further airborne operations. General Kurt Student would dub Crete "the graveyard of the German paratroopers" and a "disastrous victory."{{sfn|Beevor|1994|p=231}} During the night of 24 May, George II and his government were evacuated from Crete to Egypt.<ref name="HG"/>

==Assessments==
{{Battle of Greece timeline infobox}}

The Greek campaign ended with complete German victory. The British did not have the military resources to permit them to carry out simultaneous large-scale operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even had they been able to block the German advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counterthrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.

In enumerating the reasons for the complete German victory in Greece, the following factors were of greatest significance:

# Germany superiority in ground forces and equipment;<ref name="McC">{{harvnb|Blau|1986}}, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116<U+2013>118]<br>* {{harvnb|McClymont|1959}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471<U+2013>472]</ref>

# Inadequacy of British expeditionary forces, since the Imperial force available was small;<ref name="McC"/>
# Poor condition of the Hellenic Army and its shortages of modern equipment;<ref name="CB116-118"/>
# Inadequate port, road and railway facilities;<ref name="Mc471-472">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=471<U+2013>472}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html]</ref>
# Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British, Greek and Yugoslav forces;<ref name="CB116-118"/>
# Turkey's strict neutrality;<ref name="CB116-118"/> and
# The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance.<ref name="CB116-118"/>

===Backlash===
After the Allies' defeat, the decision to send British forces into Greece faced fierce criticism in Britain. Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] during World War II, considered intervention in Greece to be "a definite strategic blunder", as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of [[History of Libya as Italian colony|Italian-held Libya]], or to successfully withstand [[Erwin Rommel]]'s ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' March offensive. It thus prolonged the [[North African Campaign]], which otherwise might have been successfully concluded during 1941.{{sfn|Broad|1958|p=113}}

In 1947, [[Freddie de Guingand|de Guingand]] asked the British government to recognise its mistaken strategy in Greece.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=624}} Buckley countered that if Britain had not honored its 1939 commitment to Greece, it would have severely damaged the ethical basis of its struggle against Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|p=138}} According to Historian Heinz Richter, Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece to influence the political atmosphere in the United States and insisted on this strategy even after the defeat.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=633}} According to Keegan, "the Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemen's war, with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side" and the vastly outnumbered Greek and Allied forces, "had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight."{{sfn|Keegan|2005|pp=158}}
It has also been suggested the British strategy was to create a barrier in Greece, to protect [[Turkey]], the only (neutral) country standing between an Axis block in the Balkans and the oil-rich [[Middle East]].{{sfn|Lawlor|1982|pp=936, 945}}

Freyberg and Blamey also had serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation, but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions.<ref name="Mc475-476">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=475<U+2013>476}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html]</ref> The campaign caused a furore in Australia, when it became known that when he received his first warning of the move to Greece on 18 February 1941, General Blamey was worried, but had not informed the Australian Government. He had been told by Wavell that [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] Menzies had approved the plan.<ref name="Mc476">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=471<U+2013>472}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]</ref> Indeed, the proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present, but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=338}} On 5 March, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that "the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe" and the next day, he called the operation "most hazardous". However, thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.<ref name="Mc115-476">{{harvnb|McClymont|1959|pp=115, 476}}, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-13.html] and [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html]</ref>

===Impact on Operation Barbarossa===
In 1942, members of the [[British Parliament]] characterised the campaign in Greece as a "political and sentimental decision". Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=638<U+2013>639}} This is an argument that historians such as Keegan used to assert that Greek resistance was a turning point in World War II.<ref name="K144">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece (World War II)|encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of Battles}}<br>* {{harvnb|Keegan|2005|pp=144}}</ref> According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler [[Leni Riefenstahl]], Hitler said that "if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]".{{sfn|Riefenstahl|1987|p=295}} Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Broad|1958|p=113}}

Bradley and Buell conclude that "although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait."{{sfn|Bradley|Buell|2002|p=101}} On the other hand, Richter calls Eden's arguments a "falsification of history".{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=639<U+2013>640}} [[Basil Liddell Hart]] and de Guingand point out that the delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among Britain's strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita. In 1952, the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=640}} According to Robert Kirchubel, "the main causes for deferring Barbarossa's start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring."{{sfn|Kirchubel|2005|p=16}} This however does not answer whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan. Keegan writes:

:: ''In the aftermath, historians would measure its significance in terms of the delay Marita had or had not imposed on the unleashing of Barbarossa, an exercise ultimately to be judged profitless, since it was the Russian weather, not the contingencies of subsidiary campaigns, which determined Barbarossa's launch date.''{{sfn|Keegan|2005|pp=158}}

==Homages to the resistance==
In a speech made at the ''Reichstag'' in 1941, Hitler expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance,{{Cref|h}} saying of the campaign:

"For the sake of historical truth I must verify that only the Greeks, of all the adversaries who confronted us, fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death"

The ''F<U+00FC>hrer'' ordered the release and repatriation of all Greek prisoners of war, as soon as they had been disarmed, "because of their gallant bearing."<ref>Hitler, [[s:Address to the Reichstag|Speech to the Reichstag on 4 May 1941]]<br>* {{harvnb|Keegan|2005|pp=165<U+2013>66}}</ref> According to Hitler's Chief of Staff, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], the ''F<U+00FC>hrer'' "wanted to give the Greeks an honorable settlement in recognition of their brave struggle and of their blamelessness for this war: after all the Italians had started it."{{Cref|i}} Inspired by the Greek resistance during the Italian and German invasions, Churchill said, "Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks".<ref>[http://greekembassy.org/Embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&folder=361&article=19051 Celebration of Greek Armed Forces in Washington], Press Office of the Embassy of Greece<br>* {{cite encyclopedia| title = Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Helios}}<br> *{{harvnb|Churchill|1974|pp=6 891}}<br> * {{harvnb|Pilavios|Tomai|2010}} [http://www.naftemporiki.gr/video/video.asp?id=30688 The Heroes Fight like Greeks]</ref> In response to a letter from King [[George VI]] dated 3 December 1940, American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] stated that "all free peoples are deeply impressed by the courage and steadfastness of the Greek nation",{{Cref|k}} and in a letter to the Greek ambassador dated 29 October 1942, he wrote that "Greece has set the example which every one of us must follow until the despoilers of freedom everywhere have been brought to their just doom."<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16185 The American Presidency Project], Santa Barbara, University of California</ref>
