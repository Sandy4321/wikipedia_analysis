"'''Loverboy'''" is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released on July 16, 2001 by [[Virgin Records]] as the [[lead single]] from Carey's eighth [[studio album]], ''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|Glitter]]'' (2001). Written and produced by Carey, [[Larry Blackmon]], [[Cameo (band)|Thomas Jenkins]] and [[Clark Kent (producer)|Clark Kent]], "Loverboy" is built around a sample from "Candy" by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], who are also featured on the track. An uptempo song, it draws influence from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] music genres, and incorporates derivatives from 1980s melodies. Lyrically, the song finds Carey fantasizing about her loverboy, a man that will fulfill her physical and sexual desires.

The track was subject to controversy, following reports that [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Tommy Mottola]] (Carey's ex-husband) stole the idea of sampling the singer's original planned sample, [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s "Firecracker", over a month after Carey had signed for it. Since Carey's ''Glitter'' was to be released over a month after Lopez's album, she changed the song's melody to sample from "Candy" instead. Controversy ensued following its release; Carey was hospitalized for severe mental and physical exhaustion, following poorly received television appearances involving the song and album.  

"Loverboy" received generally mixed reviews from music critics; many felt Carey was overwhelmed by the song's guests (primarily on the remix version), while others felt it was unoriginal and dated. After the song's release in the United States, "Loverboy" stalled on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], leading Virgin to reduce the price to 49 cents. After the price cut, the song reached a peak of number two on the Hot 100, though failing top the chart due to weak radio airplay. Though finishing as the best-selling song of 2001 in the United States, "Loverboy" became Carey's first lead single to not reach number one. Internationally, the song failed to garner strong charting, reaching the top-ten in Australia and Canada, and the top-twenty in Italy and the United Kingdom.

The recording was accompanied by an official remix, titled "Loverboy (Remix)", featuring guest artists [[Ludacris]], [[Da Brat]], [[Shawnna]] and Twenty II. The remix was panned by critics, who felt that aside from overpowering Carey, the featured artists made the song disorganized. A music video, directed by [[David LaChapelle]], was shot for both versions of the song. The first version features Carey as a scantily-clad cheerleader, waving a flag as her loverboy finishes a race. The video for the remix version features similar footage, only including shots of the song's guests in race-cars during their verses.

==Background and release==
Following the release of "Loverboy", Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the song.<ref name=nyc>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/24/us/record-label-pays-dearly-to-dismiss-mariah-carey.html|title=Record Label Pays Dearly To Dismiss Mariah Carey|last=Pareles|first=Jon|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=2002-01-22|accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> On July&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the [[MTV]] program ''[[Total Request Live]]'' (TRL).<ref name=hospital>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1445424/mariah-carey-hospitalized.jhtml|title=Mariah Carey Hospitalized For 'Extreme Exhaustion'|work=''[[MTV News]]''|publisher=[[MTV Networks]] ([[Viacom]])|accessdate=2011-03-29|date=2005-10-13|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard}}</ref> As the show's host [[Carson Daly]] began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt.<ref name=hospital2>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1445918/mariah-carey-had-breakdown.jhtml|title=Mariah Carey Had 'Breakdown,' Her Publicist Says|work=''MTV News''|publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom)|accessdate=2011-03-29|date=2005-10-13|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard}}</ref> Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on [[Times Square]], while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy.<ref name=hospital2/> Carey then walked to Daly's platform and began a [[striptease]], in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim "Mariah Carey has lost her mind!".<ref name=hospital/> While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, she admitted that he was meant to act surprised in order to provide a more dramatic effect for the program.<ref name=hospital2/> Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention, with many critics and newspapers citing her behavior as "troubled" and "erratic".<ref name=nyc/> In the days following her appearance on TRL, Carey had began displaying "erratic behavior" during a public record singing for the single at [[Tower Records]] in New York.<ref name=hospital/> As the appearance was filmed, she began rambling on several points, leading her to discuss radio-host [[Howard Stern]], and how his form of humor on his program bothered her greatly.<ref name=hospital2/> At that point, Carey's publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and ordered the cameras to stop filming. Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website:
<blockquote>
I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.<ref name=hospital/>
</blockquote> 
After the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" when she posted the letters.<ref name=hospital2/> Two days later on July&nbsp;26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown".<ref name=emi>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1777172.stm|title=EMI Drops Mariah Carey|work=''[[BBC News]]''|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2002-01-31|accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, [[Virgin Records]] and [[20th Century Fox]] delayed the release of both ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', as well as its soundtrack of the same name.<ref name=mtv8>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1445918/mariah-carey-had-breakdown.jhtml|title=Mariah Carey Had 'Breakdown,' Her Publicist Says|work=''MTV News''|publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom)|accessdate=2011-03-29|date=2005-10-13|first=Brian|last=Hiatt}}</ref> The announcement was made on August&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2001, that both the film and accompanying soundtrack would be postponed three weeks, from August&nbsp;21 to September&nbsp;11, and from August&nbsp;31 to September&nbsp;21.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1472736/20030616/index.jhtml|title=Carey Maps Out 'Intimate Evening' Tour|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|work=''[[VH1]]''|publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom)|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref> Following Carey's absence from the public eye, as well as her abandonment of promotional appearances for the film and soundtrack, her unprecedented $100&nbsp;million five-album record deal with [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI Records]]) was bought out for $50&nbsp;million.<ref name=emi/><ref name=contract>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F115C6D597A4809&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Mariah Carries On With Record Deal, Recovery|last=Zwecker|first=Bill|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=2002-01-22|accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref> The decision was brought out due to the low sales of the project, as well as the negative publicity surrounding her breakdown.<ref name=nyc/> Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.<ref name=nyc/> Additionally, she founded her own label modeled after her initials, [[MonarC Entertainment]], and signed a new three-album record deal with [[Island Records]], valued at over $23&nbsp;million.<ref name=nyc/>

==Composition==
{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Loverboy (Feat. Cameo).ogg|title="Loverboy"|description=A sample of "Loverboy", showing Carey's incorporation of the "Candy" sample, as well as its racy and sexually suggestive lyrics.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
"Loverboy" is an uptempo song, which draws influence from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] music genres, and incorporates derivatives from 1980s melodies. The song's [[Hook (music)|hook]] is built around a [[Sample (music)|sample]] of "Candy", by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]]. Aside from borrowing from the melody, "Loverboy" features Cameo as a lead vocalist on the track. According to Chuck Taylor from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', "Loverboy" is reminiscent of several of Carey's previous [[lead single|lead singles]], as they too were predominantly built around samples of older songs.<ref name=chuck>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CRQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Singles Review: Loverboy|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=2001-06-16|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> He described some of its background flourishes as "swirling harmonies overtop", and noted the inclusion of many shouts and [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] from Carey and Cameo.<ref name=chuck/> Due to the song's heavy usage of the "Candy" sample, and the heavy blend of instrumentation and vocals, he said that to his bewilderment, the song was "devoid of a standard hook".<ref name=chuck/> ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Elios Therepio felt the idea of sampling "Candy" was genius "on paper", but once recorded, suffered from various miscalculations.<ref name=title>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/5425|title=Mariah: Loverboy|last=Therepio|first=Elios|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=2001-07-18|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> He felt it didn't match the success Carey's previous single, "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]" (which also recalled its melody from an older song), and criticized the inclusion of several over-the-top "keyboard and synth arrangements".<ref name=title/> Regarding Carey's voice, aside from describing it as "obscured", Therepio expressed his difficulty in understanding her lyrical phrases, claiming it was weakened from "no-everyone-can-understand-what-you're-saying'-itis".<ref name=title/> Gil Kaufman from [[MTV News]] noted the inclusion of "bouncing funky bass [and] rock guitars",<ref name=gil>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444081/mariah-gets-gritty.jhtml|title=Mariah Mixes 'Glitter' With Streetwise Grit|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|work=''MTV News''|publisher=Viacom|date=2001-05-29|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> while Roger Caitlin of the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' described how Carey was often reduced to "breathy background vocals" on "Loverboy".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/80608827.html?dids=80608827:80608827&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+13%2C+2001&author=ROGER+CATLIN&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=MARIAH'S+OUT+OF+HER+ELEMENT&pqatl=google|title=New on Disc|last=Caitlin|first=Roger|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2001-06-16|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Lyrically, the song finds Carey looking for her "loverboy", and a sugar-daddy that's going to "love her right". Therepio found it ironic how Carey was crooning for a sugar-daddy, when she had just left one (referring to her older ex-husband [[Tommy Mottola]]). Additionally, he felt Carey was molding her image from that of a balladeer, to a "pin-up image" of a pop star.<ref name=title/> The song's lyrics are racy, and feature the protagonist asking for her "loverboy" to fulfill her sexual desires: "Loverboy come on and love me / Give me more".<ref name=entrainment>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,130868,00.html|title=Mariah Carey <U+2013> Loverboy|last=Seymour|first=Craig|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=2001-05-29|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref>  

===Sampling controversy===
{{Listen|pos=right|filename=YMO - Firecracker.ogg|title="Firecracker"|description=A sample of "Firecracker" from the 1978 album ''[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'' by the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|band of the same name]]. This song was sampled in the original unreleased version of "Loverboy".|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Throughout 2000, Carey had already been writing and recording material for ''Glitter''.<ref name=lopezthief>{{cite web|title=Mariah 'Ripped Off' Twice on Same Record|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,49437,00.html|work=''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]''|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=2002-04-04|accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> <U+2028>During this period, she developed the concept for the album's lead single, "Loverboy". Originally, Carey had sampled the melody and hook from the 1978 [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] song "[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Firecracker]]", using an [[interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of it throughout the chorus and introduction.<ref name=lopezthief/> In early theatrical trailers for ''Glitter'', the original version of "Loverboy" was still featured. As Carey had ended her contract with [[Columbia Records]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] was signed by [[Tommy Mottola]], and had begun recording material for her album, ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' (2001).<ref name=lopezthief/> According to [[The Inc. Records|The Inc.]]'s [[Irv Gotti]], Mottola, head of Columbia and Carey's ex-husband, knew of Carey's usage of the "Firecracker" sample, and attempted to have Lopez use the same sample before her.<ref name=lopezthief/> At the time, Carey had become increasingly paranoid over outside executives being informed about ''Glitter'', especially following news of Lopez's "theft" of the song.<ref name=lopezthief/> When the music publisher's for "Firecracker" were questioned, they admitted Carey had licensed usage of the sample first, and Lopez had signed for it over one month later, under Mottola's arrangement.<ref name=lopezthief2>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6WRWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cfIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6642,5453173&dq=mariah+carey+loverboy+jennifer+lopez&hl=en|title=Mariah Carey Is Still In No mood To Talk|last=Kresse|first=Jim|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Publishing Company]]|date=2001-09-07|accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> Following the scandal, Carey was not able to use the original sample, as Lopez's album was to be released far earlier than ''Glitter''.<ref name=lopezthief2/> She subsequently changed the composition of "Loverboy", and incorporated a new sample, "[[Candy (Cameo song)|Candy]]" by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]].<ref name=lopezthief2/> According to Gotti, Mottola contacted him with instructions to create an additional song that sounded exactly like another ''Glitter'' track he produced, titled "If We" featuring rappers [[Ja Rule]] and [[Nate Dogg]].<ref name=lopezthief2/> The "Firecracker" sample was eventually used by Lopez on her song "[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]", from her album ''J.Lo''.<ref name=lopezthief2/>

==Critical reception==
"Loverboy" was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics; many were not impressed with the incorporation of the sample, and felt the song didn't lead Carey into any newer ground or innovation. Additionally, several reviewers were not impressed with Carey's concealed vocals and the song's overly-complicated production. Sarah Rodman of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' described the song's production as a "traffic-jam" and wrote "'Loverboy' is another in an increasingly long line of glitzy, candy-coated, creatively stunted song."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/80313960.html?dids=80313960:80313960&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+11%2C+2001&author=SARAH+RODMAN&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=Music%3B+All+that+litters+`Glitter%27%3B+Carey+displays+newfound+maturity+-+when+you+can+hear+her+among+the+guest+stars&pqatl=google|title=Music; All That Litters, 'Glitter': Carey Finds New Found Maturity - When You Can Hear Her Among Her Peers|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=2001-09-11|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Natalie Nichols felt "Loverboy" was "predictable" and presented nothing new for Carey's audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/09/entertainment/ca-43691|title=Record Rack|last=Nichols|first=Natalie|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2011-07-20|accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Edna Gunderson wrote the song off as "skimpy",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/80256478.html?dids=80256478:80256478&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+11%2C+2001&author=Edna+Gundersen&pub=USA+TODAY&desc=Mariah+litters+%27Glitter%27+with+hyper+vocals+and+dull+duets&pqatl=google|title=Mariah Litters 'Glitter' With Dull Duets|last=Gunderson|first=Edna|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=2011-09-11|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> while Glenn Gamboa from ''[[Newsday]]'' described its overall reception as "lukewarm".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/79768697.html?dids=79768697:79768697&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+06%2C+2001&author=Glenn+Gamboa.+STAFF+WRITER&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=Mariah+Reported+to+Be+Back+in+Hospital&pqatl=google|title=Mariah reported to be Back in Hospital|last=Gamboa|first=Glenn|work=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|date=2001-09-06|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Harry Guerin from [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] outed the song as one of Carey's "finest moments" on ''Glitter'', and disagreed with criticism regarding the "overly-populated" musical background".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2001/0927/careym.html|title=Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann > Music Review > Mariah Carey - Glitter|first=Harry|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]]|date=2001-09-12|accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] listed the song as the only "recommended" song from ''Glitter'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/glitter-r544381/review|title=Mariah Carey - Glitter|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]]|work=''[[Allmusic]]''|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=2001-09-11|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> while Gil Kaufman of [[MTV News]] called it an "fun, uptempo dance number".<ref name=gil/> Craig Seymour from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated "Loverboy" a C-, and criticized its lyrical content and production.<ref name=entrainment/> An anonymous writer from ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the song had "no decipherable tune", due to the inclusion of electronic musical instruments and background shouts and ad-libs.<ref name=canbrit>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2007/oct/03/canbritneybounceback|title=Can Britney Bounce Back?|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2007-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> ''Billboard''{{'}}s Chuck Taylor described the song as "self-sabotage", and felt Carey was gambling her longevity.

== Remix ==
Aside from the regular version of the song, an official remix of "Loverboy" was included on ''Glitter''. The song's main remix, titled "Loverboy" (Remix), uses the same sample as the album version and retains all of Carey's original vocals. It has a different introduction, the singing and spoken parts of Cameo are greatly reduced (and are not credited), and additional raps are included by [[Da Brat]], [[Ludacris]], [[Shawnna]], and Twenty II. Critics panned the song, agreeing that the inclusion on the former pair only made it more difficult to hear and understand Carey's singing. Many described their inclusion as "upstaging" the singer, while others felt they made the song increasingly tumultuous. ''NME'' writer Elios Therepio rated the remix five out of ten stars, and claimed the song to have been a much weaker lead single than Carey's "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]" (1995).<ref name=title/> Jim Farber from ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' criticized Brat's verse, writing how it "cut right through" the production.<ref name=mcdaily/> ''[[The Morning Call]]''{{'}}s Len Righi described the remix as "cloddish",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2001-09-22/news/3365320_1_mariah-carey-virgin-america-glitter|title=Mariah Carey: 'Glitter'|work=[[The Morning Call]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2001-09-22|accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> while Jim Abbott from the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' felt the song's guests "upstaged" Carey.<ref name=music>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-09-07/entertainment/0109060489_1_mariah-carey-loverboy-remix-glitter|title=Carey Can't Sing to the Beat of Bland|last=Abbott|first=Jim|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2001-09-28}}</ref>

==Music video==
===Synopsis===
[[Image:Mariah Carey - Loverboy (Clean Rap Version).jpg|thumb|right|225px|In the still, Carey is shown portraying a cheer-leader by a racing event. Music reviewers criticized Carey's image, consisting of a lighter hair color and double-handkerchief bra, which they felt cheapened the singer.]]
Two music videos, both directed by [[David LaChapelle]], were shot for the song and its accompanying remix. The videos introduced a less demure image of Carey, one that received negative backlash from critics. She appears in the video with a lighter hair color than she had sported in the past, and wearing a series of revealing ensembles. Reviewers disregarded Carey's newer image, primarily her double-handkerchief bra, and likened her to younger pop singers such as [[Britney Spears]], which they felt cheapened the singer. The video begins with Cameo driving all over a racetrack, while Carey, dressed in revealing clothing, is shown singing in various "car girl" positions at the track on a hot summer day. She flags down cars as the "flag girl" and dances as a "tire girl" in a [[kaleidoscope]]-inspired sequence, before jumping out of a cake to the roars of the crowd below.<U+2028><U+2028> Several other scenes of Carey in a pink jumpsuit while riding on top of a race-car are shown, during which Cameo continues the race. A video was also made for the remix and retains most of the shots of the original. In it, Ludacris and Shawnna can be seen rapping together as they ride in an old car, while Da Brat and Twenty II rap together in a more modern car without a hood.

===Reception===
The music video for "Loverboy" received generally mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt Carey was portrayed in an overtly sexual manner. A  writer from ''The Guardian'' criticized the video, calling it "wacky" and describing Carey's choreography as "running amok".<ref name=canbrit/> [[Slant Magazine]]'s Sal Cinquemani felt the video was "brilliantly over-the-top",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/mariah-carey-the-emancipation-of-mimi/560 |title=Mariah Carey: Glitter|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2001-09-08|accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> while an anonymous columnist from ''NME'' commented that it would cause male viewers to "play with themselves" after watching.<ref name=title/> In a countdown of the "The 5 Least Sexiest Music Videos", Priya Elan from ''NME'' included the video at number three, writing how the singer "spins with the mad-eyed grace of someone who hasn<U+2019>t been to sleep for 72 hours" (referring to Carey's mention of insomnia as a reason for her breakdown).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=148&title=what_are_the_unsexiest_music_videos_ever&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1|title=The 5 Least Sexiest Music Videos|last=Elan|first=Priya|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|date=2001-07-18|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> Japiya Burns of ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' was critical of Carey's portrayal in the video, primarily her double-handkerchief bra.
