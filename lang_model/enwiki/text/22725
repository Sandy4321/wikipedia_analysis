'''L<U+00F8>ten''' is a [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[counties of Norway|county]] of [[Hedmark]], Norway.

L<U+00F8>ten was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]).

==The name==

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after an old farm L<U+00F8>ten ([[North Germanic languages|Norse]] ''Lautvin''). The actual farm is probably the one which is now called ''Prestgarden'' ('the vicarage'), where the first church was built. The first element is ''laut'' f 'hollow depression'. (And there is a long depression between Prestgarden and the old church.) The last element is ''vin'' f 'meadow, pasture'.  

From about 1500 until 1838 the name was written "Leuten" or "Leuthen". From 1838 until 1918 the name was written "L<U+00F8>iten".

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times (1984). It shows a [[drinking horn]] from the [[Middle Ages]] (to represent the products of [[L<U+00F8>iten Br<U+00E6>nderi]]).

==Location==

L<U+00F8>ten is the most eastern of the original [[village]]s in [[Hedmark]] where it is lays between [[Hamar]] municipality to the west north west, [[Stange]] municipality to the west south west, and [[Elverum]] municipality to the east. Small portions of the municipality border on [[<U+00C5>mot]] in the far north and [[V<U+00E5>ler, Hedmark|V<U+00E5>ler]] in the south.

==History==
There has been traffic from east to west through L<U+00F8>ten, for all recorded periods and [[archeology|archeological]] evidence supports earlier trade along this route.

The old town center was formed around the L<U+00F8>ten Church, which is from the [[13th century]].

When King [[Christian IV]] prohibited the importation of [[Germany|German]] [[beer]] in the early 17th Century, [[distillation]] began in Norway. In 1624 distilled alcohol was prohibited at weddings, and by 1638 Christian forbade the clergy the right to distill in their own homes. The corn-growing districts of L<U+00F8>ten, Vang (the former municipality in Hedmark), and [[Romedal]] all became famous for their distilleries. "Gamle L<U+00F8>iten" from L<U+00F8>iten Br<U+00E6>nderi, which was established in 1855, was a highly prized <U+2018>akvavit<U+2019> produced in L<U+00F8>ten. 

When the [[railway]] was opened in [[1862]], [[L<U+00F8>ten Station]] became the new center of trade and management.

[[Edvard Munch]] was born in L<U+00F8>ten on [[12 December]] [[1863]].
