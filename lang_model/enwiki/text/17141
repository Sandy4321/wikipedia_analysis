== Background and recording ==
In an interview with [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], vocalist/guitarist Kip Berman explained that the band "wanted the songs to exist in an immediate and instinctual place. The album sounds like we're taking away what we were hiding behind before. Lyrically, the first record had a lot of remembered experiences that I was looking back on and trying to make more clever, which can sound contrived. I like the idea of lyrics that don't get beyond themselves but catch you and make an impression. I think that's more emotionally compelling." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/41451-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-talk-new-lp/# |title=The Pains of Being Pure at Heart Talk New LP |publisher=Pitchfork |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref>
