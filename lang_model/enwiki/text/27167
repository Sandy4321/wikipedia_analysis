The '''Albert Dock''' in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], was opened in 1846 by its namesake, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Based on plans submitted in 1839 by the civil engineers [[Jesse Hartley]] and Philip Hardwick, for a combined [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] and [[warehouse]] system, shipping entered the dock from either [[Canning Half Tide Dock]] to the north or [[Salthouse Dock]] to the east.

The Albert Dock was built entirely of cast iron, brick, and stone, with no structural wood; it was the first building in the UK to be built in such a manner. It was also the first fire-proof warehousing system in the world. In 1848 it was upgraded to feature the world's first [[hydraulic]] warehouse [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] system. The five Grade I buildings, covering 1.25 million [[square foot|sq ft]], make the Albert Dock complex the largest set of Grade I [[listed building]]s in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=2003-03-07 |author=Helen Carter |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The dock closed to shipping in 1972 and suffered from dereliction for a period until it was redeveloped in the early 1980s by Arrowcroft Group plc with funding from the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]]; this work, which was carried out by [[Tarmac Construction]]<ref>Berry Ritchie, ''The Story of Tarmac'' Page 99, Published by James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 1999</ref>, involved a total structural refurbishment of all five buildings and included rebuilding a top corner of a warehouse which had been knocked off by a [[World War II]] [[bomb]]. The buildings now contain a variety of bars, restaurants and museums, as well as hotels and office space. Albert Dock is used as a ship dock once a year for the Liverpool [[Tall Ships]] festival.

The [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] occupies most of the north side of the dock. Albert Dock is also home to [[Tate Liverpool]], the northern branch of the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]]. 

Between 1988 and 1996 the [[ITV]] television show ''[[This Morning (television)|This Morning]]'', hosted by [[Richard and Judy]], was broadcast from studios in the dockside buildings. Weather presenter [[Fred Talbot]] used a floating map of the British Isles to describe the outlook. The map was eventually removed in 2003.

The Albert Dock inspired the remodelling of [[Buenos Aires]]'s own dock, [[Puerto Madero]].
