'''Nikolas Tomas "Nik" Stauskas''' (born October 7, 1993) is a  [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]] player.  A [[Canada|Canadian]] native, Stauskas plays for the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines]] and is playing his freshman season for the [[2012<U+2013>13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|2012<U+2013>13 team]]. Stauskas is of Lithuanian heritage, but has represented the [[Canada men's national basketball team|Canadian men's national basketball team]].

After spending two of his secondary school years in Ontario at [[Loyola Catholic Secondary School]] and representing the Canadian National Team at the 2009 [[FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship]], Stauskas moved to [[South Kent, Connecticut]] to attend [[South Kent School]] for a year, but did not play basketball there due to a hip injury. He then transferred to [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]] in [[Southborough, Massachusetts]] where he excelled at [[high school basketball]] for two years, leading the school to back-to-back [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]] (NEPSAC) Class AA Championship Games. The team won the NEPSAC championship in Stauskas' 2012 senior season, and he was the championship game MVP.  He was also selected to the NEPSAC All-Class AA team.

As a freshman at Michigan, he moved into the starting lineup in the team's seventh game, based on his excellent shooting. By the end of December of that year he had been named Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week three times. At the end of January, he was named to the [[Wayman Tisdale Award]] <U+22C5>(USBWA National Freshman of the Year) top 12 midseason list.
