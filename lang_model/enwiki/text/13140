'''Antioxidants''' are molecules that slow or prevent the [[oxidation]] of other chemicals. Oxidation is a [[redox]] [[chemical reaction]] that transfers [[electron]]s from a substance to an [[oxidizing agent]]. Oxidation reactions can involve the production of [[free radical]]s, which can form dangerous [[chain reaction]]s.  Antioxidants can terminate these chain reactions by removing radical intermediates and can inhibit other oxidation reactions by being oxidized themselves.  As a result, antioxidants are often [[reducing agent]]s such as [[thiol]]s or [[phenols]]. 

Although oxidation reactions are critical for life, they can also be damaging; hence, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]], [[vitamin C]], and [[vitamin E]] as well as [[enzyme]]s such as [[catalase]], [[superoxide dismutase]] and various [[peroxidase]]s. Low levels of antioxidant molecules or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of these antioxidant enzymes causes [[oxidative stress]] and may damage or kill [[cell (biology)|cells]].

As oxidative stress has been implicated in the [[pathogenesis]] of many human diseases, the use of antioxidants in [[pharmacology]] is intensively studied, particularly as treatments for [[stroke]] and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s. However, it is unknown whether oxidative stress is the cause or the consequence of such diseases.  Antioxidants are also widely used as ingredients in [[dietary supplements]] in the hope of maintaining health and preventing diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[coronary heart disease]]. Although some studies have suggested antioxidant supplements have health benefits, other large [[clinical trial]]s did not detect any benefit for the formulations tested, and excess supplementation may occasionally be harmful. In addition to these uses in medicine, antioxidants have many industrial uses, such as [[preservatives]] in food and cosmetics and preventing the degradation of [[rubber]] and [[gasoline]].


==History==
The term antioxidant (also "antioxygen") originally was used to refer specifically to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th century, extensive study was devoted to the uses of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the fouling of [[internal combustion engine]]s.<ref>Matill HA (1947). Antioxidants. ''Annu Rev Biochem'' 16: 177-192.</ref>

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=German J |title=Food processing and lipid oxidation |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |volume=459 |issue= |pages=23-50 |year= |pmid=10335367}}</ref>  Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption.  However, it was the identification of [[Vitamin A|vitamins A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[vitamin E|E]] as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in biochemistry of living organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacob R |title=Three eras of vitamin C discovery |journal=Subcell Biochem |volume=25 |issue= |pages=1-16 |year= |pmid=8821966}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Knight J |title=Free radicals: their history and current status in aging and disease |journal=Ann Clin Lab Sci |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=331-46 |year= |pmid=9846200}}</ref>

The possible [[mechanisms of action]] of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized.<ref>Moreau and Dufraisse, (1922) ''Comptes Rendus des S<U+00E9>ances et M<U+00E9>moires de la Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Biologie'', '''86''', 321.</ref>  Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of [[lipid peroxidation]] led to the identification of antioxidants as [[reducing agent]]s that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging [[reactive oxygen species]] before they can damage cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolf G |title=The discovery of the antioxidant function of vitamin E: the contribution of Henry A.

==Metabolites==
===Overview===
Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in [[lipid]]s ([[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytoplasm]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from [[lipid peroxidation]].<ref name=Sies/> These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.<ref name=Vertuani/> The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as [[glutathione]] or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed throughout the body (see table below).

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a complex area, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chaudi<U+00E8>re J, Ferrari-Iliou R |title=Intracellular antioxidants: from chemical to biochemical mechanisms |journal=Food Chem Toxicol |volume=37 |issue=9-10 |pages=949<U+2013>62 |year= |pmid=10541450}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sies H |title=Strategies of antioxidant defense |journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=215 |issue=2 |pages=213<U+2013>9 |year=1993 |pmid=7688300}}</ref> The action of one antioxidant may depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.<ref name=Vertuani/> The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant therefore depends on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.<ref name=Vertuani/> 

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] metals and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Imlay J |title=Pathways of oxidative damage |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=57 |issue= |pages=395-418 |year= |pmid=14527285}}</ref> [[Selenium]] and [[zinc]] are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

==Enzyme systems==
[[Image:Antioxidant pathway.svg|thumb|left|400px|Enzymatic pathway for detoxification of [[reactive oxygen species]].]]
===Overview===
As with the chemical antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes.<ref name=Sies/><ref name=Davies/> Here, the superoxide released by processes such as oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes, with [[superoxide dismutase]]s catalysing the first step and then [[catalase]]s and various [[peroxidase]]s removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of [[transgenic animal|transgenic mice]] lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.<ref name=Magnenat>{{cite journal |author=Ho Y, Magnenat J, Gargano M, Cao J |title=The nature of antioxidant defense mechanisms: a lesson from transgenic studies |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1533365&blobtype=pdf |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=106 Suppl 5 |issue= |pages=1219-28 |year= |pmid=9788901}}</ref>

It is thought that oxidation of [[low density lipoprotein]] in the blood contributes to heart disease, and initial observational studies found that people taking Vitamin E supplements had a lower risk of developing heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rimm EB, Stampfer MJ, Ascherio A, Giovannucci E, Colditz GA, Willett WC | title=Vitamin E consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease in men | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1993 | pages=1450-6 | volume=328 | issue=20 | id=PMID 8479464}}</ref> Consequently, at least seven large clinical trials were conducted to test the effects of antioxidant supplement with Vitamin E, in doses ranging from 50 to 600 mg per day. However, none of these trials found a statistically significant effect of Vitamin E on overall number of deaths or on deaths due to heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Vivekananthan DP, Penn MS, Sapp SK, Hsu A, Topol EJ | title=Use of antioxidant vitamins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of randomised trials | journal=Lancet | year=2003 | pages=2017-23 | volume=361 | issue=9374 | id=PMID 12814711}}</ref>

While several trials have investigated supplements with high doses of antioxidants, the "''Suppl<U+00E9>mentation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants''" (SU.VI.MAX) study tested the effect of supplementation with doses comparable to those in a healthy diet.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hercberg S, Galan P, Preziosi P, Bertrais S, Mennen L, Malvy D, Roussel AM, Favier A, Briancon S | title=The SU.VI.MAX Study: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the health effects of antioxidant vitamins and minerals | journal=Arch Intern Med | year=2004 | pages=2335-42 | volume=164 | issue=21 | id=PMID 15557412}}</ref>  Over 12,500 French men and women took either low-dose antioxidants (120 mg of ascorbic acid, 30 mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of beta carotene, 100 <math>\mu</math>g of selenium, and 20 mg of zinc) or [[placebo]] pills for an average of 7.5 years.  The investigators found there was no statistically significant effect of the antioxidants on overall survival, cancer, or heart disease. However, a subgroup analysis showed a 31% reduction in the risk of cancer in men, but not women.

===Physical exercise===
During exercise, oxygen consumption can increase by a factor of more than 10.<ref>{{{cite journal |author=Dekkers J, van Doornen L, Kemper H |title=The role of antioxidant vitamins and enzymes in the prevention of exercise-induced muscle damage |journal=Sports Med |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=213-38 |year=1996 |pmid=8776010}}</ref> This leads to a large increase in the production of oxidants and results in damage that contributes to muscular fatigue during and after exercise. The [[inflammatory response]] that occurs after strenuous exercise is also associated with oxidative stress, especially in the 24 hours after an exercise session. The immune system response to damage done by exercise peaks 2 to 7 days after exercise, the period during which adaptation resulting in greater fitness is greatest. During this process, free radicals are produced by [[neutrophil]]s to remove damaged tissue. As a result, excessive antioxidant levels have the potential to inhibit recovery and adaptation mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tiidus P |title=Radical species in inflammation and overtraining |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0008-4212&volume=76&issue=5&startPage=533 |journal=Can J Physiol Pharmacol |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=533-8 |year=1998 |pmid=9839079}}</ref>

The evidence for benefits from antioxidant supplementation in vigorous exercise is mixed. There is strong evidence that one of the adaptations resulting from exercise is a strengthening of the body's antioxidant defenses, particularly the glutathione system, to deal with the increased oxidative stress.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Fiebig R, Chandwaney R, Ji L |title=Aging and exercise training in skeletal muscle: responses of glutathione and antioxidant enzyme systems |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/267/2/R439 |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=267 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=R439-45 |year=1994 |pmid=8067452}}</ref> It is possible that this effect may be to some extent protective against diseases which are associated with oxidative stress, which would provide a partial explanation for the lower incidence of major diseases and better health of those who undertake regular exercise.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Heinecke J |title=Oxidative stress and antioxidants in exercise |journal=Curr Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=829-38 |year=2001 |pmid=11375753}}</ref>

However, no benefits to athletes are seen with vitamin A or E supplementation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Takanami Y, Iwane H, Kawai Y, Shimomitsu T |title=Vitamin E supplementation and endurance exercise: are there benefits? |journal=Sports Med |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=73-83 |year=2000 |pmid=10701711}}</ref> For example, despite its  key role in preventing lipid membrane peroxidation, 6 weeks of vitamin E supplementation had no effect on muscle damage in ultramarathon runners.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mastaloudis A, Traber M, Carstensen K, Widrick J |title=Antioxidants did not prevent muscle damage in response to an ultramarathon run |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72-80 |year=2006 |pmid=16394956}}</ref> Although there appears to be no increased requirement for vitamin C in athletes, there is some evidence that supplementation with vitamin C increased the amount of intense exercise that can be done, vitamin C supplementation before strenuous exercise may reduce the amount of muscle damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peake J |title=Vitamin C: effects of exercise and requirements with training |journal=Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=125-51 |year=2003 |pmid=12945825}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jakeman P, Maxwell S |title=Effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation on muscle function after eccentric exercise |journal=Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=426-30 |year=1993 |pmid=8299614}}</ref> However, other studies found no such effects, and some research suggests that supplementation with amounts as high as 1000 mg inhibits recovery,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Close G, Ashton T, Cable T, Doran D, Holloway C, McArdle F, MacLaren D |title=Ascorbic acid supplementation does not attenuate post-exercise muscle soreness following muscle-damaging exercise but may delay the recovery process |journal=Br J Nutr |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=976-81 |year=2006 |pmid=16611389}}</ref>

While antioxidants supplementation is widely hypothesized to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may, paradoxically, interfere with cancer treatments.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schumacker P | title = Reactive oxygen species in cancer cells: Live by the sword, die by the sword. | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 175-6 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16959608}}</ref> One explanation for this effect is that the growth-promoting environment of cancer cells leads to high levels of redox stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements could decrease the effectiveness of [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seifried H, McDonald S, Anderson D, Greenwald P, Milner J |title=The antioxidant conundrum in cancer |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/63/15/4295 |journal=Cancer Res |volume=63 |issue=15 |pages=4295-8 |year=2003 |pmid=12907593}}</ref>

Measurement of antioxidants is not a straightforward process, as this is a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to different reactive oxygen species. In [[food science]], the [[Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity|oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) has become the current industry standard for assessing antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cao G, Alessio H, Cutler R |title=Oxygen-radical absorbance capacity assay for antioxidants |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=303-11 |year=1993 |pmid=8458588}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ou B, Hampsch-Woodill M, Prior R |title=Development and validation of an improved oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=4619-26 |year=2001 |pmid=11599998}}</ref> Other measurement tests include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity|trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prior R, Wu X, Schaich K |title=Standardized methods for the determination of antioxidant capacity and phenolics in foods and dietary supplements |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=4290-302 |year=2005 |pmid=15884874}}</ref> In medicine, a range of different assays are used to assess the antioxidant capability of [[blood plasma]] and of these, the ORAC assay may be the most reliable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cao G, Prior R |title=Comparison of different analytical methods for assessing total antioxidant capacity of human serum |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/44/6/1309 |journal=Clin Chem |volume=44 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=1309-15 |year=1998 |pmid=9625058}}</ref> 

Antioxidants are found in varying amounts in foods such as vegetables, fruits, grain cereals, legumes and nuts. Some antioxidants such as [[lycopene]] are [[ascorbic acid]] can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xianquan S, Shi J, Kakuda Y, Yueming J |title=Stability of lycopene during food processing and storage |journal=J Med Food |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=413-22 |year=2005 |pmid=16379550}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodriguez-Amaya D |title=Food carotenoids: analysis, composition and alterations during storage and processing of foods |journal=Forum Nutr |volume=56 |issue= |pages=35-7 |year= |pmid=15806788}}</ref> Other antioxidant compounds are more stable, such as the polyphenolic antioxidants in foods such as whole-wheat cereals and tea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baublis A, Lu C, Clydesdale F, Decker E |title=Potential of wheat-based breakfast cereals as a source of dietary antioxidants |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/content/full/19/suppl_3/308S |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=19 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=308S-311S |year=2000 |pmid=10875602}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rietveld A, Wiseman S |title=Antioxidant effects of tea: evidence from human clinical trials |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/133/10/3285S |journal=J Nutr |volume=133 |issue=10 |pages=3285S-3292S |year=2003 |pmid=14519827}}</ref> In general, processed foods contain less antioxidants than fresh and uncooked foods, since the preparation processes may expose the food to oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henry C, Heppell N |title=Nutritional losses and gains during processing: future problems and issues |url=http://docstore.ingenta.com/cgi-bin/ds_deliver/1/u/d/ISIS/35722612.1/cabi/pns/2002/00000061/00000001/art00020/4A4C97E12AA663421172630098BC02E4E69AEC9E94.pdf?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/error/delivery&format=pdf |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=145-8 |year=2002 |pmid=12002789}}</ref>

Some antioxidants are made in the body and are not absorbed from the [[intestine]]. One example is glutathione, which is made from [[amino acid]]s. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free [[cysteine]], [[glycine]] and [[glutamic acid]] before being absorbed, even large oral doses have little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witschi A, Reddy S, Stofer B, Lauterburg B |title=The systemic availability of oral glutathione |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=667-9 |year=1992 |pmid=1362956}}</ref> Ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is also poorly absorbed from the gut and is made in humans through the [[mevalonate pathway]].<ref name=Turunen/>

==Technological uses==
===Food preservatives===
Antioxidants are used as [[food additive]]s to help [[preservative|guard against food deterioration]]. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers.  However, as oxygen is also important for plant [[respiration]], storing plant materials in anerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kader A, Zagory D, Kerbel E |title=Modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1-30 |year=1989 |pmid=2647417}}</ref> Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are especially important class of preservatives as, unlike [[bacteria]]l or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zallen E, Hitchcock M, Goertz G |title=Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=552-7 |year=1975 |pmid=1184900}}</ref> These preservatives include [[ascorbic acid]] (AA, E300), [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tocopherol]]s (E306), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iverson F |title=Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole |journal=Cancer Lett |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=49-54 |year=1995 |pmid=7600543}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide | url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref>

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are [[unsaturated fat]]s, oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robards K, Kerr A, Patsalides E |title=Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review |journal=Analyst |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=213-24 |year=1988 |pmid=3288002}}</ref> Since oxidized lipids are often discolored (such as the browning of a cut apple) and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur|sulfurous]] flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying.  Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminum foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A |title=Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=52 |issue=13 |pages=4072-9 |year=2004 |pmid=15212450}}</ref>

===Industrial uses===
Some antioxidants are added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.<ref>CE Boozer, GS Hammond, CE Hamilton (1955) "Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons. The Stoichiometry and Fate of Inhibitors in Benzene and Chlorobenzene". ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', 3233-3235</ref> They are also used to prevent the oxidative degradation of [[rubber]], [[plastic]]s and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives | url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat-based [[cosmetics]] such as [[lipstick]] and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent [[rancidification|rancidity]].
