A '''beam tetrode''' is a type of [[vacuum tube]] specially designed to produce greater output power than a similar [[pentode]]. It has found extensive application in power [[amplifier|amplification]].

== History ==
The problem of [[secondary emission]] in the [[tetrode]] [[vacuum tube|tube]] (valve) was solved by [[Philips]]/[[Mullard]] with the introduction of a [[suppressor grid]] to produce the [[pentode]] construction.  Since Philips held a patent on this design, other manufacturers were keen to produce pentode type tubes without infringing the patent. In the UK, two [[EMI]] engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, produced and patented an alternate design.  Their design had the following features (compared to the normal pentode).

* The [[control grid|control]] and [[screen grid]]s were wound so that the pitches were the same and the wires were in alignment (the pentode used different pitches).

* A pair of beam-forming plates was added at the two ends of the oval grid structure to focus the electron stream into a pair of beams 180 degrees apart (the pentode added a third grid). These plates are normally connected to the cathode.

The design is today known as the '''beam tetrode''' but historically was also known as a '''kinkless tetrode''', since it is a four-electrode device without the [[negative resistance]] kink in the [[anode]] current vs [[anode]] voltage characteristic curves of a true tetrode. Some authorities, notably outside the United Kingdom, argue that the beam plates constitutes a fifth electrode. 

The EMI design had the following advantages compared to the pentode:

* The [[screen grid]] current was about 5-10% of the [[anode]] (anode) current compared with about 20% for the pentode, thus the beam tetrode was more efficient.

* The design introduced significantly less third-[[harmonic distortion]] into the signal than did the pentode.

* The design produced a greater output power compared with a similar pentode.

The beam tetrode was not without its disadvantages:

* It had higher [[intermodulation distortion]] than the pentode, though this could be eliminated with the application of [[negative feedback]], or (more usually) by adopting an [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] design in a [[electronic amplifier|push-pull]] circuit.  This connection links the screen grids to taps on the output [[transformer]].

* The beam tetrode required a higher [[control grid]] voltage than the pentode and thus required a higher-gain driver stage preceding it.

* The beam tetrode had a tendency to oscillate if the circuit was not designed properly.

The MOV (Marconi Osram Valve) company, under the joint ownership of [[EMI]] and [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], considered the design too difficult to manufacture (due to the need for good alignment of the grid wires). As MOV had a design-share agreement with [[RCA]] of America, the design was passed to that company. RCA had the resources to produce a workable design - the result was the famous [[6L6]]. Not long after, the beam tetrode appeared in a variety of offerings, but for power audio purposes, the best examples were produced by the MOV company - the [[KT66]] in 1937 and the [[KT88]] in 1956. This latter tube was never bettered, and both are still manufactured today for discerning [[audiophile]]s (but no longer by MOV which ceased production in 1988).

Interestingly, many tubes that are described as pentodes actually turn out to be beam tetrodes. The ubiquitous Mullard [[EL34]] (6CA7), although manufactured by Mullard as a pentode, was also produced by many manufacturers around the world as a beam tetrode instead. Even Philips/Mullard themselves were not immune; several examples of Mullard-marked [[ECL82]]s (a signal triode plus low-power pentode intended for single-ended operation) have turned out to contain beam tetrodes.

The most common beam tetrodes of all time were probably the [[25L6]], 35L6, and 50L6, and their miniature versions the 50B5 and 50C5, which were to be found in millions of [[All American Five]] AM radio receivers.

The beam tetrode produces the lowest distortion of this class of tube by producing significantly less third-harmonic distortion, and lower [[intermodulation distortion]] when used in ultralinear mode.  Second-harmonic distortion is automatically cancelled in a push-pull design. The beam tetrode also lends itself to being operated as a [[triode]] (by connecting its screen grid to its [[anode]]), and in this mode functions more efficiently than a pentode operated in the same manner.
