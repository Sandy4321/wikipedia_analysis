It was in 1921 that Gusman and his family moved to Moscow, where he began writing for ''Pravda.''<ref name=smirnov /> He was recognized as an important film critic, and from 1923 onwards headed Pravda's theatre section.<ref name=fchoate /> Gusman rejected arguments among some Soviet filmmakers, associated with the [[Proletkult]] movement, that contributing to a new Soviet cinema required abandoning the history of film altogether. Gusman wrote that the new cinema "must be built brick by brick, making use of everything that is healthy about the New World, and that which is good about the old."<ref name=tsivian>{{cite book|last=Tsivian|first=Yuri|title=Lines of Resistance: Dziga Vertov and the Twenties|year=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press}}</ref> Gusman responded favorably to candid films pioneered by Dziga Vertov called [[Kino-Pravda]]. He described them as "lively<U+2026> striking<U+2026> and interesting," but criticized the lack of connection between scenes and the absence of unifying themes.<ref name=tsivian />

===Musical career===
In 1929 Gusman, as deputy director, led the State [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Academic Theater's]] effort to stage [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev's]] ''[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|Pas d'Acier]]'' with new cast and choreography.<ref name=morrison>{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Simon|title=The People's Artist: Prokofiev's Soviet Years|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>  Gusman remained with the Bolshoi Theatre through 1930, and in 1933 became head of the arts division of the Soviet Central Radio Administration.<ref name=fchoate /> Gusman played a central role in working with Prokofiev in the musical and cinematic production of [[Lieutenant Kij<U+00E9>]].<ref name=bartig>{{cite book|last=Bartig|first=Kevin|title=Composing for the Red Screen: Prokofiev and Soviet Film|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Following the success of the film, in 1934 Gusman organized a broadcast concert of the music with [[Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra|Moscow Radio Orchestra]].<ref name=bartig /><ref name=morrison />

In 1934, Gusman negotiated a contract between Prokofiev and the All-Union Radio Committee, helping the composer return to Russia. Gusman also offered him a tremendous sum of 25,000 rubles for one of a series of commissioned works: the ''[[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)|Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of October]]'', to commemorate the [[Russian Revolution|October Revolution of 1917]].<ref name=smnk>{{cite journal|title=The Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of October, or how the spectre of Communism haunted Prokofiev|journal=The Journal of Musicology|year=2006|volume=23|issue=2|author=Simon Morrison|authorlink=Nelly Kravetz|publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/jm.2006.23.2.227}}</ref> Gusman also commissioned Prokofiev to write a ''Collective Farm Suite'', a ''Dance Suite'', and a suite from the music for ''Egyptian Nights''.<ref name=smnk /> Though Gusman remained an important supporter of Prokofiev's music,<ref name=bartig /> neither he nor the composer ever witnessed a performance of the ''Cantata'': the work was banned, and both men died before its performance in 1966.<ref name=smnk />
