'''Harold D. Prewitt, Jr (Hal)''' (born October 1, 1954 in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], [[United States|U.S.]]) is a [[Race car driver]], [[American businessman]], inventor of [[personal computer]] products and early pioneer in the [[History of personal computers#The beginnings of the personal computer industry|personal computer revolution]].  He resides in [[South Beach]] ([[Miami Beach, Florida]]) and [[Park City, Utah]].<ref name="Hal Prewitt">{{cite web|url=http://www.prewitt.net/biography/biography.php|title=Hal Prewitt|publisher=Driver's Website|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> 

Prewitt competes<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/> in [[professional]] and occasionally in [[amateur]] race events and has driven in more than 150 [[Endurance racing (motorsport)]] or sprint races worldwide. He is a regular competitor in the [[Grand-Am]] [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and at major international [[FIA]] [[road races]]. These include the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[24 Hours N<U+00FC>rburgring]], [[Dubai 24 Hour]], 24 Hours of Barcelona, [[Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour]] and major races held at [[road course]] [[race tracks]] all over the world. 

In the 1970's and 1980's he was one of the early creators<ref name="Boyhood dream">{{cite web|url=http://coreinternational.info/SFBJ_June_88.pdf|title=Boyhood dream becomes a reality for entrepreneur|publisher=[[South Florida Business Journal]]|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> of [[personal computer]] products, developing popular software and hardware while helping build a new industry. This was the period during which the [[microcomputer]] was developed, the [[Altair 8800]] was launched and [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer]] were founded. He provided consulting services to [[IBM]] in the years just prior to the introduction of their first [[IBM PC|personal computer]] and is credited<ref name="Whiz kid">{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-6378228/hal-prewitt-computer-whiz.html|title=Hal Prewitt; a computer whiz kid challenges the big boys|publisher=[[Florida Trend]]|accessdate=January 31, 2010 | date=August 1, 1987}}</ref> with inventing [[hard disk drives]] and a [[local area network]] for their [[IBM 5100|first portable]] and [[IBM 5120|desktop series computers]].  

Skilled<ref name="Whiz kid"/> in [[computer programming]] and [[engineering]], Prewitt founded and managed a number of technology firms.  The largest and best known was [[Core International, Inc]], a leading technology firm started in 1979 and well known as an industry leading developer of [[disk array]], [[computer data storage]] and [[backup]] products. Prewitt was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until 1993 when the company was sold<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19930624&id=1NQPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hI4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2801,4016736|title=Japanese Buy Core International|publisher=The News|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> to [[Aiwa|Sony]].

Prewitt is the Managing Member of Prewitt Enterprises, LLC, a Florida-based Agricultural and investment business. The agricultural part of the business grows oranges and at its peak produced more than 1.5 million half gallon cartons of [[orange juice]] with much of it used in [[Tropicana_Products#Evolution_of_Tropicana_Pure_Premium|Tropicana's Pure Premium]].<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>   


==Early Life==
Prewitt grew up in the [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] area and lived there from 1963 to 1976.  There he had his first exposure to [[auto racing]]; volunteering at [[Daytona International Speedway]] and never realizing that one day he would return to the track as a driver.  He built his first computer in 1967 at 13. It performed simple math, which he disliked so much in school, and even operated his phonograph. This was eight years before [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] built their first<ref name=AppleConf>{{cite book| last = Linzmayer| first = Ronald W.| title = Apple Confidential: The Real Story of Apple Computer, Inc.| publisher = No Starch Press| year = 1999| url = http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm}}</ref> [[Apple Computer#1976<U+2013>1980: The early years|computer]] or [[Bill Gates]] started [[Microsoft]] (1975)<ref name="founding">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm | title=Bill Gates: A Timeline | accessdate=2006-07-03 | work=BBC News | date=2006-06-15}}</ref>. Prewitt's seventh grade teacher nicknamed him "Hal" after the humanlike spaceship computer in the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)]] because of his keen interest in computers.  [[File:01873 p w11aghvq93m1891 r01.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Cadet Captain Prewitt]] He joined the [[Civil Air Patrol]] as a [[Civil Air Patrol#Cadet Programs|cadet]] and earned his way to the second highest rank ([[Cadet grades and insignia of the Civil Air Patrol#Cadet Lieutenant Colonel|Cadet Lt. Colonel]]), learning leadership, search and rescue, about the military and the value of providing community service.  Prewitt learned how to fly a plane, soloed at 16 and shortly thereafter earned his [[Private Pilots License]] at the youngest age allowed.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/><ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

As a [[teenager]], Prewitt learned [[sailing]], [[fishing]], [[boating]] and [[Scuba diving]].  With his aptitude for technical endeavors, he developed skills in [[mechanics]], [[engineering]], [[electronics]], [[navigation]] and [[construction]]. At 15, before he had a [[Driver%27s_license_in_the_United_States|driver's license]], he rebuilt the engine of a neighbor's [[Fiat]] after it was pronounced unsalvageable. For a year he drove the car along the back roads around Daytona. Later he sold it for a profit to a woman who used it as a racecar. After school and in summers, he worked at jobs building homes and in a [[restaurant]] washing dishes and cooking. In high school, he had more spending money than the average student because of a business he operated renting out the family houseboat.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/><ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

After graduating High School, Prewitt continued building boats, managing his business and began to focus on computer programming.  Between 1972-1975 he  learned [[FORTRAN]], [[BASIC]], [[COBOL]], [[ALGOL]], [[IBM RPG|RPG]] and [[assembly language]] using an [[IBM 1130]]. In the early 1970's, Prewitt dreamed of designing, building and selling a generation of small business computers with a price tag much less than the going rate of $50,000.  Convinced that he was on to something big, the young Prewitt sought [[venture capital]] to get his plans off the ground. "I was told that the [[personal computer]] would never come into existence.  They turned me down cold.  It was an uphill battle from there." says Prewitt.<ref name="Boyhood dream"/> In 1975, he built and added to his computer collection an [[Altair 8800]] (widely recognized as the spark that led to the [[microcomputer revolution]]). That same year, at the age of 21, Prewitt obtained his first [[Business software|business applications]] customer when he sold, designed and wrote [[computer programs]] for the [[IBM 5100]] and [[System/32]] as part of the business he had started at age 16.  Never far from his racing interest, he joined the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and participated in [[autocross]] events.<ref name="Whiz kid"/>

===Family===
Prewitt was born in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], the eldest son of Harold Dean Prewitt, Sr (20 Nov 1931  <U+2013>  01 Mar 1972)<ref name="Father's Grave">{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=prewitt&GSfn=harold&GSbyrel=in&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=69773609&df=all& | title=Grave of Harld D.

Prewitt's father joined the [[US Air Force]] underage at 13 years old using his older brother's ID and then switched to the [[US Navy]] at 17 serving in  [[World War II]] and Korea.  His father left the military after 18 years (1945-1962), did odd jobs and then worked as a [[mail carrier|mailman]] for the [[US Postal Service]] until his death. Prewitt's father was honored as a [[Kentucky Colonel]] by the [[Governor of Kentucky]].  His Mother was a [[Registered nurse]] and lives in the [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] area.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/><ref name="Whiz kid"/>

Prewitt married his first wife Florine Andrews in August 1980 and divorced after 23 years in early 2004. They have two sons, Calvin and Tim. He married Corinne Brody (Loria) in October 2007.  She has a son, Alex.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>

===Education===
Prewitt  attended  [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Orlando#Secondary_schools|All Souls Catholic School]] (1960-1963) in [[Sanford, Florida]] until 3rd grade while his father served in the military.  He attended Port Orange Elementary School (1963-1965) from 3rd to 5th grade when his family moved to [[Allandale, Florida]].<ref name="Daytona Schools">{{Cite news| url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NJ&p_theme=nj&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=godwin&s_dispstring=allfields(prewitt)%20AND%20source(godwin)%20AND%20date(nj06)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=nj06&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22prewitt%22)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no  |publisher=Daytona Beach News Journal | date=29 Jan 2006 | accessdate=07 Feb 2012 | title= Microchip to motor for Prewitt  | first1= Godwin  | last1= Kelly}}</ref> In 1966, his family moved to [[Ormond Beach, Florida]] where he attended [[Volusia County Schools|Osceola Elementary]] (1965-1966), Seabreeze Jr. High (1966-1969) and then graduated from [[Seabreeze High School]] (1969-1972) in 1972.<ref name="Daytona Schools"/> At 16, he attended Burnside-Ott Aviation in [[Miami, Florida]] where he [[First solo flight|soloed]].  After high school, Prewitt attended [[Daytona Beach Community College]] (1972-1976) studying business and computer science but left without earning a degree.  He  transferred to [[Florida Atlantic University]] (1976-1978), [[Boca Raton, Florida]] where he continued his studies in  business and computer science. Prewitt [[dropping out|dropped out]] of college when his business consumed all his available time.<ref name="Whiz kid"/>  

School records show he did well in Effort, but had poor academic performance with major challenges reading, spelling and finishing assigned work in those classes on time.  He often failed English, Humanities and courses that require intense reading comprehension while scoring A's in Art, Computer Science, Physics and Physical Education.  In the 7th grade standardized [[California Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) Program|California AchievementTest]] that mesured reading, arithmetic and language he averaged 3 grades below his classmates.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>  Prewitt reported "guidance counselors and a few teachers advised to forget about college and to take up a simple career saying I would likely not succeed at something more advanced. This was understandable considering a few days ago I found my 1971 SAT scores that showed 390 verbal and 490 math (880 total)."<ref name="Dyslexia">{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/people/Hal-Prewitt/172335191|title=Hal Prewitt|publisher= http://www.classmates.com| date=09 Feb 2012|accessdate=09 Feb 2012}}</ref>

===Dyslexia===
Prewitt is [[dyslexic]] and has difficulty reading and spelling.  He reported, "Only recently did I figure out the cause.  Even though a Jr High teacher suspected I was dyslexic, they decided likely not because I did not reverse letters enough. Unfortunately, [[dyslexia]] was not well recognized, properly diagnosed or treated in those days.  Reading, spelling and writing continue to be very difficult.   Maybe some of my successes were a result of not knowing or thinking anything was wrong and the determination to overcome whatever challenges we face in life."<ref name="Dyslexia"/><ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>


==Careers==
Prewitt's working career began at the young age of 13.  He started in construction helping build homes for an [[Ormond Beach, Florida]] builder. He also worked busing tables and washing dishes before a promotion to cook at local popular restaurants "The Tropics" and "Julian's".  At 16, Prewitt started his first business. While attending community college, he built boats, worked as a painter, an [[accountant]] and for the yard crew at Howard Boat Works, a marina where his family had made an investment. Prewitt's final jobs where he was employed by someone else were as a lab assistant helping students in his college and as a [[computer programmer]] for a company providing [[Business software|business applications]] on [[mainframes]] and [[mini computers]].  After 22 years old, his employment was limited to working for himself or businesses he owned.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/><ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

Prewitt started his first business when he was 16 and a junior in High School.  "Ranger Systems", had four divisions: Ranger Manufacturing, Business World, Rent a Houseboat and Ranger Automotive Engineering.<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/> 

He used the manufacturing part of the business to build electronics, computers and fiberglass boats from 13' fishing runabouts to a 40' houseboat.   Business World did marketing, printing and advertising. Prewitt wrote brochures, shot pictures, placed ads and ran a printing press.  The biggest and most profitable division was Rent a Houseboat.  Prewitt took the family boat and turned it into a rental business. He sometimes used a small boat to travel to school and quickly reach the houseboat. Prewitt did everything from writing contracts to maintenance. "I started the houseboat business to pay for a car," Prewitt says. The business had its drawbacks; Prewitt frequently missed classes to unstop a toilet or revive the boat engine.  The automotive division focused on repairs.<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

One of his teachers, Dr. Robert Cameron Jr., program manager of computer science at [[Daytona Beach Community College]], remembers Prewitt as a go-getter. "He was always working on something and too busy learning on his own to bother with the course work", he says.<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

Prewitt operated Ranger Systems from 1970 to 1975 until his focus switched to [[computer programming]] and the [[History of personal computers#The beginnings of the personal computer industry|personal computer revolution]].<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

In 1975, Prewitt created a new company to continue his efforts building, selling, installing and programming computers. This was the period when he started developing storage devices which ultimately became his most successful products.  Prewitt worked on the many [[personal computers]] of the day in addition to machines from [[IBM]], [[Data General]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and others. [[File:N29793.jpg|thumb|right|Prewitt in 1979 with his 1941 [[Taylorcraft]]]] He had customers that were located from mid to south [[Florida]]  in the manufacturing, hotel, service, legal, medical, construction and agricultural industries.

After hiring employees to help with the high demands of his business while trying to attend college, Prewitt decided to spread the his workload by taking on a partner and creating Southeast Computer Consultants. The organization was started in late 1977, of proven computer professionals who had come together rather than work as independent consultants. Prewitt moved over some of his clients from his International Computer and also obtained [[IBM]] as a client in the years just prior to the introduction of their first [[IBM PC|personal computer]]. The business grew, but the hours were long, costs were high and profits were lower than expected.  

In 1979, Prewitt decided to divide up the clients and dissolve the firm due to the difficulty of managing this type of business and his desire to focus on the high growth evolving [[personal computer]] industry. He planned to call the new firm, "Core International" and offered his partner half of the new business.  However his partner declined and continued in the same line of work.<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

In late 1979, Prewitt as sole owner created [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] from the assets of International Computer and Southeast Computer Consultants.  Initially [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] was created as a for-profit association of owners and operators of small [[IBM]] computers.  It sold mail-order computer supplies and developed software for users of the [[IBM 5100]], [[IBM 5110|5110]] and [[IBM 5120]] systems, the forerunners of today's [[personal computers]].  He continued research and development on [[computer storage]] devices and decided to build his first product for the [[IBM]] 5100 series because the machines did not have [[hard disk drives]].<ref name="Whiz kid"/>[[File:CORE1981.jpg|thumb|right|CORE's 1979-1985 Delray Beach, FL Two small homes converted to offices where 19 million dollars of products were designed and sold before moving to the new 60,000 sqft Boca Raton location. Prewitt lived here until growth pushed him out.]] Prewitt contracted with [[Control Data Corporation]] to manufacture the key component.  Even though it was a niche product, the product became popular almost overnight when [[IBM]] discontinued its 5100 series and their customers turned to [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] for parts and supplies. Within two years, Prewitt had sold $2.5 million worth of disk drives. [[Core International, Inc|CORE's]] second hardware and major software product also catered to the [[IBM]] orphans. It was a device and software that allowed [[IBM]] 5110/20 users to transfer data and programs from their old bulky computers into the new sleek [[personal computers]], which in 1981 were revolutionizing the computer industry. [[Core International, Inc|CORE's]] software was called [[Core International, Inc#PC51|PC51]] and allowed any [[DOS]] [[personal computer]] to use any [[BASIC]] program  written for the [[IBM]] 5110/20 series computer and to run unmodified. Impressed, [[IBM]] approached Core to become an [[IBM]] dealer.  Customers could buy an integrated [[IBM PC]] which completely replaced [[IBM]]'s 5100 computers or optionally attach them to [[Core International, Inc|CORE's]] [[local area network]] connecting all machines.  These were revolutionary products and [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] was the only source.<ref name="Whiz kid"/><ref name="Boyhood dream"/>

The company expanded internationally to include offices in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. In 1986, [[Inc Magazine]] selected [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] as 21st in their annual list (Inc. 500) of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the [[U.S.]].  By 1990, [[Core International, Inc|CORE]] was well known as an industry leading developer of [[disk array]], [[computer data storage]] and [[backup]] products. Prewitt created numerous [[hard drive|disk drives]], [[Disk controller|controllers]] and authored many [[Business_software|business software applications]] and utilities.<ref name="Whiz kid"/>  He became widely recognized as an expert, quoted in the press and gave speeches and lectures both domestically and abroad.  A major effort of his was to educate the marketplace on the way a [[hard drive]] functioned, their importance in the [[computer system]] and how to obtain the best performance and reliability.

===Racing - Notable wins & finishes===
[[Image:2010DubaiPodiumphoto.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Win at 24 hours of Dubai. Drivers Hal Prewitt, [[Cor Euser]], Toto Lassally and Jim Briody]]
Prewitt first became active in racing while growing up in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] in the 1970s and driving in [[SCCA]] events.  He became serious in 2004 after attending [[Skip Barber Racing School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NJ&p_theme=nj&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=godwin&s_dispstring=allfields(prewitt)%20AND%20source(godwin)%20AND%20date(nj06)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=nj06&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22prewitt%22)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|title=Microchip to motor for Prewitt|publisher=Daytona Beach News-Journal|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>
Today, Prewitt is a professional level driver in selected International and North American Endurance road race events supporting his sponsors and EveryLapCounts.com, a global fund raising effort for children's charitable causes. He enjoys Endurance rather than Sprint racing. Prewitt's primary talent is ability to bring home a win by clicking off laps and staying out of the pits, not damaging or killing the equipment.   He owned and managed a race shop thereby bringing an additional perspective different from other drivers; Prewitt understands the engineering, physics and knows how to turn a wrench.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>

===Fishing===
[[File:1988 BBC WIN-CREW.jpg|thumb|left|1988 BBC win Hal Prewitt (center) with crew (left to right) Paul Ivey, Todd Simlic and Rick O'Neill]]
Prewitt has been widely regarded as one of the world's top [[Sport Fishermen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-07-24/news/8802130126_1_white-marlin-fishing-fort-lauderdale|title=Prewitt Possesses The Winning Edge|publisher=Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref> Over the years, he [[Catch_and_release|caught and released]] more than one thousand [[Billfish]] with many of them [[Animal_identification|tagged]] for science research.<U+00A0>Most of these were captured [[Big-game_fishing#Fighting_the_fish|"stand up"]], not using a [[Big-game_fishing#Fighting_the_fish|fishing chair]] and on light tackle. Prewitt was selected as [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[Angling|Angler]] of the Year 1992, recognized and awarded by [[International Game Fish Association]] ([[IGFA]]) as the [[Angling|Angler]] who [[Animal_identification|Tagged & Released]] the most [[Sailfish]] in 1990, 1991 and 1992 and [[White Marlin]] in 1992. In 1989, Power and Motoryacht Magazine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/|title=America's Top Ten Anglers 1988|publisher=Power and Motoryacht|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref> named him one of [[United States|America's]] Top Ten [[angling|Anglers]] of 1988. 
[[File:MegabyteSST.jpg|thumb|right|Megabyte in the USVI Open. Angler Hal Prewitt catching a [[Atlantic blue marlin|Blue Marlin]] on [[Big-game_fishing#Fighting_the_fish|"stand up" tackle]] with Actor [[Cliff Robertson]], Writer [[Jay McInerney]], Screen Writer & Model [[Marla Hanson]] watching]]
In 1988, he won perhaps the most<U+00A0>prestigious and competitive [[Big-game fishing]] [[Fishing_tournament|tournament]] series in the world, [[Marlin_fishing#Bahamas|The Bahamas Billfish Championship]] (BBC). This annual award recognizes the overall champion of six tournaments located in the [[Bahamas]] held on  [[Bimini]],  [[Cat Cay]], [[Walker's Cay]], [[Berry Islands]] and the [[Abacos]].

Prewitt has achieved one of the rarest feats in offshore ocean [[Big-game_fishing|Billfishing]].  This is when an [[angling|Angler]] catches any three of five [[Billfish]] ([[Atlantic blue marlin|Blue Marlin]], [[White Marlin]], [[Sailfish]], [[Marlin|Spearfish]] or [[Swordfish]]) within a single day.   He has attained five Grand Slams (3 fish) and two Super Grand Slams (4 fish), including both a Grand and Super Grand Slam in the same day. With Prewitt's skills, it was not unusual for him to [[catch and release]] at the same time, a double (2) or triple (3) of [[White Marlin]] or [[Sailfish]], all while under the strict [[International_Game_Fish_Association#International_Angling_Regulations|IGFA Tournament Rules]].

He has won or placed in the top three positions in numerous world class tournaments.  These include [[Cancun, Mexico]] Light Tackle, [[Walker's Cay]] Billfish, [[Bimini]] Big Game, [[Treasure Cay]], Chub Cay and the Boy Scout USVI Open Tournaments.

Prewitt owned two [[Big-game_fishing#Boats|sportfishing boats]] and each was named Megabyte; a 1983 46' Post and 1988 61' Jim Smith. Both have been extensively covered in magazines and broadcast TV shows. The Post was featured on the cover of the October 1988 issue of Motor Boating & Sailing Magazine and in a story of winning fishing boats.  The Jim Smith, in addition to magazines, was featured in the [[ESPN]] coverage of the Boy Scout Tournaments and Mark Sosin's Saltwater Journal television shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&p_theme=pbpb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=megabyte%20prewitt%20AND%20date(all)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(megabyte%20prewitt)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|title=Search Summary on Prewitt & Megabyte|publisher=Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref>  Prewitt was unique among yacht owners or [[Big-game_fishing|Billfisherman]]; knowing how to run and fix almost anything on the boat and with the ability to work as the captain, engineer or mate. Rarely seen on the social circuit and probably not recognizable at the cocktail receptions, Prewitt maintained a low profile dissimilar from the typical [[Big-game_fishing|big boat Angler]].  He explains the secrets of  success in  the story "Byte for Bite", by Jan Fogt in [[Boating_(magazine)|Boating Magazine]] April 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coreinternational.info/1989-04_Boating_Byte_for_Bite.pdf|title=Byte for Bite - How a crew of computer junkies stunned the sportfishing circuit|publisher=Boating April 1987|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
Prewitt served on the Board of Directors and as Trustee until 2003 of [[The Billfish Foundation]] (TBF). Founded in 1986 by his late and longtime friend [[Winthrop P. Rockefeller]], TBF is the world's leading non-profit organization dedicated to conserving billfish and associated species worldwide which helps ensure healthy oceans and strong coastal economies. TBF's signature research project is the traditional tag and release program that uses the efforts of anglers to provide data and research to scientists and fisheries managers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billfish.org|title=Billfish Foundation Website|publisher=TBF|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref>

Prewitt and his family or firms have both supported and made philanthropic gifts to The Billfish Foundation, Boy Scouts of [[USVI]], Every Lap Counts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everylapcounts.com/|title=Every Lap Counts|publisher=Every Lap Counts|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref>,which supports charitable causes for children through major international endurance auto races, [[Norton Museum of Art]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], [[Palm Beach County, Florida]] Science Fair, Summit Christian School in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], [[WXEL-TV]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], Miami Rescue Mission which provides care for the homeless, [[Salvation Army]] in [[Miami, Florida]], Park City Museum in [[Park City, Utah]], [[Utah Symphony]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and [[Deer Valley Music Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deervalleymusicfestival.org/support/item/66-supporters|title=Deer Valley Music Festival & Utah Symphony|publisher=Utah Symphony|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everylapcounts.com/|title=Every Lap Counts|publisher=Every Lap Counts|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref><ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>


==Politics & Public Service==
Beginning in the mid 90s, Prewitt served as a Commissioner on the Architectural and Code Enforcement Boards prior to his 2001 unopposed election to the Town Commission of [[Manalapan, Florida]] where he held office until the town was reapportioned. He was very active in the Town and greatly covered in local press in more than 39 stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&p_theme=pbpb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Hal%20prewitt%20manalapan%20AND%20date(all)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Hal%20prewitt%20manalapan)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|title=Search summary on Hal Prewitt & Manalapan|publisher=Palm Beach Post|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref> Prewitt served on the [[Florida Atlantic University]] Executive Advisory Board and Palm Beach Countywide Beaches & Shores Council.<ref name="Hal Prewitt"/>


==Other Interesting Facts==
In March 2009, Prewitt purchased<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=6091923|title=Romney Ski Estate Sold|publisher=KSL TV|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref> [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor]] and [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012| presidential candidate]] [[Mitt Romney|Mitt Romney's]] home<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luxist.com/2009/02/17/mitt-romney-in-utah-estate-of-the-day/|title=Mitt Romney Estate|publisher=Luxist.com|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref> in [[Park City, Utah]].  The home was built by Romney in 1999, used to raise his family while President of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], was the site of a number of political events and also served as the family's vacation residence from 1999 to 2009.<ref name="Mountain Majesty">{{cite web|url=http://www.parkcitymagazine.com/Park-City-Magazine/Winter-Spring-2012/Mountain-Majesty/|title=Prewitt Estate|publisher=Park City Magazine|accessdate=08 Feb 2012}}</ref>

You win Endurance races by clicking off laps and staying out of the pits, not damaging or killing the equipment. It's nice, but you don't have to be the fastest driver on the track.
* The best way to succeed, whether in racing, business or tasks in everyday life, is to develop the ability to see the future. Take in every piece of information, connect the dots and make the right decisions. When we don't make mistakes we look like a genius.
* Increase your success when billfishing by creating a single weakest link, a bait that looks and swims different and that is chasing other bait.
