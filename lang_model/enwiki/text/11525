[[Image:Christmas story credits.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Credits for ''[[A Christmas Story]]''.  The names joined by "and" means that these three writers each worked separately on their drafts of the screenplay.]]
In the [[United States]], '''[[screenwriting]] credit''' for motion pictures and television programs under its jurisdiction is determined by either the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE) or the [[Writers Guild of America, west]] (WGAw). Since [[1941 in film|1941]], the Guilds have been the final arbiter of who receives credit for writing a [[screenplay]] or original story, or credit for creating the original characters. A production company that signs the Guild Basic Agreement must comply with Guild rules.

==Rationale==
The system is important to writers primarily for reputational purposes. Some sources list only WGAE or WGAw certified credits. [[John Howard Lawson]], the first president of the [[Screen Writers Guild]] (the WGAw's former name) said, "A writer's name is his most cherished possession. It is his creative personality, the symbol of the whole body of his ideas and experience." However, the Internet Movie Database<ref>http://www.imdb.com</ref> has included unofficially credited work in the filmographies of writers since 2009.

The credit system affects eligibility for membership in the [[trade union|union]], which is determined on points awarded based on what a writer has done, and it affects future income. While all writers are paid when they work, usually only credited writers receive residual income from future exploitation of a film on video, pay-per-view, broadcast television, etc.

==Process==
On completion of a film, the producer presents proposed screenwriting credits to the guild and circulates the final script to all writers employed on the script. If any writer objects to the proposed credits, credit for the film enters arbitration. The director or producer of the film being proposed for final credit triggers an automatic arbitration (WGA Screen Credits Manual, section III.C.1)

In arbitration, Guild members review all drafts of the screenplay by each writer and follow a formula that determines the credits.

The WGAE and WGAw both resolutely reject the ''[[auteur theory]]''&mdash;that only the director is the "author" of a film&mdash;so a "production executive" (a producer or director) who claims credit must meet a higher standard than others to receive credit. An original writer must contribute at least one-third of the final screenplay to receive credit. Subsequent writers who work as [[script doctor]]s must contribute more than half of the final screenplay to receive credit. A production executive who works on a script must contribute at least half the final product to receive credit (WGA Screen Credits Manual, section III.C.3).

Credit can be apportioned for the story, a short treatment of the plot and characters, and the screenplay itself when all writers were not equally involved in the creation of both. A credit might read "Story by John Doe.  Screenplay by John Doe & Richard Roe."

Where a team of writers works on a screenplay, names are joined by an [[ampersand]] (''&amp;''), and when two teams of writers work successively on a script, the teams are joined by ''and''. So, a credit reading "John Doe & Richard Roe and Jane Doe & Jane Roe" means that there were two writing teams, John and Richard on one and the two Janes on the other.

Where a film has been based on a previous film, but does not remake it, a "based on characters created by" credit is given, such as on the show ''[[Frasier]]''. Every episode gives credits to [[James Burrows]], [[Glen Charles]] and [[Les Charles]], the creators of ''[[Cheers]]'', the show where the character of Dr. Frasier Crane originated.

Only three writers may be credited for the screenplay if they collaborated and a maximum of three teams of three may be credited no matter how many actually worked on it. For example, ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]) had about a dozen writers, as did ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]). The film adaptation of ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' ([[1994 in film|1994]]) supposedly had over sixty writers. This limit doesn't include those awarded credit elsewhere for creating characters or the original story.

The Guilds also permit use of [[pseudonym]]s if a writer requests one in a timely fashion, but has been known to refuse to accept one that makes a statement. For example, [[screenwriter]] [[J. Michael Straczynski]] wanted to take his name off the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'' and substitute "Eiben Scrood" ("I been screwed") to protest script changes the production company made. According to Straczynski, the WGAw refused because "it 'diminished the value' of the show and basically made light of the studio."<ref>http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-16393&query=Eiben</ref>

=== Story by ===
There is a common misconception that a "story by" credit may be given to a person who simply has the story ''idea'' for a film or television program. This is never the case, as all writing credits are for actual writing. Often, a screenwriter produces a [[spec script]] that, after being [[option (films)|optioned]], undergoes a "page one rewrite" that produces a new draft. In many such cases, the original author receives the "story by" rather than "screenplay by" credit.

==Examples==
Here are some complicated examples of WGA-approved exceptions to the typical one-writer credit.
*''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Nicolas Cage]], has the writing credit "Story by [[David Weisberg]] & [[Douglas S. Cook]].  Screenplay by [[David Weisberg]] & [[Douglas S. Cook]] and [[Mark Rosner]]."
*''[[Armageddon (film)|Armageddon]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]), starring [[Bruce Willis]], carries the credits "Story by [[Robert Roy Pool]] and [[Jonathan Hensleigh]].  Adaptation by [[Tony Gilroy]] and [[Shane Salerno]]. Screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and [[J. J. Abrams]]."
* ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]) gives "characters" credit to [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]] for creating the characters as she wrote the novel that the first film was based upon. The film gives the credit "Story by Eve Ahlert & Dennis Drake and Kate Kondell. Screenplay by Kate Kondell." 
*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]) credits "Screen Story by [[Ted Elliott]] & [[Terry Rossio]] and [[Stuart Beattie]] and [[Jay Wolpert]]. Screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio."
* ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) credits "Screenplay by [[Craig Mazin]] & [[Jim Abrahams]] & [[Pat Proft]]. Story by Craig Mazin. Based on Characters Created by [[Shawn Wayans]] & [[Marlon Wayans]] & Buddy Johnson & [[Phil Beauman]] and [[Jason Friedberg]] & [[Aaron Seltzer]]." The original ''Scary Movie'' was based on a combination of two scripts, causing its sequels to have increasingly complicated writing credits.

==Arbitration==
Some Guild members have criticized the arbitration process. The Guild, however, have won most lawsuits against them, and in 2002 the WGA membership overwhelmingly rejected changes to the arbitration procedures. 

A chief objection is the secrecy of the process.{{Who|date=July 2007}} Identities of the arbiters are secret, so concerned parties have no way to object to the qualifications or possible biases of their judges.  Also, the decision itself is secret, even from the parties to the dispute, so they have no way to know why they lost or won credit. Secret decisions make an appeal impossible, and define no precedent for future disputes. There is an appeal panel, but it only concerns itself with technical details as to whether the decision followed the rules.

Guild members have criticized the way the process handles existing material, such as a book, that is adapted to film. Generally, the first writer to work on such a project naturally appropriates the most cinematic elements of the story. Other teams that subsequently work on the script, however, may base their work on the original text rather than that first draft. [[Barry Levinson]], the director of ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]) and a disputant over screenwriting credit for the film (which was adapted from a novel), says: <ref name="Willens">{{cite web

:If a writer creates an idea from scratch, that's one thing. Even if the script is given to other writers and rewritten, that first writer created the seeds of that idea and he or she should get some regard.  But for a script from a book, it's different.

Even if little of the initial efforts remain in the final script, the original writer is often awarded credit because he or she was first on the scene.

==Conflict and resolution examples==<!-- This section is linked from [[Joss Whedon]] -->

[[Frank Pierson]], formerly WGAw president and the current ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}) president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], says that, "The large majority of credits are still straightforward and uncontested," but "When they go wrong, they go horribly wrong."  [[Phil Alden Robinson]] says, "No one can trust the writing credit. Nobody knows who really wrote the film."<ref>{{cite web

When [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]) was adapted for the screen, [[Alex Cox]] and [[Tod Davies]] wrote the initial adaptation. When [[Terry Gilliam]] was brought in to direct, he rewrote it with [[Tony Grisoni]]. The Guild initially denied Gilliam and Grisoni any credit, even though Gilliam claimed nothing of the original adaptation remained in the final film. "As a director, I was automatically deemed a 'production executive' by the Guild and, by definition, discriminated against.  But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair."<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = February 24, 2009}}</ref> After complaints, the Guild did award Gilliam and Grisoni credit, in addition to Cox and Davies, but Gilliam resigned from the union over the dispute. "It's really a [[Star Chamber]]," said Gilliam of the arbitration process, which he claimed took more work than the screenplay itself.<ref name="Willens" />

Similar problems arose for the film ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]). According to director [[John Frankenheimer]], "The credits should read: Story by [[J. D. Zeik]], screenplay by [[David Mamet]]. We didn't shoot a line of Zeik's script."<ref name="articles.latimes.com">[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/05/entertainment/ca-10109/  Mamet Versus Writers Guild, the Action Thriller Sequel]</ref> Instead, Mamet received credit under a pseudonym. After the controversy over credits for ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', Mamet reportedly has decided to attach his name only to movies on which he is the sole writer.<ref name="articles.latimes.com" /> 

From 1993 to 1997, there were 415 arbitrations, about one-third of all films whose credits were submitted.
