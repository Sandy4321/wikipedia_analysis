'''Cheadle Hulme''' is a suburban area located in the south of [[Greater Manchester]] in the North-West of [[England]]. Historically a part of [[Cheshire]], it now forms part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]]. 

==The village==
While it is contiguous with the larger districts of [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] (to the north) and [[Bramhall]] (to the east), ''Cheadle Hulme'' retains a distinct identity, with its own shopping centre and [[Cheadle Hulme railway station|railway station]] with the railway running over the brick built Seven Arches [[Viaduct]].
[[Image:Cheadle Hulme Arches.jpg|thumb|left|Part of Cheadle Hulme's [[Seven Arches Railway Viaduct]]]]
The village lies on the Lady Brook (Micker Brook), one of the [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[River Mersey]], flowing from the [[Poynton]] area, through Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme and joining the Mersey in [[Stockport]]. 
Cheadle Hulme railway station was the cut-off point for the different stages of the 2004 upgrade of the West Coast railway.
The [[Old English]] place name ''Cheadle'' refers to ''ced'' "wood" as does ''leah'' "clearing in a wood" and may have been used since the 7th century. [[Viking]] influence in the 9th century may have introduced [[Danish language|Danish]] field names such as ''hulm'' meaning "island in the fen" or "water meadow" which were used later in the modern name. 

Cheadle Hulme is the home of the historic East [[Cheshire]] [[Chess]] Club, and [[Cheadle Hulme School]], which celebrated its 150th anniversary in [[2005]], and two amateur dramatic societies; CHADS and the Players.

In [[2007]], Cheadle Hulme became the home of [[Waitrose]]'s first purpose built retail outlet in the North of England which opened on 19th July 2007<ref>http://www.waitrose.com/branches/branchdetails.aspx?uid=710</ref>. 
Its local newspaper is called Community News, which also covers Bramhall and Hazel Grove, distributing around 22,000 copies a week. Another local newspaper is the Stockport Express, covering the whole of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, available every Wednesday.

==History==

Stone axes found about 3 miles north of Cheadle Hulme around the Mersey valley and tributaries show clear evidence of population in the [[Neolithic|New Stone Age]] period. There is some suggestion of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] road from Cheadle (or possibly [[Manchester]]) to [[Buxton]], running along the modern Cheadle Road (originally Street Lane) through modern Cheadle Hulme. Roman artefacts (coins, bracelets) discovered at Millington Hall, and Hulme Hall support this.

In 1321 Sir Robert (Roger) de Chedle, lord of Cheadle manor, died leaving no male heirs. The elder daughter, Clemence (married to William de Bagylegh) inherited the southern half (technically overlord to her sister's share), "Cheadle Holme". In the mid 17th century the estate was acquired by the Moseley family and became known as Cheadle Moseley, and later Cheadle Hulme.

Cheadle Hulme was originally several hamlets, which still feature in names of areas today. These included Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, Grove Lane and Hulme Hall. The many farms which covered the area also retain their names today, as in Orish Mere Farm, Hill Top Farm and Hursthead Farm.
