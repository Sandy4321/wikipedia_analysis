The '''Center for Class Action Fairness'''  ('''CCAF''')  is a Washington, D.C.-based [[public interest|public-interest]] law firm,  founded by [[Ted Frank]] in June, 2009 to represent consumers dissatisfied with their counsel in [[class action]]s and class action settlements.<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0921/outfront-tort-consumers-lawyer-tries-to-block-settlements.html|title=A Lawyer Who Tries to Block Settlements|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|date=September 21, 2009|work=[[Forbes]]|page=36|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="nlj">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202432164378|title=Judge Approves Bluetooth Settlement, but Balks at Attorney Fees Award|last=Bronstad|first=Amanda|date=July 10, 2009|work=[[National Law Journal]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>It is a project of a  [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3) organization]], a non-profit firm which relies on donors from charitable foundations and independent individuals to fund it. According to ''The American Lawyer'', as of March 2011, the CCAF had filed objections to 17 settlements, with eight objections pending in federal district courts, and had been successful on six of them.

==Background==
Ted Frank was inspired to establish the center from his success in objecting to the class action settlement in the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Grand Theft Auto]] consumer fraud case where class members would have received under $30,000 while the attorneys were asking for $1 million.<ref name=forbes/><ref name="nyt">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/technology/25settle.html|title=Hidden Sex Scenes Draw Ho-Hum, Except From Lawyers|last=Glater|first=Jonathan D.|date=June 25, 2008|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="grossman">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/press/commentary/ed122308a.cfm|title=Grand Theft Class Action: Game Over|last=Grossman|first=Andrew|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="atl">{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/ted_frank_interview.php|title=The Class Action Avenger: Ted Frank's Cool New Job|last=[[David Lat|Lat, David]]|date=August 10, 2009|work=[[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>

==Cause==
{{quote box|width=25em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Even when a lawsuit is plainly meritless, it costs defendants a lot of money to have litigators dealing with the case. Without a loser pays rule, it's cheaper for the defendants to pay trial lawyers protection money to go away. Because no one has an incentive to object, the settlements get rubber-stamped, and the trial lawyers go on to file the next extortionate lawsuit. And we all pay higher prices as a result.

In other cases, the lawsuit has merit, but the class lawyers would prefer to maximize their share of the settlement than do what is right for their putative clients: they structure the settlement in tricky ways that will minimize the total cost to the defendant while making it seem like their own outsized fees are justified. The defendant just wants the suit to go away as cheaply as possible, and doesn't care whether lawyers or consumers get the money. The class notice might be misleading: we successfully objected in one case where the notice implied that the class would get $9.5 million (thus making the $1.05 million attorney fee seem reasonable), when the class in fact got about $117,000.

CCAF hopes to change this by giving consumers another option: object, with a lawyer standing behind them to explain to a court why the law doesn't permit such an extortionate settlement that fails to benefit consumers."|source=<U+2014>Frank on the purpose of the CCAF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centerforclassactionfairness.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2009-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-05%3A00&updated-max=2010-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-05%3A00&max-results=22|title=Welcome|publisher=Center for Class Action Fairness|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>}}
Among CCAFs cases are those challenging an emerging trend known as ''[[Cy-pr<U+00E8>s doctrine|cy-pr<U+00E8>s]]''.  Created by American courts in the 1990s as a mechanism to distribute funds to stand-in organizations and causes in cases in which it would be impractical to distribute class action settlement funds directly to the entire class of plaintiffs, the practice has been criticized from time to time for redirecting funds that would otherwise go to the parties to the case.  In one case, CCAF challenged a settlement that would have directed $2.5 million out of a total $16.5 million settlement [[Apple Inc.]] was to pay to shareholders for backdating [[employee stock option]] grants, to unrelated law school programs on [[corporate governance]].<ref name="cyp"/>

CCAF has objected to settlements throughout the United States, in cases where class action lawyers receive cash payments but the plaintiff class receives only discount coupons for further products and services from the defendant company.  CCAF argues in those cases that few of the coupons are ever used, so the actual payment to plaintiffs is much lower than the stated amounts.<ref name="winbig">{{cite news|author=Bill McLellan|title=Lawyers win big in class action suit |date=June 23, 2010|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/bill-mcclellan/article_df877b2a-0f3b-5f2a-abb4-440ce3f8ef40.html?mode=story|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch}}</ref>  In 2010, CCAF successfully objected to a [[coupon settlement]] in a [[Central District of California]] class action alleging consumer fraud in the sale of [[Honda Civic Hybrid]]s; the settlement would have provided $2.95 million in attorneys' fees, but only coupons to the class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202444507335|title=Civic Hybrid class settlement doesn't pass muster|last=Bronstad|first=Amanda|date=February 24, 2010|work=[[National Law Journal]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legalnewsline.com/spotlight/225724-group-puts-the-brakes-on-honda-class-action-settlement|title=Group puts the brakes on Honda class action settlement|last=Rizo|first=Chris|date=February 23, 2010|work=Legal Newsline}}</ref><ref name="True v 2010">''True v.

CCAF has distanced itself from other firms, sometimes called "professional objectors", that make money by holding up class action settlements until they themselves are paid off,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dolanmedia.com/view.cfm?recID=596685|publisher=Baltimore Daily Record|title=The Deal Breakers: A look at professional class action objectors in Md.|first=Brendan|last=Kearney|date=May 23, 2010}}</ref>  Whereas that practice has been criticized as doing to class action lawyers what class action lawyers are doing to companies, one commentator said that CCAF appears to be doing so as a matter of principle.<ref name="winbig"/>  As of April, 2010 the Center had taken on nine cases on its own initiative or on behalf of dissatisfied class members, but had not accepted any attorney fees.

==Notable cases==
Frank, at his own expense, traveled to New York and filed a successful objection to the proposed class action settlement in the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Grand Theft Auto consumer fraud case]] where class members who had bought a  <U+201C>Grand Theft Auto<U+201D> computer game with a hidden, sexually explicit [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] would have received less than $30,000, while the plaintiffs' attorneys would receive $1 million in legal fees.<ref name=forbes/><ref name="grossman">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/press/commentary/ed122308a.cfm|title=Grand Theft Class Action: Game Over|last=Grossman|first=Andrew|date=22 December 2008|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="atl">{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/ted_frank_interview.php|title=The Class Action Avenger: Ted Frank's Cool New Job|last=[[David Lat|Lat, David]]|date=10 August 2009|work=[[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]]|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockwallheraldbanner.com/opinion/x1440316177/Hardly-a-class-act|title=Hardly a <U+2018>class<U+2019> act Legally Speaking|publisher=Rockwall Herald-Banner (Texas)|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="nyt625">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/technology/25settle.html|title=Hidden Sex Scenes Draw Ho-Hum, Except From Lawyers|last=Glater|first=Jonathan D.|date=25 June 2008|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref> Spurred by complaints about excessive sexual content in the game, class action attorneys sued its makers, Take Two Interactive Software.

In April 2011, Frank and the CCAF filed an objection to the $3.4 billion taxpayer funded [[Cobell Indian Trust settlement]], which the federal government had agreed to in December 2009, which had established a $1.5 billion Trust Accounting and Administration Fund and a $1.9 billion Trust Land Consolidation Fund to buy fractionated land interests.<ref name="PD">{{cite web|url=http://plainsdaily.com/entry/objection_filed_against_cobell_indian_trust_class_action_settlement_agreeme/ |title=Objection Filed Against Cobell Indian Trust Class Action Settlement Agreement|publisher=Plains Daily|author=Bommarito, Kate|date=20 April 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>  Under the agreed settlement, a maximum of $99.9 million had been allocated for the lawyers fees but they had demanded $223 million.<ref name="PD"/> Acting on behalf of Kimberly Craven, a [[Sisseton-Wahpeton Ovate]] tribe member, Frank argued that the case was about pure greed, stating that it included "an <U+2018>outrageous<U+2019> fee request that has resulted in bipartisan criticism" and that the Class Counsel were "more interested in maximizing their personal recovery than the interests of the class."<ref name="PD"/>

In May 2011, the Center for Class Action Fairness filed a lengthy brief in [[Missouri]], challenging a settlement which gave lawyers who sued [[A.G.
