'''Robert Prosine<U+010D>ki''' ({{IPA-sh|<U+02C8>r<U+0254>b<U+025B>rt <U+0329>pr<U+0254>si<U+02C8>n<U+025B>t<U+0283>ki|hr}}, (born 12 January 1969) is a former [[Croatia]]n [[association football|football]] midfielder. Prosine<U+010D>ki is regarded by many as the player with best technique that ever played in and for Croatia. Former national squad teammate [[Zvonimir Boban]], humbly, also agreed with this. His dribbling is considered excellent, and his ability to keep possession of the ball is very highly regarded. He is one of the few footballers to have played for both the Spanish rival clubs [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].

After retiring from active football he worked as assistant manager of the [[Croatia national football team]] between 2006<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=107624.html Croatia back among the big boys]</ref> and 2010, before being appointed manager of the [[Red Star Belgrade]] football club in December 2010.

==Early life and career==
Prosine<U+010D>ki was born in [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Schwenningen]], [[West Germany]], into a family of [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[gastarbeiter]]s of mixed ethnicity. His father <U+0110>uro was [[Croats|Croatian]], hailing from a village near [[Kraljevec na Sutli]], and his mother Emilija is [[Serbs|Serbian]], originally from [[<U+010C>a<U+010D>ak]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/umro-otac-robija-prosineckog/151229.aspx | title=Umro otac Robija Prosine<U+010D>kog | first= | last= | publisher=index.hr | date=30 July 2003 | language=Croatian | accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sportservis.pressonline.rs/wsw/index.php?p=71&ni=16561 | title=Emilija Prosine<U+010D>ki: Raduje me <U+0161>to je moj Robert opet u Srbiji! | first=D. | last=Nedeljkovi<U+0107> | publisher=''[[Press (newspaper)|Press]]'' | date=10 December 2010 | language=Serbian | accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref> 

He spent his childhood in Germany before moving back to [[SR Croatia]] with his family in 1979, at the age of ten. By that time Prosine<U+010D>ki had already been playing in the [[Stuttgarter Kickers]] youth system. Once in Croatia, he continued in the youth setup of [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].

==Club career==
===Dinamo Zagreb===
After moving up the youth ranks for years, Prosine<U+010D>ki started getting occasional first team appearances during the [[1986<U+2013>87 Yugoslav First League|1986<U+2013>87 league season]] under head coach [[Miroslav Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]]. On his league debut versus [[FK <U+017D>eljezni<U+010D>ar Sarajevo|FK <U+017D>eljezni<U+010D>ar]], he managed to score a goal. By the end of the season, he recorded one more league appearance.

Wanting to secure his son's financial future, Prosine<U+010D>ki's father <U+0110>uro started pushing within club hierarchy for a professional contract to be given to his 18-year-old son.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kolumne/genijalci-prosinecki-pjanic-raskrinkali-su-cirinu-tastinu-kolumna-110780 | title=Genijalci Prosine<U+010D>ki i Pjani<U+0107> raskrinkali su <U+0106>irinu ta<U+0161>tinu | first=Igor | last=Flak | publisher=''[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]'' | date=15 March 2010 | language=Croatian | accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref> However, coach Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> sent him away, famously saying that if Prosine<U+010D>ki ever became a real football player, he would eat his coaching diploma.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/1998/11/20/Gledista.htm | title=Hrvatski jal | first=Milan | last=Jaj<U+010D>inovi<U+0107> | publisher=''[[Vjesnik]]'' | date=20 November 1998 | language=Croatian | accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.com/pdf/2000%5C06%5C25%5C11A11.PDF |format=PDF| title=Drugi odlazak <U+00BB>Velikog <U+017D>utog<U+00AB> - najtu<U+017E>niji dan za hrvatski nogomet | first=Predrag | last=Juri<U+0161>i<U+0107> | publisher=''[[Vjesnik]]'' | date=25 June 2000 | language=Croatian | accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref>

===Red Star Belgrade===
In the summer of 1987 <U+0110>uro Prosine<U+010D>ki took Robert over to [[Belgrade]] and got the professional contract they were after. [[Dragan D<U+017E>aji<U+0107>]], [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]]'s then football director, remembers the transfer as follows: {{cquote|''On one of our visits to Zagreb we stayed at [[Regent Esplanade|Hotel Esplanade]] where I got approached by a man who introduced himself as Robert Prosine<U+010D>ki's uncle. He told me his nephew wasn't happy at Dinamo and asked me if we could arrange a tryout. I told them to come to Belgrade in a couple of days and they did. At the tryout I saw this kid do wonders with the ball and I immediately asked our head coach [[Velibor Vasovi<U+0107>]] to schedule an afternoon practice session at the main stadium so that I could see the kid one more time. It was obvious we had a classy player on our hands, and I initiated the contract proceedings right away. Our lawyer informed us that we wouldn't have to pay a transfer fee to Dinamo so Robert's father <U+0110>uro and I agreed everything in five minutes.''<ref>[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.72.html:310888-Dzajic-Najbitnije-da-Prosinecki-srusi-Partizan D<U+017E>aji<U+0107>: Najbitnije da Prosine<U+010D>ki sru<U+0161>i Partizan];''Ve<U+010D>ernje novosti'', 10 December 2010</ref>}}

Immediately upon arrival to his new club, Prosine<U+010D>ki became a first team regular and furthermore, much to Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>'s chagrin, also rapidly established himself as one of Yugoslavia's most gifted and talented players. Playing under head coach Vasovi<U+0107> the youngster earned a spot in Red Star's midfield lineup alongside [[Dragan Stojkovi<U+0107>]], [[<U+017D>arko <U+0110>urovi<U+0107>]], and [[Goran Milojevi<U+0107>]] just a few weeks into the [[1987<U+2013>88 Yugoslav First League|1987<U+2013>88 league season]] and never looked back. In October 1987 he was part of the [[Yugoslavia national under-20 football team|Yugoslav youth squad]] which won the [[1987 FIFA World Youth Championship|World Youth Championship]] in [[Chile]], with Prosine<U+010D>ki winning the Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player. Although playing in Chile meant that he was away from the club for the entire month of October, he was already held in such high regard at Red Star that club brass attempted to bring him back from Chile after the tournament's group stages, so that he could play in their [[1987<U+2013>88 UEFA Cup]] second round tie versus [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]]. The players protested to FIFA, and [[Jo<U+00E3>o Havelange]], the organisation's chairman at the time, intervened to keep Prosine<U+010D>ki in Chile.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/jul/24/newsstory.sport9 | title=Yugoslavia in the 90s: the greatest team there never was? | first=Jonathan | last=Wilson | publisher=guardian.co.uk | date=24 July 2007 | accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> 

During his four-year spell at the club Prosine<U+010D>ki helped Red Star win three [[Yugoslav First League]] titles and one [[Yugoslav Cup]], as well as participating in the club's greatest success in history by winning the [[1991 European Cup Final|1991 European Cup]].

He then played with [[Real Madrid]], [[Real Oviedo]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], [[NK Hrvatski dragovoljac]], [[Standard Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (where he is considered a legend despite playing only one season in the latter stages of his career), [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911)|Olimpija Ljubljana]], and [[NK Zagreb|Zagreb]].

Prosine<U+010D>ki is still held as a folk hero at Portsmouth for his marvelous one man performances in the centre of midfield, his goals and assists saving the club from relegation in the 2001/02 season. At the end of the [[Premier League 2007-08|2007-08 Premier League season]] the readers of ''[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]]'' have picked Prosine<U+010D>ki for all-time best [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] eleven. He is only non-British player among elected.
It was after talking to Prosine<U+010D>ki that current Croatia international [[Niko Kranj<U+010D>ar]] decided to sign for Portsmouth in the summer of 2006.<ref>[http://www.net.hr/sport/page/2007/11/15/0437006.html Kranj<U+010D>ar: Prosine<U+010D>ki je presudio - Sport - Net.hr]</ref>

==Controversy==
===Relationship with <U+0106>iro Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>===
Parallel with Prosine<U+010D>ki's later rise to football superstardom at [[Red Star Belgrade]], [[Real Madrid]], [[FC Barcelona]] and Yugoslav and Croatian national teams, the story of him being chased away from [[Dinamo Zagreb]] in 1987 by the famous coach [[<U+0106>iro Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]] grew in Croatian and Yugoslav media and public. To this day it is often cited and referenced as an example of football mismanagement, poor judgement, and bad work with youth categories.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kolumne/genijalci-prosinecki-pjanic-raskrinkali-su-cirinu-tastinu-kolumna-110780 | title=Genijalci Prosine<U+010D>ki i Pjani<U+0107> raskrinkali su <U+0106>irinu ta<U+0161>tinu | first=Igor | last=Flak | publisher=''[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]'' | date=15 March 2010 | language=Croatian | accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref> Colourful Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>, the villain of the piece, rarely talked on the record about the circumstances of Prosine<U+010D>ki's departure. However, in 2010, Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> deflected responsibility for the flap by claiming he actually gave the youngster a four-year contract that was eventually, according to Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107>, annulled by Dinamo president [[Ante Pavlovi<U+0107>]] on a technicality due to not being processed administratively by the subfederation responsible. On the same occasion, Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> went on to accuse Prosine<U+010D>ki's father <U+0110>uro of not negotiating in good faith with Dinamo by saying "he already had his combination with Red Star". Asked about his famous quote about eating his diploma if Prosine<U+010D>ki ever became a player, Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> responded that he only used it as a motivation tool.<ref>[http://www.net.hr/sport/page/2010/06/04/0366006.html <U+0106>iro otkrio tajnu kako je Prosine<U+010D>ki zavr<U+0161>io u Zvezdi!];net.hr, 4 June 2010</ref>

Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> and Prosine<U+010D>ki would reignite their feud eleven years later during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] where they were part of the Croatian national team that somewhat improbably made it all the way to the semifinal. In the semifinal match that Croatia lost 1-2 versus host France after going ahead 1-0, Bla<U+017E>evi<U+0107> decided to leave Prosine<U+010D>ki on the bench, which led to a lot of criticism.

===Court case versus Dinamo===
In the summer of 1997, Prosine<U+010D>ki came back to the club where he started his professional career. Now called [[Croatia Zagreb]], the club was turned into a state project bankrolled by the Croatian regime's highest echelons and personally supported by president [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]]. By 2000, Prosine<U+010D>ki left Croatia Zagreb, but in late 2001 decided to initiate a lawsuit against the club (whose name was now restored back to Dinamo after the fall of Tu<U+0111>man's regime) over [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]1,550,000 (<U+20AC>750,000) in unpaid wages.<ref>[http://www.monitor.hr/clanci/prosinecki-tuzi-dinamo-zbog-neisplacenih-1550-000-dem/15436/ Prosine<U+010D>ki tu<U+017E>i Dinamo zbog neispla<U+0107>enih 1,550.000 DEM];''Vjesnik'', 20 November 2001</ref>

Years later in 2009, court ruled against Prosine<U+010D>ki, mostly due to asserting that the lawsuit against Dinamo had no merit since Prosine<U+010D>ki played for Croatia Zagreb, and not Dinamo Zagreb.<ref>[http://www.net.hr/sport/page/2009/11/13/0210006.html Prosine<U+010D>ki: Kao da nikad nisam igrao za Dinamo];net.hr, 13 November 2009</ref> Commenting on the verdict in late 2009, Prosine<U+010D>ki said he was cheated out of his money.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbj_Oq-tuVU net.hr interview];December 2009</ref>
