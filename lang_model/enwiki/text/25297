'''State Route 124''' ('''SR&nbsp;124''') is a {{convert|51.1|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[State highway (US)|state highway]] that runs southwest-to-northeast through portions of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], [[Barrow County, Georgia|Barrow]], and [[Jackson County, Georgia|Jackson]] [[County (United States)|counties]] in the north-central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;124 begins at an [[Intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[Interstate 20 in Georgia|I-20]]/[[U.S. Route 278 in Georgia|US&nbsp;278]]/[[Georgia State Route 12|SR&nbsp;12]] in [[Lithonia, Georgia|Lithonia]], in DeKalb County. To the northeast, it crosses into Gwinnett County and, immediately, crosses over the [[Yellow River (Georgia)|Yellow River]]. Southwest of [[Snellville, Georgia|Snellville]], it meets [[Georgia State Route 264|SR&nbsp;264]]. In town, it intersects [[U.S. Route 78 in Georgia|US&nbsp;78]]/[[Georgia State Route 10|SR&nbsp;10]] and then, the [[Ronald Reagan Parkway]]. On the southwestern edge of [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]] is the [[Sugarloaf Parkway]]. Farther into town, it intersects [[Georgia State Route 20|SR&nbsp;20]]. Then, [[U.S. Route 29 in Georgia|US&nbsp;29]]/[[Georgia State Route 8|SR&nbsp;8]] join the road in a [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] to the west. A short distance later, SR&nbsp;124 splits to the north, and almost immediately, joins SR&nbsp;20 concurrently to an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Georgia State Route 316|SR&nbsp;316]] (University Parkway). A short distance later, SR&nbsp;124 splits off to the northeast. Northwest of [[Dacula, Georgia|Dacula]], it meets [[Georgia State Route 324|SR&nbsp;324]]. Farther to the northeast, the highway crosses into Barrow County. After an intersection with [[Georgia State Route 211|SR&nbsp;211]], it enters Jackson County. A few miles later is [[Braselton, Georgia|Braselton]]. There, it has a very brief concurrency with [[Georgia State Route 53|SR&nbsp;53]]. It curves to the southeast to [[Georgia State Route 332|SR&nbsp;332]]. The road heads westerly until it meets its northeastern terminus, an intersection with [[Georgia State Route 11|SR&nbsp;11]] in the southwestern part of [[Jefferson, Georgia|Jefferson]].
