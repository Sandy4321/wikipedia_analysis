==History==
It was designed by the engineer John Sydney Crossley.<ref name=NHLE/> The first stone was laid on 12 October 1870 and the last in 1874.<ref name=Houghton/> One thousand [[Navvy|Navvies]] building the viaduct established [[shanty town]]s on the moors for themselves and their families.<ref name=HR150/> They named the towns after victories of the [[Crimean War]], sarcastically for [[wikt:posh|posh]] districts of London, and Biblical names.  There were [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]]s and deaths from industrial accidents.  One hundred navvies were killed during the construction of the viaduct.<ref name=HR150/> There are 200 burials of men, women, and children in just the graveyard at [[Chapel-le-Dale]] dating from the construction. The church has a special memorial to the railway workers<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapel-le-Dale: St Leonard, Ingleton|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/chapel-le-dale-st-leonard/|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kapp|first=Alexander P|title=St Leonard's Church Chapel le Dale, Memorial|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1788933|work=SD7377|publisher=[[Geograph]] Project|accessdate=25 August 2013|date=28 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Ian|title=Millennium gravestone, Chapel le Dale|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1905789|work=SD7377|publisher=[[Geograph]] Project|accessdate=25 August 2013|date=6 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1964, several brand new [[cars]] being carried on a freight train that was crossing the viaduct were blown off the wagons they were being carried upon and landed on the ground by the viaduct.<ref name=HR150/>

==Location==
Ribblehead Viaduct is the longest and most famous [[viaduct]] on the [[Settle-Carlisle Railway]]. [[Ribblehead railway station]] is located less than half a mile to the south of the viaduct. Just to the north of it is the [[Blea Moor Tunnel]], the longest tunnel on the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]].<ref>Garrat, Colin & Matthews, Max-Wade (2003) Illustrated Encyclopedia of Steam And Rail, Barnes & Noble Books, New York, ISBN 0-7607-4952-3</ref>  It is located near the foot of the mountain of [[Whernside]]. The viaduct is curved, and so may be seen by passengers on the train.

The Settle-Carlisle line is one of three north-south main lines; along with the [[West Coast Main Line]] through [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] and the [[East Coast Main Line]] via [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. [[British Rail]] attempted to close the line in the 1980s, citing the reason that the viaduct was unsafe and would be expensive to repair.  A partial solution was to single the line across the viaduct in 1985, preventing two trains from crossing simultaneously. The closure proposals generated tremendous protest and were eventually retracted. The viaduct, along with the rest of the line, was repaired and maintained and there are no longer any plans to close it.

Two taller viaducts on the route are  [[Smardale|Smardale viaduct]] at {{convert|131|ft|m}} high and near to [[Crosby Garrett]], and Arten Gill at {{convert|117|ft|m}}.
