'''''Blithe Spirit''''' is a comic play by [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] which takes its title from [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem "[[To a Skylark]]" ("Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! / Bird thou never wert").  The play concerns the socialite and novelist Charles Condomine, who invites the eccentric [[Mediumship|medium]] and [[clairvoyant]], Madame Arcati, to his house to conduct a [[s<U+00E9>ance]], hoping to gather material for his next book.  The scheme backfires when he is haunted by the ghost of his annoying and temperamental first wife, Elvira, after the s<U+00E9>ance.  Elvira makes continual attempts to disrupt Charles's marriage to his second wife, Ruth, who cannot see or hear the ghost.

The play was first seen in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1941, creating a new long-run record for non-musical British plays of 1,997 performances.  It also did well on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] later that year, running for 657 performances.  Coward adapted the play for [[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|film in 1945]], starring [[Rex Harrison]], and directed a [[musical theatre|musical]] adaptation, ''[[High Spirits (musical)|High Spirits]]'', on Broadway in 1964.  It was also adapted for television in the 1950s and 1960s and for radio.  The play enjoyed several West End and Broadway revivals in the 1970s and 1980s and was revived again in London in 2004, 2011 and 2014. It returned to Broadway in February 2009.

==Background==
The title of the play is taken from [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem "[[To a Skylark]]".<ref>Nightingale, Benedict. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924C3EF6E6CCA3&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "Coward's high-flyer lays an egg"], ''The Times'', 19 June 1997, p.  37</ref> For some time before 1941 Coward had been thinking of a comedy about ghosts. His first thoughts centred on an old house in Paris, haunted by spectres from different centuries, with the comedy arising from their conflicting attitudes, but he could not get the plot to work in his mind.<ref name=p89>Payn, p. 89</ref> He knew that in wartime Britain, with death a constant presence, there would be some objection to a comedy about ghosts,<ref>Hoare, p. 321</ref> but his firm view was that as the story would be thoroughly heartless, "you can't sympathise with any of them. If there ''was'' a heart it would be a sad story."<ref name=p89/>

After his London office and flat had been destroyed in the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], Coward took a short holiday with the actress [[Joyce Carey]] at [[Portmeirion]] on the coast of [[Snowdonia]] in Wales. She was writing a play about [[John Keats|Keats]], and he was still thinking about his ghostly light comedy:
 {{quote|We sat on the beach with our backs against the sea wall and discussed my idea exclusively for several hours. Keats, I regret to say, was not referred to. By lunchtime the title had emerged together with the names of the characters, and a rough, very rough, outline of the plot. At seven-thirty the next morning I sat, with the usual nervous palpitations, at my typewriter. Joyce was upstairs in her room wrestling with [[Fanny Brawne]]. There was a pile of virgin paper on my left and a box of carbons on my right. The table wobbled and I had to put a wedge under one of its legs. I smoked several cigarettes in rapid succession, staring gloomily out of the window at the tide running out. I fixed the paper into the machine and started. ''Blithe Spirit''. A Light Comedy in Three Acts.

For six days I worked from eight to one each morning and from two to seven each afternoon. On Friday evening, May ninth, the play was finished and, disdaining archness and false modesty, I will admit that I knew it was witty, I knew it was well constructed, and I also knew that it would be a success.<ref>Coward (1954), p. 211</ref>|}}

==Synopsis==
Charles Condomine, a successful novelist, wishes to learn about the occult for a novel he is writing, and he arranges for an eccentric medium, Madame Arcati, to hold a s<U+00E9>ance at his house.  At the s<U+00E9>ance, she inadvertently summons Charles's first wife, Elvira, who has been dead for seven years.  Madame Arcati leaves after the s<U+00E9>ance, unaware that she has summoned Elvira.  Only Charles can see or hear Elvira, and his second wife, Ruth, does not believe that Elvira exists until a floating vase is handed to her out of thin air.  The ghostly Elvira makes continued, and increasingly desperate, efforts to disrupt Charles's current marriage. She finally sabotages his car in the hope of killing him so that he will join her in the spirit world, but it is Ruth rather than Charles who drives off and is killed.

Ruth's ghost immediately comes back for revenge on Elvira, and though Charles cannot at first see Ruth, he can see that Elvira is being chased and tormented, and his house is in uproar.  He calls Madame Arcati back to exorcise both of the spirits, but instead of banishing them, she materialises Ruth.  With both his dead wives now fully visible, and neither of them in the best of tempers, Charles, together with Madame Arcati, goes through s<U+00E9>ance after s<U+00E9>ance and spell after spell to try to exorcise them, and at last Madame Arcati succeeds.  Charles is left seemingly in peace, but Madame Arcati, hinting that the ghosts may still be around unseen, warns him that he should go far away as soon as possible.  Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the central character tiptoes out as the curtain falls <U+2013> a device that he also used in ''[[Present Laughter]]'', ''[[Private Lives]] ''and ''[[Hay Fever]]''.<ref>Lahr, p. 71</ref> Charles leaves at once, and the unseen ghosts throw things and destroy the room as soon as he has gone. (In the David Lean film version, the ghosts thwart Charles's attempt to escape, and his car is again sabotaged; he crashes and joins them as a ghost, with Elvira at one arm and Ruth at the other.)

==Critical reception==
After the first performance in Manchester, the reviewer in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought the mixture of farce and impending tragedy "An odd mixture and not untouched by genius of a sort".<ref>"Opera House", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 June 1941, p. 6</ref> After the London premiere, [[Ivor Brown]] commented in ''The Observer'' on the skill with which Coward had treated his potentially difficult subject; he ended his notice, "But here is a new play, a gay play, and one irresistibly propelled into our welcoming hearts by Miss Rutherford's Lady of the Trances, as rapt a servant of the s<U+00E9>ance as ever had spirits on tap."<ref>Brown, Ivor. "At the Play", ''The Observer'', 6 June, 1941, p. 7</ref> The London correspondent of ''The Guardian'' wrote, "London received Mr Noel Coward's ghoulish farce with loud, though not quite unanimous acclaim. There was a solitary boo <U+2013> from an annoyed spiritualist, presumably."<ref>"Blithe Spirit in London", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 4 July 1941, p. 4</ref>  ''[[The Times]]'' considered the piece the equal not only of Coward's earlier success ''[[Hay Fever]]'' but of [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]'s classic comedy ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.<ref>"Piccadilly Theatre", ''The Times'', 3 July 1941, p. 2</ref> There were dissenting views. [[James Agate]] thought the play "common",<ref>Citron, p. 7</ref> and [[Graham Greene]] called it "a wearisome exhibition of bad taste".<ref name=mb>Billington, Michael. "Comedy, not farce", ''The Times'', 24 July 1970, p. 13</ref>

When the piece had its first West End revival in 1970 the play was warmly though not rapturously praised by the critics,<ref name=mb/><ref>Dawson, Helen. "Not so blithe", ''The Observer'',  26 July 1970, p. 24</ref> but by the time of the next major production, in 1976, [[Irving Wardle]] of ''The Times'' considered, "Stylistically, it is Coward's masterpiece: his most complete success in imposing his own view of things on the brute facts of existence,"<ref>Wardle, Irving. "Blithe Spirit", ''The Times'' 25 June 1976, p. 11</ref> and [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] of ''The Guardian'' wrote of Coward's influence on [[Harold Pinter]].<ref name=mb1>Billington, Michael. "Familiar spirits", ''The Guardian'', 7 July 1976, p. 8</ref> In 2004, Charles Spencer of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "With ''Hay Fever'' and ''Private Lives'', ''Blithe Spirit'' strikes me as being one of Coward 's three indisputable comic masterpieces. [It is] the outrageous frivolity with which Coward treats mortality that makes the piece so bracing."<ref>Spencer, Charles.
