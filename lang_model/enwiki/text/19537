'''Robert John Roberts''' (April 1859 &ndash; [[20 October]] [[1929]]), better known as '''Bob Roberts''', was an [[England|English]] [[association football|football]] [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. He spent the majority of his career at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], with whom he won an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal, and also played for [[Sunderland Albion F.C.|Sunderland Albion]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He won three caps for [[England national football team|England]] and is the first West Bromwich Albion player to have appeared at international level. He was nicknamed '''''Long Bob''''' and '''''The Prince of Goalkeepers'''''.<ref name="Cult Heroes">{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Simon | title = West Brom's Cult Heroes | publisher = Know the Score | year = 2006 | pages = pp2&ndash;11 | isbn = 1-905449-02-X}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Amateur years===
Roberts was born in [[West Bromwich]] as one of five children to James Roberts. After leaving Christ Church school Bob became a [[plasterer]] by trade, while his interest in sport led him to join the [[Avery Berkel|George Salter's Spring Works]] football team, the [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Strollers]].<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> On [[23 November]] [[1878]] Roberts played in the first recorded Strollers game, a 12-a-side friendly against Hudson's soap factory that finished 0&ndash;0.<ref name="Essential History"/> Roberts continued to play for the club after they changed their name to West Bromwich Albion in 1880. He played in various positions, including full-back, half-back and forward, and there is record of him scoring against Smethwick Holy Trinity in February 1880 in a 3&ndash;0 victory. However he was generally not a success as an outfield player, one observer describing him thus:<ref name="Cult Heroes"/>
{{Cquote|As a forward he was useless, and as a half-back, or back, he could stop a man, but invariably missed the ball.}}

Roberts kept goal for the first time during the [[1880-81 in English football|1880&ndash;81 season]]. His first match between the posts appears to have taken place on either [[18 December]] [[1880]] against Wednesbury Royal George,<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> or else on [[29 January]] [[1881]] against Hockley Belmont.<ref name="Essential History">{{cite book| last = McOwan | first = Gavin | title = The Essential History of West Bromwich Albion | publisher = Headline | year = 2002 | pages = pp7&ndash;12 | isbn = 0-7553-1146-9 }}</ref> He helped Albion reach the semi-final of the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]] in both [[1881-82 in English football|1881&ndash;82]] and [[1882-83 in English football|1882&ndash;83]]. In the latter season the club won their first trophy, the [[Staffordshire Senior Cup]], beating [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]]<!--they weren't Stoke City until the 1920s--> 3&ndash;2 in the final. According to the newspaper ''The Athlete'', Roberts could take "a lot of credit for the win by his fine keeping".<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> In 1885 Albion reached the FA Cup quarter-final, but lost 2&ndash;0 to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]; Roberts was unable to participate in the match due to "[[rheumatics]]".<ref name="Cult Heroes"/>

===Professional era===
With the legalisation of professionalism in the summer of 1885, Roberts and his team mates all became professional players in [[1885-86 in English football|1885-86]], and proceeded to win both the Birmingham and Staffordshire cups. Albion lost to Blackburn Rovers (via a replay) in the [[1886 FA Cup Final]], the first of three successive [[FA Cup Final]]s in which Roberts played. He received another runners-up medal the following year as Albion were defeated 1&ndash;0 by rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the [[1887 FA Cup Final|1887 final]]. During the cup run he is credited with scoring a goal from a long kick downfield against [[Derby Junction F.C.|Derby Junction]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Matthews | first=Tony | title=West Bromwich Albion: The Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books | year=2007 | pages=p393| isbn=978-1-85983-565-4}}</ref> Twelve months later he helped his team to victory in the 2&ndash;1 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the [[1888 FA Cup Final|1888 final]]. His performance for Albion was described as "most remarkable" by ''[[The Times]]'', while ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'' said that his keeping was "brilliant all through the game".<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> Later that year Roberts played in the "Championship of the World" match, which pitted the English FA Cup holders against the winners of the [[Scottish Cup]]. Albion lost the game 4&ndash;1 to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Matthews | first=Tony | coauthors=Mackenzie, Colin | title=Albion! A Complete Record of West Bromwich Albion 1879&ndash;1987 | publisher=Breedon Books | year=1987 | pages=p13 | isbn=0-907969-23-2}}</ref>

Roberts played in Albion's first ever [[Football League]] match on [[8 September]] [[1888]], keeping a [[clean sheet]] in the 2&ndash;0 victory over Stoke.<!--they weren't Stoke City until the 1920s--><ref>{{cite book| last=Matthews | first=Tony | title=West Bromwich Albion: The Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books | year=2007 | pages=pp174&ndash;175| isbn=978-1-85983-565-4}}</ref> His appearance made him one of only two players (alongside [[Ezra Horton]]) to have played in both Albion's first FA Cup game and their first league game.<ref name="WBA Whos Who">{{cite book | last = Matthews | first = Tony | title = The Who's Who of West Bromwich Albion | publisher = Breedon Books | year = 2005 | pages = pp197&ndash;198 | isbn = 1-85983-474-4}}</ref> He was ever-present in that first league season of [[1888-89 in English football|1888&ndash;89]], making 22 appearances and keeping four clean sheets.<ref name="100 Greats">{{cite book | last = Matthews | first = Tony | title = 100 Greats - West Bromwich Albion Football Club | publisher = Tempus | year = 2001 | pages = p97 | isbn = 0-7524-2224-3}}</ref> In October 1889 he was suspended by [[The Football Association|the FA]] for four matches, after he took part in an unsanctioned match at Walsall.<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> Roberts made 84 appearances in the league and the FA Cup during his Albion career; taking into account friendlies and local cup competitions, he appeared around 400 times for the club.<ref name="WBA Whos Who"/> 

In May 1890 Roberts moved on a free transfer to [[Sunderland Albion F.C.|Sunderland Albion]]; their offer of 50 [[Shilling (United Kingdom)|shilling]]s per game was one that West Bromwich were unable to match. He failed to settle in the [[North East England|North East]], enduring homesickness as well as his wife's illness. On the pitch however, he helped Sunderland Albion finish as runners-up in the [[Football Alliance]] and was ever-present in the league.<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> He returned to West Bromwich Albion on another free transfer in May 1891, and was initially given his place back, at the expense of [[Joe Reader]]. By this time however, Roberts' wife was seriously ill and she died in October 1891. Goalkeeping duties were alternated, and as Roberts' form declined further, Reader won his place back permanently.<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> Roberts thus played no part in Albion's [[1892 FA Cup Final]] win over [[Aston Villa]], and left Albion to join Villa at the end of the season, again for no transfer fee. Villa director [[William McGregor]] said that Roberts was "Unquestionably the finest goalkeeper of his time".<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> After playing in just four games for Villa, Roberts retired from playing football in June 1893.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Adam |coauthors=Griffin, Jeremy |title=The essential history of Aston Villa |publisher=Headline book publishing |pages=p.314|isbn=075531140X}}</ref> He moved back to the North East, where he settled for the remainder of his life, working as a plasterer<ref>{{cite book | author=Graham Betts| title=England: Player by player | publisher=Green Umbrella Publishing | year=2006|pages=p.205| isbn=1-905009-63-1}}</ref>, and died in [[Byker]] on [[20 October]] [[1929]].<ref name="100 Greats"/>

==International career==
On [[19 March]] [[1887]], Roberts made his debut for [[England national football team|England]]; in doing so he became West Bromwich Albion's first ever international player.<ref>{{cite book| last=Matthews | first=Tony | coauthors=Mackenzie, Colin | title=Albion!

|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> He was so proud of winning his first England [[cap (sport)|cap]] that he wore it in every subsequent match in which he played.<ref name="Cult Heroes"/> He won two further caps for his country in 1888 and 1890 respectively, on both occasions lining up against [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]] in [[Belfast]]. England were victorious in both matches, in the latter by a 9&ndash;1 scoreline.<ref name="Englandstats last game">{{cite web

Roberts won various other representative honours during his career, including an appearance for the [[Birmingham County Football Association|Birmingham FA]] in their 4&ndash;1 win against the [[Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield FA]]. He also turned out for the Players v Gentlemen match at the [[Kennington Oval]] and played in a county match for [[Staffordshire]], against [[Lancashire]]. When he represented Birmingham for a match against Glasgow, such was his popularity that "dozens, possibly even hundreds" of West Bromwich Albion supporters neglected their own team's match against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall Swifts]] in order to watch him play.<ref name="Cult Heroes"/>
