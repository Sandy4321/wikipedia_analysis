The '''World Science Festival''' is a [[science festival]] held in [[New York City]] that is planned as an annual event. The [[World Science Festival, 2008|2008 inaugural festival]] was held May 28 <U+2013> June 1 and consisted mainly of panel discussions and on-stage conversations, accompanied by multimedia presentations.

The festival was the brainchild of [[Columbia University]] physicist [[Brian Greene]] and his wife, [[Emmy Award]]-winning television journalist Tracy Day. It was held in partnership with major New York City cultural and academic institutions such as [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== History and background ==

The World Science Festival was founded by [[Brian Greene]], a [[Columbia University]] physics professor and author of several popular-science books (such as ''[[The Elegant Universe]]''), and his wife, [[Emmy Award]]-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by a visit to the 2005 [[Festival della Scienza]] in [[Genoa]], where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.<ref name="Musser">Cf. {{Citation

Day and Greene proceeded by sounding out scientists and science communicators about their idea, enlisting many of their contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They then went on to meetings with the presidents of the city's major universities, its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears wherever they went, and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City.<ref name="Musser"/> Early 2006 saw the founding of the [[Science Festival Foundation]] (SFF), a [[non-profit organization]] based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are [[Alan Alda]], Columbia University president [[Lee Bollinger]], the foundation's president Judith Cox, [[New York University]] president [[John Sexton]], and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.<ref>Non-profit status and chairman position from the foundation's 990-EZ form for 2006, accessible online via

Next came the assembly of a team of producers who were to organize the festival's events. Notably Kyle Gibson, an Emmy Award-winning former producer of [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline with Ted Koppel]], joined the festival as senior program producer, while production of the Youth and Family Program was put into the hands of Robin Reardon, a former show producer for [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] and former vice president of [[Universal Studios]] Creative, who also became the festival's managing director.<ref>Producers: {{Citation
