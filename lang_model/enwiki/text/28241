The '''11th Airborne Division''' of the [[United States Army|US Army]] was activated on the 25th of February, 1943.  From [[1963]] to [[1965]], the division was redesignated the '''11th Air Assault Division'''.  This division should not be confused with the [[Mexican-American War]] [[11th United States Infantry Division]].

==History==

===Landing===
The 11th Airborne Division arrived in [[New Guinea]], [[25 May]] [[1944]], and continued training, leaving for the [[Philippines]] [[11 November]] [[1944]]. It landed amphibiously, not by jump, on [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], [[18 November]] [[1944]], between [[Abuyog, Leyte|Abuyog]] and Tarragona (now [[MacArthur, Leyte|MacArthur]]), 40 miles south of [[Tacloban City|Tacloban]], and pushing inland, cleared the [[Ormoc City|Ormoc]]-[[Burauen, Leyte|Burauen]] supply trail, an important Japanese combat lifeline. The 11th's general mission was to seize and secure within its zone all exits from the mountains into [[Leyte Valley]] and to secure the western exits from the mountains into the west coastal corridor to assist the attack of the [[US 7th Infantry Division|7th Division]] toward Ormoc.

===The Enemy===
On [[6 December]] [[1944]] the paratroopers of the 11th found themselves fighting Japanese parachutists who had landed near the [[San Pablo City|San Pablo]] airstrip. The Japanese were wiped out in a 5-day engagement. In a continuous series of combat actions, Japanese resistance was reduced on Leyte by the end of December 1944. Heavy resistance was met at Rock Hill, which finally fell, [[18 December]]; a sleeping enemy was caught off guard at Hacksaw Hill, [[23 December]], and suffered heavy losses. During January 1945 the Division rested and staged for a landing on [[Luzon]]. While other American troops were driving on [[Manila]] from the north, the 11th Airborne made an amphibious landing 60 miles south of Manila, [[31 January]] [[1945]], at [[Nasugbu, Batangas|Nasugbu]], and began to drive north.

===Jumps===
The first combat jump by an element of the division in the war, that of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment on [[Tagaytay City|Tagaytay Ridge]], [[3 February]] [[1945]], met no resistance. The 511th crossed the [[Para<U+00F1>aque City|Para<U+00F1>aque River]] [[5 February]], and reached Manila, meeting fierce Japanese resistance. [[Nichols Field]] was taken, [[12 February]], and [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] was flanked, 12-[[16 February]], and finally taken, [[17 February]]. A combined air and sea assault liberated more than 2,000 American and European interned nationals at [[Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna|Los Ba<U+00F1>os]], [[23 February]] [[1945]]. With Manila declared secure, the Division reduced a strong ring of enemy outposts between [[Lake Taal]] and [[Laguna de Bay]], and occupied towns along Highway No. 1, cutting off the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Peninsula]]. In April the 11th took part in clearing out remaining enemy resistance in [[Batangas|Batangas province]], and by [[1 May]], all resistance in southern Luzon had ended.

===Final Mission===
The final operation of the Division was conducted on [[23 June]] [[1945]], in conjunction with the advance of the [[US 37th Infantry Division|37th Division]] in northern Luzon. A Task Force was formed and jumped on [[Camalaniugan Airfield]], south of [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]]. The force attacked and made contact with the 37th Infantry Division, [[26 June]] [[1945]], between [[Alcala, Cagayan|Alcala]] and the [[Paret River]]. In July 1945 the Division trained; in August it was transported by air to [[Honshu]], [[Japan]], via [[Okinawa]], for occupation duty.

===Coming home===

After occupation duty in Japan, the division returned to [[Camp Campbell]] in [[Kentucky]] in [[1949]]. Its mission became that of a training division.  The division's final overseas assignment came in [[1956]], when it was sent to [[Germany]] to replace the [[U.S. 5th Infantry Division|5th Infantry Division]].  On [[30 June]] [[1958]], the 11th Airborne Division was inactivated to be reactivated as the [[U.S. 24th Infantry Division|24th Infantry Division]] in [[Augsburg, Germany|Augsburg]], [[Germany]].  Ironically, the 24th's contingency Airborne Brigade was activated [[16 July]] [[1958]], and sent to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], as part of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Ike]]'s move to prevent the loss of Lebanon to the newly emerging [[United Arab Republic]].  Apart from a brief reactivation in [[1963]] as the 11th Air Assault Division to test out the concepts of [[air assault|helicopter assault tactics]], that was the final time that the division saw service.  It was inactivated for the final time in [[1965]].  Results from its tests would come to be used by the [[U.S. 1st Cavalry Division|1st Air Cavalry Division]] and, to this day, the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)]].
