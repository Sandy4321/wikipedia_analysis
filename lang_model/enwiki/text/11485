'''Lady Yin''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: <U+6BB7><U+6C0F>; [[Pinyin]]: Y<U+012B>n Sh<U+00EC>) is a minor character featured within the famed ancient Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. She is the wife of [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]] and they have three sons, [[Jinzha]], [[Muzha (deity)|Muzha]], and [[Nezha (deity)|Nezha]].

Throughout the Nezha birth arc in ''Fengshen Yanyi'', Lady Yin would always be known to reflect many acts of kindness to her third son -- no matter what he truly did. Thus, Lady Yin would be seen protecting Nezha at many times throughout the novel, even when he performed horendous actions such as the killing of [[Ao Guang]]'s third son, [[Ao Bing]]. After Nezha had given his own body as a sacrifice to Ao Guang in order to protect his family, Lady Yin would end up erecting a temple atop the Green Screen Hill as a stationing area for Nezha's spirit (this was because Nezha continuously pleaded to her in her sleep). Lady Yin would be scolded by Li Jing profusely following this point.
