'''Venstre'''<ref group="note">The party name is officially not translated into any other language, but is in English often referred to as the Liberal Party.

Founded with a basis on pro-[[free market]] [[liberalism]], it is the major party on the [[centre-right]] of the [[political spectrum]].  The party currently governs in coalition with the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], with support from the [[Danish People's Party]].

In the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary elections]], Venstre received 26% of the vote, and 46 out of 179 seats. It is led by [[Lars L<U+00F8>kke Rasmussen]], who took over as party leader and [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] from [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] in 2009.

Venstre is a liberal party within the [[Nordic agrarian parties|Nordic agrarian]] tradition, but is notably more pro-free market than its sister parties.<ref>{{cite book |title=Beyond Westminster and Congress: the Nordic experience |last=Esaiasson |first=Peter |coauthors=[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]] |year=1999 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |location=Columbus |isbn=9780814208397 |page=377 }}</ref>  Some describe it as [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], since its leader from 1998 to 2009, [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], is known for his authorship of the book ''[[From Social State to Minimal State]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Venstre1945.jpg|thumb|right|''Venstre'' 1945 election material ''("Venstre has good cards on hand")'']]
''Venstre'', or "the Left" in English, was founded in 1870 under the name ''Det Forenede Venstre'' (The United Left). It was formed through the merger of three parliamentary factions, all of whom had identified as leftist in the context of the time. From 1895-1910 it was known as ''Venstrereformpartiet'' (Left Reform Party), and after that as ''Venstre''.

''Venstre'' was traditionally a party advocating free trade and farmers' interests. This traditional landed basis resulted in a relative decline in influence due to the rapidly accelerating urbanisation of Danish society. Starting in the 1880s, the party began expanding into urban regions as well.

By the 1910s, the splitting off of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberals]] and the appearance of the [[Social Democratic Party of Denmark|Social Democrats]] had pushed Venstre toward the centre, and it often relied on its former Conservative adversaries for parliamentary support.  After the 1960s Venstre was reoriented as a more classical liberal party. During the leadership of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], the party turned further to the right.

===Origin of the name===
The fact that the major liberal political party in a country calls itself 'Left' is often confusing to many foreign (and sometimes Danish) observers. The name has, however, its historical explanation. At the time of its foundation, ''Venstre'' affirmed progressive ideas in the then Danish parliament. Their opponents, ''H<U+00F8>jre'' (Right), was the forerunner of the present [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]]. In current Danish politics there is a clear distinction between the concepts of ''Venstre'' (Left, i.e. the party bearing that name) and ''venstrefl<U+00F8>j'' (left wing, i.e. socialist and other left-leaning parties). The use of the word for "left" in the name of the Danish political party ''[[Det Radikale Venstre|Radikale Venstre]]'' and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] party ''[[Venstre (Norway)|Venstre]]'' is meant to refer to [[liberalism]] and not [[socialism]].

Members of the party are referred to as ''Venstrem<U+00E6>nd'' and ''Venstrekvinder'', respectively "Venstre Men" and "Venstre Women" (singular: -mand / -kvinde).

==Ideology==
===Tax policy===
Since the elections in 2001, Venstre has enacted a so-called "tax stop" in order to halt the growth in taxes seen during the previous eight years under the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]. This tax stop has been under heavy fire from the parties on the [[left wing]] of Danish politics, allegedly for being "asocial" and "only for the rich."

Attempts to control the growth in public expenditures, have however, been less successful than originally hoped by the party. [[Government spending|Public spending]] has continued to increase by approximately 1% above inflation, per year.

In 2004, two small tax cuts went into effect:

First, people with jobs get a 3% tax reduction on the 5% "bottom tax" ({{lang-da|Bundskat}}). This initiative is supposed to encourage people to go off welfare, and take jobs instead.

Second, the bottom limit of the "middle tax" ({{lang-da|Mellemskat}}) of 6%, is raised by 12,000 [[Danish Krone]]r every year, over the next four years. This will limit the income stresses of middle incomes and families with children.

Venstre has so far refrained from making statements on the future of the "top tax" (Danish: Topskat) of 15%, and the [[Value Added Tax]] (Danish: "Moms") of 25%.

The income tax in Denmark ranges from [9%-44%] for ultra low income families to [44%-62%] progressively for middle class families. 850,000 Danes (31% of everyone employed) pay a marginal income tax of 62% although the overall effective rate will be lower.
