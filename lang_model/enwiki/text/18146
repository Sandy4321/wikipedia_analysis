{{History Of The Cold War}}
The '''Cold War''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0425><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0301><U+0434><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0439><U+043D><U+0430><U+0301>, ''Kholodnaya vo<U+012D>na''}}) was the continuing state from about 1947 to 1991 of political conflict, military tension, [[Proxy War|proxy wars]], and economic competition between the [[Communist World]] <U+2013> primarily the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s and allies <U+2013> and the powers of the [[Western world#The Cold War|Western world]], primarily the [[United States]] and its allies. Although the chief military forces never engaged in a major battle with each other, they expressed the conflict through military coalitions, strategic conventional force deployments, extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable, [[proxy war]]s, espionage, propaganda, conventional and nuclear [[arms race]]s, appeals to neutral nations, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the [[Space Race]].

After the success of their temporary wartime alliance against [[Nazi Germany]], the USSR and the US saw each other as profound enemies of their basic ways of life. The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the eastern European countries it occupied, annexing some  and maintaining others as satellite states, some of which were later consolidated as the [[Warsaw Pact]] (1955&ndash;1991). The US financed the recovery of western Europe and forged [[NATO]], a military alliance using [[containment]] of [[communism]] as a main strategy ([[Truman Doctrine]]).

The US funded the [[Marshall Plan]] to effectuate a more rapid post-War recovery of Europe, while the Soviet Union would not let most Eastern Bloc members participate. Elsewhere, in [[Latin America]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the USSR assisted and helped foster [[communist revolution|communist revolutions]], opposed by several Western countries and their regional allies; some they attempted to [[rollback|roll back]], with mixed results. Among the countries that the USSR supported in pro-communist revolt was [[Cuba]], led by [[Fidel Castro]]. The proximity of communist Cuba to the United States proved to be a centerpoint of the Cold War; the USSR placed multiple nuclear missiles in Cuba, sparking heated tension with the Americans and leading to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, where full-scale nuclear war threatened. Some countries aligned with NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and others formed the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The Cold War featured periods of relative calm and of international high tension <U+2013> the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948&ndash;1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950&ndash;1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1959&ndash;1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] (1979&ndash;1989), and the [[Able Archer 83]] NATO exercises in November 1983. Both sides sought [[d<U+00E9>tente]] to relieve political tensions and deter direct military attack, which would probably guarantee their [[mutual assured destruction]] with [[nuclear weapon]]s.

In the 1980s, under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when the nation was already suffering [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. In the late 1980s, Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[perestroika]]'' ("reconstruction", "reorganization", 1987) and ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness", ca. 1985). The Cold War ended after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power. [[Russia]] rejected Communism and was no longer regarded as a threat by the U.S. The Cold War and its events have had a significant impact on the world today, and it is often referred to in popular culture, especially films and novels about spies.

==Origins of the term==
At the end of [[World War II]], English author and journalist [[George Orwell]] used the term ''[[Cold war (general term)|Cold War]]'' in his essay <U+201C>You and the Atomic Bomb<U+201D>, published October 19, 1945, in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of [[nuclear warfare]], he warned of a <U+201C>peace that is no peace<U+201D>, which he called a permanent <U+201C>cold war<U+201D>,<ref>{{cite book| last=Kort| first =Michael| title= The Columbia Guide to the Cold War|publisher= Columbia University Press| year =2001|page =3}}</ref> Orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Geiger| first =Till| title= Britain and the Economic Problem of the Cold War|publisher= Ashgate Publishing| year =2004|page =7}}</ref> Moreover, in ''The Observer'' of March 10, 1946, Orwell wrote that <U+201C>[a]fter the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a <U+2018>cold war<U+2019> on Britain and the [[British Empire]].<U+201D><ref>Orwell, George, ''The Observer'', March 10, 1946</ref>

The first use of the term to describe the post<U+2013>World War II [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] tensions between the USSR and its satellites and the United States and its western European allies is attributed to [[Bernard Baruch]], an American financier and presidential advisor.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=54}}</ref> In [[South Carolina]], on April 16, 1947, he delivered a speech (by journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]])<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Safire|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/news/edsafire.php|title=Islamofascism Anyone?|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 1, 2006|accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref> saying, <U+201C>Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war.<U+201D><ref>'[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bernard-baruch-coins-the-term-cold-war Bernard Baruch coins the term "Cold War"]', history.com, April 16, 1947.

There is disagreement among historians regarding the starting point of the Cold War. While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began towards the end of [[World War I]], although tensions between the [[Russian Empire]], other European countries and the United States date back to the middle of the 19th century.<ref name="Gaddis"/>

As a result of the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia (followed by its withdrawal from [[World War I]]), Soviet Russia found itself isolated in international diplomacy.<ref name="lee">{{Harvnb|Lee|1999|p=57}}</ref>  Leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement", and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided, beginning with the establishment of the Soviet [[Comintern]], which called for revolutionary upheavals abroad.<ref name="Palmieri34">{{Harvnb|Palmieri|1989|p=62}}</ref>

Subsequent leader [[Joseph Stalin]], who viewed the Soviet Union as a "socialist island", stated that the Soviet Union must see that "the present capitalist encirclement is replaced by a socialist encirclement."<ref name="tucker46">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=46}}</ref> As early as 1925, Stalin stated that he viewed international politics as a bipolar world in which the Soviet Union would attract countries gravitating to socialism and capitalist countries would attract states gravitating toward capitalism, while the world was in a period of "temporary stabilization of capitalism" preceding its eventual collapse.<ref name="tucker47">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|pp=47<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Various events before the Second World War had been demonstrative of mutual distrust and suspicion between the Western powers and the Soviet Union, including the [[Bolshevik]]s' challenge to capitalism;<ref name = "Halliday">{{Harvnb|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}</ref> Western support of the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Civil War]];<ref name = "Gaddis">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=57}}</ref> the 1926 Soviet funding of a British general workers strike causing Britain to break relations with the Soviet Union;<ref name="tucker74">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=74}}</ref> Stalin's 1927 declaration of peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries "receding into the past";<ref name="tucker75">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=75}}</ref> conspiratorial allegations during the 1928 [[Shakhty Trial|Shakhty show trial]] of a planned British- and French-led [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]];<ref name="tucker98">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=98}}</ref> the American refusal to recognize the Soviet Union until 1933;<ref name = "LaFeber 1991">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|1991|pp=194<U+2013>197}}</ref> and the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Moscow Trials]] of the [[Great Purge]], with  allegations of British, French, Japanese and Nazi German espionage.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tim Tzouliadis| title=The Forsaken |publisher=The Penguin Press |isbn=978-1-59420-168-4}}</ref>

As a result of the German invasion in June 1941, the Allies decided to help the Soviet Union; Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its [[Lend-Lease]] Program.<ref>George C. Herring Jr., ''Aid to Russia, 1941<U+2013>1946: Strategy, Diplomacy, the Origins of the Cold War'' (Columbia University Press, 1973).</ref>

However, Stalin remained highly suspicious and believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to allow the Soviets to bear the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last moment and shape the peace settlement.  Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|pp=151<U+2013>153}}</ref>

==End of World War II and post-war (1945<U+2013>47)==
===Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe===
[[Image:Yalta summit 1945 with Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin.jpg|thumb|right|The "[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]" at the Yalta Conference: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], 1945.]]
{{See|Tehran Conference|Yalta Conference}}
The Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war.<ref name="Gaddis13-23">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=13<U+2013>23}}</ref> Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.<ref name="Gaddis13-23" /> The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through [[international organization]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=156}}</ref>

Given the Russian historical experiences of frequent invasions<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=7}}</ref> and the immense death toll (estimated at 27&nbsp;million) and the destruction the Soviet Union sustained during World War II,<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead]", BBC News, May 9, 2005.

The Western Allies were themselves deeply divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals <U+2013> military victory in both [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the [[British Empire]], and the creation of a world peace organization <U+2013> were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Eastern European countries as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.<ref Name=Plokhy>{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2010|p=}}</ref>

In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage and the two western leaders vied for his favors. The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and agreed to divide the [[Balkans]] into respective spheres of influence, and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations.<ref Name=Plokhy/>

Further Allied negotiations concerning the post-war balance took place at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, albeit this conference also failed to reach a firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.<ref name="Gaddis21">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=21}}</ref> In April 1945, both Churchill and new United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] opposed, among other things, the Soviets' decision to prop up the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Lublin government]], the Soviet-controlled rival to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], whose relations with the Soviets were severed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zubok|1996|p=94}}</ref>

Following the [[End of World War II in Europe|Allies' May 1945 victory]], the Soviets effectively occupied Eastern Europe,<ref name="Gaddis21" /> while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe. In [[Allied-occupied Germany]], the Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France established [[Allied-occupied Germany|zones of occupation]] and a loose framework for four-power control.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=22}}</ref>

The [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 Allied conference in San Francisco]] established the multi-national [[United Nations]] (UN) for the maintenance of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] was effectively paralyzed by individual members' ability to use [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bourantonis|1996|p=130}}</ref> Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune.<ref>{{Harvnb|Garthoff|1994|p=401}}</ref>

[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|right|thumb|Post-war territorial changes in Eastern Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc.]]
During the final stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were initially (and effectively) ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]].

The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the brutal methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.<ref name="roht83">{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}</ref> In Asia, the Red Army had overrun [[Manchuria]] in the last month of the war, and went on to occupy the large swath of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=40}}</ref>

As part of consolidating Stalin's control over the Eastern Bloc, the [[NKVD]], led by [[Lavrentiy Beria]], supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed to crush anti-communist resistance.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 34"/> When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 100">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=100}}</ref>

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.<ref name="Telegraph">Fenton, Ben.

===Tensions build===
{{See|Long Telegram|Iron Curtain|Restatement of Policy on Germany}}
In February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]]'s "[[X Article|Long Telegram]]" from Moscow helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, and became the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schecter|2003|pp=152<U+2013>154}}</ref> That September, the Soviet side produced the [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov|Novikov]] telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and "co-authored" by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability "to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kydd|2005|p=107}}</ref>

On September 6, 1946, [[James F.

{{Main|Containment|Truman Doctrine}}
By 1947, US president Harry S.

The American government's response to this announcement was the adoption of [[containment]],<ref name="Gaddis28">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=28<U+2013>29}}</ref> the goal of which was to stop the spread of communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the [[Truman Doctrine]], which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes.<ref name="Gaddis28" /> Even though the insurgents were helped by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],<ref name="LaFeber 1991" /> US policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to [[Domino theory|expand]] Soviet influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=38}}</ref>

In early 1947, Britain, France and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.<ref name="miller16">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}</ref> In June 1947, in accordance with the [[Truman Doctrine]], the United States enacted the [[Marshall Plan]], a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union.<ref name="miller16"/>

The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=186}}</ref> The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html|title=Pas de Pagaille!|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=July 28, 1947|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> One month later, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]], creating a unified [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].

Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe.<ref name="Gaddis32">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=32}}</ref> Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.<ref name="Gaddis32" /> The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with eastern Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]] (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the [[Comecon]]).<ref name = "LaFeber 1991" /> Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref>

In early 1948, following reports of strengthening "reactionary elements", Soviet operatives executed a [[Czechoslovak coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948|coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures.<ref name="wettig86">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=86}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Patterson|1997|p=132}}</ref>  The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point, set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.<ref name="miller19">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}</ref>

===Berlin Blockade and airlift===
[[Image:C-47s at Tempelhof Airport Berlin 1948.jpg|thumb|C-47s unloading at [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in Berlin during the Berlin Blockade.]]
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
The United States and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into [[Bizone|"Bizonia"]] (1 January 1947, later "Trizonia" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949).<ref name="miller13">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=13}}</ref> As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system.<ref name="miller18">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=18}}</ref> In addition, in accordance with the [[Marshall Plan]], they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the German economy, including the introduction of a new [[Deutsche Mark]] currency to replace the old [[Reichsmark]] currency that the Soviets had debased.<ref name="miller31">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=31}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948 <U+2013> 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in [[West Berlin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=33}}</ref> The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=65<U+2013>70}}</ref>

The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change.

Media in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was an [[Eastern Bloc information dissemination|organ of the state, completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party]], with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party.<ref name="oneil15">{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick|title=Post-communism and the Media in Eastern Europe|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0714647659|page=15<U+2013>25}}</ref>Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.<ref>James Wood, p. 111</ref>

Along with the broadcasts of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Voice of America]] to Eastern Europe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=131}}</ref> a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the Communist system in the Eastern Bloc.<ref name="Puddington9" /> Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press.<ref name="Puddington9">{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=9}}</ref> Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F.

===Chinese Civil War and SEATO===
{{See|Chinese Civil War|Southeast Asia Treaty Organization}}
In 1949, [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] People's Liberation Army defeated [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s United States-backed [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=39}}</ref> Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]].

United States officials moved thereafter to expand containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p= 212}}</ref> In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "[[Pactomania]]"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably [[ANZUS]] in 1951 and [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.<ref name = "Byrd" />

===Korean War===

One of the more significant impacts of containment was the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].

Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised [[NATO]] to develop a military structure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Isby|Kamps|1985|pp=13<U+2013>14}}</ref> Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong opposition to the war often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices  and withdrawal of all foreign forces.<ref>{{Cite book

===Khrushchev, Eisenhower and De-Stalinization===
In 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War.<ref name="Karabell" >Karabell, p. 916</ref> [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18&nbsp;months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively.<ref name = "LaFeber 1991" />

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the Soviet leader following the deposition and execution of [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and the pushing aside of rivals [[Georgy Malenkov]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. On February 25, 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] by [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=107}}</ref> As part of a campaign of [[de-Stalinization]], he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.<ref name = "Karabell" />

On November 18, 1956, while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you" expression, shocking everyone present.<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html We Will Bury You!]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'', November 26, 1956. Retrieved on June 26, 2008.</ref> He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=84}}</ref> In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the "construction of a communist society" in the USSR would be completed "in the main".<ref>{{Harvnb|Tompson|1997|pp=237<U+2013>239}}</ref>

Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a "[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]" for the [[containment]] strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime.<ref name = "Karabell" /> Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of "massive retaliation", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression. Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name = "LaFeber 1991" />

From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. However, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's belief in the inevitability of war, and declared his new goal was to be "peaceful coexistence".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=70}}</ref> This formulation modified the Stalin-era Soviet stance, where international [[class struggle]] meant the two opposing camps were on an inevitable collision course where Communism would triumph through global war; now, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own,<ref>{{Harvnb|Perlmutter|1997|p=145}}</ref> as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities,<ref>{{Harvnb|Njolstad|2004|p=136}}</ref> which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later "new thinking" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.<ref>Breslauer, p. 72</ref>

===Berlin Ultimatum and European integration===

[[File:Soviet empire 1960.png|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under Soviet [[Sphere of influence|influence]], after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959 and before the official [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1961]]
During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city", giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to [[Mao Zedong]] that "Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=71}}</ref> NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.<ref>Glees, pp. 126<U+2013>27</ref>

More broadly, one hallmark of the 1950s was the beginning of [[European integration]]<U+2014>a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate d<U+00E9>tente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.<ref>Cameron<U+200F>, p. 156</ref>

The period after 1956 was marked by serious setbacks for the Soviet Union, most notably the breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance, beginning the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. [[Mao]] had defended Stalin when Khrushchev attacked him after his death in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge.<ref name="Gaddis142" />

Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader [[Fidel Castro]] during the latter's trip to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in April, leaving [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] to conduct the meeting in his place.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lechuga Hevia | first = Carlos  | title = Cuba and the Missile Crisis | publisher = Ocean Press | year = 2001 | location = Melbourne, Australia | page = 142 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=aKLrYxcDg2wC | doi = | id = | isbn = 9781876175344}}</ref> Eisenhower's officials were not sure as to whether Castro was a communist, but hostile toward the Cubans' efforts to decrease their economic reliance on the United States.<ref name = "Smith 1998, 95">{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Joseph  | title = The Cold War 1945-1991 | publisher = Blackwell | year = 1998 | location = Oxford | page = 95 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FnnF9NKMJdkC | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780631191384}}</ref>

The [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and [[History of Germany since 1945|post<U+2013>World War II Germany]]. By the early 1950s, the [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement]] was emulated by most of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="dowty114">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}</ref> However, hundreds of thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] annually emigrated to [[West Germany]] through a "loophole" in the system that existed between East and West [[Berlin]], where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement.<ref name="harrison99">{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=99}}</ref>

Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy and his administration experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the [[Cuban Project]], devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961.

In February 1962, Khrushchev learned of the American plans regarding Cuba: a "Cuban project"{{mdash}}approved by the CIA and stipulating the overthrow of the Castro government in October, possibly involving the American military{{mdash}}and yet one more Kennedy-ordered operation to assassinate Castro.<ref name = "Zubok 1994, 158-159">Zubok, Vladislav M.

Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions, and ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and presented an ultimatum to the Soviets.

In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs.<ref name = "Karabell" /> From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with [[per capita]] [[GDP]]s approaching those of the United States, while [[Eastern Bloc economies|Eastern Bloc economies stagnated]].<ref name="Karabell" /><ref name="hardt16">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=16}}</ref>

As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212"/> Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems.<ref name="Karabell" /> During this period, Soviet leaders such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Alexei Kosygin]] embraced the notion of [[d<U+00E9>tente]].<ref name = "Karabell" />

===French NATO withdrawal===

The unity of NATO was breached early in its history, with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France from 1958 onwards. De Gaulle protested at the United States' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably [[French Algeria]], where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.<ref name=deGuaulle>{{Cite book

In September 1968, during a speech at the Fifth Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] one month after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Brezhnev outlined the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], in which he claimed the right to violate the sovereignty of any country attempting to replace Marxism-Leninism with capitalism.

{{quote|When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.}}

===Sino-American rapproachment===
{{Main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
[[Image:Nixon Mao 1972-02-29.png|thumb|[[Richard Nixon]] meets with [[Mao Zedong]] in 1972.]]
As a result of the [[Sino<U+2013>Soviet split]], tensions along the Chinese<U+2013>Soviet border [[Sino<U+2013>Soviet border conflict|reached their peak]] in 1969, and United States President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War.<ref>Dallek, Robert (2007), p. 144.</ref> The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.

In February 1972, Nixon announced a stunning rapprochement with Mao's China<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=149<U+2013>152}}</ref> by traveling to Beijing and meeting with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]]. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the [[Vietnam War]] both weakened America's influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.<ref>Buchanan, pp. 168<U+2013>169</ref> Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.<ref name = "Palmowski" />

These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.<ref name = "Karabell" />

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established the groundbreaking new policy of ''[[d<U+00E9>tente]]'' (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures.<ref name = "LaFeber 1991" />
Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties,<ref name = "LaFeber 1991" /> including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, ''d<U+00E9>tente'' would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually.<ref name="bbc-nb"/>

Meanwhile, these developments coincided with the "[[Ostpolitik]]" of West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]].<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 154"/> Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the [[Helsinki Accords]] signed at the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=188}}</ref>

===Late 1970s deterioration of relations===

The term ''second Cold War'' has been used by some historians to refer to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militaristic.<ref name = "Halliday" />

===War in Afghanistan===

During December 1979, approximately 75,000 Soviet troops [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded]] Afghanistan in order to support the Marxist government formed by ex-Prime-minister [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], assassinated that September by one of his party rivals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=210}}</ref>

In a post-Afghan War interview conducted by French weekly newsmagazine ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] stated that the president had already signed a directive to provide aid to the anti-communist [[mujahideen]] insurgency against the pro-Soviet [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]] government of Afghanistan in July, some six months prior to the Soviet military intervention.<ref name = "Maley 2002, 78">Maley, William (2002).

Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] treaty from the [[United States Senate|Senate]], imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would boycott the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow Summer Olympics]].

In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, [[Ronald Reagan]] bluntly stated, in a conversation with [[Richard V. Allen]], his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," he said. "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?"<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7398 The Man Who Won the Cold War, by [[Richard V.

Despite anti-American sentiment in Iran as a result of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] against the pro-American shah and an accompanying breakdown in relations with the new [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] government over the [[Iran hostage crisis]], the Reagan administration reached out to the anti-communist Khomeini in an effort to recruit the theocracy into the American camp in the early 1980s. Then-CIA director [[William J. Casey|William Casey]] described the Khomeini government as "faltering and [possibly] moving toward a moment of truth...

Moscow had built up a military that consumed as much as 25&nbsp;percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product at the expense of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and investment in civilian sectors.<ref name="LaFeber 2002, p. 332">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=332}}</ref> Soviet spending on the [[arms race]] and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least [[Era of Stagnation|a decade of economic stagnation]] during the late Brezhnev years.

Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of [[nomenklatura|massive party and state bureaucracies]] dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=335}}</ref> The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their [[military-industrial complex|military<U+2013>industrial base]].<ref name = "Odom">{{Harvnb|Odom|2000|p=1}}</ref> However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas{{Which?|date=May 2011}} where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West.<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=340}}</ref>

By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military.

Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions.

By the time the comparatively youthful [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] in 1985,<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 197"/> the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.<ref name="LaFeber331" /> These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.<ref name="LaFeber331">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|pp=331<U+2013>333}}</ref>

An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called ''[[perestroika]]'', or restructuring.<ref name="Gaddis231">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=231<U+2013>233}}</ref> Perestroika relaxed the [[production quota]] system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.<ref name="Gaddis231" />

Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West.<ref name="Palmowski" /><ref name="LaFeber2002">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|pp=300<U+2013>340}}</ref> Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced ''[[glasnost]]'', or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=7}}</ref> ''Glasnost'' was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]] and moderate the abuse of power in the [[Central Committee]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=33}}</ref> Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating [[d<U+00E9>tente]] between the two nations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=61}}</ref>

===Thaw in relations===

In response to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race.<ref name="Gaddis229">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=229<U+2013>230}}</ref> The first was held in November 1985 in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]].<ref name="Gaddis229" /> At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50&nbsp;percent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/21/newsid_2549000/2549897.stm 1985: "Superpowers aim for 'safer world'"], BBC News, November 21, 1985.

East<U+2013>West tensions rapidly subsided through the mid-to-late 1980s, culminating with the final summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the [[START I]] arms control treaty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=255}}</ref> During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain.<ref name="Shearman76"/> In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets [[Sinatra Doctrine|officially declared]] that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Gaddis248">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=248}}</ref>

In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan<ref name="Gaddis 2005, pp. 235<U+2013>236">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=235<U+2013>236}}</ref> and by 1990 Gorbachev [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|consented]] to [[German reunification]],<ref name="Shearman76">{{Harvnb|Shearman|1995|p=76}}</ref> the only alternative being a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen]] scenario.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shearman|1995|p=74}}</ref> When the Berlin Wall came down, Gorbachev's "[[Common European Home]]" concept began to take shape.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=11160| title=Address given by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Council of Europe| publisher=[[European NAvigator|Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe]]| date=1989-07-06| accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the Communist leaders of the [[Warsaw Pact]] states were losing power.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, pp. 235<U+2013>236"/> In the USSR itself, ''glasnost'' weakened the bonds that held the Soviet Union together<ref name="Gaddis248" /> and by February 1990, with the dissolution of the USSR looming, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sakwa|1999|p=460}}</ref>

At the same time freedom of press and dissent allowed by ''glasnost'' and the festering "nationalities question" increasingly led the Union's component republics to declare their autonomy from Moscow, with the [[Baltic states]] withdrawing from the Union entirely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=253}}</ref> The [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 revolutionary wave]] that swept across Central and Eastern Europe overthrew the Soviet-style communist states, such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lefeber|Fitzmaurice|Vierdag|1991|p=221}}</ref> Romania being the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=247}}</ref>

Gorbachev's permissive attitude toward Eastern Europe did not initially extend to Soviet territory; even Bush, who strove to maintain friendly relations, condemned the January 1991 killings in [[January 1991 events in Latvia|Latvia]] and [[January Events|Lithuania]], privately warning that economic ties would be frozen if the violence continued.<ref>Goldgeier, p. 27</ref> The USSR was fatally weakened by a [[1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|failed coup]] and a growing number of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], particularly [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], who threatened to secede from the USSR. The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], created on December 21, 1991, is viewed as a successor entity to the [[Soviet Union]] but, according to Russia's leaders, its purpose was to "allow a civilized divorce" between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]] and is comparable to a loose [[confederation]].<ref>[http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/14b6b499-9eb2-4dee-b96c-784ec918969a.html Soviet Leaders Recall <U+2018>Inevitable<U+2019> Breakup Of Soviet Union], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], December 8, 2006.

Following the Cold War, Russia cut military spending dramatically, creating a wrenching adjustment as the military-industrial sector had previously employed one of every five Soviet adults,<ref name = "Aslund"><U+00C5>slund, p. 49</ref> meaning its dismantling left millions throughout the former Soviet Union unemployed.<ref name="Aslund" /> After Russia embarked on capitalist economic reforms in the 1990s, it suffered [[1998 Russian financial crisis|a financial crisis]] and a recession more severe than the US and Germany had experienced during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name = "Nolan">Nolan, pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref> Russian living standards have worsened overall in the post<U+2013>Cold War years, although the economy has resumed growth since 1999.<ref name="Nolan" />

Military expenditures by the US during the Cold War years were estimated to have been $8&nbsp;trillion, while nearly 100,000&nbsp;Americans lost their lives in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=1}}</ref> Although the loss of life among Soviet soldiers is difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was far higher than that incurred by the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=213}}</ref>

In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' [[proxy war]]s around the globe, most notably in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=266}}</ref> Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post<U+2013>Cold War years.<ref name = "Marshall">[http://www.systemicpeace.org/PC2005.pdf Monty G.

The aftermath of Cold War conflict, however, is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.<ref name="Halliday" /> The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by Communist governments has produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia.<ref name = "Halliday" /> In Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and a large increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].<ref name = "Halliday" />

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography of the Cold War}}
As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.<ref name = "Nashel">{{cite encyclopedia|author= Nashel, Jonathan|editor=Whiteclay Chambers, John|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to American Military History|title=Cold War (1945<U+2013>91): Changing Interpretations (entire chapter)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xtMKHgAACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+American+Military+History|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195071980|ref= harv}}</ref> In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet<U+2013>US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.<ref name="Brinkley">Brinkley, pp. 798<U+2013>799</ref> Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.<ref name = "Halliday" />

Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism", and "post-revisionism".<ref name = "Calhoun" />

"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion into Eastern Europe.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.<ref name = "Byrd" />
