'''''Dishonored''''' is a 2012 [[Stealth game|stealth]] [[Action-adventure game|action adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. It was released worldwide in October 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], beginning in North America on October 9.

Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, ''Dishonored'' follows Corvo Attano, the Empress's legendary bodyguard. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin to seek revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists, a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider, a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors provide voice work for the game, including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Billy Lush]], [[Lena Headey]] and [[Chlo<U+00EB> Grace Moretz]].

The game is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are modified based on violent actions, or lack thereof, committed by the player. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.

''Dishonored'' received generally positive reviews, focusing on the individual narrative of the missions and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and issues with controlling the player's character. Following its release, the game won the 2012 [[Spike Video Game Awards|Spike Video Game]] award for Best Action-Adventure Game, and was repeatedly recognized both as the best action-adventure game and one of the best overall games of 2012.

==Gameplay==
''Dishonored'' is played in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective,<ref name="RevVerge"/> with an emphasis placed on [[Stealth game|stealth]] action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces.<ref name="BethBlog1"/> The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused sandboxes designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers.<ref name="BethBlog1"/><ref name="Openworld"/> Between missions the player is taken to a central hub; the Hound Pits pub.<ref name="BethBlog1"/> In the pub Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings, alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades.<ref name="Gameplay70"/> In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse.<ref name="Gameworld"/> The game features the ability for the player to save anywhere and also includes a checkpoint save system. Both methods are disabled during combat. There are four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of [[Health (gaming)|health]] and mana potions, as well as enemy awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. The easy difficulty also enables health regeneration.<ref name="BethBlog2"/>

''Dishonored'' features [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] elements such as the ability to upgrade powers and moral choices with focus on non-linear consequences.<ref name="Gameplay50"/> The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any [[non-player character]] (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] involved the player completing a side mission for a character which was rewarded with the mission targets being kidnapped and enslaved in a mine.<ref name="Gameplay5"/> Each mission contains multiple avenues of exploration and reaching targets, with traversal and exploration of levels designed to support the array of abilities at the player's disposal, rather than specific paths that are aimed towards a particular gameplay style such as hacking or sneaking.<ref name="Powers1"/> Specific elements of missions are also randomised such as altering the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission, requiring the player to explore the game area to locate the intended target each time the mission is played.<ref name="GameRandom"/>

Actions committed by the player are not judged to be of a good or evil morality, but instead are tracked by a "chaos" system that records how much collateral damage, violent actions and deaths are caused by the player. The game world is modified by how little or much damage is caused, affecting story decisions while not punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another.<ref name="Gameplay5"/><ref name="Powers1"/><ref name="Gameplay1"/> For example, a NPC who disapproves of violent methods may not support the player and may even betray them.<ref name="Setting3"/> The game reacts to the chaos caused in both scripted ways, such as dialog, and dynamic ways, such as increasing the presence of rats and plagued citizens, and adding new scenes, and can affect the active mission and future ones.<ref name="Openworld"/> The system also influences the two game endings obtainable, with variations based on which characters live or die.<ref name="Gameplay40"/> Playing violently can allow missions to be completed in less time than a stealth approach, but will consume more resources such as health and mana potions, which are required more often in direct combat.<ref name="Gameplay5"/><ref name="Gameplay1"/>

===Abilities and powers===
[[File:Dishonored Video Game - Gameplay.ogv|thumb|300px|Gameplay emphasizes combining different abilities to overcome or bypass obstacles. The player summons rats, slows time so that they can attach a weapon to a rat and then possess that specific rat, before walking it to the enemy, killing them. (0:39)|alt=Video sample of the game]]
The game features six active powers, four passive powers, or ''enhancements'', and forty ''bone charms'', which grant the player supernatural perks such as increasing the duration of rat possession.<ref name="Gameplay40"/><ref name="Gameplay12"/> Initially, only three bone charms can be active at any time.<ref name="PowerSK"/> Smith and Colantonio stated that it is impossible for a player to accrue all of the powers and abilities in a single playthrough.<ref name="Gameplay12"/> Mana is necessary to use the abilities and only partially regenerates after use, enough to allow the use of powers like "Blink" and "Dark Vision", but mana potions are required to recover larger amounts of mana, restricting the use of higher cost abilities like "Possession" and "Bend Time".<ref name="Gameplay12"/> Magic and ranged weapons are assigned to the player character's left hand and a sword to the right hand.<ref name="Setting3"/>

The main supernatural powers are unlocked and purchased using ''runes'', and each can be upgraded.<ref name="Gameworld"/><ref name="Gameplay40"/> Powers include: "Dark Vision", which allows the player to see enemies through walls, their field of view and an abstract representation of sound made by the player;<ref name="BethBlog2"/> "Blink", a short-distance teleportation ability;<ref name="AccoE32012K"/> "Possession", that allows the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters from rats and fish to humans;<ref name="Gameworld"/> "Devouring Swarm", which summons a swarm of deadly rats; "Bend Time", that slows or freezes time;<ref name="Gameworld"/> "Wind Blast", a gust of wind that can knock down enemies;<ref name="RevTelegraph"/> and "Shadow Kill" that turns dead enemies to ash preventing their discovery.<ref name="PowerSK"/> The player also has access to weaponry including a sword, grenades, crossbow and pistols.<ref name="Weapons"/> Coins must be collected to upgrade weapons and gadgets.<ref name="Gameplay40"/>

Stealth is based on occlusion, hiding behind objects and architecture and avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, with lighting also a factor in player visibility. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to view the immediate area and eavesdrop, and as long as Corvo remains hidden, enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms.<ref name="BethBlog2"/>

Guards have several states of alertness ranging from normal, to suspicious, aware of the player's presence and then actively searching for the player.  Enemy [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) will respond to sound and can be distracted by the player creating a sound in one place to lure a guard away from their position.<ref name="BethBlog3"/> Remaining concealed from guards eventually reduces the alertness to aware, but it will not return to normal in that particular mission. Enemies communicate their alertness state to their allies, in turn increasing their alertness level.<ref name="BethBlog4"/>

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Dishonored'' takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, which is modeled after late 1800s to early 1900s [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The city is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter. In the city, technology and otherworldly forces coexist. Dunwall is a center for fishing and whaling, with whale oil a valuable resource necessary for powering the city.<ref name=reled/><ref name="Setting1"/><ref name="Setting2"/><ref name="Cast4"/><ref name="RevCVG"/> Following philosopher Esmond Roseburrow's discovery of whale oil's use as a fuel<U+2014>known in the city as trans<U+2014>the government used it to develop powerful weaponry which in turn bred government corruption.<ref name="SettingOil"/> The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats and dogs that is killing the poor and isolating the rich.

The main character of ''Dishonored'' is Corvo Attano, the legendary former bodyguard to Dunwall's Empress Jessamine Kaldwin ([[April Stewart]]).<ref name="CastList"/> He becomes an infamous assassin after he is framed for her murder. Corvo is skilled in stealth and combat, armed with unusual gadgets, and possesses great supernatural powers.<ref name="Gameplay1"/><ref name="CastCorvo"/><ref name="CastCorvo2"/> The game designers chose not to have Corvo speak so that the player can project themselves onto the character.<ref name="CastCorvo"/> Characters also include: Admiral Havelock ([[John Slattery]]), the Loyalist leader and ally to Corvo;<ref name="RevCVG"/> Piero Joplin ([[Brad Dourif]]), an inventor who builds Corvo's mask and supplies him with gadgets; Callista Curnow ([[Lena Headey]]) the caretaker for the Empress' daughter Young Lady Emily ([[Chlo<U+00EB> Grace Moretz]]); Granny Rags ([[Susan Sarandon]]), a former aristocrat now blind and deranged after years of living on the streets; Daud ([[Michael Madsen]]), leader of a group of assassins known as "the Whalers";<ref name="Cast"/><ref name="Cast2"/><ref name="DLC2"/> Treavor Pendleton (Derek Phillips), a member of parliament; Samuel (Ryan Cutrano), a commoner who ferries Corvo to and from his missions; Overseer Teague Martin (Joel Johnstone); and Slackjaw (Al Rodrigo), a gang leader.<ref name="CastList"/> [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Gregg Berger]] provide the voice of the loudspeakers found throughout the city relaying government propaganda.<ref name="Cast"/><ref name="CastList"/><ref name="Cast2"/>

Corvo is offered aid in his quest by the Outsider ([[Billy Lush]]), described as a mixture of [[God]] and the [[Devil]], who imprints his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities,<ref name="Cast4"/> and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart)<ref name="CastList"/> that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark to other characters, granting each different abilities.<ref name="BethBlog3"/> Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how to use them up to the recipient.<ref name="Development50"/>

Corvo's targets include: the Lord Regent Hiram Burrows ([[Kristoffer Tabori]]), the Empress' former spymaster who masterminded her death and framed Corvo, and now controls Dunwall;<ref name="CastList"/><ref name="CastCorvo"/> his lover Lady Boyle ([[Anna Graves]]), an aristocrat funding the military;<ref name="CastList"/><ref name="CastBoyle"/><ref name="CastBoyle2"/><ref name="CastBoyle3"/> the Pendleton Twins, Lords Custis and Morgan (Zach Hanks), members of parliament;<ref name="CastList"/><ref name="CastPendleton"/> High Overseer Campbell ([[Daniel Hagen]]), leader of the city's religious order;<ref name="CastList"/> and Anton Sokolov ([[Roger L.

===Plot===
After returning from a foreign voyage to seek aid with the deadly plague ravaging the city, Corvo Attano travels to the tower of Dunwall and meets with the Empress. After delivering the message, they are attacked by teleporting assassins, led by Daud, who magically restrain Corvo, kill the Empress, and kidnap her daughter Emily. The Empress' Spymaster arrives and has Corvo imprisoned for her murder and Emily's abduction. Six months later, the Spymaster has seized control of Dunwall as Lord Regent. He tells Corvo that he masterminded the assassination and has framed Corvo. Corvo is to be executed the following day. In his cell, Corvo is smuggled a letter from Empire Loyalists and given the means to escape. Following his escape he is ferried to the Hound Pits pub by Samuel to meet the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock.

While resting at the pub, Corvo is taken to a dream world where he meets the Outsider and is branded with his mark. Corvo is sent to eliminate the conspirators behind the Lord Regent's plot and the player is given the option of killing or otherwise neutralizing Corvo's targets. His first target is High Overseer Campbell. During the mission, he meets Granny Rags, and Slackjaw. Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers Emily's location in the Golden Cat, a brothel, under the care of Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers. After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov, responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful technologies. Sokolov is returned to the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent's financier, Lady Boyle. Corvo infiltrates Boyle's masquerade ball and, after deducing which of the three sisters is the Lord Regent's mistress, disposes of her.

After returning to the pub, Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move on the Lord Regent himself. Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power and, in the process, learns that the Lord Regent had intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society, though things quickly got out of hand. Corvo returns to the Hound Pits pub where the Loyalists celebrate their success. After sharing a drink, Corvo goes to his room and collapses. He wakes to learn Havelock and his Loyalist allies Treavor Pendleton and Teague Martin had Samuel poison Corvo's drink to prevent him interfering in their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her. Samuel, however, remains loyal to Corvo and had given him a lowered dose of poison, allowing Corvo to survive. Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river before fleeing himself. Corvo awakes as the prisoner of the assassin Daud and his men, the people who carried out the Empress' assassination, and who intend to claim the bounty put on his head by the now Lord Regent Havelock.

Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins, before traveling through his territory and into the sewers. There he finds Granny Rags attempting to cook Slackjaw. Corvo can eliminate either Slackjaw or Granny Rags, who is revealed to be Vera Moray, a witch. Corvo finally returns to the pub to find it overrun with guards and many of the Loyalists dead at Havelock's hand. He discovers where Havelock has taken Emily, and can save Piero, Sokolov and Calista. Corvo signals to Samuel who ferries him to the former Lord Regent's lighthouse. He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that Havelock, to ensure the Loyalists' actions are never known, has already killed them. Once finished with Havelock, Corvo may or may not rescue Emily. Reading Havelock's journal reveals the Lord Regent's suspicion that Emily is Corvo's daughter; an idea supported by an optionally found drawing by Emily of Corvo, labeled "Daddy".

The ending is dictated by the level of chaos the player caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves Emily, she takes her place on the throne as Empress, with Corvo at her side. If chaos is low, a golden age dawns as the plague is finally overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes and is buried beside Empress Jessamine, by Empress Emily Kaldwin I the Wise. If chaos is high, the city remains in turmoil and overrun with the plague. If Corvo does not manage to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship.

==Development==
[[Image:Harvey Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Deus Ex]]'' designer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] served as one of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s two creative directors.]]

The game was first announced on July 7, 2011, by Bethesda Softworks as a first-person stealth action adventure game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. ''Dishonored'' is the first [[Arkane Studios]] game to be published by Bethesda following its purchase by Bethesda parent [[ZeniMax Media]] in August 2010. Arkane Studios founder Rapha<U+00EB>l Colantonio and ''[[Deus Ex]]'' developer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] act as the game's creative directors,<ref name="Development10"/> and ''Deus Ex'' designer Ricardo Bare acts as Lead Designer.<ref name="Development11"/> ''[[Half Life 2]]''{{'s}} [[City 17]] designer, visual design director Viktor Antonov and art director Sebastien Mitton lead the art team.<ref name="Development10"/><ref name="Development1"/><ref name="Gameplay13"/> Smith, Colantonio, Antonov and Mitton spent three years in pre-production. Bethesda first approached Arkane and asked them to develop a new game and develop a new intellectual property. The team already had ideas in place for a similar type of game, but specifics did not form until Bethesda approached the studio.<ref name="Development201"/> Mitton contacted Antonov in May 2009, asking for his help in establishing an artistic identity for a new intellectual property.<ref name="Gameplay13"/> The full Arkane team including their offices in Lyon, France, and Austin, Texas worked on the game.<ref name="BethBlog1"/>

The game supports a separate interface for Microsoft Windows users compared to console versions and the use of Xbox 360 controllers for PC. Smith described the team philosophy of allowing those passionate about a particular release platform to develop towards it, so those passionate about PC work on the interface, while Xbox 360 fans are allowed to develop the [[Achievement (Xbox_360)#Gamerscore|Achievements for that platform]].<ref name="Openworld"/><ref name="Interface"/> ''Dishonored'' officially went [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing .28RTM.29|gold]] on September 28, 2012.<ref name="DevGold"/><ref name="DevGold2"/>

===Gameplay===
The development was influenced by methods that the team discovered to exploit each player ability or tool, such as combining a high jump with a teleport ability to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently. Instead of restricting these exploits, the team tried to design levels to accommodate them.<ref name="Setting3"/><ref name="Development50"/> However, not all of the power ideas were considered suitable for the game, including a power that would turn the player into a two-dimensional shadow that could move along walls.<ref name="Gameplay40"/> Balancing the effectiveness of the player's powers was considered difficult, with Colantonio stating "we wanted to give [the player] very strong powers, to make [the player] really a badass, but at the same time we didn't want the game to be too easy." Each power is given a duration, mana cost, and other tunable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most destructive of abilities by making it too costly to frequently use or limiting how long it remains active.<ref name="Powers1"/>

''Dishonored''{{'}}s stealth system was originally based on the ''[[Thief (series)|Thief]]'' series and its use of level lighting and shadows to determine how an enemy can detect the player. However, it was decided that it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the efforts placed into the level designs and ultimately contrasted poorly with well-lit areas.<ref name="Developemtn100"/> Much of the ambient dialog was written to be lengthy and add background to the world, to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialog was written to be shorter to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the speaking character.<ref name="DesignGrossman"/>

The missions were designed based on an initial interesting idea which would then be populated with interesting things for the player to do. Paths are defined to access the target areas and ideal paths developed and then expanded. The area was then populated with NPCs which are assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level using their abilities and powers to test if the area provided a challenge or a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed.<ref name="Development50"/> The levels initially featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to move through the level as they choose, but testing showed that players would become lost or obey NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. This resulted in the introduction of more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players.<ref name="Development201"/> Discussing the game violence and consequence of the game's freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted an experience of watching a tester play the Boyle Estate level, a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; he determined that not killing the NPCs was the greater option as it opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every character in the level from guards to cowering servants, which Houston found disconcerting.<ref name="DevHouston"/>

===Design===
The art team continued to get requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production until the end of the development cycle. Each design was hand drawn instead of procedurally reproduced. The city of Dunwall, designed to be a "contemporary and cool" "period piece", is inspired by late 1800 to early 1900s London and Edinburgh, and in its earliest stages of development the game was set to take place in seventeenth century London.<ref name="Gameplay30"/> Describing why London had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration, Smith explained:

{{quote|Because it was the last year of [[Great Plague of London|the plague]], and the year of the [[Great Fire of London|great fire of London]], which of course ended the plague by burning the slums down... In this kind of game you<U+2019>re always looking for a way to up the tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren<U+2019>t giant crowds of people at the market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, and we were talking independently about possession, and we wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don<U+2019>t have to hide them. All these pieces just worked together.<ref name="Development50"/>}}

[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|left|Seventeenth century London, afflicted by the Great Plague and the Great Fire, served as inspiration for the fictional city of Dunwall.]]
Antonov described his inspiration from London as "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense...and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". Antonov highlighted the importance of that familiarity to different cultures because "you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction". He explained that Edinburgh alternatively provided a sense of containment and variety of architectural designs. These historical designs were then combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov clarified was not comparable to the brass, rivets and steam of [[steampunk]] design.<ref name="Gameplay13"/> Some elements of the world design are derived from the fictional alternate industrial revolution in the game, and others are deliberately impressionistic.<ref name="BethBlog1"/> Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh as part of their research, taking photos of people, places and objects. The pair chose to avoid the busier streets and focus on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint...if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?".<ref name="Design50"/> The world map was designed in as a single piece of art and then sectioned so that the designers were clear on where each mission took place.<ref name="CastCorvo"/>

In-game characters were stylized in a manner inspired by illustrations from old adventure and pirate stories such as ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' (1922), but maintaining a sense of realism and political incorrectness.<ref name="Gameplay13"/> An anatomy expert helped ensure the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of character faces represented Great Britain.<ref name="Gameplay30"/> Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.<ref name="Gameplay13"/>

[[File:Dishonored-Tallboy-Concept.jpg|thumb|Concept art of the Tallboy. Their tall mechanical legs were inspired by a stilt-wearing cleaner; as their role in the game changed, the legs remained until it was considered that their legs could allow them to fight the infected, while remaining safe from harm, resulting in their final role. The design also includes a whale-oil tank on the character's back for aesthetic reasons.]]
The Tallboys were conceived as [[town crier]]s, and were later given stilts after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office fa<U+00E7>ade while himself wearing stilts. This version of the Tallboy was replaced by the loudspeakers found throughout Dunwall.<ref name="DesignMitton"/> The Tallboy design evolved into a [[lamplighter]] that would light street lamps with whale-oil tanks, but further development considered that their tall mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with the plague infected citizens while remaining high above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow.<ref name="DesignMitton"/><ref name="EuroDisect"/> Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' back for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale-oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence while Corvo is in the city.<ref name="DesignMitton"/>

The Heart is a human heart modified by technology and the supernatural that serves as a means of navigating the player to collectable items in the levels, and "plays a part related to informing [the player's] decisions about when to apply violence or not, making it a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or history of a character, and even its own origins. The Heart was originally designed as a method of identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive with its own agenda. After player-testing, it was decided that a more direct navigation system was required. While the Heart's gameplay role continued to change, it continued to provide narration on its perception of different characters, which helped reinforce the narrative themes and differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialog. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that the optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.<ref name="DesignHeart"/>

The Hound Pit pub that acts as a base for the player was initially a larger structure, but filling out the interior of the pub required a lot of stairs, rooms and a large amount of climbing that made navigation confusing. The team found a challenge in retaining the larger exterior they desired while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse. The pub was reduced in size outside to resemble an [[Edwardian era]] style building, but the interior still remained too labyrinthine, so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quicker. Ultimately it was decided to simply close the third floor off entirely.<ref name="EuroDisect"/> One stage that had to be removed was a mental institution where Corvo would have faced crazed inmates who are sensitive to sound.<ref name="DesignMitton"/>

===Music===
[[Daniel Licht]] provides the game score<U+2014>an ambient, violin-heavy presentation designed to represent 19th century London.<ref name="MusicLicht"/> As part of the game's promotion, Bethesda employed Copilot Strategic Music + Sound to develop the ominous ''The Drunken Whaler'', a modified version of the sea shanty ''[[Drunken Sailor]]''.<ref name="MusicWhaler1"/> ''The Drunken Whaler'' appeared in the game's trailer and attracted positive during its presentation at 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3). Following its debut the trailer was watched over 850,000 times on YouTube, and it was awarded the [[Machinima]] Best Trailer award.<ref name="MusicWhaler2"/> Copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing the lyrics instead of a professional youth choir, aiming to achieve a dark, haunting quality to the music. However, they found it difficult to source children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats, and instead used child actors, adult singers who could imitate children, and the children of their friends.<ref name="MusicWhaler2"/> Instruments included violins, detuned and distorted guitars, and a "whaler stomp" achieved by the team stamping on wooden boards to create a pulse sound.<ref name="MusicWhaler2"/>

''Dishonored''{{'}}s plot received a polarized response with many reviewers praising the contained stories driving each mission, but criticizing the overarching narrative. [[IGN]]'s Cam Shea said it is "a shame that ''Dishonored'''s story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts" but insisted "''Dishonored'' is a game you'll talk with your friends about".<ref name="RevIGN"/> ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead, [[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]'s Arthur Gies, and [[Giant Bomb]]'s Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for generic missions, "late narrative missteps",<ref name="RevVerge"/> and ending abruptly.<ref name="RevEuroGame"/><ref name="RevGiantBomb"/> Whitehead also said that the unique, inventive and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. [[Joystiq]]'s Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, and the abrupt ending, but said that the overall experience had left him wanting more.<ref name="RevJoystiq"/>  In contrast, [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'s Susan Arendt considered that the story was well paced, and ''[[Shacknews]]''{{'}}s John Keefer said that it was emotionally immersive and "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but felt that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.<ref name="RevShack"/> Klepek also held issue with repetitive ambient dialog found in the missions.<ref name="RevGiantBomb"/> 

The gameplay was generally praised for the freedom given to players in how to complete objectives and explore the levels. Keefer appreciated that mechanics like the powers and equipment were not essential and did not detract from the story, serving as optional bonuses to levels that can be completed purely with creativity and cleverness.<ref name="RevShack"/> However, he noted that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance, leaving the player lost on how to proceed.<ref name="RevShack"/> Gies said the game can initially seem unstructured from a level-design perspective, but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player could take, allowing them to experiment instead of focusing on rigid objective-driven design.<ref name="RevVerge"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Chris Watters enjoyed the various pathways and methods of traversing each level with "compelling abilities", particularly the "Blink" power, and the freedom of choice which he said made ''Dishonored'' one of the truly remarkable games of [2012].<ref name="RevGameSpot"/> Arendt said that the depth of flexibility was also a shortcoming, with certain play styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded, preclude the desire for level exploration for further enhancements and resources.<ref name="RevEscapist"/> ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba also considered that the game punished players for taking a certain path, particularly one of violence, which resulted in harder gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending, encouraging stealth over alternatives.<ref name="RevGameInformer"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Jason Schreier contrasted ''Dishonored'' with other contemporary video games, stating that where other games may require a player to find the specific solution to defeating an enemy or solving a puzzle, ''Dishonored'' "feels like entering a designer's playpen", providing the player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with, or break, the world.<ref name="RevKotaku"/> 

Reviewers also noted the variety offered replayability; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''{{'}} Alex Dale praised the variety and replayability of the game saying "''Dishonored'' doesn't demand you see everything it has to offer, although it is compulsive enough to ensure you will".<ref name="RevCVG"/><ref name="RevCVG2"/> [[News.com.au|News.com.au's]] William Colvin considered that the only shortcoming of the game could be that it offered too many options,<ref name="RevNewscomau"/> and Watters said the game achieves a rare feat of being "compulsively replayable".<ref name="RevGameSpot"/> Issues were raised with how the player controlled Corvo, with Whitehead criticizing the controls as unresponsive when used in contextual situations. However, Sliwinski said that the controls worked well.<ref name="RevJoystiq"/> The AI received criticism from reviewers who found it inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his experience of enemies that could spot Corvo from a great distance, and yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in the enemies peripheral vision.<ref name="RevEuroGame"/> Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth focused players into a combat situation for which their character is not built.<ref name="RevGameInformer"/> [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]'s Jake Gaskill said that the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them.<ref name="RevG4TV"/> Watters also noted lulls in enemy intelligence but said that the it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.<ref name="RevGameSpot"/> 

The game's visuals and design were generally praised; Gaskill said that the art style was unique and the game world both vivid and fully realized, and Gies stated that the design "stands apart from its contemporaries as something different".<ref name="RevG4TV"/> Colvin described ''Dishonored'' as "a triumph for the medium" and said that it "sets the benchmark for visuals, story, and character performance, and that it is "easily the best looking game you'll play this year."<ref name="RevNewscomau"/> Juba said the "steampunk-inspired" technology designs were fascinating, and the overall visual style and art direction offered a distinct aesthetic that complimented the "dark and disturbing" lore found in the city.<ref name="RevGameInformer"/>

Reviewers likened ''Dishonored'' to well-received games from the early 2000s such as ''Deus Ex'' and the ''Thief'' video game series. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Tom Hoggins said it is like the "thinking man's games, [from] the turn of the century which cherished player choice and control", comparing it against contemporary "noisy, brash thrill-rides obsessed with military ooh-rah and barely interactive set pieces.<ref name="RevTelegraph"/> Dale called ''Dishonored'' "one of the greatest games of this generation", and considered that the game excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice. Dale also called it the first true stealth game "for a long while", and the closest comparison to ''Thief'' in the current generation of games.<ref name="RevCVG"/><ref name="RevCVG2"/> Schreier stated that the game featured the same "masterful world design" as the 2007 video game ''[[Bioshock]]''.<ref name="RevKotaku"/>
