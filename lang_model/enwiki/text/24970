The '''Quantock Hills''' are a range of [[hill]]s west of [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. The highest point on the Quantocks is [[Wills Neck]], at {{convert|1261|ft|m|0|lk=on}}.<ref name="curio">{{cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0906456983 |pages=41 }}</ref> The hills are officially designated as the Quantock Hills [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

The hills run from the [[Taunton Deane|Vale of Taunton Deane]] in the south, for about {{convert|15|mi|km|0|lk=on}} to the north-west, ending at East Quantoxhead and [[West Quantoxhead]] on the coast of the [[Bristol Channel]]. They form the western border of [[Sedgemoor]] and the [[Somerset Levels]]. From the top of the hills on a clear day, it is possible to see [[Glastonbury Tor]] and the [[Mendip Hills|Mendips]] to the east, [[Wales]] as far as the [[Gower peninsula]] to the north, the [[Brendon Hills]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Blackdown Hills]] to the south. Soil types and weather combine to support the hills' plants and animals. In 1970 an area of 6,194.5&nbsp;acres (2,506.9&nbsp;hectares) was designated as a [[Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name="SSSI">{{cite web | title=The Quantocks | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000310.pdf |  format=PDF | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> 

They have been occupied since prehistoric times with [[Bronze Age]] [[round barrow]]s  and [[Iron Age]] hill forts. Evidence from  [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times includes [[silver]] coins discovered in [[West Bagborough]]. In the later Saxon period, [[King Alfred]] led the resistance to [[Viking]] invasion, and [[Watchet]] was plundered by Danes in 987 and 997. The hills were fought over during the [[English Civil War]] and [[Monmouth rebellion]] but are now a peaceful area popular with tourists and walkers. They explore paths such as the [[Coleridge Way]] used by the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who lived in [[Nether Stowey]] from 1797 to 1799. 

== Etymology ==

The name first appears in [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] charters in around 880 AD as ''Cantuctun'' and two centuries later in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Cantoctona'' and ''Cantetone''. The name means ''settlement by a rim or circle of hills'';<ref name="dunning">{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=Robert|title=Somerset & Avon|publisher=John Bartholomew & Son Ltd|location=Edinburgh|date=1980|pages=123-124|isbn=0702883808}}</ref> ''Cantuc'' is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] for a rim or circle, and ''-ton'' or ''-tun'' is [[Old English language|Old English]] for a settlement. An alternative meaning is ''ridge of the Welshman'', probably referring to a Saxon tribe that fought a battle locally.<ref name="curio"/>

==Geology==
[[Image:Quantocksbeach.jpg|thumb|left|Beach at Quantock's Head. The wave cut platform is visible at low tide below the short "cliff" exposing the rock strata.]]
The Quantock Hills are largely formed by rocks of the [[Devonian]] period, which consist of sediments originally laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north-western areas older [[Early Devonian]] rocks known as Hangman Grits predominate<ref name="dunning"/> and can be seen in the exposed rock at [[West Quantoxhead]] quarry, which was worked for road building.<ref  name="waite">{{cite book |title=Portrait of the Quantocks |last=Waite |first=Vincent |year=1964 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0709111584 |pages= }}</ref> Further south there are newer [[Middle Devonian|Middle]] and [[Late Devonian]] rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates.<ref  name="waite"/> These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near [[Aisholt]]. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, is the only limestone cave in the Devonian limestone of North [[Devon]] and West Somerset.<ref  name="waite"/> The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger [[New Red Sandstone]] rocks of the [[Triassic]] period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/countryside/quantockhills/quantockhillsgeology.htm |title=Quantock Hills Geology |accessdate=2008-03-03 |work=Quantock Hills AONB }}</ref> These rocks were laid down in a shallow sea and often contain irregular masses or veins of [[gypsum]], which was mined on the foreshore at [[Watchet]].<ref  name="waite"/>

Several areas have outcrops of slates. Younger rocks of the [[Jurassic]] period can be found between [[St Audries]] and [[Kilve]]. This area falls within the [[Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI|Blue Anchor to Lilstock]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) and is considered to be of international geological importance. 

Kilve has the remains of a red-brick [[retort]] built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and [[Blue Lias|blue]], yellow and brown [[Early Jurassic|Lias]] embedded with [[fossils]]. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.<ref>{{cite web | title=Oil retort house  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265166 | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

At [[Blue Anchor]] the coloured [[alabaster]] found in the cliffs gave rise to the name of the colour "Watchet Blue".<ref name="curio">{{cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0906456983 |pages=41 }}</ref> The village has the only updraught brick [[kiln]] known to have survived in Somerset.

==Climate==
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], the Quantock Hills has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of [[England]]. The mean temperature is approximately 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and shows a [[season]]al and a [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and 2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (36&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the [[Azores]] often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.

[[Cumulus cloud|Cloud]] often forms inland, especially near hills, and acts to reduce sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600&nbsp;hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with [[Atlantic]] [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 31 to 35&nbsp;inch (800 to 900&nbsp;mm). About 8 to 15&nbsp;days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; winds are lightest from June to August. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.<ref>{{cite web | title=About south-west England | publisher=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-21}}</ref>

In 1970 an area of 6,194.5&nbsp;acres (2,506.9&nbsp;hectares) in the Quantocks was designated as a [[Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref name="SSSI"/> This a [[conservation designation]] denoting a [[protected area]] in the [[United Kingdom]], selected by [[Natural England]], for areas with particular landscape and ecological characteristics. It provides some protection from development, from other damage, and (since 2000) also from neglect, under the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].

===Flora===
[[Image:Quantockheather.jpg|thumb|left|The Northern Flank of Beacon Hill (Quantocks). In late summer the northern Quantocks are ablaze with Heather and Gorse. [[Minehead]] can be seen in the distance.]]
The hilltops are covered in heathland of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The western side of the Quantocks are steep [[Escarpment|scarp]] slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut [[combe]]s to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by [[Heather]] {''Calluna vulgaris''), with significant populations of  [[Cross-leaved Heath]] (''Erica tetralix''), [[Purple Moor-grass]] (''Molinia caerulea''), [[Bilberry]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus'') and [[Deschampsia|Wavy Hair-grass]] (''Deschampsia flexuosa''). Drier areas are covered with [[Bell Heather]] (''Erica cinerea''), [[Western Gorse]] (''Ulex gallii'') and [[Agrostis|Bristle Bent]] (''Agrostis curtisii''), while [[Bracken]] (''Pteridium aquilinum'') is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports [[Anagallis|Bog Pimpernel]] (''Anagallis tenella''). The woodland is generally Birch/Sessile Oak woodland, Valley Alder woodland and Ash/Wych Elm woodland, which support a rich [[lichen]] flora. [[Alfoxton]] Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen ''Tomasellia lectea'' is present.<ref name="SSSI"/>

===Fauna===

The various habitats, together with the wide range of slopes and aspects, provide ideal conditions
for a rich fauna. [[Amphibians]] such as the [[Palmate Newt]] (''Triturus helveticus''), [[Common Frog]] (''Rana
temporaris''), and [[Common Toad]] (''Bufu bufo'') are represented in the damper environments. Reptiles
present include Adder (''[[Vipera berus]]''), [[Grass Snake]] (''Natrix natrix''), [[Slow Worm]] (''Angula fragilis'') and [[Common Lizard]] (''Lacerta vivipara''). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, including the [[Grasshopper Warbler]] (''Locustella naevia''), [[Nightjar]] (''Caprimulgus europaeus''), [[Raven]] (''Corvus corax'') and the [[Pied Flycatcher]] (''Ficedula hypoleuca''). The Quantocks are also an important site for [[Red Deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''). Invertebrates of note include the [[Silver-washed Fritillary]] butterfly (''Argynnis paphia''), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: ''Thymalus limbatus'', ''Orchesia undulata'' and ''Rhinosimus ruficollis''.<ref name="SSSI"/>

== History ==

Evidence of activity in the Quantocks from prehistoric times includes finds of [[Mesolithic]] flints at [[North Petherton]] and [[Broomfield, Somerset|Broomfield]]<ref name="AoS">''The Archaeology of Somerset'', M.Aston & I.Burrow (eds)(1982) ISBN 0-86183-028-8</ref> and many [[Bronze Age]] [[round barrow]]s (marked on maps as ''[[tumulus]]'', plural ''tumuli''), such as Thorncombe Barrow above [[Bicknoller]]. Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the [[Triscombe]] Stone and the Long Stone above [[Holford]].  Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient [[ridgeway]]s.<ref  name="waite"/><ref name="dunning"/> A Bronze Age [[hill fort]], [[Norton Camp]], was built to the south at [[Norton Fitzwarren]], close to the centre of bronze making in [[Taunton]].

[[Image:Ruborough Camp Somerset Map.jpg|thumb|Earthworks at [[Ruborough]] Camp]]
[[Iron Age]] sites in the Quantocks include major hill forts at [[Dowsborough]] and [[Ruborough]], as well as several smaller earthwork enclosures, such as [[Trendle Ring]] and [[Plainsfield Camp]]. Ruborough near [[Broomfield, Somerset|Broomfield]] is on an easterly spur from the main Quantock ridge, with steep natural slopes to the north and south east. The fort is triangular in shape, with a single rampart and ditch (univallate), enclosing {{convert|4|acre|ha|1}}. A linear outer work about {{convert|131|yd|m|0}} away, parallel to the westerly rampart, encloses another 4&nbsp;acres. The name ''Ruborough'' comes from ''Rugan beorh'' or ''Ruwan-beorge'' meaning ''Rough Hill''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=10228 |title=Ruborough Camp, Broomfield |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=Somerset Historic Environment Record }}</ref> The Dowsborough fort has an oval shape, with a single rampart and ditch (''univallate'') following the contours of the hill top, enclosing an area of {{convert|7|acre|ha|1}}. The main entrance is to the east, towards [[Nether Stowey]], with a simpler opening to the north west, aligned with a ridgeway leading down to Holford. A [[Mountain pass|col]] to the south connects the hill to the main Stowey ridge, where a linear earthwork known as Dead Woman's Ditch cuts across the spur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=33306 |title=Dowsborough hillfort, Holford |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=Somerset Historic Environment Record }}</ref>

Little evidence exists of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influence on the Quantock region beyond isolated finds and hints of transient forts. A Roman port was at [[Combwich]], and it is possible that a [[Roman road]] ran from there to the Quantocks, because the names Nether Stowey and [[Over Stowey]] come from the Old English ''stan wey'', meaning ''stone way''.<ref name="curio">{{cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0906456983 |pages=41 }}</ref> In October 2001 a hoard of 4th-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[silver]] was discovered in [[West Bagborough]]. The 681&nbsp;coins included two [[denarii]] from the early 2nd century, and eight [[miliarense]] and 671&nbsp;[[siliqua]] dating to 337<U+2013>367&nbsp;AD. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Didius Julianus|Julian]] and derive from a range of mints including [[Arles]] and [[Lyon]]s in [[France]], [[Trier]] in [[Germany]] and [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/culturecommunity/museums/explore/thewestbagboroughhoardofromansilver/ |title=The West Bagborough hoard of Roman silver |accessdate=2007-10-07 |work=Somerset County Museums Service Collections }}</ref> The area remained under Romano-British [[Celt]]ic control until 681<U+2013>685&nbsp;AD, when [[Centwine of Wessex]] pushed west from the [[River Parrett]], conquered the Welsh [[Cadwaladr|King Cadwaladr]], and occupied the rest of Somerset north to the Bristol Channel.<ref name="ASC681">''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', [http://britannia.com/history/docs/676-99.html 676-99 AD]</ref>
Saxon rule was later consolidated under [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine]], who established a fort at Taunton in about 700&nbsp;AD.<ref name="VCH"> ''The Victoria History of the County of Somerset'', Vol 1 (1906) </ref>

The first documentary evidence of the village of [[Crowcombe]] is by [[<U+00C6>thelwulf of Wessex]] in 854, where it was spelt 'Cerawicombe'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonexmoor.co.uk/villages/crowcombe.htm |title=Crowcombe |accessdate=2007-11-17 |work=Whats on Exmoor }}</ref> At that time the manor belonged to [[Glastonbury Abbey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/cultureheritage/heritage/projects/eus/crowcombe/ |title=Crowcombe by Clare Gathercole |accessdate=2007-11-17 |work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey }}</ref> In the later Saxon period, [[King Alfred]] led the resistance to [[Viking]] invasion from [[Athelney]], south-east of the Quantocks.<ref name="waite"/> According to the [[Anglo-Saxon chronicle]], the early port at [[Watchet]] was plundered by Danes in 987 and 997.<ref name="somharbours">{{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=125<U+2013>137 }}</ref> Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or [[herepath]], so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The herepath has a characteristic form that is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation {{convert|66|ft|m|0|sing=on}} wide track between avenues of trees growing from [[hedge laying]] embankments. The herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past [[Battle of Cannington|Cannington Hill]] (fort) to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks along the line of the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to [[Triscombe]] Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred's base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the [[Brendon Hills]] and [[Exmoor]].<ref name="Gres">''Dumnonia and the Valley of the Parret'', Rev. W.H.P. Greswell (1922)</ref>

After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 [[William de Mohun]] was given land at [[Dunster]], Broomfield and [[Quantoxhead]], his son becoming [[William de Mohun of Dunster 1st Earl of Somerset]], while [[William Malet (Norman conquest)|William Malet]] received [[Enmore, Somerset|Enmore]].<ref name="waite"/> [[East Quantoxhead]] was given to the Luttrells (previously spelled de Luterel), who passed the manor down through descendants into the 20th century. A Luttell also became the [[Earl of Carhampton]] and acquired [[Dunster Castle]] in 1376, holding it until it became a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property in 1976. 

[[Stowey Castle]] at Nether Stowey was built in the 11th century. The castle is sited on a small isolated knoll, about {{convert|390|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} high. It consisted of a square [[keep]] (which may have been stone, or a wooden superstructure on stone foundations) and its defences and an outer and an inner [[Motte-and-bailey|bailey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quantockonline.co.uk/quantocks/villages/netherstowey/orientationleaflet_v2_2.pdf |title=Nether Stowey Castle orientation leaflet |accessdate=2008-03-11 |format=PDF |work=Quantock Online }}</ref> The mount is {{convert|29|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above the {{convert|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} wide ditch which itself is {{convert|7|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} deep.

[[Image:Dunstercastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dunster Castle]]]]
During the [[English Civil War]] Dunster was a Royalist stronghold under the command of Colonel Wyndham. Sir Francis Dodington of [[Dodington, Somerset|Dodington]] was a local commander. In November 1645 Parliamentary forces started a siege that lasted until an honourable surrender of the castle in April 1646. [[Cavalier|Royalist]] reinforcements for the siege of Dunster Castle were sent by sea to Watchet, but the tide was on the ebb, and a troop of [[Roundheads]] rode into the shadows and forced the ship to surrender. Thus a ship at sea was taken by a troop of horse.<ref name="curio">{{cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0906456983 |pages=41<U+2013>42 }}</ref> Dunster shared the fate of many other Royalist castles and had its defences demolished to prevent any further use against Parliament. Sir [[John Stawell]] of [[Cothelstone]] had raised a small force at this own expense to defend the King. When [[Taunton]] fell to parliamentary troops and was held by [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]], he attacked Stawell at [[Bishops Lydeard]] and imprisoned him. After the [[English Restoration|restoration]] [[Charles II]] conferred the title of [[Baron Stawell]] on Blake's son Ralph.<ref name="waite"/>

At the end of the [[Monmouth rebellion]] of [[1685]], (also known as the Pitchfork Rebellion), many participants were executed in the Quantocks. The rebellion was an attempt to overthrow the [[King of England]], [[James II of England|James II]], who became king when his elder brother, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], died on [[6 February]] [[1685]].  James II was unpopular because he was [[Roman Catholic]], and many people were opposed to a "[[papist]]" king.  [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]], claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II.<ref name="foard"/> The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth's forces at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] on [[6 July]] [[1685]].

[[Image:Crowcombechurch.jpg|thumb|[[Crowcombe]] Church]]
In 1724 the 14th-century spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe was damaged by a lightning strike. The top section of the spire was removed and is now planted in the churchyard,<ref>{{cite web | title=Remains of spire, in churchyard, 15&nbsp;metres East of chancel, Church of the Holy Ghost  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265089 | accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> and stone from the spire was used in the flooring of the church.

Norton Fitzwarren was the site of a boat lift on the now unused section of the [[Grand Western Canal]] from 1839 to 1867. A 300-person prisoner of war camp built here during [[World War II]] housed [[Italy|Italian]] prisoners from the [[Western Desert Campaign]] and German prisoners from the [[Battle of Normandy]].

==Footpaths==

Poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] lived in [[Nether Stowey]] in the Quantocks from 1797 to 1799. In his memory a footpath, The [[Coleridge Way]], was set up by the [[Exmoor]] park authorities. The {{convert|36|mi|km|0|sing=on|lk=on}} route begins in Nether Stowey and crosses the Quantocks, the Brendon Hills and Exmoor before finishing in [[Porlock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coleridgeway.co.uk/ | title= In the Footsteps of the Romantic Poet | work= The Coleridge Way | accessdate= 2007-07-15 }}</ref>

The [[Quantock Greenway]] is a [[trail|footpath]] that opened in 2001. The route of the path follows a figure of eight centred on [[Triscombe]]. The northern loop, taking in [[Crowcombe]] and [[Holford]], is {{convert|19|mi|km|0}} long, and the southern loop to [[Broomfield, Somerset|Broomfield]] extends for {{convert|18|mi|km|0}}. The path travels through many types of landscape, including deciduous and coniferous woodland, private parkland, grazed pasture and cropped fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkingpages.co.uk/trails_paths/LDP_quantockgreenway.htm |title=Quantock Greenway |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=Walking pages }}</ref>

==Governance==

The Quantock Hills were designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/countryside/quantockhills/|title=Welcome to the Quantock Hills AONB Service Website|work=Quantock Hills AONB|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref> As they have the same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the [[national parks of England and Wales]]. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the [[national park]]s. Unlike AONBs, national parks have their own authorities and special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, few statutory duties are imposed on local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].

Many of the villages on the Quantocks have their own [[parish council]]s, which have some responsibility for local issues. They also elect councillors to [[Somerset|Somerset County Council]] and district councils, such as [[Taunton Deane]], [[West Somerset]] and [[Sedgemoor]]. Each of the villages is also part of a parliamentary constituency: [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]], [[Yeovil (UK Parliament constituency)|Yeovil]], or [[Bridgwater (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgwater]]. The area is also part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)]] of the European Parliament.

Poet [[William Wordsworth]] and his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth|Dorothy]] lived at [[Alfoxton House]] in [[Holford]] between July 1797 and June 1798,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265135 |title=Alfoxton Park Hotel |accessdate=2008-03-09 |work=Images of England }}</ref> during the time of their friendship with Coleridge. The 2000 film ''[[Pandaemonium (film)|Pandaemonium]]'', based on the lives of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was set in the hills.

[[Virginia Woolf|Virginia]] and [[Leonard Woolf]] spent a few days of their honeymoon at The Plough Inn, Holford, before continuing to the continent in 1912.  They returned about a year later to try to help Virginia recover from one of her recurring nervous breakdowns. 

The opening of [[John le Carr<U+00E9>]]'s 1974 novel ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]'' is set in the Quantocks. The 1980 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Shada]]" makes a sidelong reference to this region &ndash; the [[Fourth Doctor]] (played by [[Tom Baker]]) claims that walking through the Time Vortex "is a little trick I learned from a space-time mystic in the Quantocks". In the 1980s and 1990s, English novelist [[Ruth Elwin Harris]] wrote her ''Quantock Quartet'', a set of novels centred on four sisters growing up around the Quantock Hills during the early 20th&nbsp;century. The novels were later reprinted by [[Candlewick Press]]. The Quantocks were also the setting for the final episode of the third series (2006) of ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]''.

==Places of interest==

In the small village of [[Aley, Somerset|Aley]] is [[Quantock Lodge]], a green-grey 19th-century mansion built from [[cockercombe tuff]]. It was the family home of [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton]], until the 1960s when it was converted into a school. In 2000, it became a centre for recreation and banqueting and summer camps for youths.

[[Broomfield, Somerset|Broomfield]] is home to [[Fyne Court]]. Originally the pleasure grounds of pioneer 19th-century electrician, [[Andrew Crosse]], it is now a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-owned [[nature reserve]] and [[visitor centre]].
