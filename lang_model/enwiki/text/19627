'''Alpha''' (uppercase '''<U+0391>''', lowercase '''<U+03B1>'''; {{lang-el|<U+0386><U+03BB><U+03C6><U+03B1>}} ''<U+00C1>lpha'') is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 1. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Aleph (letter)|aleph]] [[Image:phoenician aleph.svg|20px|Aleph]]. Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin [[A]] and the Cyrillic letter [[A (Cyrillic)|<U+0410>]].

In English, the noun "alpha" is used as a synonym for "beginning", or "first" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alpha</ref>

==Uses==

===Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], alpha was pronounced {{IPAblink|a}} when short and {{IPAblink|a<U+02D0>}} when long. Where there is ambiguity, long and short alpha are sometimes written with a macron and breve today: <U+1FB9><U+1FB1>, <U+1FB8><U+1FB0>.
*[[wikt:<U+1F65><U+03C1><U+03B1>#Ancient Greek|<U+1F65><U+03C1><U+03B1>]] = <U+1F65><U+03C1><U+1FB1> ''h<U+014D>r<U+0101>'' {{IPA-el|h<U+0254><U+030C><U+02D0>ra<U+02D0>|}} "a time"
*[[wikt:<U+03B3><U+03BB><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1>#Ancient Greek|<U+03B3><U+03BB><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1>]] = <U+03B3><U+03BB><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+1FB0> ''gl<U+00F4>ssa'' {{IPA-el|<U+0261>l<U+0254><U+0302><U+02D0>ssa|}} "tongue"

In [[Modern Greek]], [[vowel length]] has been lost, and all instances of alpha represent the short {{IPA-el|a|}}.

In the [[polytonic Greek|polytonic]] orthography of Greek, alpha, like other vowel letters, can occur with several diacritic marks: any of three accent symbols ({{lang|grc|<U+03AC>, <U+1F70>, <U+1FB6>}}), and either of two breathing marks ({{lang|grc|<U+1F01>, <U+1F00>}}), as well as combinations of these. It can also combine with the [[iota subscript]] ({{lang|grc|<U+1FB3>}}).

====Greek grammar====
In the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]-[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha {{IPAblink|a<U+02D0>}} fronted to {{IPAblink|<U+025B><U+02D0>}} ([[eta]]). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after [[epsilon]], [[iota]], and [[rho]] (<U+03B5>, <U+03B9>, <U+03C1>; ''e'', ''i'', ''r''). In [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], long alpha is preserved in all positions.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek grammar for colleges''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#30 paragraph 30] and [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_notes.htm#30D note].</ref>

[[Privative a]] is the [[Ancient Greek]] prefix <U+1F00>- or <U+1F00><U+03BD>- ''a-'', ''an-'', added to words to negate them. It originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''{{PIE|n<U+0325>-}}'' ([[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] nasal) and is [[cognate]] with English ''un-''.

[[Copulative a]] is the Greek prefix <U+1F01>- or <U+1F00>- ''ha-'', ''a-''. It comes from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|sm&#805;}}''.

===Math and science===
{{main|Alpha (disambiguation)}}
The letter alpha represents various concepts in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], including [[alpha radiation]], [[angular acceleration]], [[alpha particle]]s, [[alpha carbon]] and strength of [[electromagnetic interaction]] (as [[Fine-structure constant]]). Alpha also stands for [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of a [[Chemical compound|compound]] in [[physical chemistry]]. It is also commonly used in [[mathematics]] in [[algebra|algebraic solutions]] representing quantities such as angles. Furthermore, in mathematics, the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a [[Normal distribution|normal curve]] in [[statistics]] to denote [[statistical significance|significance level]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu.au/WebStat/unit_materials/c5_inferential_statistics/what_alpha_level.html|work=Research Methods and Statistics PESS202 Lecture and Commentary Notes|title=Chapter 5: Analysing the Data Part II : Inferential Statistics}}</ref> when proving [[null hypotheses|null]] and [[Alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]]. In zoology, it is used to name the dominant individual in a wolf or dog pack.

The proportionality operator "[[<U+221D>]]" (in [[Unicode]]: U+221D) is sometimes mistaken for alpha.

The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|Latin A]].

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], a letter based on the lower case of alpha represents the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==History and symbolism==

===Etymology===
Alpha was derived from ''aleph'', which in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] means "[[ox]]".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=alpha alpha] on the Online Etymology Dictionary</ref>

===Plutarch===
[[Plutarch]], in ''[[Moralia]]'',<ref>Symposiacs, Book IX, questions II & III [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 On-line text] at Adelaide library</ref> presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, has to say for [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]] <U+2014> which, unlike [[Hesiod]],<ref>Hesiod, in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (see on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project]), advises the early Greek farmers, "First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough."</ref> the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. "Nothing at all," Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is "alpha", because it is very plain and simple <U+2014> the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue <U+2014> and therefore this is the first sound that children make.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]].

===Alpha and Omega===

Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something. The New Testament has God declaring himself to be the "[[Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last." ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

===Language===
The term "alpha" has been used to denote position in social hierarchy, examples being "[[alpha male]]s" or pack leaders.
