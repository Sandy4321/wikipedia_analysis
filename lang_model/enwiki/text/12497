'''Fleishhacker Pool''' was a public saltwater swimming pool located in the southwest corner of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] next to the [[San Francisco Zoo|zoo]] for 47 years. It was the largest swimming pool in the [[United States]].

==Construction==

It was built by [[philanthropist]] and [[civic engagement|civic]] leader [[Herbert Fleishhacker]] in 1924, and opened April 22, 1925. The pool measured {{convert|1000|by|150|ft|abbr=on|-1}}, held {{convert|6500000|usgal|L|abbr=on}} of [[seawater]], and accommodated 10,000 bathers. The pool was so large the lifeguards required rowboats for patrol, and was used by the military for drills and exercises. The pool water was pumped from the Pacific Ocean, filtered and heated.  The pool's heater could warm {{convert|2800|usgal|L|abbr=on}} of seawater from 60 degrees to 75 degrees Fahrenheit each minute. This resulted in a constant pool water temperature of 72 degrees for AAU swim meets.<ref name=sfcg>{{cite web | author=James Smith  | title=Fleishhacker Pool | url=http://www.sfcityguides.org/public_guidelines.html?article=290&submitted=TRUE&srch_text=&submitted2=&topic=Parks%20and%20Recreation | work=San Francisco City Guides | date=2007 | accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref>

The water provided by a series of pumps and piping at [[high tide]], directly from the [[Pacific Ocean]], {{convert|650|ft|abbr=on}} away. There was also a diving pool measuring {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} square and {{convert|14|ft|abbr=on}} deep and a two tiered diving tower.

==Decline==
After years of underfunding and poor maintenance, the pool was showing some deterioration when a storm in January 1971 damaged its drainage pipe. Because the repair costs exceeded the City's budget, the pool was converted to a fresh water pool which resulted in poor water quality. As a result of the poor attempt at conversion and resulting water quality, the pool was closed by the end of 1971.<ref name=sfcg/>

In 1999, the San Francisco [[Zoological Society]] was granted ownership of the pool house. The swimming pool itself was filled with rocks and gravel, with the space now serving as a parking lot for the zoo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfzoo.org/openrosters/ViewOrgPageLink.asp?LinkKey=14106&orgkey=1900#fleishhackerpool |title=Historic Sites:  Fleishhacker Pool|publisher=San Francisco Zoological Society |accessdate =28 August 2010}}</ref> The poolhouse was derelict and occupied by the homeless for many years until destroyed by a fire on December 1st, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sfist.com/2012/12/01/fleishhacker_pool_on_fire.php |title=Fleishhacker Pool House Next To SF Zoo On Fire |publisher=SFist.com |accessdate =01 December 2012}}</ref>
