'''Katharine Houghton Hepburn''' (May 12, 1907{{ndash}}June 29, 2003) was an American actress of film, stage, and television. Known for her headstrong independence and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a [[Hollywood]] leading lady spanned more than 60 years. She cultivated a screen persona that matched this public image, and regularly played strong-willed, sophisticated women. Her work came in a range of genres, from [[screwball comedy]] to literary drama, and she received four [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]&mdash;a record for any performer. 

Raised in [[Connecticut]] by wealthy, [[Progressive era|progressive]] parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. After four years in the theatre, favorable reviews of her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy Award for her third picture, ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures. In 1938 she was labeled "box office poison". Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out [[Studio system|her contract]] with [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and acquiring the film rights to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', which she sold on the condition that she be the star. In the 1940s she was contracted to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where her career focused on an alliance with [[Spencer Tracy]]. The screen-partnership spanned 25 years, and produced nine movies.

Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her work in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' (1968), and ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981). In the 1970s she began appearing in television movies, which became the focus of her career in later life. She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill-health, Hepburn died in 2003 at 96 years old.

Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to societal expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore pants before it was fashionable. She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the "modern woman" in 20th-century America and influenced changing popular perceptions of women. In 1999, she was named by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|top female Hollywood legend]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars |publisher=American Film Institute |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

==Early life and career beginnings==

Hepburn was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], on May 12, 1907, the second of six children. Her parents were [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|Katharine Martha Houghton]] (1878<U+2013>1951), a feminist who headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later fought for birth control with [[Margaret Sanger]] and Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879<U+2013>1962), a urologist at [[Hartford Hospital]]. Katharine Martha instilled in her daughter the virtues of perseverance, independence, and fortitude.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 14.</ref> As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several "Votes For Women" demonstrations.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 37.</ref> Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England [[American Social Health Association|Social Hygiene Association]], which aimed to educate the public about [[venereal disease]].<ref name="britton 41">Britton (2003) p. 41.</ref> The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished.<ref name="higham p 2">Higham (2004) p. 2.</ref> Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered.<ref name="cavett">{{Cite episode |title=Katharine Hepburn: Part 2 |series=The Dick Cavett Show |serieslink=The Dick Cavett Show |network= [[American Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=October&nbsp;3, 1973}} Stated by Hepburn in this interview.</ref><ref>Higham (2004) p. 4; Chandler (2011) p. 39; Prideaux (1996) p. 74.</ref> Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of "two very remarkable parents",<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 21.</ref> and credited her upbringing with providing the foundation for her success.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 47.</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Katharine Hepburn: Part 1 |series=The Dick Cavett Show |serieslink=The Dick Cavett Show |network= [[American Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=October&nbsp;2, 1973}} When asked if her "lucky" upbringing was the reason for her success, Hepburn responded: "Well, I think that in the first place, it's lucky if you have an intelligent, and brilliant, and inspiring father and mother, and it's lucky if you had experiences before the age of 15 which teach you not to be afraid."</ref> She remained close to her family throughout her life.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 30; Kanin (1971) p. 82.</ref>

[[File:Katharine Hepburn yearbook photo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of Hepburn, age 21|Hepburn's college yearbook photo, 1928. It was while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]] that she chose acting as a career.]]

The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her hair short like a boy's.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 30.</ref> Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 43.; Higham (2004) p. 2.</ref> Golf became a passion for his oldest daughter: she took daily lessons and became very good, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship.<ref name="higham p 7"/> She loved swimming in [[Long Island Sound]], and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you."<ref>Higham (2004) p. 3.</ref> Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 34.</ref> With her friends and siblings, she would put on plays and perform to her neighbors for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the [[Navajo people]].<ref>Higham (2004) p. 4.</ref>

On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in [[Greenwich Village]], Hepburn discovered the body of her older brother Tom, whom she adored,<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 44.</ref> dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 46.</ref> The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 6.</ref> The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 5.</ref> She shied away from other children, dropped out of [[Kingswood-Oxford School|Oxford School]], and began receiving private tutoring.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 49.</ref> For many years, she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life,'' that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 7.</ref>

In 1924, Hepburn gained a place at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 285.</ref> It was the first time she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 69.</ref> She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and was once suspended for smoking in her room.<ref name="dickens 4">Dickens (1990) p. 4.</ref> Hepburn was drawn to acting but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly.<ref name="dickens 4"/> The lead role in a production of ''[[The Woman in the Moon]]'' in her senior year, and the positive response it received, cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career.<ref name="higham p 7">Higham (2004) p. 7.</ref> She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.<ref>Horton and Simmons (2007) p. 119.</ref>

===Breaking into theatre (1928<U+2013>1932)===
Hepburn left Bryn Mawr determined to become an actress.<ref Name="Time">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816908,00.html|title=Cinema: The Hepburn Story |date = September 1, 1952|newspaper= Time|accessdate=August 21, 2011}} {{subscription required}}</ref> The day after graduating,<ref name="all about me">{{Cite episode|title=Katharine Hepburn: All About Me|network=[[Turner Network Television]]|airdate=18&nbsp;January, 1993|credits=Directed by David Healy}} Stated by Hepburn in this documentary.</ref> she traveled to [[Baltimore]] to meet [[Edwin H. Knopf]], who ran a successful [[Repertory|stock theatre company]]. Impressed by her eagerness, Knopf cast Hepburn in his current production, ''The Czarina''.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 8.</ref> She received good reviews for her small role; the ''Printed Word'' described her performance as "arresting".<ref name="Hep p 81">Hepburn (1991) p.81.</ref> She was given a part in the following week's show, but here Hepburn was less accomplished. She was criticized for her shrill voice, and so left Baltimore to study with an acclaimed voice tutor in New York City.<ref name="higham p 9">Higham (2004) p. 9.</ref>

[[File:Katharine Hepburn in The Warriors Husband.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hepburn, a young woman, dressed in a short tunic and armour, acting in a play.|Hepburn in the role that brought her to the attention of Hollywood, 1932's ''The Warrior's Husband'']]

Knopf decided to produce ''[[The Big Pond]]'' in New York and called for Hepburn to be the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired and replaced with Hepburn, which gave her a starring role after only four weeks in the theatre.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 59; Higham (2004) p. 9.</ref> On opening night, Hepburn turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too high and fast to be comprehensible.<ref name="higham p 9"/> She was promptly fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with producer [[Arthur Hopkins]], and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in ''These Days''. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the [[Cort Theatre]], but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights.<ref name="higham p 9"/> Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in [[Philip Barry]]'s play ''[[Holiday (play)|Holiday]]''. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to [[Katharine Hepburn#Relationships|marry Ludlow Ogden Smith]], her beau from college. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in ''Holiday'', which she held for six months.<ref name="berg p 73">Berg (2004) p. 73.</ref>

In 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the [[Theatre Guild]] to play the lead in ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]''. She felt the role was perfect,<ref>Hepburn (1991)  p. 109.</ref> but again she was fired.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 11.</ref> Hepburn went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for minimum pay in ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]''. In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined a stock company in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]. She left halfway through the summer season, and continued studying with a drama tutor.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 16; Hepburn (1991) p. 112.</ref> In early 1931, she was cast in the Broadway production of ''Art and Mrs. Bottle''. She was released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying "She looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent", but then rehired when no other actress could be found.<ref name="higham p 16">Higham (2004) p. 16.</ref> It went on to be a small success.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 22.</ref>

Hepburn appeared in a number of plays with a [[summer stock]] company in [[Ivoryton]], Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit.<ref name="higham p 16"/> During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, ''[[The Animal Kingdom]]'', alongside [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure this was the role to make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired.<ref name="Hep p 118"/> When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, "Well, to be brutally frank, you weren't very good."<ref name="Hep p 118">Hepburn (1991) p. 118.</ref> This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 74.</ref> She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she received an offer to read for the lead role in the Greek fable ''The Warrior's Husband''.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 120.</ref>

''The Warrior's Husband'' proved to be Hepburn's break-out performance. Biographer [[Charles Higham]] states that the play was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production.<ref name="higham p 17">Higham (2004) p. 17.</ref> It opened on March 11, 1932, at the [[Morosco Theatre]] on Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 75.</ref> Richard Garland of the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' wrote, "It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene."<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 229.</ref>

Critics loved the performance and Hepburn became an instant star.]]

A scout for the Hollywood agent [[Leland Hayward]] spotted Hepburn's appearance in ''The Warrior's Husband'', and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming [[RKO]] film ''[[A Bill of Divorcement]]''. Hepburn was unhappy with her test scene, and sent material from ''Holiday'' instead.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 128.</ref> Director [[George Cukor]] was impressed by what he saw: "There was this odd creature," he recalled, "she was unlike anybody I'd ever heard." He particularly liked the manner in which she picked up a glass: "I thought she was very talented in that action."<ref>Higham (2004) p. 23.</ref> On being offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week&mdash;a large amount for an unknown actress.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 21.</ref> Cukor encouraged the studio to accept her demands<ref name="Time"/> and they signed Hepburn to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee.<ref>Haver (1980) p. 94.</ref> RKO head [[David O. Selznick]] recounted that he took a "tremendous chance" in casting the unusual actress.<ref name="haver 96">Haver (1980) p. 96.</ref>

Hepburn arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old. She starred in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' opposite [[John Barrymore]], showing no sign of intimidation.<ref name="haver 96"/><ref>Prideaux (1996) p. 15, quotes Hepburn saying: "It never occured to me to doubt myself. When I first worked with John Barrymore, I watched him a bit and thought ... 'I can handle this perfectly easily!'".</ref> Although she struggled to adapt to the nature of film acting, Hepburn was fascinated by the industry from the start.<ref>Higham (2004) pp. 30<U+2013>31.</ref> The picture was a success and Hepburn received rave reviews.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 82.</ref> [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her performance "exceptionally fine <U+2026> Miss Hepburn's characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|title=Movie Review <U+2013> ''A Bill of Divorcement''|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E7D81331E633A25750C0A9669D946394D6CF|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 25, 2011|date=October 3, 1932}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Standout here is the smash impression made by Katharine Hepburn in her first picture assignment.

Hepburn's second film was ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' (1933), the story of an aviatrix and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's personal reviews were good.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 84.</ref> Regina Crewe wrote in the ''[[New York Journal American|Journal American]]'' that although her mannerisms were grating, "they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality."<ref name="higham p 44">Higham (2004) p. 44.</ref> Her third picture confirmed Hepburn as a major actress in Hollywood.<ref name="Berg p 86">Berg (2004) p. 86.</ref> For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace in ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'', she won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She had seen the script on the desk of producer [[Pandro S. Berman]] and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 85.</ref> Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony, a choice she would follow for the duration of her career, but was thrilled with the win.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 88.</ref> Her success continued with the role of Jo in the [[Little Women (1933 film)|screen adaptation of]] ''[[Little Women]]'' (1933). The movie was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date,<ref name="haver 96"/> and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. ''Little Women'' was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying "I defy anyone to be as good as I was [as Jo]".<ref name="Berg p 86"/> 

By the end of 1933 Hepburn was at the top of her profession, but yearned to prove herself on Broadway.<ref>Berg (2004), p. 89; Higham (2004) p. 57.</ref> [[Jed Harris]], one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was experiencing a slump in his career.<ref name="berg p 91"/> He asked Hepburn to appear in the play ''[[The Lake]]'', which she agreed to do for a low salary.<ref name="Berg p 92">Berg (2004) p. 92.</ref> Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film ''[[Spitfire (1934 film)|Spitfire]]'' (1934). Hepburn's role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. It is widely considered one of her worst films, and Hepburn received poor reviews for the effort.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 89.</ref> Hepburn kept a picture of Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life to "[keep] me humble."<ref name="Berg 2004 p. 90">Berg (2004) p. 90.</ref> 

''The Lake'' previewed in Washington, D.C., at the end of 1933, where there was a large advance sale.<ref name="Berg p 92"/> Harris's poor direction had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 60.</ref> Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]] on December 26, where Hepburn was slated by the critics.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 62.</ref> [[Dorothy Parker]] quipped, "Katharine Hepburn runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."<ref name="Time"/> Already tied to a ten-week contract, Hepburn had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 166.</ref> Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money I can make out of you." Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 93.</ref> She later referred to Harris as "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met",<ref name="berg p 91">Berg (2004) p. 91.</ref> and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 4.</ref>

===Career struggles, "box office poison" (1934<U+2013>1938)===

[[File:Hepburn mary of scotland.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Hepburn dressed in medieval clothes, standing with a concerned look on her face.|In ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936), one of a series of unsuccessful films Hepburn made in this period.]]

After the failure of ''Spitfire'' and ''The Lake'', RKO cast Hepburn in ''[[The Little Minister]]'' (1934), based on a Victorian novel by [[James Barrie]], in an attempt to repeat the success of ''Little Women''.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 105.</ref> There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a commercial failure.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 66.</ref> The romantic drama ''[[Break of Hearts]]'' (1935) with [[Charles Boyer]] proceeded to collect poor reviews, and also lost money at the box office.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 106.</ref> After three forgettable movies, success returned to Hepburn with ''[[Alice Adams (film)|Alice Adams]]'' (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved [[Alice Adams (novel)|the book]] and was delighted to be offered the role.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 68.</ref> The picture was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination.<ref name="Berg p 109">Berg (2004) p. 109.</ref> 

Berman allowed Hepburn to select her next feature.<ref name="Berg p 109"/> She chose George Cukor's new project, ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1935), which paired her for the first time with [[Cary Grant]]. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked ''Sylvia Scarlett'' and it was unpopular with the public.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 110.</ref> For her next film she played [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936). It met with a similarly poor reception.<ref>Berg (2004) pp.111<U+2013>112.</ref> ''[[A Woman Rebels]]'' (1937) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character fights against convention. ''[[Quality Street (film)|Quality Street]]'' (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 112.</ref>

Alongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from Hepburn's attitude.<ref>Horton and Simmons (2007) p. 120.</ref> She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative.<ref name="lat life"/> When asked if she had any children, she snapped back "Yes I have five: two white and three colored."<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 284.</ref> She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs,<ref name="Kanin p 85">Kanin (1971) p. 85.</ref> which earned her the nickname "Katharine of Arrogance".<ref>Berg (2004) p. 111.</ref> The public were also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure.<ref name="lat life">{{cite news|last=McNamara|first=Mary|title=It was her defining role: life|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/01/entertainment/et-mary1|accessdate=October 2, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 1, 2003}}</ref><ref>Britton (2003) p. 16.</ref> Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood,<ref name="Berg p 114"/> so returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.

For her next feature, ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) paired Hepburn with [[Ginger Rogers]] in a role that mirrored her own life&mdash;that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress.<ref name ="Berg p 116">Berg (2004) p. 116.</ref> Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers,<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 238.</ref> and the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the Academy Awards.

Hepburn played the physical comedy of the film with confidence,<ref name="Berg p 117"/> and took tips on comedic timing from her co-star [[Walter Catlett]].<ref>Higham (2004) p. 88.</ref> ''Bringing Up Baby'' was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 90.</ref> With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with Hepburn.<ref name="Berg p 118">Berg (2004) p. 118.</ref>

''Bringing Up Baby'' was the last picture Hepburn did at RKO. After its release, the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors considered "Box Office Poison".<ref name="Berg p 118"/> The next film offered to her was ''[[Mother Carey's Chickens]]'', a "[[B Movie]]" with poor prospects.<ref name="Berg p 118"/> Hepburn turned it down, and instead opted to buy herself out of her contract for $75,000.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 201.</ref> Many actors of the time were afraid to leave the stability of the [[studio system]], but Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent.<ref>Verlhac (2009) p. 8; Chandler (2011) p. 142.</ref> She signed on for the film version of ''[[Holiday (1938 film)|Holiday]]'' (1938) with [[Columbia Pictures]], pairing her for the third time with Grant. The comedy was well received by critics, but it was too late to compensate for the previous flops and overcome the negative publicity. ''Holiday'' failed to be a hit,<ref>Edwards (1985) p. 166.</ref> and the next script offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000&mdash;less than she had been receiving at the start of her film career.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 119.</ref> Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn: "No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time."<ref>Britton (2003) p. 13.</ref>

She is holding a glass of champagne and they are looking at each other flirtatiously.| As Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), alongside [[James Stewart]]. Hepburn said of the role, "I gave her life and she gave me back my career."<ref name="all about me"/>]]

Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 97.</ref> [[Howard Hughes]], Hepburn's beau at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom, and bought her the [[film rights]] before it had opened.<ref name="berg p 132">Berg (2004) p. 132.</ref> The pair also contributed a quarter of the play's production costs.<ref>Berg (2004), p. 133.</ref> ''The Philadelphia Story'' first toured the United States, to positive reviews,<ref>Berg (2004) p. 136.</ref> and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 29, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.<ref Name="Time"/>

All the major film studios approached Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 137.</ref> She chose to sell the rights to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio,<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 224.</ref> on the condition that she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, [[George Cukor]], but the co-stars she wanted, [[Clark Gable]] and [[Spencer Tracy]], were both unavailable. [[Louis B. Mayer]] promised her [[James Stewart]] and $150,000 "for anyone else you want or can get."<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 217.</ref> Hepburn chose her friend and previous co-star, Cary Grant&mdash;to whom she ceded top billing.<ref name="dickens 17">Dickens (1990) p. 17.</ref> Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers&nbsp;... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of people want to see me fall flat on my face."<ref name="Berg p 139">Berg (2004) p. 139</ref> Thus the film began with the actress being knocked flat onto her backside by Cary Grant. The movie also came with the highest production values available, including gowns by top designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]] that made Hepburn look more glamorous than ever before.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 140.</ref> Berg claims the effect was to "recreate Katharine Hepburn" in the eyes of her audience.<ref name="Berg p 139"/> The [[The Philadelphia Story (film)|resulting film]] was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at the [[Radio City Music Hall]].<ref Name="Time"/> In its review, ''Time'' wrote: "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven."<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Pictures, Jan. 20, 1941|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772652,00.html|accessdate=September 27, 2011|newspaper=Time|date=January 20, 1941}}</ref> Herb Golden of ''Variety'' stated: "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture&nbsp;...

Hepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the romantic comedy ''[[Woman of the Year]]''. The idea for the film was proposed to her by [[Garson Kanin]] in 1941. Hepburn passed the outline onto [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] at MGM, who expressed an interest in the picture. Kanin recalled how Hepburn contributed to the script: reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project.<ref name="Kanin p 81">Kanin (1971) p. 81.</ref> Hepburn presented the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000&mdash;half for her, half for the authors, [[Michael Kanin]] and [[Ring Lardner, Jr.]]<ref>Berg (2004) p. 147.</ref> Her terms accepted, Hepburn was also given the director and co-star of her choice, [[George Stevens]] and Spencer Tracy. Released in 1942, ''Woman of the Year'' was another success. Critics praised the chemistry between the stars and, says Higham, noted Hepburn's "increasing maturity and polish".<ref>Higham (2004) p. 113.</ref> The ''World-Telegram'' commended two "brilliant performances",<ref name="Curtis p 457">Curtis (2011) p. 457.</ref> and Hepburn received a fourth Academy Award nomination for her role as independent career-woman Tess Harding. During the course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.<ref name="dickens 17"/>

===Slowing in the 1940s (1942<U+2013>1949)===

In 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, ''Without Love'', which was also written with the actress in mind.<ref name="Curtis p 457"/> Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 178.</ref> MGM were eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]]'' (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 175.</ref> It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy<U+2013>Hepburn pairing.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 480; Kanin (1971) p. 5.</ref>

[[File:Tracy Hepburn Adams Rib.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|240px|alt=Screenshot of Hepburn and Spencer Tracy sat in an open-top car in mid-conversation. He looks unimpressed.|The majority of films Hepburn did in this period were with [[Spencer Tracy]]. She later said the partnership did much to advance her career, as he was the more popular star at the time.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 149.</ref> The pair are seen here in one of their most successful outings, ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949).]]

Since ''Woman of the Year'' Hepburn had committed to [[Katharine Hepburn#Spencer Tracy|a romantic relationship with Tracy]] and dedicated herself to helping the star&mdash;who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia.<ref name="troubled tracy">Curtis (2011) p. 702, quotes Tracy's daughter as saying: "[alcoholism] was something [my father] had to battle all his life." For insomnia, see Curtis (2011) pp. 508, 662, 670, 727.</ref> Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s&mdash;notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950.<ref name="berg 179">Berg (2004) p. 179.</ref> Her only appearance in 1943 was a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the morale-building wartime film ''[[Stage Door Canteen]]'', playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama ''[[Dragon Seed (film)|Dragon Seed]]''. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast.<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 18.</ref> She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of ''[[Without Love (film)|Without Love]]'' (1945), after which she turned down a role in ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' to support Tracy through his return to Broadway.<ref name="Curtis p 522">Curtis (2011) p. 522.</ref> ''Without Love'' received poor reviews, but a new Tracy<U+2013>Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter weekend 1945.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 515.</ref> 

Hepburn's next film was ''[[Undercurrent (1946 film)|Undercurrent]]'' (1946), a [[film noir]] with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Robert Mitchum]] that was poorly received.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 129.</ref> A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama set in the [[American Old West]] entitled ''[[The Sea of Grass (film)|The Sea of Grass]]''. Similarly to ''Keeper of the Flame'' and ''Without Love'', a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 549.</ref> The same year, Hepburn portrayed [[Clara Wieck Schumann]] in ''[[Song of Love (film)|Song of Love]]''. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 131.</ref> By the time of its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the anti-communist witch-hunt occurring in Hollywood. Viewed by the public as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people were reportedly throwing things at screen showings of ''Song of Love''.<ref name="Curtis p 555">Curtis (2011) p. 555.</ref> Her next film role came unintentionally, as she stepped in to replace [[Claudette Colbert]] only days before shooting began in [[Frank Capra]]'s political drama ''[[State of the Union (film)|State of the Union]]'' (1948).<ref>Berg (2004) p. 182.</ref> Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy<U+2013>Hepburn picture.<ref name="Curtis p 555"/> Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box office.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 564.</ref> 

Tracy and Hepburn appeared on screen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film ''[[Adam's Rib]]''. Like ''Woman of the Year'', it was a "battle of the sexes" comedy, and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson Kanin and [[Ruth Gordon]]. A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in court, Hepburn described it as "perfect for [Tracy] and me".<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 246.</ref> She was instrumental in getting [[Judy Holliday]] cast in the film, which kick-started the young actress's Hollywood career.<ref>Kanin (1971) pp. 156<U+2013>157.</ref> Although Hepburn was still unpopular due to her political views, with scattered [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] at theatres around the country, ''Adam's Rib'' was a hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy<U+2013>Hepburn picture to date.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 587.</ref> Critic [[Bosley Crowther]] was full of praise for the film, and noted the duo's "perfect compatibility".<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title='Adam's Rib,' 'Tight Little Island,' 'Amazing Mr. Beecham' Among Movie Newcomers|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 25, 2011|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E5DC1F3BE23BBC4E51DFB4678382659EDE&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|date=December 26, 1949}}</ref>

===Professional expansion (1950<U+2013>1952)===

[[File:The African Queen production still.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hepburn is dressed in early 20th century clothes, looking prim and proper. Behind her is Humphrey Bogart, also dressed as his character from The African Queen.|Hepburn often worked abroad in the 1950s, beginning with ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), which was shot on location in Africa. Pictured is a promotional image for the film, with co-star [[Humphrey Bogart]].]]

The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and  stretch herself further than at any other point in her life  at an age when most actresses  began to retreat.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 192.</ref> Berg describes the decade as "the heart of her vast legacy" and "the period in which she truly came into her own."<ref name="berg 193">Berg (2004) p. 193.</ref> In January 1950, Hepburn made her first venture into Shakespeare, playing [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] in ''[[As You Like It]]''. She hoped to prove she could play already established material,<ref name="all about me"/> and said "It's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time."<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 728.</ref> It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and continued to be virtually sold out for 148 shows.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 267.</ref> The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material on the stage.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 186.</ref>

In 1951, Hepburn filmed ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', her first movie in [[Technicolor]]. She played Rose Sayer, a prim spinster missionary living in [[German East Africa]] at the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Co-starring [[Humphrey Bogart]], ''The African Queen'' was shot mostly on location in the [[Belgian Congo]]&mdash;an opportunity Hepburn embraced.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 194.</ref> It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with [[dysentery]] during filming.<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 21.</ref> Later in life, she  released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim,<ref>Berg (2004) p. 198.</ref> and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards. It proved that she could be a hit without Spencer Tracy, being the first successful film she had made without him since ''The Philadelphia Story'' a decade earlier, and fully re-established her popularity.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 633.</ref> 

Hepburn went on to make the sports comedy ''[[Pat and Mike]]'' (1952), a second film written specifically as a Tracy<U+2013>Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. Hepburn was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to me that her audience was missing a treat."<ref name="Kanin p 169">Kanin (1971) p. 169.</ref> Hepburn was asked to gain weight for the role, and she was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not end up in the film.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 622.</ref> ''Pat and Mike'' was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy.<ref>Berg (2004) pp. 198<U+2013>199.</ref> The performance brought a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress <U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Katharine Hepburn Golden Globe Awards history|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29415|publisher=The Hollywood Foreign Press Association|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> 

In the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] for a ten-week run of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Millionairess (play)|The Millionairess]]''. Her parents had read Shaw to her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the actress.<ref name="Chandler p 200">Chandler (2011) p. 200.</ref> Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and her friend [[Constance Collier]] wrote that Hepburn was "on the verge of a nervous breakdown".<ref name="Curtis p 635">Curtis (2011) p. 635.</ref> ''The Millionairess'' was widely acclaimed, and brought to Broadway.<ref name="dickens 22"/> It opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] in October 1952, where the response by critics was lukewarm but it sold out for the ten-week run.<ref name="Curtis p 635"/> Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by [[Preston Sturges]], Hepburn offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself, but the project was not picked up by any studio.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 163; Berg (2004) p. 200.</ref> She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career.<ref name="Chandler p 200"/>

===Spinsters and Shakespeare (1953<U+2013>1962)===

[[File:Hepburn Summertime.jpg|thumb|alt=Hepburn, middle-aged, smiling.|In [[David Lean]]'s romantic drama ''[[Summertime (1954 film)|Summertime]]'' (1954). Jane Hudson is one of the popular "spinster" roles Hepburn played in the 1950s.]]

''Pat and Mike'' was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making her free to select her own projects.<ref name="dickens 22">Dickens (1990) p. 22.</ref> She spent two years resting and traveling, before committing to [[David Lean]]'s romantic drama ''[[Summertime (1954 film)|Summertime]]'' (1954). The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has a passionate love affair. She described it as "a very emotional part" and found it fascinating to work with Lean.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 253.</ref> At her own insistence, Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result.<ref>Edwards (1985) pp. 291<U+2013>292.</ref> The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 202.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Summertime'' Film Review|url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1954/summertime|publisher=Film4|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 204.</ref> The following year, Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the [[Old Vic]] theatre company, playing [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', [[Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)|Kate]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and Isabella in ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 203.</ref>

Hepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for her work opposite [[Burt Lancaster]] in ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1956). Again she played a lonely women empowered by a love affair, and it seemed that Hepburn had found a niche in playing love-starved spinsters that critics, audiences and her peers clearly enjoyed.<ref name="Berg p 204">Berg (2004) p. 204.</ref> Hepburn said of playing such roles, "With Lizzie Curry [''The Rainmaker''] and Jane Hudson [''Summertime''] and Rosie Sayer [''The African Queen''] <U+2013> I was playing me. It wasn't difficult for me to play those women, because I'm the maiden aunt."<ref name="Berg p 204"/> Less success that year came from ''[[The Iron Petticoat]]'' (1956), a reworking of the classic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', with [[Bob Hope]]. Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther called "horrible".<ref name="Dickens 166">Dickens (1990) p. 166.</ref> It was a critical and commercial failure,<ref name="Dickens 166"/> and Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.<ref name="Berg p 204"/> 

Tracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the office-based comedy ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's spinster persona,<ref name="Berg p 206">Berg (2004) p. 206.</ref> but it performed poorly at the box office.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 738.</ref> That summer Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in [[Stratford (Connecticut)|Stratford, Connecticut]], at the [[American Shakespeare Theatre]], she repeated her Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' and played Beatrice in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. The shows were positively received.<ref name="Berg p 206"/> After two years away from the screen, she starred in a film adaptation of [[Tennessee Williams]]' controversial play ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959) with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. The movie was shot in London, and was "a completely miserable experience" for Hepburn.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 209.</ref> She clashed with director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] during filming, which culminated with her spitting at him in disgust.<ref>Kanin (1971) pp. 218<U+2013>219. The dispute was primarily over Mankiewicz's behavior towards Montgommery Clift, whom Hepburn sympathized with after some personal troubles and felt was being treated unfairly.</ref> The picture was a financial success,<ref>Berg (2004) p. 210.</ref> and her work as creepy aunt Violet Venable gave Hepburn her eighth Oscar nomination. Williams was pleased with the performance, writing, "Kate is a playwright's dream actress. She makes dialogue sound better than it is by a matchless beauty and clarity of diction".<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 219.</ref> He wrote ''[[The Night of the Iguana]]'' (1961) with Hepburn in mind, but the actress, although flattered, felt the play was wrong for her and declined the part, which went to [[Bette Davis]].<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 220.</ref>

Hepburn returned to Stratford in the summer of 1960 to play [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and Cleopatra in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote of her Cleopatra: "Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch."<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 239.</ref> Hepburn herself was proud of the role.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 270.</ref> Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s film version of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962 film)|Long Day's Journey Into Night]]'' (1962). It was a low-budget production, and Hepburn appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 242.</ref> She called it "the greatest [play] this country has ever produced", the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone "the most challenging female role in American drama", and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 212.</ref> ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] at that year's [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It remains one of her most praised performances.<ref name="lat obit">{{cite news|last=Baum|first=Geraldine|title=Classy Film Feminist Had Brains, Beauty, That Voice|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/30/local/me-hepburn30|accessdate=October 2, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 30, 2003}}</ref>

===Success in later years (1963<U+2013>1970)===

[[File:Hepburn guess whos coming to dinner.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Hepburn|In ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), which won Hepburn her second of four Academy Awards]]

Following completion of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'', Hepburn took a break in her career to care for the ailing Spencer Tracy.<ref name="Hep p 393">Hepburn (1991) p. 393. "I virtually quit work just to be ''there'' so that he wouldn't worry or be lonely."</ref> She did not work again until 1967's ''[[Guess Who's Coming To Dinner]]'', a ninth film with Tracy. The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn's niece, [[Katharine Houghton]], playing her daughter. Tracy was a dying man by this point, suffering the effects of heart disease,<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 823.</ref> and Houghton later commented that her aunt was "extremely tense" during the production.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 849.</ref> Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene. ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to date.<ref name="Berg p 249">Berg (2004) p. 249.</ref> She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her first. Hepburn felt the award was not just for her, but was also given to honor Tracy.<ref name="Berg p 249"/>

Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy's death, choosing to preoccupy herself as a remedy against grief.<ref name="Berg p 255">Berg (2004) p. 255.</ref> She received numerous scripts<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 259.</ref> and chose to play [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in ''[[The Lion In Winter]]'' (1968), a part she called "fascinating".<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 255.</ref> She read extensively in preparation for the role,<ref name="kanin p 6">Kanin (1971) p. 6.</ref> where she starred opposite [[Peter O'Toole]].

Anthony Harvey is quoted in Curtis (2011) p. 877.</ref> John Russell Taylor of ''[[The Times]]'' suggested that Eleanor was "the performance of her (Hepburn's) career", and proved that she was "a growing, developing, still surprising actress".<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 192.</ref> The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress.<ref name ="Berg p 251">Berg (2004) p. 251.</ref> The role, combined with ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'', also won Hepburn a British Academy Film Award ([[BAFTA]]) for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]]. Hepburn's next appearance was in ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot (film)|The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'' (1969), which she filmed in [[Nice]] immediately after completing ''The Lion in Winter''.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 210.</ref> Unlike her previous hits the picture was a failure critically and financially, and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 211.</ref>

From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', about the life of [[Coco Chanel]]. Hepburn admitted that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical.<ref name="Berg p 252">Berg (2004) p. 252.</ref> She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as said by Berg, "what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts".<ref name="Berg p 253">Berg (2004) p. 253.</ref> The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show.<ref name="Berg p 253"/> She was nervous about every performance, and recalled "wondering what the hell I was doing there."<ref>Berg (2004) p. 254.</ref> Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised and ''Coco'' was popular with the public.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 296.</ref> Hepburn would typically receive a standing ovation at the end of the night, and the show's run was twice extended.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 297.</ref> She later said ''Coco'' marked the first time she accepted that the public were not against her, but actually seemed to love her.<ref name="all about me"/> The work earned Hepburn a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 302.</ref>

===Film, television and theatre (1971<U+2013>1983)===

Hepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [alone]".<ref name="britton 41"/> First she traveled to Spain to film a version of [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Trojan Women (film)|The Trojan Women]]'' (1971) alongside [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. When asked why she had taken the role, she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything while she still had time.<ref name="dickens 202">Dickens (1990) p. 202.</ref> The movie was poorly received,<ref name="dickens 202"/> but the [[Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards|Kansas City Film Critics]] named Hepburn's performance [[Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|the best from an actress]] that year. In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[Travels With My Aunt]]'', but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with [[Maggie Smith]].<ref>Edwards (1985) pp. 374<U+2013>376.</ref>

Hepburn's next film, an adaptation of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[A Delicate Balance (film)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1973) directed by [[Tony Richardson]], had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.<ref name="dickens 29">Dickens (1990) p. 29.</ref> She then ventured into television for the first time and appeared in a small-screen production of Tennessee Williams' ''[[The Glass Menagerie (1973 film)|The Glass Menagerie]]''. Hepburn had been wary of entering into the medium but it proved to be one of the main television events of 1973, scoring high on the [[Nielsen ratings]].<ref>Berg (2004), pp. 256<U+2013>257; Higham (2004) p. 227.</ref> Hepburn received an [[Emmy]] Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work in the medium.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 257.</ref> Her next project was the television movie ''[[Love Among the Ruins (film)|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with [[Laurence Olivier]]. It received positive reviews and high ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 258.</ref> 

[[File:Hepburn rooster cogburn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Screenshot of Hepburn in rural clothes, age 68|In ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]'' (1975), which Hepburn starred in with [[John Wayne]]]]

Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]] to [[Lawrence Weingarten]]. She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, "I'm very happy I didn't hear anyone call out 'It's about time'."<ref>{{Cite episode|title=46th Academy Awards|episodelink=46th Academy Awards|network=[[National Broadcasting Company]]|credits=Produced by [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|airdate=April&nbsp;2, 1974}}</ref> The following year, she was paired with [[John Wayne]] in the Western ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]'', a sequel to his Oscar-winning film ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]''. Hepburn's role replicated Rose Sayer from ''The African Queen'', again playing a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member's death.<ref name="dickens 29"/> The movie received mediocre reviews. Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but not as many as anticipated and it was only moderately successful.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 29; Dickens (1990) pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of ''[[A Matter of Gravity]]''. The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress,<ref>Edwards (1985) p. 390.</ref> and the play was popular despite poor reviews.<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 30.</ref> It later went on a successful nationwide tour.<ref name="Berg p 259">Berg (2004) p. 259.</ref> During the Los Angeles run of the production, Hepburn fractured her hip.

It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with [[George Cukor]], and gained her a third Emmy nomination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Katharine Hepburn Emmy Awards history|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=katharine+hepburn&program=&start_year=1949&end_year=2011&network=All&web_category=All&winner=All|publisher=Primetime Emmy Awards|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> 

By the 1980s Hepburn had developed a noticeable [[essential tremor|tremor]], giving her a permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a television interview "I've had my day&mdash;let the kids scramble and sweat it out."<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 31.</ref> During this period she saw the Broadway production of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'', and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age.<ref name ="berg 261">Berg (2004) p. 261.</ref> [[Jane Fonda]] had purchased the screen rights for her father, the actor [[Henry Fonda]], and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 234.</ref> ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' was a successful outing, as it became the second-highest grossing film of 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=1981 Domestic Grosses|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 27, 2011}}</ref> 74-year-old Hepburn was noted for how energetic she still was, as she dived fully clothed into [[Squam Lake]] and gave a lively singing performance.<ref name ="berg 261"/> The movie won Hepburn a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award. Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win; "a tribute to her enduring career."<ref>Dickens (1990) p. 218.</ref>

1981 also saw Hepburn return to the stage, and she received a second [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play|Tony]] nomination for her work in ''[[The West Side Waltz]]''. Playing a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life, ''Variety'' observed that the role was "an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [Hepburn's] own public image." Walter Kerr of ''The New York Times'' wrote of Hepburn and her performance: "One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines."<ref name="nyt obit">{{cite news|last=James|first=Caryn|title=Katharine Hepburn, Spirited Actress, Dies at 90|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/movies/katharine-hepburn-spirited-actress-dies-at-96.html?src=pm|accessdate=September 25, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 30, 2003}}</ref> She hoped to make a film out of the production, but nobody purchased the rights.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 262.</ref> Hepburn's reputation as one of America's best loved actors was firmly established by this point, as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine and again won the popularity award from People's Choice.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's Your Turn! - Reader's Poll|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081942,00.html|accessdate=November 8, 2011|newspaper=People|date=April 19, 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=People's Choice Awards 1983 Nominees|url=http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/awards/nominees/index.jsp?year=1983|publisher=People's Choice|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

===Focus on television (1984<U+2013>1994)===

[[File:Katharine Hepburn in Love Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Hepburn, now an elderly woman, seated on a sofa|Hepburn's final movie appearance was in ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1994). Critics commented that the 86 year old had lost none of her powerful screen presence.]] 

In 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark comedy ''[[Grace Quigley]]'', the story of an elderly woman who enlists a hitman ([[Nick Nolte]]) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and it received a small audience.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 286; Dickens (1990) p. 34.</ref> In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 264.</ref> With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles.<ref name="laura lansing">{{cite web|title=Laura Lansing Slept Here (1988) <U+2013> Overview|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/126954/Laura-Lansing-Slept-Here/overview|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's ''[[Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry]]'', then two years later returned for the comedy ''[[Laura Lansing Slept Here]]'', which allowed Hepburn to act with her grandniece, [[Schuyler Grant]]. In 1991 she released her autobiography, ''Me: Stories of my Life''. It topped best-seller lists for over a year.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 268.</ref> She returned to television screens in 1992 for ''[[The Man Upstairs (1992 film)|The Man Upstairs]]'', co-starring [[Ryan O'Neal]], for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1994 she worked opposite [[Anthony Quinn]] in ''[[This Can't Be Love (film)|This Can't Be Love]]'', which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles have been described as "a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character" and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself.<ref name="nyt obit"/><ref name="laura lansing"/>

Hepburn's final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first since ''Grace Quigley'' ten years earlier, was ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1994). At 86 years old, she played a supporting role alongside [[Annette Bening]] and [[Warren Beatty]]. It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo appearance in ''Stage Door Canteen'', in which she did not play a leading role.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 280.</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] noted that it was the first time Hepburn had looked frail, but that the "magnificent spirit" was still there and said her scenes "steal the show".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Film Review: ''Love Affair'' (1994)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941021/REVIEWS/410210302|newspaper=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=August 25, 2011|date=October 21, 1994}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance, stating that "if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been".<ref name="nyt obit"/> Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie ''[[One Christmas]]'' (1994), for which she received a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination at 87 years old.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/inaugural-screen-actors-guild-awards#nominee-1601 |title=The Inaugural Screen Actors Guild Awards| publisher=Screen Actors Guild Awards | accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>

When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer: "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side.

===Relationships===<!-- Do not change this heading as 'Ludlow Ogden Smith' redirects here -->

Hepburn's only husband was Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr. The couple married on December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29.<ref name="higham p 10">Higham (2004) p. 10.</ref> Hepburn made Smith change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow so that she would not be known as "Kate Smith". It was too plain, she insisted, and disliked that it was the name of [[Kate Smith|an overweight singer]] who was popular at the time.<ref name="berg p 73"/> Hepburn never fully committed to the relationship and prioritized her career.<ref name="higham p 10"/> The move to Hollywood in 1932 cemented their estrangement,<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 153.</ref> and in 1934, she traveled to Mexico to get a [[Mexican divorce|quick divorce]]. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial and moral support in the early days of her career, and in her autobiography called herself "a terrible pig" for exploiting his love.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p. 154.</ref> They remained friends until his death in 1979.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 54.</ref>

Soon after moving to California, Hepburn began a relationship with her agent Leland Hayward.

They first met while Hepburn was filming ''Sylvia Scarlett'', when they were introduced by their mutual friend Cary Grant.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 127.</ref> Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but at that time Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting her failing career.<ref>Berg (2004) p. 131.</ref> They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being named "box office poison".<ref>Berg (2004) p. 132; Hepburn (1991) pp. 204<U+2013>205.</ref> Hepburn stuck to her decision not to re-marry, and made a conscious choice not to have children. She felt that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, and it was not one she was willing to make.<ref name="cavett"/> "I would have been a terrible mother," she told Berg, "because I'm basically a very selfish human being."<ref>Berg (2004) p. 50.</ref> She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.<ref>Hepburn (1991) p.  37.</ref>

From as early as the 1930s, rumors have persisted that Hepburn was a lesbian or bisexual.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 881.</ref> In 2007, [[William J. Mann]] released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case.<ref>Mann (2007) p. xxiv. "That Hepburn loved other women, that she made her life with other women, is a defining aspect of her story."</ref> Katharine Houghton responded to this speculation about her aunt, saying: "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian."<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 449.</ref>

==Performances: technique and analysis==

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|quote="Her best films were when she was presented as a woman on her high horse with slightly pretentious, often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty and democratic. We liked the idea that aristocratic people would be humanized by democratic values<U+2014>in her case, by slightly rough-necked and good-natured males."<ref name="lat obit"/>|source=<U+2014>Film historian and critic [[Richard Schickel]] explains the typical Hepburn role and its appeal.}}

According to reports, Hepburn was not an instinctive actor.<ref>Curtis (2011) p. 435</ref> She liked to carefully study the text and character beforehand, making sure she knew it thoroughly, and then to rehearse as much as possible and film multiple takes of a scene.<ref name="kanin p 6"/> With a genuine passion for the industry she committed heavily to each role,<ref>Higham (2004) pp. 30, 34; Kanin (1971) p. 18.</ref> and insisted on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts herself.<ref>Higham (2004) p. 131; Chandler (2011) p. 287.</ref> She was known to learn not only her own lines but also those of her co-stars.<ref>Chandler (2011) p. 241; Higham (2004) p. 53.</ref> Stanley Kramer commented on her motivation, saying: "Work, work, work. She can work till everyone drops."<ref>Higham (2004) p. 201.</ref> With each film Hepburn would involve herself in its production, making suggestions for the script and stating her opinion on everything from costumes to lighting to camerawork.<ref>Curtis (2011) pp. 508, 539, 844; Higham (2004) pp. 34, 126, 139, 180; Kanin (1971) p. 271; Berg (2004) p. 144.</ref> 

The characters Hepburn played were, with very few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often they were strong and independent.<ref>Horton and Simmons (2007) p. 118.</ref> These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability.<ref>{{cite news|last=French|first=Philip|title=Philip French's Screen Legends: Katharine Hepburn|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/apr/12/katharine-hepburn-screen-legend|accessdate=November 26, 2011|newspaper=The Observer|date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> Garson Kanin described what he called "the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again."<ref>Kanin (1971) p. 80.</ref> Due to this repeated [[character arc]], Britton sees Hepburn as embodying the "contradictions" of the "nature and status of women",<ref name="britton 8">Britton (2003) p. 8.</ref> as the strong females she depicts are eventually "restored to a safe position within the status quo".<ref name="Britton 2003 p. 6">Britton (2003) p. 6.</ref> Film critic [[Molly Haskell]] has commented on the importance of this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters "do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on the good side of the audience."<ref name="lat life"/> 

Hepburn is one of America's most celebrated actresses,<ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Kate at 100: No one else like her|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/27/entertainment/ca-secondlook27|accessdate=October 3, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 27, 2007}}</ref> but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her on-screen persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist: "I think I'm always the same.
