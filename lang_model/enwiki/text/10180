"'''Killer Within'''" is the fourth episode of the [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|third season]] of the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[television series]] ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''. It originally aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States on November 4, 2012, and was written by Sang Kyu Kim and directed by [[Guy Ferland]]. The episode marked [[Sarah Wayne Callies]] and [[IronE Singleton]]'s final appearances as regular actors on the show. Most television critics positively reviewed the episode, applauding its bleak undertones and the performances. However, some commentators criticized the narrative ploys and the direction taken in the program. "Killer Within" was viewed by 9.27 million viewers, including 4.9 percent of those in the 18 to 49 demographic upon its initial broadcast in the United States.

==Plot==
"Killer Within" opens as an unidentified individual sets up the remnants of a deer carcass as a trail to attract walkers (see [[zombies]]). As the walkers begin to follow the trail, the individual successfully breaks the lock to the prison gate, simultaneously placing the carcass' heart nearby.

[[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) discusses with [[Carol Peletier]] ([[Melissa McBride]]), [[Daryl Dixon (The Walking Dead)|Daryl Dixon]] ([[Norman Reedus]]), [[Maggie Greene]] ([[Lauren Cohan]]), [[Glenn (The Walking Dead)|Glenn]] ([[Steven Yeun]]), and [[T-Dog (The Walking Dead)|Theodore "T-Dog" Douglas]] ([[IronE Singleton]]) the disposing of the rotting corpses and other tasks required to make the prison their permanent home. The group is approached by prisoners [[Axel (The Walking Dead)|Axel]] ([[Lew Temple]]) and Oscar ([[Vincent M. Ward|Vincent Ward]]), who are visibly distraught and plead to be part of the clan. An adamant Rick declines their pleas, and abides by a [[Sick (The Walking Dead)|compromise initiated between the two groups]]. T-Dog sympathizes with the prisoners, and is open to the idea of letting them join, but Maggie, Glenn and Daryl disappear and Rick insists that the prisoners keep to their cell block. Axel and Oscar refuse because their cell block is full of bodies. Rick has the two prisoners caged, intending to cast them out with one week's supplies.

A suspicious [[Michonne]] examines the [[US National Guard|National Guard]] vehicles retrieved by the Governor and his men. She notices numerous bullet holes and detects bloodstains in one of them. Once the Governor arrives, Michonne interrogates him about the details of the soldiers' deaths. The Governor ignores her questions and attempts to convince her to stay at Woodbury. After their confrontation, Michonne tells [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]] of her plans to migrate to the coast.

[[Hershel Greene]] ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) takes his first steps [[Seed (The Walking Dead)|after having his right leg amputated]] and is assisted by his daughter Beth Greene ([[Emily Kinney]]), [[Lori Grimes]], and her son [[Carl Grimes]] ([[Chandler Riggs]]). The group's celebration abruptly ends as a horde of walkers unexpectedly invades the courtyard. The ensuing chaos forces the group to disperse. During the commotion, T-Dog is bitten on the shoulder. Rick, Daryl and Glenn rush in from outside the fences and Glenn finds the gate's lock broken and chains cut, leading Rick to believe that Axel and Oscar are responsible. But when the prison sirens sound off, attracting more walkers, it is clear that someone else is to blame. Oscar explains that the back-up generators are powering the alarms and they decide to work together to shut them down.

In Woodbury, Andrea gives [[Merle Dixon]] ([[Michael Rooker]]) the location to Hershel's farm. Merle asks her to join him on his journey to search for Daryl, but she declines. The Governor similarly denies Merle's request to search for his brother but changes his mind and agrees to let Merle go with the Governor in tow on the condition that he obtain more information first. The Governor begins to develop a relationship with Andrea, who decides to stay in Woodbury for the time being, much to Michonne's dismay.

Carol offers assistance to a wounded T-Dog, but he refuses, given the fatal nature of his injury. After being blocked in the corridor on both sides, T-Dog sacrifices himself to ensure Carol's safety. Horrified at the sight of walkers eating T-Dog alive, Carol flees. On the other side of the building, Lori goes into labor. Carl successfully finds her, Maggie, and himself refuge in the boiler room. However, as Lori begins to push through her [[uterine contraction|contractions]], she begins to bleed profusely. Realizing that she will not survive childbirth, Lori reconciles with Carl and follows through with a fatal [[Caesarian section]] conducted by Maggie. A distraught Carl later shoots Lori's corpse to prevent reanimation.

Andrew (Markice Moore), the prisoner Rick had previously left at the hands of the walkers, reveals himself to be the perpetrator when he attacks Rick from behind as he arrives in the generator room with Daryl and Oscar. As the two men scuffle, Daryl secures the door against multiple walkers and Oscar picks up Rick's gun. Andrew pressures him to kill Rick, but Oscar kills Andrew, instead. Oscar hands the gun back to Rick, who shuts off the emergency generators. Glenn and Axel join them and on their way out the five discover T-Dog's remains as well as Carol's head-wrap, leading them to presume that she, too, had died. They reunite with Beth and Hershel out in the courtyard. As Rick prepares to go back in search of the others, Carl and Maggie emerge with the baby. Initially perplexed by Lori's absence, Rick collapses when he realizes she is dead.

"Killer Within" signified the final appearances of Sarah Wayne Callies and [[IronE Singleton]] as regulars. Although Callies suggested Lori's death to [[Frank Darabont]] on numerous occasions, [[Glen Mazzara]] made the decision to kill her off.<ref name=loridies/> The writing team chose to advance the revelation into the earlier part of the season, to provide "fresh" opportunities for the staff.<ref name=tv>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Walking-Dead-Lori-Death-Callies-Kirkman-Mazzara-1055530.aspx|title=The Walking Dead Bosses on Two Big Deaths: "It Was Not an Easy Decision"|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|date=November 4, 2012|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> Mazzara and Callies conversed minimally about how Lori would die, but Callies opted to wait until the script's release to acquire more insight given that her character "doesn<U+2019>t know she<U+2019>s going to die".<ref name=loridies/> She rehearsed and revised the dialogue with Mazzara for a couple of weeks. Some of the adjustments included things that Mazzara said weren't initially in the script. "I just thought, it belongs there," Callies stated.<ref name=loridies>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/11/04/sarah-wayne-callies-lori-walking-dead/|title=Sarah Wayne Callies (a.k.a.

To prepare for the death scene, Callies viewed the [[Stanley Kubrick]]-directed war film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) with Ferland. She liked [[Arliss Howard]]'s performance and described his character's demise as a brisk, "kind of strange death".<ref name=loridies/> Callies did not practice her character's death with Riggs. Instead, the final day enabled them to possess "so many emotions in [their] hearts" and to deliver an emotionally poignant and raw performance.<ref name=loridies/>

Producers trained Cohan to perform a Caesarian in preparation for the scene.<ref name=amm/> Callies wore a leotard-esque rig resembling a pregnant abdomen; a prosthetic abdomen was later glued onto the suit. This process took approximately one hour to complete.<ref name=amm/> Inside the prosthetic abdomen was additional layering that imitated a uterus, which held the fetus. An insert shot was taken while the abdomen was sliced open, emphasizing the uncontrollable blood flow. The liquid was pumped through a small tube that was attached to the front of the suit.<ref name=amm>{{cite video | people=|date=November 14, 2012 |title=The Making of Episode 304, Killer Within|format=Audio commentary |medium=Dialogue |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]}}</ref> 

Singleton was informed about his character's fate before production of the third season began,<ref name=amm/> and had to avoid arousing any suspicion from the public, particularly T-Dog's fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/11/tdog-may-be-gone-irone-here |title=T-Dog may be gone, but IronE is here |author=Harris, Will |date=November 8, 2012 |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |publisher=Hampton Roads |accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Singleton said about his character's "heroic" death: "When I read [the script], I was thankful that he would go out as a hero.

==Themes==
The central theme in "Killer Within" is death. T-Dog sacrifices himself to allow Carol to escape, while Lori dies after an improvised operation. Kirkman wanted Rick and Carl to develop a different psyche during the season<ref name=tv/> and Lori's death would serve as a catalyst for both characters' development. Rick's anguish manifests in much of the episode's concluding scene, leading Mazzara to believe that "everything is up in the air and anything could happen" once the group confronts the Governor.<ref name=hollz>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-lori-t-dog-robert-kirkman-glen-mazzara-386275|title='Walking Dead' Dissection: Robert Kirkman, Glen Mazzara on the Group's Major Fatalities|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> Kirkman agreed, proclaiming that not only was it inevitable, but it also develops Rick's character.<ref name=hollz/>

Both deaths were heroic by design and reflected their personal lives. Mazzara stated that T-Dog's stint as a football player became evident as "he just heroically acts as a linebacker and just clotheslines these walkers, even at his own expense."<ref name=tv/> Regarding Lori's demise, he professed that childbirth was heroic: "That heroism of a woman giving birth and paying a price and just being focused on the survival of her children is a beautiful story, and a story that's actually taken place millions of times throughout history."<ref name=tv/> In his article for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Darren Franich linked facets of Lori's death to the [[Book of Job]] and suggested that it acted as a "triple" [[catharsis]] for the character.<ref name=loridies2/> Franich perceived Lori's extramarital affair with [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] ([[Jon Bernthal]]) as an allegorical [[allusion]] to [[Original Sin]]<U+2014>a Christian theological concept of damnation<U+2014>which then transitions into an "optimistic [[New Testament]] vision of hope" as Lori comes to terms with her destiny. "She was confident, and fearless, and heroic," Franich concluded in his review for "Killer Within".<ref name=loridies2>{{cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/walking-dead-recap-lori-dead-tdog/|title='The Walking Dead' recap: Mommie Dearest|first=Darren Franich|last=Ross|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 16, 2012|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc}}</ref>

Hudson observed [[tribalism]] as a trope in "Killer Within", which he ascribed to the reluctance of Maggie, Rick and others in the group to allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. The ''Los Angeles Times'' journalist noted that these characters had been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past civilization for so long that they have reverted to "traveling in a small, tightly knit group, hunting and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part of their it as a deadly threat."<ref name=la/>

The fates of Lori and T-Dog garnered favorable reviews from television commentators. According to [[HitFix]] writer Alan Sepinwall, the moment when Lori and Carl share their goodbyes was the most heartbreaking event since the ending of the second season episode "[[Pretty Much Dead Already]]".<ref name=hit>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-the-walking-dead-killer-within-hard-labor|title=Review: 'The Walking Dead' - 'Killer Within': Hard labor|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Laura Hudson felt that it was a grim departure for a character that endured long bouts of grief for reasons beyond her control.<ref name=la>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-recap-of-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-20121105,0,4151616.story|title='Walking Dead' recap: No more kid stuff|first=Laura|last=Hudson|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> Erik Kain from ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine found Lori's death to be especially difficult to watch, and was shocked by T-Dog's "sudden" death despite the fact that he "was never as prominent a figure" on the program. "As hard as these deaths were to watch," Kain wrote, "they also give me faith in the show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/11/04/the-walking-dead-review-because-i-could-not-stop-for-death/|title='The Walking Dead' Review: Because I Could Not Stop For Death|first=Erik|last=Kain|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Publishing}}</ref> Even though he stated that T-Dog died "a hero's death", Michael Rapoport of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' concluded that Lori's "gut-churning" demise was the more memorable.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/11/05/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within-tv-recap/|title=<U+2018>The Walking Dead,<U+2019> Season 3, Episode 4, <U+2018>Killer Within<U+2019>: TV Recap|first=Michael|last=Rapoport|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Les Hinton]]|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

Lori's demise was featured in ''The Huffington Post''{{'s}} list of "The Biggest 'OMG' TV Moments of 2012",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/27/biggest-omg-tv-moments-2012_n_2371140.html|title=Brody's 'Homeland' Tape, Lane's 'Mad Men' Death And More: The Biggest 'OMG' TV Moments Of 2012 |work=The Huffington Post|publisher=Arianna Huffington|date=December 27, 2012|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> and placed nineteenth in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'s}} article covering the year's most noteworthy television moments. Journalist Chris Kirk said that the segment was "utterly surprising", and pointed out that the writers beguiled viewers by shedding light onto Lori's crumbled relationship with Rick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/features/2012/best_tv_2012/best_tv_2012_the_walking_dead_s_lori_s_childbirth.html|title=2012: The Year in TV Moments|first=Chris|last=Kirk|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|date=December 27, 2012|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> 

Some reviewers presented more negative critiques. Ted Pigeon of [[Slant Magazine]] asserted that although the latter half of the installment contained some of the show's most touching material, the methodology behind its narratives were "all too apparent".<ref name="SlantMagazineReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2012/11/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within/|title=The Walking Dead: Season 3, Episode 4, "Killer Within"|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=November 5, 2012|last=Pigeon|first=Ted |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in his review felt the episode "stumble[d]" in how T-Dog and Lori were eliminated and in how the Woodbury storyline repeated what was already known. Halden commented in his B+ review that "killing T-Dog and Lori earned the show an immediate thrill, but it also meant crossing off two potential sources of drama, people who had a history on the series, however thin or poorly developed that history might have been."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/killer-within,86863/|title=Killer Within |first=Zack |last=Handlen |date=November 4, 2012 |work=[[The A.V.

The performances of ''The Walking Dead'' ensemble was a frequent topic in the critiques. Lincoln's performance received kudos from various media outlets including [[HitFix]], ''Rolling Stone'', and ''Slate''.<ref name=rs/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-the-walking-dead-killer-within-hard-labor|title=Review: 'The Walking Dead' - 'Killer Within': Hard labor |first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/tv_club/features/2012/the_walking_dead_season_3_recaps/week_4_1/the_walking_dead_recap_episode_4_killer_within_reviewed.html|title=The Walking Dead, Season 3|author=Chris Kirk, Jeffrey Bloomer|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> To Goldman, Lincoln collapsing onto the ground was a "suitably powerful and evocative" gesture that epitomized the essence of the series. In addition, the IGN writer commended Callies, Riggs, and Cohan for their performances in "Killer Within".<ref name=ign/> Sepinwall added that Callies "absolutely sold" the portrayal of a mother saying "goodbye to the son who had to grow up much too quickly".<ref name=hit/>
