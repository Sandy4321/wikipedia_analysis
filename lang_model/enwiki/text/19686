}}'''1991 protest in Split''' was a [[street protest]] against the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' <U+2013> JNA) held in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]] on 6 May 1991. The protest was organised by the [[Croatian Trade Union Association]] in the [[Brodosplit]] Shipyard and joined in by workers from other companies in the city and other residents of Split after radio broadcast appeals for help while the protesters marched through the streets. Ultimately, the protest drew 100,000 supporters.

The march ended in a [[Picketing (protest)|picket]] in front of the Banovina building, where the JNA had its headquarters in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to [[1991 siege of Kijevo|the JNA-imposed blockade]] of the village of [[Kijevo, Croatia|Kijevo]]. Scuffles broke out in front of the building, and a JNA soldier was killed by a gunshot reportedly fired from the crowd. Four organisers of the protest were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a [[military court]] and convicted. They were released months later in a [[prisoner exchange]]. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its [[combat readiness]] there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest.

==Background==
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija'' <U+2013> JNA) then confiscated the weapons of Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] (''Teritorijalna obrana'') in order to minimize resistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}</ref> On 17 August, tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],<ref name=Hoare118>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=118}}</ref> centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around [[Knin]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}</ref> parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].<ref name=MarticICTY>{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}</ref> After two unsuccessful attempts by [[Republic of Serbia (1990<U+2013>2006)|Serbia]], supported by [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Serbia's provinces of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] to obtain the [[Yugoslav Presidency]]'s approval to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|pp=118<U+2013>119}}</ref> and [[Pakrac clash|a bloodless skirmish]] between Serb insurgents and [[Lu<U+010D>ko Anti-Terrorist Unit|Croatian special police]] in March,<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|pp=384<U+2013>385}}</ref> the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a [[state of emergency]]. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]]. Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than the preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expanding Serbia.<ref name=Hoare119>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=119}}</ref> By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to [[Plitvice Lakes incident|its first fatalities]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}</ref> The JNA intervened on the side of the insurgents, and prevented the [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian police]] from taking action.<ref name=Hoare119/> In early April, the leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intent to integrate the area under their control, viewed by the [[Government of Croatia]] as a breakaway region, with Serbia.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}</ref>

In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defences, it doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police.<ref name=BB86>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=86}}</ref> The Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved from January 1991. The initial plan of [[Croatian President]] [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]] was to win support from the [[European Community]] (EC) and the [[United States]] for Croatia, and he disregarded advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tu<U+0111>man's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=91}}</ref>

==Protest==
The immediate cause for a confrontation with the JNA in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] was a [[1991 siege of Kijevo|blockade of the village of Kijevo]], where Croatian authorities had established a new police station,<ref name=Woodward142>{{harvnb|Woodward|1995|p=142}}</ref> imposed on 29 April.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Shea|2005|loc=p. 214, note 30}}</ref> The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by [[Colonel]] [[Ratko Mladi<U+0107>]], and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies.<ref name=Gow154>{{harvnb|Gow|2003|p=154}}</ref> Tu<U+0111>man called on the public to bring the siege to its end.<ref name=Woodward142/>

The protest took place on 6 May 1991 in Split, organised by the [[Croatian Trade Union Association]] in [[Brodosplit]] Shipyard,<ref name=SD0605>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|6 May 2001}}</ref> in response to Tu<U+0111>man's earlier statement.<ref name=Woodward142/> The protest started out with 10,000 shipyard workers,<ref name=VL0605>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|6 May 2010}}</ref> but ultimately drew approximately 100,000 people,<ref name=BrigovicN10>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|loc=note 10}}</ref> from the shipyard and other factories in Split to a protest march through the city, carrying [[Croatian flag]]s.<ref name=SD0605/> The protest march grew in number as more citizens joined in, following radio broadcast messages calling for support. In order to prevent the  [[Yugoslav Navy]] from intervening using ships equipped with [[water cannon]]s, [[Jadrolinija]] ships were used to obstruct access to [[Port of Split|the port]].<ref name=VL0605/> The protesters [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] around the Banovina building,<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|pp=417<U+2013>418}}</ref> which housed the command centres of the JNA Military-Maritime District and the Yugoslav Navy at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=416}}</ref> The protesters demanded lifting of the blockade of [[Kijevo, Croatia|Kijevo]], withdrawal of [[armoured personnel carrier]]s parked in front of the Banovina building and hoisting of a Croatian flag on the building itself.<ref name=SD0605/>

During the protest, the crowd assaulted a JNA armoured personnel carrier and managed to remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Bali<U+0107>, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the [[Croatian anthem]] by the crowd.<ref name=VL0605/> In a scuffle which broke out in front of the building,<ref name=SD0605/> Sa<U+0161>ko Ge<U+0161>ovski, a JNA conscript from [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], was killed by a shot fired from the crowd.<ref name=SD2603>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|26 March 2011}}</ref> By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the [[Flag of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav flag]] from the building, moved away and dispersed.<ref name=SD0605/>

==Aftermath==
Besides Ge<U+0161>ovski, there were no fatalities, but several JNA soldiers were wounded.<ref name=BrigovicN10/> Death of Ge<U+0161>ovski provoked protests in [[Skopje]], Macedonia in June, where the protesters accused Tu<U+0111>man of the murder.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|1995|loc=p. 453, note 73}}</ref> Onesin Cvitan, mayor of Split at the time, claimed that Ge<U+0161>ovski was fired upon from the Banovina building, but Croatian State Attorney's Office contradicts him claiming that Ge<U+0161>ovski was killed by someone in the crowd picketing in front of the building. An investigation was launched but the case was dropped because of lack of evidence.<ref name=SD2603/> JNA's security service in Split, run by Colonel [[Ljubi<U+0161>a Beara]],<ref>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|12 June 2010}}</ref> identified Mato Sablji<U+0107>, Ivan Begonja, Roland Zvonari<U+0107> and Branko Glavinovi<U+0107> as organisers of the protest where the killing occurred and arrested them on 5 June. They were put on trial at a [[military court]] in [[Sarajevo]] on 19 August, convicted and sentenced to one and a half to eight years in prison. The group was imprisoned in [[Fo<U+010D>a]] until 25 November, when they were exchanged for JNA [[prisoners of war]].<ref name=BrigovicN10/> The protest is commemorated annually in Split and a [[monograph]] covering the event was issued in 2011.<ref name=SD2603/>

In the wake of the protest, the JNA increased [[combat readiness]] of its garrison in Split and elsewhere in Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from Split to its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up potable water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=418}}</ref> The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the [[Battle of the Barracks]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brigovi<U+0107>|2011|p=447}}</ref>

The siege of Kijevo was lifted days after the protest through negotiations and two weeks after the JNA blockaded the village. The arrangement proved short-lived, as the JNA units, again led by Mladi<U+0107>, attacked Kijevo destroying a substantial part of the village. The attack began when Croatian forces refused to surrender to Croatian Serb leader, [[Milan Marti<U+0107>]]. It was one of the first instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating [[Croatian War of Independence]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gow|2003|pp=154<U+2013>155}}</ref>
