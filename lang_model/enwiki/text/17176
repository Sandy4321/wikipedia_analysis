[[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] '''Radek Zelenka''' is a [[fictional character]] in the television series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]],'' portrayed by [[David Nykl]]. He is a scientist from the [[Czech Republic]] and a member of the original expedition from Earth to the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] city of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] in the Pegasus galaxy. His expertise on Ancient technology is only surpassed by Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], with whom he shares a friendly rivalry. Zelenka's planned one-time appearance in the season 1 episode "[[Thirty-Eight Minutes (Stargate Atlantis)|Thirty-Eight Minutes]]" was followed by a recurring role for [[expository writing|expository scenes]] with McKay and the leader of the expedition. Zelenka has since appeared in approximately half of each season's episodes and also appeared in the crossover episode "[[The Pegasus Project]]" of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. The series finale of ''Atlantis'', "[[Enemy at the Gate (Stargate Atlantis)|Enemy at the Gate]]", marks his last appearance. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 [[Leo Award]] in the category "Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male".

==Role in ''Stargate''==

Dr. Radek Zelenka is a careful and precise scientist of the original [[Atlantis Expedition]] who often supplements the scientific decisions of the "equally brainy" Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], with whom he has a friendly rivalry.<ref name=tvzones64 /><ref name=gw_czech /> He frequently appears in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition for expository scenes to lay out an episode's premise to the audience,<ref name=gw_czech /><ref name=gw_chron /> and is "a key player in helping the Atlantis team stay one step ahead of the bad guys as well as solving some of its most perplexing scientific conundrums".<ref name=culttimess45>{{Cite news |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Radekal Science |newspaper=[[Cult Times]] |issue=Special 45 |pages= |date=October 2007 |url=http://www.visimag.com/culttimes/cs45_feat01.htm |accessdate=2008-02-28 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> [[GateWorld]]'s David Read felt that while Zelenka may "play second fiddle to Rodney",<ref name=gw_minute /> he is also "the only one who even has the potential to put McKay down."<ref name=gw_chron /> Actor David Nykl explained that Zelenka has "reasonably well honed social skills" and "can put up with a lot of stress [...] and a lot of pressure, particularly from McKay and the situations that he can get into", but he may be too focused and determined to get one thing done.<ref name=gateroom>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-gateroom.com/articles/davidn.html |title=David Nykl - Interviewed 19th July 2006 |publisher=the-gateroom.com |date=July 19, 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

==Conceptual history==
[[File:David Nykl at collectormania gmex3.jpg|thumb|David Nykl at Collectormania G-Mex 3]]
From the beginning of ''Stargate Atlantis'', the producers were looking for actors to play non-Americans to present the cooperation between different nations and other groups of people in an alien environment. When actor [[David Nykl]] mentioned his [[Czech Canadian]] background during his audition for a Russian character for the season 1 episode "[[Thirty-Eight Minutes]]", the producers changed the character's nationality to Czech and cast him. Nykl made such an impression that producer [[Brad Wright]] wrote Zelenka into the [[Rodney McKay]] ([[David Hewlett]]) scenes of the next episode, "[[Suspicion (Stargate Atlantis)|Suspicion]]".<ref name=gw_chron>{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/chronicles_of_radek.shtml |title=Chronicles of Radek &ndash; GateWorld talks with David Nykl |publisher=''[[GateWorld]]'' |month=June | year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref><ref name=ac_a_110 /><ref name=companion1>{{cite book |last=Gosling |first=Sharon |title=Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 |origyear=2005 |publisher=Titan Books |location=London |isbn=1-84576-116-2 | pages=131&ndash;133 |chapter=Recurring cast |year=2005 |month=July}}</ref> 

Zelenka was re-introduced in the mid-season-1 finale "[[The Storm (Stargate Atlantis)|The Storm]]", [[Martin Gero]]'s second ''Atlantis'' episode. Gero had had difficulty with laying out the dangers of the storm and its solution in a quick and entertaining manner with just the McKay character, and Brad Wright was not opposed to introducing another expository character.<ref name=ac_a_110>{{cite video |people=[[Martin Gero]] |date=2005 |title=Audio commentary for "[[The Storm (Stargate Atlantis)|The Storm]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[MGM]]}}</ref> Zelenka has since frequently appeared for expository scenes in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition.<ref name=gw_czech /><ref name=gw_chron /> Zelenka's given name is first mentioned by McKay in the season 1 finale "[[The Siege (Stargate Atlantis)|The Siege]]";<ref>{{cite episode |episodelink=The Siege (Stargate Atlantis) |title=The Siege (Part 1) |series=Stargate Atlantis |serieslink=Stargate Atlantis |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Martin Gero]] |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=1 |number=4}}
* '''McKay:''' Okay, I think I can handle this alone, Radek. Isn't there something better you could be doing?"</ref> McKay had previously been unable to remember Zelenka's name.<ref name="Thirty-Eight Minutes">{{cite episode |episodelink=Thirty-Eight Minutes |title=Thirty-Eight Minutes |series=Stargate Atlantis |serieslink=Stargate Atlantis |credits=[[Mario Azzopardi]] |writers=[[Brad Wright]] |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=1 |number=4}}

* '''Weir:''' "Okay, so we should still evacuate." '''/ McKay:''' "Yes, but not just because of Zelemka's pessimism." '''/ Zelenka:''' "Zelenka."</ref> The producers chose "Radek", a fairly common Czech given name, without input from Nykl.<ref name=gw_chron /> When Colonel [[Samantha Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]) replaced Dr. [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] ([[Torri Higginson]]) as the leader of the Atlantis expedition in season 4, the producers shifted the emphasis of Zelenka's collaboration with McKay to his interaction with Carter.<ref name=gw_minute /> By the end of the show's run, the interactions between Zelenka and McKay become more subtle to the point where they finish each other's sentences and need fewer words and expressions to get by.<ref name=gw_words>{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/words_of_radek.shtml |title=Words of Radek &ndash; GateWorld talks with David Nykl |month=September |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

Since Zelenka's first appearance, David Nykl's fluent [[Czech language|Czech]] was worked into ''Stargate Atlantis'' as part of Zelenka. Approximately half of Zelenka's Czech lines were scripted (in English), which Nykl then translated verbatim. The other half was ad-libbed and usually included swearing.<ref name=gw_czech /><ref name=gw_chron /> His usual Czech exclamations include [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ty_vole Ty vole] and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/do_prdele Do prdele] . Nykl found it increasingly hard to remember to put on the accent as the show went on.<ref name=gw_words /> The late season 1 episode "[[Letters from Pegasus]]" features a minute-long non-subtitled monologue in which Zelenka describes the city of Atlantis in his mothertongue. Nykl translated the scripted monolog at home and performed it in Czech the next day. A version in English was initially planned to be filmed but was dropped after Nykl's successful first take. The end of Zelenka's video message ("dr<U+017E> se mil<U+00E1><U+010D>ku" &ndash; "take care, darling") was ad-libbed, but Nykl left it to the writers to create Zelenka's backstory.<ref name=gateroom /> But during the show's run, Zelenka only ever mentions having a brother,<ref name="Tao of Rodney" /> a sister, and a nephew,<ref name="Critical Mass">{{cite episode |episodelink=Critical Mass (Stargate Atlantis) |title=Critical Mass |series=Stargate Atlantis |serieslink=Stargate Atlantis |credits=[[Andy Mikita]] |writers=[[Carl Binder]] |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=2 |number=13}}
* '''Zelenka:''' "My sister has a child. He breaks things."</ref> and is never shown to be or have been in a romantic relationship.

==Reception==

Often informing his superiors of critical situations, Zelenka earned the nickname "Mr. Bad News" among fans.<ref name=tvzones64>{{Cite news |last=Eramo |first=Steven |author-link= | title=David Nykl &ndash; Mr Bad News |newspaper=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 67 |pages=78&ndash;79 |date=January 2007 |url= |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name=gw_czech /> In an interview with David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens referred to Zelenka as a "popular" and "interesting" character, and compared Zelenka's apparitions in ''Atlantis'' to those of the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' character [[Walter Harriman (Stargate)|Walter Harriman]], "a bit like the icing on the cake".<ref>{{cite web |last=Nuytens |first=Gilles |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/david_nykl_01.htm |title=Interview with David Nykl |publisher=thescifiworld.net |date=September 15, 2005 |accessdate=2008-02-25}}</ref> Another interviewer mentioned that, following a "warm reception", the "fans have really taken [Zelenka] to heart".<ref name=gateroom /> When ''GateWorld'' hypothesized that viewers were looking forward to an episode where the "underdog" Zelenka saves the day instead of McKay, Nykl replied that the set-up dynamic earns the character more sympathy from the audience.<ref name=gw_words /> For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 [[Leo Award]] in the category "Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374455/awards |title=Awards for Stargate Atlantis |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref>
