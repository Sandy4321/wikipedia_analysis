'''Alejandro "Alex" Rodr<U+00ED>guez Olmedo''' (born March 24, 1936 in [[Arequipa]]) is a former tennis player from [[Peru]] with [[United States|American]] citizenship, who was ranked as the top amateur player in the world in 1959. Although born and raised in Peru, he came to Southern California and was mentored by Perry T. Jones, President of the Southern California Tennis Association<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers <U+2013> Perry Jones|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/perry-jones|publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>  at the [[Los Angeles Tennis Club|Los Angeles Tennis Club (LATC)]].  [[George Toley]] recruited him to play for the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]], as he wrote in his book "The Golden Age of College Tennis, 2009".  Olmedo  graduated with a Business Degree from USC. While there, he won the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) Singles and Doubles Championships in 1956 and 1958.<ref name=si>{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1013916/index.htm |title=Alex Olmedo, Tennis Champion |work=Sports illustrated |date=September 7, 1998 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> (In 1957, USC was excluded from NCAA competition.)

Perry T. Jones became Davis Cup Captain in 1958 and recruited Olmedo to play on the team.  He represented the U.S. in [[Davis Cup]] competition in 1958 and 1959, winning in both singles and doubles <U+2013> achieving 2 of the 3 points required to win the Cup. His teammates were [[Ham Richardson]] and [[Barry MacKay]], when they won the Cup in 1958.<ref name=time>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937085,00.html |title=Hail to the Chief |publisher=[[Time (magazine)]] |date=January 12, 1959 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>  Even though he was not a U.S. citizen, he was technically eligible to represent the U.S. in Davis Cup because he had lived in the country for at least five years and because his country of citizenship, Peru, did not have a Davis Cup team. His participation was very controversial, however. Sports columnist Arthur Dailey at the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, "This would seem to be the saddest day in the history of American tennis. A few more such rousing victories and the prestige of this country in tennis will sink to a new low."  Olmedo himself refused to file for U.S. citizenship, said he was content to remain a Peruvian citizen, and denied he was ducking U.S. citizenship to avoid being drafted into the Army. Still, many Americans "took a dim view of the largest nation in the competition stooping to borrow a little player from Peru to win the Cup".<ref name=Ledger>"While Critics Cry, He Wins", ''Lakeland Ledger'', August 23, 1959, page 19.</ref>

Olmedo won the [[Australian Open|Australian Championships]] and the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] singles titles in 1959 and was the runner-up at the 1959 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], losing to [[Neale Fraser]], who he defeated in the Australian Championships earlier that year. At 1959 Wimbledon, he defeated [[Rod Laver]] in 71 minutes 6<U+2013>4, 6<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>4. Olmedo turned professional in 1960, and that year won the [[U.S. Pro Tennis Championships|US Pro]] title by beating [[Tony Trabert]] in the final

Olmedo was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1987.<ref name=hof>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/alex-olmedo|title=Alejandro Olmedo |publisher=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> Olmedo was the first Latin American to win the Wimbledon men's singles title. He spent over 40 years teaching tennis at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] in California.
