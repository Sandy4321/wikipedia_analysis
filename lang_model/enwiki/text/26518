'''Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann''' ([[10th April]] [[1755]] in [[Mei<U+00DF>en]], [[Saxony]] - [[2nd July]] [[1843]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]) was a German physician who founded [[homoeopathy|homoeopathic medicine]]. Hahnemann is also credited with introducing the practice of [[quarantine]] during his employment with the Duke of [[Anhalt-K<U+00F6>then]]. 

An impressive  [http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0001740.htm monument] in [[Washington, D.C.]], commemorates Hahnemann's life and works.

==Life==
Born Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann in [[Meissen]], [[Saxony]], on [[April 10]], [[1755]], Hahnemann showed early proficiency at languages; ''"by twenty he had mastered [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]],"'' <ref>http://www.skylarkbooks.co.uk/Hahnemann_Biography.htm</ref> and was making a living as a translator and teacher of languages. He later gained proficiency in ''"[[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], Chaldaic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]."'' <ref>http://www.skylarkbooks.co.uk/Hahnemann_Biography.htm</ref>

Hahnemann studied medicine at [[Leipzig]] and [[Vienna]]. He received his doctor of medicine degree at the [[University of Erlangen]] on 10 August [[1779]], qualifying with honors with a thesis on the treatment of cramps. He began practicing as a doctor in [[1781]]. ''"Shortly thereafter he married Johanna Henriette Kuchler"''<ref>http://www.skylarkbooks.co.uk/Hahnemann_Biography.htm</ref>; they had eleven children.

Through his practice, Hahnemann quickly discovered that the medicine of his day did as much harm as good:
:''"My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing."'' <ref>http://www.skylarkbooks.co.uk/Hahnemann_Biography.htm</ref>

After giving up his practice he made his living chiefly as a writer and translator. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[Cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann realised that other astringent substances are not effective against [[malaria]] and began to research [[cinchona]]'s effect on the human organism very directly: by self-application. He discovered that the drug evoked malaria-like symptoms in himself, and concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: ''"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms."'' <ref>http://www.skylarkbooks.co.uk/Hahnemann_Biography.htm</ref> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the first of a new medicinal approach to which he gave the name [[homeopathy]].

Hahnemann began systematically testing substances for the effect they produced on a healthy individual and trying to deduce from this the ills they would heal. He quickly discovered that ingesting substances to produce noticeable changes in the organism resulted in toxic effects. His next task was to solve this problem, which he did through exploring dilutions of the compounds he was testing. He claimed that these dilutions, when done according to his technique of [[succussion]] (systematic mixing through vigorous shaking) and [[potentization]], were still effective in producing symptoms.  However, these effects have never been duplicated in [[clinical trials]], and his approach has been universally abandoned by modern medicine.[citation needed]

Hahnemann began practicing this new technique, which soon attracted other doctors. He first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[Germany|German]] medical journal in [[1796]]; in [[1810]], he wrote his ''Organon of the Medical Art'', the first systematic treatise on the subject.

Hahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life. He died in [[1843]] in [[Paris]], 88 years of age, and is entombed in a mausoleum at [[Paris]]'s [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise]] cemetery.

== Other Achievements ==

Although most famous today as the founder of [[homeopathy]], this was not the sole focus of his research. Some of his other discoveries are still in use today, such as the potent [[Marsh test]] (for the presence of arsenic in solids). It involved combining a sample fluid with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of hydrochloric acid. A yellow precipitate, arsenic trisulfide, would be formed if arsenic were present. 

Some of Hahnemann's notable works include:
*''Versuch <U+00FC>ber ein neues Prinzip zur Auffindung der Heilkr<U+00E4>fte der Arzneisubstanzen, nebst einigen Blicken auf die bisherigen'', (''Hufelands Journal der practischen Arzneykunde'', [[1796]]) 
*''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'' ([[1810]]) explains the theory of homeopathic medicine. Hahnemann published the 5th edition in [[1833]]; an unfinished 6th edition was discovered after Hahnemann's death but not published until [[1921]].
*''[[Materia Medica Pura]]'' is a compilation of [[homoeopathic proving]] reports, published in six volumes during the [[1820s]] (vol. VI in [[1827]].) Revised editions of volumes I and II were published in [[1830]] and [[1833]], respectively.
*''Chronic Diseases'' (1828) is an elucidation of the root and cure of [[chronic disease]], according to the theory of [[homeopathy]], together with a compilation of [[homoeopathic proving]] reports, published in five volumes during the [[1830s]].
