'''Pablo Curatella Manes''' (December 14, 1891{{ndash}}November 14, 1962) was a prolific Argentine sculptor.

==Life and work==
Born in [[La Plata]] in 1891 to Clara Manes, a [[Greek Argentine]] immigrant, and Antonio Curatella, from [[Italian Argentine|Italy]], Curatella Manes first acquired an interest in sculpture during his frequent childhood visits to the newly-inaugurated La Plata Fine Arts Museum. He entered the labor force in 1905 as a [[typographer]] in a [[printing]] house, though an accident some months later ended his career in that industry. Drawing on his chldhood interest, he was taught the basics of sculpture by Arturo Dresco, who owned a local [[atelier]].<ref name=pablo>[http://www.pablo-curatella-manes.com/ Pablo Curatella Manes: Biograf<U+00ED>a {{es icon}}]</ref> 

The Curatellas relocated to [[Buenos Aires]], where the young sculptor enrolled in the [[National University Art Institute|National Fine Arts School]] in 1907. A rebellious streak promptly led to his expulsion, though Curatella earned an apprenticeship in 1908 under Lucio Correa Morales, with whom he worked on a number of works commissioned by Public Parks Director [[Charles Thays]]. Following the 1910 elections, he created a commemorative gold medal for Vice President-elect [[Victorino de la Plaza]], who secured a scholarship for Curatella that took him to [[Florence]] and [[Rome]]. Curatella traveled extensively in [[Italy]], as well as much of [[western Europe]], touring the region's museums and cathedrals. On his return to Argentina in 1912, National Fine Arts School director [[Ernesto de la C<U+00E1>rcova]] nearly ordered the funds' repayment, objecting to travel and activities not covered by the scholarship, desisting from the punishment after being shown a folio of Curatella's prolific work.<ref name=pablo/>

His first Buenos Aires exhibit, in 1912, was followed by a return to Europe. He settled in the [[Montparnasse]] section of [[Paris]] and studied under [[Aristide Maillol]] and [[Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]], but was forced to return home after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In his native La Plata, he opened an [[art gallery]], the ''Sal<U+00F3>n de Oto<U+00F1>o'' (Autumn Salon) in 1916. A brief return in 1917 to Paris, where Curatella worked under Maillol, [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Paul S<U+00E9>rusier]], was eventually followed by a second scholarship, with which he settled in Paris in 1920. Studying under [[Henri Laurens]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Constantin Brancusi]] and [[Le Corbusier]], Curatella explored [[Cubism]], and his sculptures became more [[Modernism|avant-garde]]; he also established his first atelier, where he acquired the habit of creating and destroying sculptures in a single day.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/pablo-curatella-manes-1 Answers.com: Pablo Curatella Manes]</ref>

He married French painter Germaine Derbecqre in 1922 and in 1926, was given a post in the Argentine Embassy. Returning to Argentina in 1929, he exhibited ''Las Tres Gracias'' (The Three Graces), which marked a departure towards the [[Abstract art|Abstract]] which would typify his work in subsequent years. Commissioned to create wall [[relief]]s for the Argentine Pavillion in the [[1937 Paris Exhibition]], Curatella returned to France and opened an atelier on rue Lauriston, in Paris. His monumental ''Tierra Argentina'' and ''Los Dos Hemisferios'' ("Argentina" and "The Two Hemispheres") earned him the honor of serving in the Paris Exhibition's sculpture jury, and following the event, he was made an Officer of the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]. Reappointed to the embassy in 1939 as a [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]], Curatella oversaw the repatriation of Argentine nationals in France following the [[Nazi invasion of France]] in 1940. Following [[World War II]], he oversaw the reopening of the Argentine Embassy, as well as the reconstruction of the [[Boulogne-Sur-Mer]] home where the hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]],  General [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]], died in 1850.
 
Curatella continued to sculpt during his diplomatic tenure, and was among those who in 1946 reinaugurated the [[Salon des Ind<U+00E9>pendants]], an artists' society and exhibit series banned by the [[Vichy regime]]. He remained active in the salon until being transfered to the Embassy in [[Athens]] in 1949, upon which he donated thirty-one works to the Argentine government for the purpose of creating a museum of modern art (which were added to the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Museum of Fine Arts]], instead). He contributed to [[Unesco]] festivals and was appointed to the organizing committee for [[Expo 58]], while accepting a commission from architect [[Mario Roberto <U+00C1>lvarez]] for two reliefs, ''El Drama'' and ''La Comedia'', for display in the public [[Teatro General San Mart<U+00ED>n|San Mart<U+00ED>n Theatre]], inaugurated in 1960. Curatella returned to the diplomatic corps in 1958, as an official in the Argentine Embassy in [[Brussels]], whereby he oversaw the Argentine pavillion at Expo 58 and was honored with the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]]. Invited as a commissioner of the 1961 Paris [[Biennale]], he reopened his rue Lauriston atelier. His ''El Guitarrista'' and ''Torso Femenino'' were acquired by the [[Modern Art Museum of the City of Paris]], but a sudden illness forced the noted sculptor to return to Buenos Aires, where he died in 1962, at age 70.<ref name=pablo/> 

He lived to see his vision for the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]], which was opened in 1956 by art critic [[Rafael Squirru]]; a number of Curatella's works are among its collections.<ref>[http://www.museodeartemoderno.buenosaires.gov.ar/mam_colecciones.htm Museo de Arte Moderno {{es icon}}]</ref>
