The '''Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire''' in [[New York City]] on March 25, 1911, was the deadliest [[industry|industrial]] [[disaster]] in the history of the city of New York and resulted in the fourth highest loss of life from an industrial accident in U.S. history. The fire caused the deaths of 146 [[garment worker]]s, who either died from the fire or jumped to their deaths. Most of the victims were recent Jewish and Italian immigrant women; the youngest were two fourteen-year-old girls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/triangle/trianglevictims2.html |title=List of Victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire  |work=Famous Trials |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/triangle-shirtwaist-fire "Triangle Shirtwaist Fire"].

People jumped from the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory [[Occupational safety and health|safety standards]] and helped spur the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]], which fought for better working conditions for [[sweatshop]] workers.

The factory was located in the Asch Building, at 29 Washington Place, now known as the [[Brown Building (Manhattan)|Brown Building]], which has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]].<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/brown.pdf NYC Landmark]</ref>

Under the ownership of Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women's blouses, known as "shirtwaists." The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young [[immigrant]] women, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays.<ref name=drehle>von Drehl, p. 105</ref>

[[Image:TriangleFireengine.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A horse-drawn fire engine en route to the burning factory.]]

As the workday was ending on the afternoon of Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire flared up at approximately 4:45 PM<ref>Stein, p. 224</ref> in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor.<ref>von Drehle, p. 118.</ref> Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon.<ref name="von Drehle, p. 163"/> The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings by the time of the fire.<ref>Stein p.33</ref> Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection.<ref>von Drehle, 119</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the [[sewing machine]]s, while ''The Insurance Monitor'', a leading industry journal, suggested that the epidemic of fires among shirtwaist manufacturers was "fairly saturated with moral hazard."<ref name="von Drehle, p. 163">von Drehle, p. 163</ref> No one suggested arson.

A bookkeeper on the eighth floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone, but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the ninth floor.<ref>von Drehle, 131</ref> According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself.<ref>von Drehle, 141<U+2013>2</ref> Although the floor had a number of exits <U+2013> two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place <U+2013> flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft. The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route.<ref>PBS: [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/introduction/triangle-intro/ "Introduction: Triangle Fire"], accessed March 1, 2011</ref> Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.

[[Image:Triangle Bodies.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The building's east side, with 40 bodies on the sidewalk. Two of the victims were found alive an hour after the photo was taken.]]

Within three minutes, the Greene Street stairway became unusable in both directions.<ref>von Drehle, 143<U+2013>4</ref> Terrified employees crowded onto the single exterior [[fire escape]], a flimsy and poorly-anchored iron structure which may have been broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling victims nearly {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off}} to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito<ref>von Drehle, 157</ref> and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped down the empty shaft. The weight of these bodies made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt.

A large crowd of bystanders gathered on the street, witnessing sixty-two people jumping or falling to their deaths from the burning building.<ref>{{cite web | last = Shepherd| first = William G. | date = 1911-03-27 | title =Eyewitness at the Triangle| accessdate = 2007-09-02| url = http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/texts/stein_ootss/ootss_wgs.html?location=Fire!| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> [[Louis Waldman]], later a New York Socialist state assemblyman, described the scene years later:<ref>Waldman, ''Labor Lawyer,'' E.P.

{{quote|One Saturday afternoon in March of that year <U+2014> March 25, to be precise <U+2014> I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire.

A few blocks away, the Asch Building at the corner of Washington Place and Greene Street was ablaze. When we arrived at the scene, the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze. The eighth, ninth, and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames.

Word had spread through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds <U+2014> I among them <U+2014> looked up at the burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the pavement below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.

The emotions of the crowd were indescribable. Women were hysterical, scores fainted; men wept as, in paroxysms of frenzy, they hurled themselves against the police lines.}}

The remainder waited until smoke and fire overcame them. The fire department arrived quickly but was unable to stop the flames, as there were no ladders available that could reach beyond the sixth floor. The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.

==Consequences==
The company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first and second degree [[manslaughter]] in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911.<ref>Stein p.158</ref> [[Max Steuer]], counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times <U+2014> which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The defense also stressed that the prosecution had failed to prove that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The jury acquitted the two men, but they lost a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs won compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty. In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20.<ref name="Hoenig">Hoenig, John M.

[[Rose Schneiderman]], a prominent [[Socialist Party of America|socialist]] and union activist, gave a speech at the memorial meeting held in the [[Metropolitan Opera]] House on April 2, 1911, to an audience largely made up of the members of the Women's Trade Union League. She used the fire as an argument for factory workers to organize:

<blockquote>I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting. ... We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.<p>Public officials have only words of warning to us--warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.<p>I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/primary/testimonials/ootss_RoseSchneiderman.html |format= reprint |title= We Have Found You Wanting |first= Rose|last= Schneiderman}}</ref></blockquote>
