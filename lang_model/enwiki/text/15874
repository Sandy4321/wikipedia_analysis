'''Australian television''' began in transmission in [[Sydney]] on the [[September 16|16th of September]], [[1956]] and has since grown to cover the entire country. Local programming, over the years, has included a broad range [[comedy]], [[sport]], and in particular [[drama]] series, in addition to [[news]] and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]]. The industry is regulated by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]. 

The new [[Media in Australia|medium]] was introduced by [[Bruce Gyngell]] with the words 'Good evening, and welcome to television',<ref name="50Years">{{cite web| title = Australia celebrates 50 years of television| publisher = [[News Limited]]| url = http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,20357015-5007183,00.html| date = 2006-09-05| accessdate = 2007-08-01

===Origins===
[[Image:WelcomeToTelevision.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bruce Gyngell]] introducing television to [[Sydney]] on [[TCN-9]].]]
Planning for television in Australian began in the [[1940]]s, however it was delayed as a result of [[World War II]].<ref name="His50">{{cite web

}}</ref> In [[1954]], the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies Government]] announced the introduction of one government-funded service and two commercial services in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]]. The [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]] was a major driving force behind the introduction of television to Australia.<ref name="His50" /> [[TCN|TCN-9]] [[Sydney]] began test transmissions on [[September 16]] of that year, and officially commenced broadcasting on [[October 27]].<ref name="His50" /> [[GTV|GTV-9]] became the first television station to broadcast to viewers in [[Melbourne]] on [[September 27]], and was soon followed by [[HSV-7]] and [[ABV-2]], with [[Sydney]] station [[ABN (TV station)|ABN-2]] soon after. All of these stations were operational in time for the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics opening ceremony, on [[November 22]], [[1956]].

These initial licenses were regulated by the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]], a government agency responsible for the regulatory side of television licensing (engineering was handled by the [[Postmaster-General's Department]]).

At this time it was relatively difficult to record and distribute local programming, meaning the majority of content was produced locally and shown live to air, often based on popular radio formats - musical variety and quiz formats were quite popular.<ref name="freetvaus-history">{{cite web

As the new medium's popularity increased, broadcasters began to import content from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for programming.<ref name="50Years" /> Local content was limited to talk and variety shows, and news and current affairs.<ref name="culturegov-history" /> Notable programs of the [[1950]]s included [[TCN-9]]'s music program ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'', hosted by radio presenter [[Brian Henderson]], [[HSV-7]]'s weekly sport program ''[[World of Sport (Australian TV series)|World of Sport]]'', and the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission|ABC]]'s ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]'', hosted by [[Johnny O'Keefe]]. The first Australian serial drama, ''[[Autumn Affair]]'', ran for a 10-month run on [[ATN-7]]. Several programs in the [[1950s]] were simply rebroadcasts of established radio programs, such as Bob Dyer's ''Pick-a-box''.

===1960s===
The [[1960]]'s saw the continued growth of television in [[Australia]], particularly into regional areas. Amongst the first regional stations to be established were BTV-6 [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], [[NBN-3]] Newcastle and [[TNT-9]] Launceston.<ref name="His60">{{cite web

While the first television services were being established in regional areas, larger cities including [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] began to receive their second and, in the mid-[[1960]]s, third stations. In order to reduce costs, networks began to emerge - originally in [[1957]] between [[HSV-7]] and [[TCN-9]], but later between almost all the metropolitan stations of a certain frequency. This led to the formation of the National Television Network (forerunner to the [[Nine Network]]) and Australian Television Network (later known as the [[Seven Network]] in [[1962]]. 
Not all stations became a part of their respective networks - [[TVW-7]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]] remained independent for a number of years as the sole commercial station in the city. Throughout the decade the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] expanded transmissions to several major centres including [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]], [[Hobart]] and [[Canberra]].

[[Image:Lane and Kennedy split screen.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Don Lane]] appearing split-screen with [[Graham Kennedy]] via coaxial cable, live on [[In Melbourne Tonight]].]]

The establishment of a coaxial cable link between [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], as well as the introduction of [[Satellite television|satellite broadcasting]] allowed news stories and programs to be accessed from around the world. The first live satellite transmission occurred between Australia and the [[United Kingdom]] in [[1966]], by [[1970]] as many as thirty-one programs were received via this manner.<ref name="His60"/> [[GTV-9]] in [[Melbourne]] broke records in [[1969]] with the longest live television broadcast with its coverage of the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landing]].<ref name="His60" />

A number of television programs were launched in the [[1960]]s, most notably [[Melbourne]] police drama ''[[Homicide (TV series)|Homicide]]'' on [[HSV-7]], ''[[Bellbird (TV series)|Bellbird]]'' on the ABC, and for interstate viewers [[Graham Kennedy]]'s ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' or the ''Graham Kennedy Channel Nine Show''.<ref name="culturegov-history" /> In addition to these, many programs still seen today were launched at this time including the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s acclaimed current affairs program ''[[Four Corners (TV series)|Four Corners]]'' and ''[[Play School]]'' - now the country's longest-running children's show, as well as the [[Nine Network]]'s ''[[Here's Humphrey]]''.<ref name="culturegov-history" />

Winners of the first nationally-shown [[TV Week]] [[Logie Award]]s included ''In Melbourne Tonight'' host [[Graham Kennedy]] - twice, ''Pick-a-box'' host Bob Dyer, [[Lorrae Desmond]] from ABC's ''The Lorrae Desmond Show'', ''Four Corners'' reporter Michael Charlton, [[Bobby Limb]], [[Jimmy Hannan]], [[Gordon Chater]], [[Brian Henderson]] and Hazel Philips.<ref name="His60" />

Numerous television stations were launched, mainly concentrated around southern and eastern parts of the country. By the turn of the decade, the takeup of television had increased dramatically - by [[1960]] up to 70% of homes in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] had a television set. Following its introduction to regional centres and other capital cities through the late [[1950]]s and [[1960]]s over 90% of Australian homes in established markets had a television set.<ref name="freetvaus-history" /> The new medium had also become highly lucrative to advertisers.

===1970s===
Following the new medium's establishment in most major metropolitan and regional centres, television continued to expand to remote areas, most notably those in the northern and western parts of Australia - [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], for example, did not receive television until [[ABD (TV station)|ABD-6]] and [[NTD|NTD-8]] launched in [[1971]]. Similarly, [[Golden West Network|VEW-8]] launched in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]] on [[June 18]], [[1971]], and [[QQQ|ITQ-8]] launched in [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]] on [[September 11]], [[1971]].

In [[1972]] it was announced that all stations will move to colour on [[March 1]], [[1975]], using the European [[PAL]] standard mandated in [[1968]].<ref name="His60" /><ref name="His70">{{cite web

[[Image:Malcolm Thompson and Suzanne Church in Number 96.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Malcolm Thompson]] and Suzanne Church in [[soap opera]], ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]''.]]

Government subsidies provided for the production of local series led to a boom in Australian-produced content. Some of the most popular series launched included [[Crawford Productions]]' ''[[Matlock Police]]'', ''[[Young Talent Time]]'', ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'', which ran for 28 years until [[1999]], music show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', and [[World War II]]-themed drama [[The Sullivans]].<ref name="culturegov-history" /> ''[[Against the Wind (TV series)|Against the Wind]]'', the first major mini-series produced for commercial television, was shown on the [[Seven Network]], while hospital drama [[The Young Doctors]] ran for 1396 episodes. The [[Network Ten|0/10 Network]], as it was then known, screened the first controversial first episode of [[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]] in [[1972]].<ref name="culturegov-history" /><ref name="His70" />

[[Graham Kennedy]] returned to the [[Nine Network]] after his departure from ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' with ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'' in [[1973]], but was banned from appearing from television in [[1975]] after an infamous 'crow-call' incident.<ref name="His70" /> Kennedy subsequently returned in [[1977]] as the host of ''[[Blankety Blanks]]''. In [[1979]], commercial stations were mandated to provide 'C'-classified programming targeted at children between 4-5pm, and a minimum of 30 minutes of pre-school programming prior to that. These regulations saw the establishment of a number of children's series including ''Simon Townsend's Wonder World'' and ''Shirl's Neighbourhood''.<ref name="His70" />

News and current affairs, particularly on commercial television, grew significantly - the [[Nine Network]]'s [[A Current Affair (Australia)|A Current Affair]], hosted by [[Mike Willesee]] began in [[November]], [[1971]], while [[60 Minutes (Australia)|60 Minutes]], on the same network, began in [[1979]].<ref name="culturegov-history" /><ref name="His70" /> In [[1972]] [[NBN Television]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] is the first station in Australia to adopt a one-hour news format,<ref name="His70" /> followed by [[ATV-0]] [[Melbourne]]'s ''[[Eyewitness News]]'', hosted by [[Bruce Mansfield]] and Annette Allison, in [[March]], [[1978]].<ref name="His70" />

A special [[Logie Award|Gold Logie Award]] was awarded to the [[Apollo 11]] crew in [[1970]], alongside actors [[Barry Crocker]] and [[Maggie Tabberer]]. Other Gold Logie winners included [[Gerard Kennedy]], [[Tony Barber]], [[Graham Kennedy]], [[Pat McDonald]], [[Ernie Sigley]] and [[Denise Drysdale]] in the first awards presentation shown in colour, [[Don Lane]], [[Jeanne Little]], and [[Bert Newton]].<ref name="His70" />

Sports broadcasting became increasingly sophisticated through the [[1970]]s. [[ABC TV]], the [[Seven Network]] and the [[Nine Network]] joined together to broadcast the [[1976 Olympic Games]] in [[Montreal]], with the opening and closing ceremonies telecast live, and highlights packages shown each night. During [[November]] of the same year, [[WIN Television|RTS-5a]] commenced transmissions in [[Riverland]], with [[Golden West Network|GTW-11]] launching in [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] on [[January 21]], [[1977]].

In [[1977]] the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football Leage]] [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] was shown live to [[Melbourne]] viewers for the first time.<ref name="His70" /> As with the Olympics, the [[1978]] [[Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton, Canada]] were shown in the form of highlights packages on ABC TV.

The [[Special Broadcasting Service]], originally a group of radio stations broadcasting government information to ethnic minorities in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], begins test transmissions on [[ABC TV]] in the two cities - mainly showing foreign-language programming on Sunday mornings.<ref name="sbs-timeline">{{cite web

===1980s===
The country's second national public broadcaster, the [[Special Broadcasting Service]], launched [[SBS TV]] in [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] in [[October]], [[1980]]. The new station, aimed at Australia's growing [[multicultural]] population, placed a much heavier emphasis on subtitled or foreign-language content. The network expanded to cover [[Canberra]] and Goulbern in [[1983]], followed by [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong]] and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[June]] [[1985]]. It is now available in most areas.

Although [[Australia]] had seen the introduction of the [[satellite]] in the [[1960]]'s, [[1986]] saw the introduction of a new, domestic satellite called [[AUSSAT]]. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and other commercial broadcasters were able to broadcast to the more remote areas of [[Australia]] without needing to set-up a new station, and by the end of 1986 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation were broadcasting both television and radio to remote areas of Australia.<ref name="freetv"> {{cite web

The [[1980]]'s was a big decade for Australian television, beginning with [[Network Ten|Ten]] broadasting the [[1984]] [[Los Angeles Olympics]] live across [[Australia]].<ref name="His80">{{cite web

The late [[1980]]'s saw the ownership changeover for many commercial and regional stations. Six main ownership groups emerged, three for commercial broadcasters and three for regional broadcasters<ref name="freetv" /> This was the beginning of ''[[aggregation]]'' for Australian television.<ref name="freetv" />

===1990s===
The [[1990s]] saw a boom in Australian-made drama, which included ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'', ''[[Water Rats]]'', ''[[SeaChange]]'', ''[[All Saints]]'', and the long running police drama ''[[Blue Heelers]]'' which ran from [[1994]] to [[2006]], one of the longest running Australian programs with almost as many episodes as ''[[Homicide]]'' two decades earlier. A number of successful comedy programs also aired during the 1990s, including ''[[Fast Forward]]'', ''[[Full Frontal]]'', ''[[The Late Show]]'' and ''[[Good News Week]]''. ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' ended its 28 year run in [[November 1999]].
[[Image:PrimeTelevisionident.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Prime Television]] was one of the first television networks to be aggregated.]]
One of the most significant changes for [[regional television in Australia]] began in the 1990s with the introduction of ''[[regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]]''. Instead of being covered by a single commercial channel, regional license areas would combine to provide three stations in line with metropolitan areas. As a result, most regional areas went from one to three channels, although some, particularly outside eastern states [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], remained with two or even only commercial station. The first license area to aggregate was that of southern New South Wales, on [[March 31]] [[1989]], followed by Queensland on [[December 31]] [[1990]], northern New South Wales on [[December 31]] [[1991]] and Victoria on [[January 1]] [[1992]]. Some areas too small to be properly aggregated, such as [[Darwin]], [[Mildura]] or rural South Australia, however, either applied for a second license or introduced a supplementary second service run by the existing local station. Following aggregation in [[1995]], [[STQ|Sunshine Television]] was purchased by [[Seven Network Limited]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.austvhistory.com/7qld/index.htm|title= Sunshine Television History|accessdate= 2007-06-27|author= Brooklyn Ross-Hulands|publisher= AusTVHistory}}</ref>

[[Community television]] was introduced to [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]] in [[1994]]. The stations, collectively known as '[[Channel 31]]', were allocated long-term temporary licenses until new legislation introduced in [[1997]] permitted permanent license to be granted. [[31 Brisbane|Briz 31]] was the first community television station to launch in Australia, on [[July 31]], [[1994]]. [[C31 Melbourne]] and [[Access 31]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] followed in [[1994]] and [[1999]] respectively, along with a number of other stations in some capital and regional cities. Throughout the early 1990s, [[SBS TV]] coverage continued to expand to include the [[Latrobe Valley]], [[Spencer Gulf]], [[Darwin]], northeast [[Tasmania]], [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]].

During the 1990s the first [[subscription television]] services were introduced to Australia. The first license was issued to [[Galaxy (Television)|Galaxy Television]], which started in [[1993 ]], providing services to most metropolitan areas by [[1995]].  Other major providers include [[Foxtel]], [[Optus Television]] and [[Austar]], all of which were introduced in [[1995]]. Galaxy,  folded in [[1998]] and was subsequently absorbed by Foxtel.<ref> {{cite web| title = Rupert's killer of a deal| work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/31/1043804519651.html| date = 2003-02-01| accessdate = 2007-08-01}} </ref><ref> {{cite web| title = The Demise of Australis| work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| url = http://www.abc.net.au/http/sfist/astralis.htm| date = 1997-11-18| accessdate = 2007-08-01}} </ref> Despite recent growth, subscription television in Australia still has relatively few subscribers.

===2000s===
[[Image:Olympic fireworks.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Seven Network]]'s telecast of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics]]' opening ceremony was one of the highest-rating programs in Australian television history.]]
[[Image:Abc2promo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Port Jackson]] and its surroundings feature in an [[Television ident|ident]] on [[ABC2]].]]

The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney resulted in huge ratings for its host broadcaster, the [[Seven Network]] - over 6.5 million Australians watched the telecast of opening and closing ceremonies, which were amongst the most-watched programs in television history and helped Seven defeat the [[Nine Network]] in ratings terms for the first time in more than two decades. The broadcast also ran on the short-lived [[C7 Sport]] subscription channel.

The turn of the millennium introduced [[Digital television in Australia|digital television to Australia]], as well as the transition to [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] and [[high-definition television|high-definition]] television production. Community stations also began to receive permanent transmitter licenses, replacing temporary licenses that were renewed yearly.

Many successful Australian shows were created during the [[2000s]], including [[ABC TV]] comedies like ''[[Kath and Kim]]'', ''[[Spicks and Specks]]'' and ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', [[Network Ten]]'s ''[[Thank God Your Here]]'', which led to the creation of many local versions throughout the world, and the growth of [[reality television]], especially ''[[Big Brother Australia]]'' and ''[[Australian Idol]]''. Australian content on subscription television also grew, with shows such as the [[Logie Award]] winning ''[[Love My Way]]''.

Amongst the new digital 'multichannels', one of the earliest was the [[SBS World News Channel]] in [[2002]], providing news bulletins in languages other than [[English language|English]]. In [[2003]] [[TDT (TV station)|Tasmanian Digital Television]] launched, providing [[Tasmania]]n viewers a third commercial station, and nationally-available stations [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids Channel]] launched, later to be eventually shut down due to funding issues and replaced in [[2005]] by [[ABC2]]. [[MDV|Mildura Digital Television]], similar to TDT, launched at the start of [[2006]]. Sydney also began testing [[datacasting]] transmissions with [[Digital 44]] in [[2003]]. While digital television boomed in areas that received a third channel and with the subscription television services, growth in other areas has been slow, with analogue shut-down dates pushed back several times.

A number of new community stations were also opened, including [[C31 Adelaide]] in [[April]], [[2004]] and [[Television Sydney]] in [[February]], [[2006]].

In [[October]] [[2005]], [[Network Ten]] announced that ''[[Good Morning Australia]]'' would be cancelled at the end of the year, after a 14 year run. Although [[Bert Newton]] was offered ongoing employment at [[Network Ten]], he joined the [[Nine Network]] to host short-lived ''[[Bert's Family Feud]]'', until [[May 23]], [[2007]] when the program was axed.<ref>{{cite web

The Nine Network, traditional ratings leader, suffered ratings losses by the mid-2000s, losing out to the Seven Network, which became the most popular Australian network early [[2007]]. This was not the only loss by the network: the death of its [[CEO]] [[Kerry Packer]] in late [[2005]] led to network personality [[Eddie McGuire]] becoming the head of the network,<ref> {{cite web| title = Small funeral for a giant of a man| work = [[ninemsn]]| url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=79417| date = 2005-12-30| accessdate = 2007-08-01}} </ref> and the network lost [[Australian Football League|AFL]] broadcast rights to the Seven and Ten network's in the largest Australian television rights deal in history, worth [[Australian dollar|AU$]]780 million.<ref>{{cite web

==Broadcasting==
{{Further|[[Australian television broadcasting]], [[Regional television in Australia]]}}
[[Image:Channel7.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Seven Network]]'s broadcast centre in the [[Melbourne Docklands]] area.]]
[[Australian television broadcasting]] is available both in [[Colour television|colour]] [[Analogue television|analogue]] and [[Digital television|digital]] formats, via a range of means including [[terrestrial television]], [[satellite television]] as well as a number of [[CATV|cable]] services. Both [[free-to-air]] and [[Pay TV|subscription]] channels and networks are available.

In most areas there is a choice of three free-to-air commercial broadcasters in addition to the television services of the two national public broadcasters, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Special Broadcasting Service]]. A third, recently-established, [[National Indigenous Television]] service is available in many remote areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tuning In |publisher=[[National Indigenous Television]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |url=http://nitv.org.au/tuning-in/ }}</ref>

Commercial television is dominated by three major metropolitan-based networks, the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]], which own stations in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]], the [[Nine Network]] which has stations in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Darwin]]. In addition to its metropolitan assets, Seven also owns regional station [[STQ|Seven Queensland]]. 

[[Regional television in Australia]] consists of independently-owned networks 'affiliated' to metropolitan stations. [[WIN Television]] is the country's largest regional broadcaster in terms of population reach (it also owns the [[Nine Network]] stations in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]]), followed by [[Southern Cross Ten]], [[Prime Television]], [[NBN Television]], the [[Golden West Network]], [[Southern Cross Television]], and [[Imparja Television]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] |title=Population figures |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2007-04-25 |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD//pc=PC_90247 }}</ref>

Along with regional markets, there are diary markets such as regional [[Western Australia]] and [[Alice Springs]], where only two networks are available. In these areas, the two incumbent commercial broadcasters are allowed to apply for a third, [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]]-only license, to provide additional programming. This has resulted in the establishment of a number of channels including [[Tasmanian Digital Television]], [[Mildura Digital Television]], and the forthcoming [[Darwin Digital Television]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] |title=Section 38B register |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2007-04-25 |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD//pc=PC_90041 }}</ref>

Subscription television in Australia consists of [[Foxtel]] in metropolitan areas and throughout [[Western Australia]], [[Austar]] in the regional areas of eastern and central states, and [[Optus Vision]] in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Brisbane]]. A number of smaller operators including [[SelecTV]], [[UBI World TV]], and [[Neighbourhood Cable]] provide niche or local services.

Community television progressively launched between the [[1980s]] to the [[2000s]], and is represented nationally by the [[Community Broadcasting Association of Australia]].<ref name="CBAA"> {{cite web

==Programming==
[[Australia]] has produced numerous notable television series and miniseries, with the most prominent programs coming from the comedy, police, and medical drama [[genre]]s.

One of the earliest Australian police drama series was ''[[Homicide (TV series)|Homicide]]'', produced in [[Melbourne]] by [[Crawford Productions]], widely viewed as having revolutionised Australian television drama production. It was followed by ''[[Division 4]]'' and ''[[Matlock Police]]'', which also enjoyed great popularity and long runs both locally and overseas. Other successful police drama series have included ''[[Cop Shop]]'', ''[[Police Rescue]]'', ''[[Blue Heelers]]'', ''[[Water Rats (TV series)|Water Rats]]'' and ''[[Stingers]]''. Medical dramas have also proved popular with audiences, including series such as ''[[The Flying Doctors]]'', ''[[GP (TV series)|GP]]'', ''[[A Country Practice]]'' and ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''.

Notable miniseries have included ''[[Against the Wind (TV series)|Against the Wind]]'', ''[[All the Rivers Run]]'', ''[[Bodyline|Bodyline: It's Just not  Cricket]]'', ''[[Brides of Christ]]'', ''[[The Dismissal (television series)|The Dismissal]]'' and ''The Timeless Land'', and in more recent times ''[[Curtin (2007 film)|Curtin]]'' and ''[[Bastard Boys]]''.

Australian soap operas have achieved a major following overseas, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], where series including ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'',  ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]'' have been shown. Other popular programs included  ''[[Bellbird (soap opera)|Bellbird]]'', ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Sullivans]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]''.

Comedy series have included ''[[The Aunty Jack Show]]'', ''[[The Paul Hogan Show]]'', ''[[Norman Gunston|The Norman Gunston Show]]'', and more recently ''[[The D-Generation]]'', ''[[Frontline (Australian TV series)|Frontline]]'', ''[[The Glass House (TV series)|The Glass House]]'' and popular series ''[[Thank God You're Here]]'', which has since been adapted to a number of countries around the world.

===Scheduling===

The scheduling for each network is quite diverse: while the Seven Network, Nine Network, and affiliates have an hour of news and current affairs at 6.00pm, Network Ten has its earlier at 5.00pm while ABC TV has theirs at 7:00pm. The [[Prime time|primetime]] slot in Australia runs from 6.00pm to midnight, with the most popular programming shown from around 7.30pm to 10.30pm, followed by a half-hour news bulletin on some networks. Many programs shown in these times on commercial networks are taken from [[United States|US]] television, while the [[ABC TV|ABC]] has a mixture of Australian and [[United Kingdom|British]] productions. [[SBS TV]], as a multicultural broadcaster, shows a range of programs produced locally and overseas in a number of languages. Imported programming has typically been shown months after its debut in the US or UK, however in recent times networks have begun to air programs within hours or days of their overseas counterparts.

[[Seven Network|Seven]] and [[Nine Network|Nine]] both have rival breakfast shows (in [[Network Ten|Ten's]] case children's programming) that run from 7.00-9.00am, followed by morning shows on all three networks until 11.00am. The [[ABC TV|ABC]] uses significant parts of its morning and afternoon schedules to provide educational and children's programming, while on [[SBS TV]] foreign-language bulletins are shown in simulcast with the [[SBS World News Channel|World News Channel]] for most of the morning, followed by foreign-language films and documentaries.

Most scheduling is consistent across Australia's three timezones - this means that [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] sees programming half an hour behind [[Australian Eastern Standard Time]], while in [[Western Australia]] programs are seen two hours behind. Consequently, many national news bulletins shown live to eastern states are seen on considerable delay in [[Western Australia]] (with the notable exception of ''[[ABC News (Australia)#The Midday Report|The Midday Report]]'', of which a second edition is produced for WA). The time delay can often deny viewers in central and western areas the opportunity to participate in interactive shows such as ''[[Big Brother Australia|Big Brother]]''. Sports programming, however, is usually shown live to all states.

One exception to this rule are subscription channels, which always run on [[Australian Eastern Standard Time]] regardless of the local service or timezone. The recent introduction of timeshift channels delayed two hours for all viewers, particularly on [[Foxtel]], allowed WA viewers to see programs in sync with other states.

==News and current affairs==
===News===
[[Image:Jamesdibble.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[James Dibble]] reading the first of many ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]'' bulletins.]]
Both national public broadcasters, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], produce news services. The ABC provides both local and national news bulletins in the form of ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]'' at 7pm and ''[[ABC News (Australia)#The Midday Report|The Midday Report]]'', presented from both [[Sydney]] and state capitals. [[SBS TV]] broadcasts a nightly hour-long ''[[SBS World News|World News Australia]]'' bulletin at 6.30pm, followed by a later, half-hour edition at 9.30pm.

Higher ratings for earlier bulletins from commercial broadcasters including the [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]], and [[Network Ten]] have prompted fierce ratings competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seven takes on Nine |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/aa/0c02c5aa.asp |date=2005-02-14 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |publisher=B&T |author=Felicity Shea}}</ref> [[Seven News]] has recently overtaken [[National Nine News]] as the Australia's highest-ratings news service, however in some instances the opposite still applies.

[[Seven News]] includes national bulletins in the mornings and afternoons and local bulletins at 6pm, as well as the network's popular breakfast program ''[[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]'', which competes directly with the [[Nine Network]]'s offerings, which include the ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today Show]]'' and morning, afternoon, evening and late editions of [[National Nine News]]. [[Ten News]] is shown in competition with Seven and Nine's breakfast programs in the form of an hour-long early news bulletin, as well as morning, late, and 'first at five' evening editions.

[[Image:250507-NBNNewsFriday.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[NBN Television#News|NBN News]], the only regional service to produce an hour of news.]]

[[Sky News Australia]], seen on [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]], and [[Optus TV]] is the only Australian-based twenty-four hour news channel. The subscription based television channel draws on the resources of its shareholders news services, using content from [[Seven News]], [[National Nine News]] and [[Sky News]] from the [[United Kingdom]], as well as reporters based in [[Sydney]], [[Canberra]], and [[Melbourne]].

A number of regional television networks produce news services. [[WIN Television]] produces 20 bulletins in parts of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], and [[Western Australia]]. [[NBN Television]] is the only regional broadcaster to produce a bulletin on both weeknights and weekends, in an hour-long format presented from [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and seen across northern [[New South Wales]]. [[Prime Television]] produces news updates throughout regional New South Wales and Victoria, with sister-network [[Golden West Network|GWN]] producing [[Golden West News]] for [[Western Australia]]. In the [[Northern Territory]], [[Imparja Television]] shows [[Imparja Television#News|Imparja National News]]. [[Southern Cross Television]] produces a bulletin for [[Tasmania]] and regional [[South Australia]].

===Current Affairs===
[[Image:DatelineSBS.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[George Negus]] hosting [[SBS TV]]'s current affairs program ''[[Dateline (SBS)|Dateline]]''.]]
Current affairs programming is shown in a broad range of formats, ranging between [[tabloid television|tabloid]]-style current affairs shows to investigative programs such as ''[[Four Corners]]''.

[[ABC TV]] has had a long history of producing current affairs programs, including the award-winning ''[[This Day Tonight]]'', the first regular current affairs program to be shown on Australian television and training ground for many of Australia's best-known journalists. ''This Day Tonight'' was axed in [[1978]], however in the mid-[[1980]]s ''[[The 7.30 Report]]'' was launched in state-based editions (these were combined into a national program hosted by [[Kerry O'Brien]] in [[1995]]). ''[[Four Corners (TV series)|Four Corners]]'', first seen in [[1961]], an investigative documentary series modelled on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', has also won many awards and broken stories previously uncovered by other media outlets. 

Other current affairs programs include news and analysis program ''[[Lateline]]'', ''[[Stateline (TV series)|Stateline]]'', shown in place of ''[[The 7.30 Report]]'' on [[Friday]]s, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'', ''[[Insiders (TV series)|Insiders]]'', ''[[Offsiders]]'' and ''[[Australia Wide]]''.

[[SBS TV]] also shows a number of current affairs programs, such as ''[[Dateline (SBS)|Dateline]]'', the country's longest-running international current affairs program, launched in [[1984]]. ''[[Insight (SBS TV, Australia)|Insight]]'', originally conceived in [[1999]] as a domestic current affairs program, is a discussion forum focussing on a single issue. SBS's Indigenous Media Unit produces another program titled ''[[Living Black (SBS TV, Australia)|Living Black]]'', which covers issues relevant to Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] community.

[[Image:TTAnnaCoren.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Anna Coren]] presenting the east-coast edition of ''[[Today Tonight]]''.]]

There are a number of commercial current affairs programs. The [[Seven Network]], in addition to Sunrise, broadcasts ''[[Today Tonight]]'', a tabloid current affairs program, every [[weeknight]] after its 6pm news bulletin. On the [[Nine Network]], ''[[A Current Affair (Australia)|A Current Affair]]'', first shown in [[1971]], competes directly with ''Today Tonight'' and has, since [[Ray Martin]] began presenting in [[1994]], provided a similar mix of content. On [[Sunday]]s, ''[[60 Minutes (Australia)|60 Minutes]]'' features a number of stories produced both locally and for its [[60 Minutes|US counterpart]]. In the morning ''[[Sunday (television program)|Sunday]]'' covers local and overseas news, politics, and current affairs, in addition to film reviews, politics, arts, and music. 

Political and interview program ''[[Meet the Press (Australian TV series)|Meet the Press]]'' is also shown on Sunday mornings, on [[Network Ten]] since [[1992]]. Regional network [[Southern Cross Ten]] broadcasts ''State Focus'', a regional current affairs program, afterwards. Ten also produces weekend and weeknighly late editions of ''[[Sports Tonight]]'', a sports information show which debuted in [[1993]].

On [[subscription television]], [[Sky News Australia]] airs a number of news commentary and analysis shows such as Agenda, Sportsline, Sky Business Report, and Sky News Eco Report. A local version of [[The Weather Channel (Australia)|The Weather Channel]] was launched in [[1999]], joined in [[2006]] by [[FoxSportsNews]], a 24-hour sports news channel. [[Squawk Australia]], a business news program shown from 6.00am, is seen on [[CNBC Asia]].

[[Audience measurement]]s in [[Australia]] are collected by three main organisations: [[OzTAM]] in metropolitan areas, Regional TAM in regional areas seviced by three commercial [[television networks]], and in areas with two commercial networks, [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen Media Research Australia]].

Ratings are collected for 40 weeks during the year, excluding a two-week break during [[Easter]] and ten weeks over [[summer]]. The majority of locally produced comedy and drama on commercial networks is shown during the ratings period.

Throughout the late [[1990s]] and early [[2000s]], the [[Nine Network]] has been the ratings leader in Australia, typically followed by the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. Subscription television and the two national broadcasters, [[ABC TV]] and in particular [[SBS TV]], due to its special-interest nature, typically attract fewer viewers than the three commercial networks. Network Ten, due to its programming line-up, has traditionally been the market leader for younger viewers. 

The [[2007]] ratings period has so far been unique in that, for the first time since [[2000]], the [[Seven Network]] has overtaken its rival [[Nine Network]] in terms of average viewers.<ref> {{cite web

}} </ref> [[ABC TV]] has also, since the early 2000s, seen ratings (as well as audience reach) as a major performance indicator - this has, however, led to a decline in viewers rather than the expected increase. The Nine Network has, in the past, aggressively marketed its long-time ratings dominance through its promotional campaign "''[[Still the One (promotional campaign)|Still the One]]''".

==Regulation==
Content on Australian television is regulated by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]. All codes of practice submitted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority are reviewed by the public prior to acceptance.<ref name="ACMAContent"> {{cite web

The regulations in place define what a broadcaster may put on-air, the time(s) of day they are allowed to broadcast specific material, and what advertisements are shown in relation to these criteria. In essence, the Australian Communications and Media Authority controls what content is shown, what time(s) of day it is shown, and who controls what is shown (i.e.: international media as opposed to [[Australian media]]).<ref name="ACMACodes"> {{cite web
