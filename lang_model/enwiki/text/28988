'''Gordon Harold Smith''' (born [[May 25]], [[1952]]) is [[Oregon]]'s junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]], currently serving his second term. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. 

== Personal background ==
Smith was born in [[Pendleton, Oregon]] to Jessica Udall Smith and Milan Dale Smith.<ref>Smith's [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/smith.htm genealogy]</ref> Smith's family moved to [[Bethesda, Maryland]] during his childhood, when his father became an Assistant [[Secretary of Agriculture|United States Secretary of Agriculture]]. After graduating high school, Smith went on a two-year mission for his church, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], to [[New Zealand]].

Smith then went to college at [[Brigham Young University]], attended law school at [[Southwestern University School of Law]], and became an attorney in [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. He moved back to Oregon in the [[1980s]] to become director of Smith Frozen Foods company in [[Weston, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref>

Smith and his wife Sharon [[adopt]]ed several children in the 1980s, including sons Morgan and Garrett and daughter Brittany.

On [[September 8]], [[2003]], Garrett, then a 21 year old college student majoring in culinary arts, committed [[suicide]]. Smith wrote a book entitled ''Remembering Garrett, One Family<U+2019>s Battle with a Child<U+2019>s Depression.''<ref>{{cite news

Smith is also a member of the [[Udall family|Udall]] [[political family]]. His mother was a cousin of the late Congressmen [[Mo Udall]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) and [[Stewart Udall]] (D-AZ), and Smith is a second cousin of current Congressmen [[Mark Udall]] (D-[[Colorado|CO]]) and [[Tom Udall]]  (D-[[New Mexico|NM]]).  They are ''double cousins'', as their grandparents were a pair of brother and a pair of sisters who intermarried. Smith is the only Republican in the group.

Smith's brother, [[Milan Smith|Milan Dale Smith, Jr.]], is a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006.

Smith is an [[Eagle Scout]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-571.html| title =The Congress and Scouting | format = | work =Fact sheet | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-09-06}}</ref>

==Rise to the United States Senate==
Smith entered politics with his election to the [[Oregon State Senate]] in 1992, and became president of that body in [[1995]]. Later in 1995, he ran in a special election for a Senate seat vacated by the resignation of [[Bob Packwood]], but was narrowly defeated in the January 1996 election by then-[[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Ron Wyden]].

United States Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], a fellow Republican, announced his retirement later that year. Smith became the first person to run for the Senate twice in one year. This time he won, defeating [[Lon Mabon]] (whose organization, the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]], had previously endorsed Smith over Wyden) in the Republican primary,<ref>{{cite news
|last=Kinsey-Hill
|first=Gail
|title=After earlier defeat, Smith successfully moves toward center
|work=The Oregonian
|date=November 7, 1996
}}</ref> and Democrat [[Tom Bruggere]] in the general election.

Smith was [[United States Senate elections, 2002|re-elected]] by a strong margin in 2002, defeating [[Oregon Secretary of State]] [[Bill Bradbury]].

==Social policy==
Smith has not conformed to either liberal or conservative positions in his views on social policy. Independent thinking, political pandering, and his affiliation with the Mormon church <U+2013> which is relatively tolerant on many social issues <U+2013> have all been cited as possible reasons for his unusual positions.

Smith became a strong supporter of expanding [[hate crime]] laws to encompass crimes against gays. On [[June 15]], [[2004]], he successfully passed an amendment doing just that (65-33) with every Democrat in the Senate voting for his amendment. As a result, he was one of a few Republican senators supported by [[gay rights]] groups in the United States, including the [[Human Rights Campaign]]. Since then, gay rights groups have expressed disappointment at his support for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would define [[marriage]] as between a man and a woman.<ref>{{cite news

|date=[[July 10]] [[2004]]
|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> 

Leading up to the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], Smith joined Senate Democrats to introduce legislation that would guarantee gay employees of the federal government [[domestic partnership]] benefits.<ref>http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2006/09/27/5</ref>

Smith has described himself as [[pro-life]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0107/19/cf.00.html |title=CNN Crossfire transcript July 19, 2001 |date=2001-07-19 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref> and in 2003 he voted along party lines to pass the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], legislation which prohibits the controversial [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedure.  In 2006, he voted to pass another controversial bill, this time crossing party lines to vote for the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]].  The measure, which would have expanded federal funding of [[stem cell]] research to cell lines extracted from embyros discarded during fertility treatment, became the first bill to be vetoed by President [[George W. Bush]].  Smith is one of nineteen Senate Republicans who voted for the measure.

==Digital Rights Management==
{{seealso|broadcast flag}}
In January [[2006]], Smith began circulating draft legislation entitled the [[Digital Content Protection Act of 2006]].<ref>{{cite press release

|title=New Senate Broadcast Flag Bill Would Freeze Fair Use

|date=January 20, 2006
|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref><ref>http://eff.org/broadcastflag/dcp_act_2006.pdf</ref> The legislation would grant the [[Federal Communications Commission]] the authority to authorize a technology known as the "broadcast flag." This technology would enable the producers of television programming to ensure the programs cannot be recorded by viewers in their homes, for instance using a [[digital video recorder]] like TiVo or onto recordable DVDs.

==Conservative or moderate?==
Smith is the only Republican currently holding statewide office in the largely Democratic state of Oregon. Along with representative [[Greg Walden]], he is one of two Republican members of Oregon's congressional delegation. Smith is often described as politically moderate, but has strong conservative credentials as well.

Smith is a member of the moderate [[Republican Main Street Partnership]], and a February 2006 ''[[National Journal]]'' congressional rating placed Smith in the exact ideological center of the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Centrists |url=http://nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/Centrists.pdf
|work=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

However, Smith is described as a rank-and-file Republican by ''GovTrack.us''<ref>{{cite web |title=GovTrack: Gordon Smith |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=300090
|work=GovTrack.us |accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>, and throughout 2006 Smith voted with Republican leader [[Bill Frist]] (TN) on 82% of contentious bills, in contrast to predecessor [[Mark Hatfield]]'s 55% record of agreement with party leader [[Trent Lott]] (MS) in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kosseff |first=Jeff |title=Oregonians in Congress: not so independent |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/elections/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1168316727218920.xml&coll=7 |work=[[The Oregonian]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> Based on five senate votes in 2006, the abortion rights advocacy group [[NARAL]] gave Smith a score of 15% on abortion rights (100% being a complete [[pro-choice]] score.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in-congress/congressional-record-on-choice/state.html?state=OR |title=Congressional Record on Choice by State: Oregon |accessdate=2007-02-13 |publisher=NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation }}</ref> Smith's votes have run contrary to widespread public sentiment on several issues, notably [[minimum wage]]<ref>http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00027</ref><ref>http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/senate/2/votes/179/</ref><ref>{{cite news

Sen. Smith was also a key advocate for embattled conservative Sen. Lott's return to a leadership post within the Republican Party in 2006. Lott had resigned his position as Senate Republican Leader in 2002, following controversy surrounding his perceived support of conservative Sen. [[Strom Thurmond]]'s (R-SC) [[segregation]]ist politics. After the party lost control of the Senate in November 2006, Republicans elected Lott to the post of Minority Whip (the second-highest Republican position in the Senate.) During the closed-door election, Sen. [[Judd Gregg]] (R-NH) nominated Lott for the position. Sen. Smith then seconded the nomination and delivered a supportive address before casting his vote.<ref>{{cite news

==War in Iraq==

Several weeks after stating his opposition to the occupation of Iraq, however, Smith declined to sign onto a bipartisan resolution to oppose the President's plan to escalate troop levels in Iraq by 21,500,<ref>{{cite news

The bill's sponsors have since changed the word to "increase." Smith expressed support for the bill, but subsequently voted to prevent it from being debated by the full Senate.

In [[March]] [[2007]], Smith was one of only two Republicans to vote for a resolution aimed at withdrawing most American combat troops from Iraq in 2008, the other being [[Chuck Hagel]]. The vote was 50 for to 48 against. <ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web

==2008 Election==
{{main|Oregon United States Senate election, 2008}}

Smith's Senate seat is up for election in 2008, and Smith has indicated that he intends to run again. As of January 2006, Smith has been identified as one of the six most vulnerable Republican Senators in the 2008 election.<ref>http://www.cqpolitics.com/2007/01/ratings_chart_2008_senate_race.html</ref> He could face both Republican and Democratic opponents.<ref>{{cite news

High-profile Democrats [[John Kitzhaber]], [[Peter DeFazio]], and [[David Wu]] have declined to run; Representatives [[Earl Blumenauer]] and [[Darlene Hooley]], and [[Oregon State Senate|state senator]] [[Ben Westlund]] have been the subject of speculation.

==Committee assignments==
Smith chaired the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]] until Democrats took control of the Senate in 2007; he is now the committee's Ranking Minority Member. (Oregon<U+2019>s senior Senator, [[Ron Wyden]], sits on this committee as well.)

Smith also serves on the following Senate committees: [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation]], [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Energy and Natural Resources]], [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]], and [[United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|Indian Affairs]].
