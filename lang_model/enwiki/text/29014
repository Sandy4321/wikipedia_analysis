The '''Danish Act of Succession of March 27, 1953'''<ref>[http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf Text of the Constitutional Act of Denmark of June 5, 1953 and the Act of Succession of March 27, 1953]</ref> was accepted after a [[Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum, 1953|1953 referendum]] in [[Denmark]] and dictates the rules governing the [[Line of succession to the Danish Throne]]. The 1953 referendum changed the act so that it became possible for a woman to inherit the throne in the event that she has no older or younger brothers, a system known as male preference [[primogeniture]].<ref name="uvm">[http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_16_grundlov_53.html http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_16_grundlov_53.html] {{da icon}}</ref> As the reigning King [[Frederick IX]] had three daughters and no sons, this meant that [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]] became the [[Heir Presumptive]] instead of her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]]. As Frederick IX's wife [[Ingrid of Sweden|Queen Ingrid]] was not expected to (and in fact did not) have any more children, this effectively ensured that Princess Margrethe would become [[Queen of Denmark]], which she did.

A [[Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum]] is expected to be held before the next [[Next Danish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] on changing the Act of Succession so that primogeniture no longer puts males over females. In other words, the first-born daughter would become heir to the throne even if she has younger brothers, which is not the case today.
