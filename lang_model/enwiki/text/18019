'''Kenneth Mathieson "Kenny" Dalglish''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 4 March, 1951 in [[Dalmarnock]], [[Glasgow]]) is a former [[Scotland national football team|Scottish international]] [[Association football|footballer]]. He is most noted for his successes with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], and both his playing and managing career at English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was placed first in Liverpool's list of "100 Players Who Shook The Kop".<ref> {{cite web |title=100 PWSTK - THE DEFINITIVE LIST  |publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] |date=2006-10-08 |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2006/oct/8/N153706061008-0859.htm |accessdate=2008-11-28}} </ref>

Dalglish began his career as a youth player at Celtic and broke into the first team in 1971, becoming a prolific striker for the club. He was made the [[Captain (association football)|team captain]] in 1975 and between 1971 and 1977 he won four [[Scottish First Division]] titles, four [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]]. His performances led to call-ups for the [[Scotland national football team|national team]]; he was part of the undefeated [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] Scotland team, and scored to bring victory over rivals [[England national football team|England]] in both 1976 and 1977. [[Bob Paisley]] paid <U+00A3>440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool in 1977, a British record at the time.

His years at Liverpool marked one of the club's most successful periods: he won six [[Football League First Division|league titles]], three [[European Cup]]s and five domestic cups. He also played for Scotland in the [[1978 World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 World Cup]]s. By the time his career had wound down in the late 1980s, Dalglish had set Scottish records for international appearances and goals, and become one of the most successful strikers in Liverpool's history. Dalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]] and brought the team a League and FA Cup [[The Double|double]] in his first year, beating [[Merseyside derby|Merseyside rivals]] [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the process. During his six-year tenure, Liverpool always finished either first or second in the league. He guided them to three league wins and two FA Cups from 1985<U+2013>1991.

He joined [[Blackburn Rovers]] in 1991 and, through [[Jack Walker]]'s patronage, he turned the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side to [[Premier League]] winners, breaking transfer fee records along the way. His move to [[Newcastle United]] in 1997 was less successful. Although he finished as Premier League runner-up in 1996<U+2013>97, the team's league performance the following season was lacklustre and he was sacked by [[Freddie Shepherd]] at the start of the [[1998<U+2013>99 FA Premier League|1998<U+2013>99 season]]. He was appointed [[Director of Football]] at Celtic in 1999 but a brief stint as caretaker manager ended in an acrimonious departure. He has not managed since 2000 and has instead focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for [[breast cancer]]. He is also a patron of [[Marine F.C.|Marine FC]].

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Dalglish, the son of an engineer, grew up supporting [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Though born in Dalmarnock in the East End of [[Glasgow]], he was brought up in Milton in the north of Glasgow and moved to the docklands of [[Govan]], near [[Ibrox]], home of Rangers when he was 15.

Dalglish attended Milton Bank Primary School in Milton and started out as a goalkeeper. [[Frank McAvennie]], another well known footballer, also grew up in the same area and attended the same school. He was attending High Possil Senior Secondary School where he won the inter schools 5-a-side and the inter year 5-a-side competitions when he appeared for the Scotland under-15s in a fixture against their Northern Irish counterparts he was playing outfield as a right-half, scoring twice. Dalglish played for Glasgow Schoolboys and Glasgow Schools (winning the Scottish Cup), and went on the be selected for the Scottish schoolboys side, where the team enjoyed an undefeated run to win the home nations Victory Shield tournament.<ref name=Tele1>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2335207/My-School-Sport-Kenny-Dalglish.html My School Sport: Kenny Dalglish] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (2006-04-12) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

He had trials at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] (twice) and notably at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], but they came to nothing.<ref>http://www.ifhof.com/hof/dalglish.asp</ref> Dalglish instead signed for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], age-old [[Old Firm]] rivals of his childhood club, Rangers.

===Celtic===
His signing, on a provisional contract in May 1967, was not without amusement. [[Jock Stein]], the legendary Celtic manager, sent his assistant [[Sean Fallon (footballer)|Sean Fallon]] to see Dalglish and his parents at their home. Hearing that Fallon was at the door, Dalglish raced to his bedroom and frantically tore down the Rangers posters on his bedroom walls.<ref>''Dalglish'' Kelly, Stephen F.</ref> In his first season Dalglish was farmed out to a Celtic nursery side, [[Cumbernauld United]] for whom he scored 37 goals during the 1967<U+2013>68 season.<ref>Lomax, Andrew (2008-02-14) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/scotland/2291752/Kenny-Dalglish-backs-Scottish-youngsters.html Kenny Dalglish backs Scottish youngsters] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> He also worked as an apprentice joiner.<ref name=Tele1/>

By the following year he had turned fully professional and was a regular member of a Celtic reserve team so highly rated it was known as the Quality Street gang due to its unparalleled production of future Scottish internationals: the legendary [[Danny McGrain]], [[George Connelly]], [[Lou Macari]], [[David Hay]] and, of course, Dalglish himself.<ref>''Jock Stein: The Definitive Biography'' McPherson, Archie p.224</ref>

Dalglish made his first team competitive debut coming on from the bench for [[Charlie Gallagher]] in [[Scottish League Cup]] quarter-final tie at [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] at [[Douglas Park]] on 25 September 1968; he helped Celtic to a 4<U+2013>2 victory.<ref>[http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/display.var.2496296.0.now_you_know_kenny_dalglish_debuted_for_celtic_against_hamilton.php NOW YOU KNOW: Kenny Dalglish debuted for Celtic against Hamilton] ''Evening Times'' (2009-03-18) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

It took Dalglish three years to establish himself in the first team. At that time Celtic were not only the best team in Scotland, they had become the first British team to win the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] after beating [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Inter Milan]] 2<U+2013>1 at the [[Est<U+00E1>dio Nacional]] in [[Lisbon]]. Stein took a great interest in Dalglish, recognising his potentially outstanding talent. Eventually he gave him his chance in a benefit match for Kilmarnock defender Frank Beattie at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock on 14 May 1971. The result was 7<U+2013>2 to Celtic, with Dalglish scoring six of the Celtic goals in a superlative performance.

The 1971<U+2013>72 season saw Dalglish score his first goal for Celtic. It came via the penalty spot in the 2<U+2013>0 [[Scottish League Cup]] tie win over Rangers at Ibrox on 14 August 1971. He went on to amass 23 league and cup goals in just 49 appearances by the end of the season.

By 1972<U+2013>73, Dalglish was Celtic's leading marksman with a seasonal tally of 41 goals in all competitions. Dalglish was made Celtic captain in 1975<U+2013>76, but it was a miserable year. Stein was badly hurt in a car crash and missed most of the season,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/4221034.stm Remembering Jock Stein] [[BBC Sport]] (2005-09-06) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> and Celtic failed to win a trophy for the first time in 12 years.

He had been a full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international for six years by the time he decided to leave Celtic. [[Tommy Docherty]] gave him his debut as a substitute in the 1<U+2013>0 [[1972 UEFA European Championship|Euro '72]] qualifier victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] on the 10 November 1971 at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]]. He scored his first goal for the Scots a year later on the 15 November 1972 in the 2<U+2013>0 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] at [[Hampden Park]]. Scotland eventually qualified and he went to the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] in West Germany. Scotland were eliminated at the end of group stages, even though they were undefeated.<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1974-06-24-08-002&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1974-06-24-08 Small Print of World Cup defeats Scotland] ''[[The Times]]'' (1974-06-24) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

In 1976 he scored the winning goal for Scotland at [[Hampden Park]] against [[England national football team|England]] when he put the ball through [[Ray Clemence]]'s legs. A year later he scored against the same opponents and goalkeeper at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in another 2<U+2013>1 win.

On 10 August 1977, after 269 appearances and 167 goals, an average of a goal every 1.6 games, for the Hoops, Dalglish moved to [[Bob Paisley]]'s Liverpool for a British record <U+00A3>440,000 transfer fee.<ref name=talks>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8012611.stm|title=Benitez opens talks with Dalglish |date=2009-04-24|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> He was bought as a replacement for [[Kevin Keegan]] who had left the club to play for [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in Germany.<ref>Lawford, Mark (2009-04-01) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1166362/Home-heart--Shearer-joins-Keegan-Dalglish-Souness-Ardiles-Hoddle-Redknapp-Bremner-legends-hotseat-club--best-all.html Home is where the heart is:  Shearer joins Keegan, Dalglish, Souness, Ardiles, Hoddle, Redknapp and Bremner in the legends' hotseat club - but who was the best of them all?] ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

His departure was a huge blow for Celtic and was extremely unpopular with the fans. It also highlighted the widening financial gap between Scottish and English clubs. When Dalglish returned in August 1978 to play in Stein's testimonial, he was greeted as a traitor and booed by a large element of the Celtic supporters.<ref>McPherson p.279</ref>

===Liverpool===
The Liverpool support had reservations about Dalglish's ability to replace Keegan, but they had no need to worry as Dalglish quickly settled in at his new club. Dalglish made his debut, wearing Keegan's famous number seven shirt, in the season opener at Wembley, the [[Community Shield|Charity Shield]], on 13 August 1977 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The sides shared the shield as the game finished as a draw. He scored his first goal in his league debut a week later on 20 August, when Liverpool went to [[Ayresome Park]] to face [[Middlesbrough]] with Dalglish's seventh minute goal earning the Reds a 1<U+2013>1 draw. He also scored on his [[Anfield]] debut three days later on 23 August. With the half-time score at 0<U+2013>0, Dalglish scored in the first minute of the second period to set the Reds up for a 2<U+2013>0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He also scored Liverpool's sixth goal when they crushed Kevin Keegan's Hamburg 6<U+2013>0 in the second leg of the [[1977 UEFA Super Cup]] final.

At the end of his first season, Dalglish had played 62 times, scoring 31 goals. These included the winning goal in the 1978 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final at Wembley against Belgian side [[Club Brugge|Bruges]], when he latched onto a through ball by fellow Scot [[Graeme Souness]] and calmly chipped the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper. He went on to become arguably the most influential member of the most successful club team in English football history, winning further League Championships and European Cups for Liverpool during a period (stretching to the mid-1980s) when the club dominated both domestic and European football.

He went on to play in both the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]], scoring against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the famous 3<U+2013>2 win, and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain, scoring against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]]. On both occasions Scotland failed to get past the group stage. In total, Dalglish played 102 times for Scotland (a national record) and scored 30 goals (also a national record, shared with [[Denis Law]]).<ref>Grahame, Ewing (2008-10-08) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/scotland/3161435/George-Burley-backs-Darren-Fletcher-to-beat-Kenny-Dalglishs-Scotland-cap-record-Football.html George Burley backs Darren Fletcher to beat Kenny Dalglish<U+2019>s Scotland cap record] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/159429.stm The Kenny Dalglish file] [[BBC Sport]] (1998-08-27) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

In April 1980, Liverpool paid <U+00A3>300,000 for [[Ian Rush]], an 18-year-old [[Chester City F.C.|Chester]] striker.<ref>Hanna, Gareth (2008-11-26) [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premiership/ian-rush-at-liverpool-i-was-in-the-right-place-at-the-right-time-14079426.html Ian Rush at Liverpool: "I was in the right place at the right time] ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> After he had made the breakthrough into the first team, Rush thrived alongside Dalglish. The pair's goals helped the Anfield club win the League championship and a 3<U+2013>1 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in which Rush scored a goal a minute from the end of extra time. A year earlier, Dalglish had himself scored in the [[1981 Football League Cup Final]].<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1207 Liverpool 2 - 1 West Ham United] LFC History, Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

Dalglish was an ever present in his first three league campaigns at Liverpool, his second campaign ([[1978-79 in English football|1978-79]]) being his personal best at the club with 21 league goals. He did not miss a league game for Liverpool until the [[1980-81 in English football|1980-81 season]], when he appeared in 34 out of 42 league games and scored just eight goals as Liverpool finished fifth in the league but still managed to win the European Cup and Football League Cup. He recovered his goalscoring touch the following season and was an ever present once again, scoring 13 goals as Liverpool were league champions for the 13th time - and the third time since Dalglish's arrival. 18 league goals came from Dalglish in [[1982-83 in English football|1982-83]] as Liverpool retained their title, but after this stage his goalscoring record became less prolific as Ian Rush became Liverpool's practically uncontested top goalscorer. However, Dalglish did remain a regular player, despite the arrival of young [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] striker [[Paul Walsh]] at the start of the [[1984-85 in English football|1984-85 season]]. 

After becoming player-manager on the retirement of [[Joe Fagan]] in the 1985 close season, Dalglish selected himself for just 21 First Division games in [[1985-86 in English football|1985-86]] as Liverpool won the double, but he started the FA Cup final win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] wearing the famous number 7 shirt ahead of Walsh, who did not even make the substitute's bench. He had a personally better campaign in the [[1986-87 in English football|1986-87 season]], this time scoring six goals from just 18 league appearances, but he was now firmly committed to giving younger players priority for a first team place. With the sale of [[Ian Rush]] to [[Juventus]] in the 1987 close season, Dalglish chose to form a new striker partnership of new signings [[John Aldridge]] and [[Peter Beardsley]] for the [[1987-88 in English football|1987-88]], during which he played just twice in a league campaign which saw Liverpool seal their 17th title. He did not participate as a player in their [[1988-89 in English football|1988-89]] league campaign, but made his first league appearance in two years on [[5 May]] [[1990]] when he came on as a subsitute against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], after which he finally retired from playing.

==Managerial career==
===Liverpool===
After the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985 in which 39 [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] supporters died when rioting fans caused a wall to collapse, and in the wake of the resignation of manager [[Joe Fagan]], Dalglish became [[player-manager]] of the [[Anfield]] club and guided them to the club's first ever "[[The Double|double]]" by the end of his first season in charge, [[1985<U+2013>86 in English football|1985<U+2013>86]]. Liverpool achieved the historic feat by winning the League Championship by two points over [[Merseyside]] rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (Dalglish actually scored the winner in a 1<U+2013>0 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] to secure the title on the final day of the season) and the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Merseyside derby|derby]] rivals Everton 3<U+2013>1 in the first ever all-Merseyside FA Cup Final.<ref>Chris Bevan and Russell Barder (2009-01-23) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7827167.stm When Dalglish did the Double] [[BBC Sport]] Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

The following season was trophy-less as Liverpool lost their league title to Everton, lost to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the League Cup final and were knocked out of the FA Cup by underdogs [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. Over a 15 year period, it was only the third time the Reds had ended the season without winning either the league title or one of the domestic or European cups.

Liverpool topped the league for almost the whole season in [[1987<U+2013>88 in English football|1987<U+2013>88]], although Dalglish's appearances were becoming increasingly rare after he signed [[Peter Beardsley]] from Newcastle. Alongside Beardsley, he signed [[John Aldridge]] from [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], who replaced the [[Juventus]]-bound Rush. He also added winger [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Oxford United]] midfielder [[Ray Houghton]] to the likes of [[Alan Hansen]], [[Ronnie Whelan]], [[Steve McMahon]], [[Mark Lawrenson]] and [[Steve Nicol]]. They had a successful run of 37 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the beginning of the season (29 in the league, 22 wins and 7 draws). The run began on the 15 August 1987 and was ended by Merseyside rivals Everton, who beat them by a single goal at [[Goodison Park]] on 21 February 1988. They were crowned champions with four games left to play, having suffered just two defeats from 40 games. However, despite being favourites in the [[1988 FA Cup Final]], they were denied a second double by an unfancied [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] side.<ref>[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1988.htm FA Cup Final 1988] FA-Cup Finals, Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

Dalglish guided Liverpool to victory over Everton in the second all-Merseyside F.A Cup final in 1989, but they squandered the chance of a second double in literally the last minute of the final game of the season. A shot by future Liverpool player [[Michael Thomas (footballer)|Michael Thomas]] gave Arsenal the 2<U+2013>0 victory they needed at Anfield and the league title went to the [[London|north Londoners]] on the basis that Arsenal had scored more goals, with the goal difference being the same.

In the [[1989<U+2013>90 in English football|1989<U+2013>90]] season Liverpool won their third league title of their first five seasons under Dalglish's management. It came after a late surge by Aston Villa had knocked them off the top of the table in April, but a strong run during the final weeks of the season saw Dalglish's men win the title by nine points. 1989-90 was also the season that saw the 38-year-old Dalglish play the final game of his career, when he came on as a 71st minute sub for [[Jan M<U+00F8>lby]] in Liverpool's final home game of the season against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 1 May 1990. Dalglish also received his third Manager of the year award.

Dalglish was in charge of the club at the time of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], on 15 April 1989 at the beginning of the FA Cup semi-final against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The tragedy claimed 94 lives on the day, with the final death toll reaching 96. Dalglish won many admirers for his dignity during this tragedy.<ref>Evans, Tony (2009-02-13) [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/liverpool/article5703041.ece?token=null&offset=144&page=13 The 50 greatest Liverpool players] ''[[The Times]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> He attended many of the funerals as did the other Liverpool players. He is still well-regarded by Liverpool supporters for this reason, as well as for his on-field successes. He resigned as manager of Liverpool (on health grounds) on 22 February 1991, his last act being a confidence vote in future homegrown talents [[Steve McManaman]], [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]], and his last signing, youngster [[Jamie Redknapp]]. Dalglish departed with Liverpool, stating he wished to retire from football in 1991.  Still defending their title and still in contention for both the league title and the [[FA Cup]].

Dalglish's Liverpool record ended with: 515 appearances, 172 goals, 307 as manager, 8 League Championships, 2 FA Cup wins, 3 European Cup wins, 4 League Cup wins, 1 European Super Cup win, and 5 Charity Shield wins. He also won a [[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers` Footballer of the Year award]], a [[Professional Footballers Association|PFA]] player of the year award, and three Manager of the Year awards.

===Blackburn Rovers===
After stating that he was taking an extended break from football, after quitting Liverpool, he surprised fans by returning to management 6 weeks later, in October 1991, with [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led into the [[Premier League]] by beating [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 1<U+2013>0 in the [[Football League Play-Offs|Second Division Play-off]] final at Wembley, the first time Blackburn had been in the top flight of English football since 1966<ref>[http://www.premierleague.com/page/blackburn-rovers Blackburn Rovers] [[FA Premier League]] Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

The club were owned by steel tycoon [[Jack Walker]] who paid Dalglish handsomely, and made large sums available to Dalglish, allowing Blackburn Rovers to compete financially with the wealthiest and biggest teams in England such as [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United]]. In 1992 Dalglish signed [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[Alan Shearer]] for a British record fee of <U+00A3>3.5&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/885534.stm Blackburn Rovers owner dies] [[BBC Sport]] (2000-08-18) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> Shearer helped Dalglish's newly promoted Rovers to fourth position in the first year of the new [[Premier League]]. Despite the Blackburn's wealth, Dalglish often found it hard to attract big name players to the club, leading to great frustration on his part. The failure to sign Roy Keane was one example: Dalglish and Keane had a verbal agreement but Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson convinced him to join his team instead. Keane recalled that Dalglish was furious at him for the decision, and even threatening to sue him.<ref>Kissane, Sinead (2002-08-19) [http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/0819/keaneroy.html Keane tells of Dalgish fury] [[RT<U+00C9>]] Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

The club finished two positions higher the following season, as runners-up to Manchester United. By this time, Dalglish had added [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Tim Flowers]] and [[David Batty]] to his growing squad.

The [[1994<U+2013>95 in English football|1994<U+2013>95]] season saw Dalglish again break the transfer record, paying [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million for [[Chris Sutton]] who along with Shearer formed a formidable striking partnership. He had now spent over <U+00A3>27&nbsp;million putting together a squad that could make a serious challenge for the Premier League Championship. The challenge came and by the last game of the season both Blackburn and Manchester United were pushing for the title. Blackburn had to go to Dalglish's former club, Liverpool, with United having to go to East London to face [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at [[Upton Park]]. Dalglish celebrated even though Rovers went 2<U+2013>1 down to a late Redknapp winner. The news that Manchester United had failed to get the result they needed had filtered through to him via the radios in the crowd.

The title meant that Dalglish had been part of nine championship winning sides and the title win also sent Dalglish into the record books once again, being only the third manager in the history of the game to lead two different clubs to league championships, [[Herbert Chapman]] ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]) and [[Brian Clough]] ([[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Nottingham Forest]]) being the others.

After winning the Premier League, Dalglish became Director of Football on 25 June 1995 with [[Ray Harford]] taking over as manager of Blackburn. As the team's fortunes began to slide particularly in the Champions' League, questions arose about the precise nature of Dalglish's contribution to the cause. Dalglish parted company with Blackburn, by 'mutual consent', the end of the following season almost immediately after the departure of Alan Shearer whom he advised to go to Newcastle. However Dalglish left a legacy at Blackburn, a talent-spotting system which focussed on young and talented Irish footballers who were brought to the Brockhall training ground, one of the best in England, for training and development.

===Newcastle United===
On 14 January 1997, Dalglish was appointed manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], on a three and a half year contract, inheriting a squad of players reputed, by previous manager [[Kevin Keegan]], to be the best the club had ever had. From a starting point of fourth place in the Premier League on the exit of Keegan, Dalglish guided the club to a runner-up finish come May and a place in the new format of the following season's [[UEFA Champions League]]. However, the [[FA Premier League 1997<U+2013>98|1997<U+2013>98]] campaign only saw the team end up in 13th place. Many have claimed that the players Dalglish signed in the pre-season did not live up to those that he inherited from Keegan, whilst others reflect upon the long term injury of Alan Shearer to be the biggest woe he faced. But for all the domestic woes, 1997<U+2013>98 brought Dalglish some of his finest moments as manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], including the famous 3<U+2013>2 Matchday 1 [[UEFA Champions League]] win over [[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]], and the defeat of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] by one goal to nil at the semi-final stage of the [[FA Cup]]. However, Newcastle could only manage a 2-0 loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Final. Dalglish was sacked by [[Freddie Shepherd]], who had only hired him twenty months previously, after two draws in the opening two games of the subsequent [[FA Premier League 1998-99|1998-1999 season]] (namely, against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] and with one goal apiece in an away fixture to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], respectively), in favour of former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/159285.stm|title=Sport: Football Gullit named Newcastle boss |date=1998-08-27|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

Dalglish expressed his enforced departure as his only regret of his time on [[Tyneside]], having hitherto rebuilt the reserve side scrapped by predecessor Keegan and signed a number of players, including [[Nolberto Solano]], [[Gary Speed]] and [[Shay Given]], who would remain fixtures of the team into the 2000s.

===Celtic===
In June 1999 he was appointed Director of Football at Celtic, with his former Liverpool signing John Barnes appointed as head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/365579.stm|title=Dalglish back at Parkhead |date=1999-06-10|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> Barnes was sacked in February 2000 and Dalglish was appointed manager, and he guided them to the [[Scottish League Cup]] final where they beat [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2<U+2013>0 at Hampden Park. He left the club shortly after, paving the way for [[Martin O'Neill]] to usher in a new period of Celtic dominance in Scottish football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/celtic-decide-to-terminate-dalglishs-contract-714234.html|title=Celtic decide to terminate Dalglish's contract|date=2000-06-30|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

Dalglish was unhappy with the departure and Celtic's termination of his contract. He had recommended previous manager Barnes to the club and offered himself as a replacement manager should the young Barnes not succeed in the role.<ref>Forsyth, Roddy (2000-06-30) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/4754679/Dalglish-hits-out-over-messy-Celtic-divorce.html Dalglish hits out over messy Celtic divorce] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref> In spite of the termination of his contract, Dalglish vowed to stay on as Director of football. After a brief legal battle, Dalgish accepted Celtic's settlement offer of <U+00A3>600,000.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2994765/Dalglish-wins-600000-claim-against-Celtic.html Dalglish wins <U+00A3>600,000 claim against Celtic] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (2000-12-15) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

Since leaving Celtic Dalglish has been linked with a number of managerial vacancies, including those at Preston North End (March 2002), Liverpool (May 2004) and the Scottish national team (November 2004). In May 2007, he was linked with the managerial vacancy at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] following [[Neil Warnock]]'s resignation, but the job went to [[Bryan Robson]] instead. Nine years after his departure from Celtic, Dalglish has yet to make a return to management.

==Return To Liverpool==
In April 2009 Liverpool manager [[Rafael Ben<U+00ED>tez]] approached Dalglish about the possibility of a return to his former club, with discussion that he could return with a role in the club's youth academy. This appointment was confirmed on 3 July 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8012611.stm|title= Dalglish makes Liverpool return|date=2009-07-04|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> and he is also the club's ambassador. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8012611.stm|title=Benitez opens talks with Dalglish |date=2009-04-24|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

===Becoming Liverpool Manager?===
Following Liverpool's indifferent start to the 2009/10 season, Dalglish was linked with a sensational return to the manager's position as replacement for under fire [[Rafael Ben<U+00ED>tez]].<ref> {{cite web|url= http://www.extrafootie.co.uk/clubs/detailed/liverpool/30042/|title= Dalglish tipped to become next Liverpool manager|date=2009-10-21|work=ExtraFootie|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dalglish is married to Marina, who is a [[breast cancer]] survivor who was diagnosed in March 2003 and has recovered well from the disease. The couple have four children: [[Kelly Dalglish|Kelly]], [[Paul Dalglish|Paul]] (a former professional footballer), Lynsey and Lauren.

In 2004, Kenny and Marina founded The Marina Dalglish Appeal to raise money for breast cancer funding. Paul and Lynsey both participated in the Liverpool 2004 run,<ref>[http://www.marinadalglishappeal.org/index_5_1.htm Paul and Lynsey Dalglish do the Liverpool 2004 run]. Marina Dalglish Appeal.

Dalglish often competes in the annual [[Gary Player]] Invitational tournament, a charity golfing event which raises money for children's causes around the world.<ref>[http://garyplayerinvitational.com/miami/latestnews.html STAR-STUDDED FIELD JOINS GARY PLAYER & RONAN KEATING FOR 2005 GARY PLAYER INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY COCA-COLA].

As part of the [[Wayne_Rooney#Paul_Stretford_controversy|Paul Stretford Controversy]], it was revealed that Dalglish was a shareholder of the Proactive agency and that people within his social circle had connections with criminals.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/sports-hottest-property-a-collapsed-trial-and-the-seedy-world-of-football-535203.html Sport's hottest property, a collapsed trial, and the seedy world of football] ''[[The Independent]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-05</ref> He refused to make a statement to the police, or media, in response to claims he invited well known London gangster Sean 'Tommy' Adams to a business meeting in 2002.<ref>Jackson, Jamie (2004-10-17) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/oct/17/newsstory.sport7 Gangsters, blackmail and sleaze in the ugly game] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>

Dalglish spoke on camera regarding the Hillsborough Disaster in March, breaking a twenty-year silence on the event. Marking the twentieth anniversary of the disaster, he expressed regret that the police and the FA had not considered delaying the kick-off of the match; a move which could have averted the 96 deaths.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7921890.stm Dalglish breaks disaster silence] [[BBC Sport]] (2009-03-03) Retrieved on 2009-06-18</ref>
