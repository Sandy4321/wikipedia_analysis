The '''BFI National Archive''' is a department of the [[British Film Institute]], and one of the largest [[film archive|film archives]] in the world. Until [[2006]] it was known as the [[National Film and Television Archive]].

It collects, preserves, restores and then shares the [[film]]s and television programmes which have helped to shape and record British life and times since cinema was invented in the late nineteenth century. 

The collections themselves are accommodated on several sites. The J.[[Paul Getty]], Jr. Conservation Centre in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], named after its benefactor, is the base for much of the work, while approximately 140 million feet of flammable [[nitrate]] film is kept separately at a BFI storage site at [[Gaydon]] in [[Warwickshire]]. 

[[Film preservation]] is an ongoing project among filmmakers, historians, archivists, museums, and [[non-profit]] organisations to rescue aging [[film stock]] and preserve recorded images.  The collections held at the '''BFI National Archive''' were started in 1935 by [[Ernest Lindgren]], the first curator of what was then called the National Film Library, and now comprise over 275,000 feature, non-fiction and short films (dating from 1894) and 210,000 television programmes.  In recent years the Conservation Centre has completed a number of much anticipated restorations of a diverse range of film titles.  This has included the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by travelling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the U.K. in the early part of this century.

Films and television programmes are acquired mainly by donation or, in the case of independent television, via funding direct from the TV companies. Emphasis is placed on British productions but whenever possible important and popular movies from overseas are also acquired.
