'''Roberto Remigio Benigni''', [[Italian orders of merit|Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI]]<ref>[http://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/DettaglioDecorato.asp?idprogressivo=158641&iddecorato=158134 quirinale.it]</ref> (born [[October 27]], [[1952]]) is an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Italy|Italian]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[actor]], [[writer]] and [[film director|director]]. 

==Biography==
===Early years===
His first experiences as a theatre actor took place in 1972, in Prato. During that autumn he moved to [[Florence]] where he took part in some experimental theatre shows, some of which he also directed. In 1975, Benigni had his first theatrical success with ''Cioni Mario di Gaspare fu Giulia'', written by [[Giuseppe Bertolucci]].

Benigni became famous in Italy in the [[1970s]] for a shocking TV series called ''Onda Libera'', on RAI2, by [[Renzo Arbore]], in which he interpreted the [[satirical]] piece "anthem of the melt body" (''L'inno del corpo sciolto'', a hymn to [[defecation]]).{{Fact|date=January 2008}} A great scandal for the time, the series was suspended due to [[censorship]].  His first film was [[1977]]'s ''[[Berlinguer ti voglio bene]]'', also by Giuseppe Bertolucci.

Afterwards, he appeared during a public political demonstration of the [[Italian Communist Party]], of which he was a sympathiser, and in this occasion he took in his arms and dangled the national leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]], a very serious figure. It was an unprecedented act, given that until that moment Italian politicians were proverbially serious and formal (and Berlinguer was perhaps the most serious of them all). It represented a breaking point, after which politicians experimented with newer habits and "public manners", attended fewer formal events and, generally speaking, modified their lifestyle in order to exhibit a more popular behaviour. Benigni was censored again in the [[1980s]] for calling the [[Pope John Paul II]] something impolite during an important live TV show ("Wojtylaccio", meaning "Bad Wojtyla" in [[Italian language|Italian]]).

His popularity increased with another Arbore's show, ''[[L'altra domenica]]'' (1978), in which Benigni portrayed a lazy film critic who has never watched the film for which he is called to review.

===1980s===
Benigni's first film as director was ''[[Tu mi turbi]]'' (''You upset me'', [[1983 in film|1983]]). On the set he met the [[Cesena]]te actress [[Nicoletta Braschi]], who was to become his wife, and who has starred in most of the films he directed.

In [[1984]], he played in ''[[Non ci resta che piangere]]'' ("Nothing left to do but cry") with the very popular comic actor [[Massimo Troisi]]. The story was a fable in which the protagonists are suddenly thrown back in time to the 15th century, just a little before 1492. They start looking for [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in order to stop him from discovering the Americas (although for very personal love reasons), but are not able to reach him.

===Benigni in America and the collaboration with Cerami===
Beginning in [[1986]], Benigni starred in three films by American director [[Jim Jarmusch]]. In ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down By Law]]'' ([[1986 in film|1986]]) (which in Italy had its title spelled "Daunbail<U+00F2>", in Italian phonetics) he played Bob, the innocent abroad, convicted for murder, whose irrepressible good humour and optimism help him escape and find love (also starring Braschi as his beloved.) In ''[[Night on Earth (film)|Night on Earth]]'', ([[1991 in film|1991]]) he plays a cabbie in Rome, causing his passenger, a priest, great discomfort by confessing his revolting sexual experiences. Later, he also starred in the first of Jarmusch's series of short films, ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' ([[2003]]).

In [[1993 in film|1993]], he starred in ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'', directed by veteran [[Blake Edwards]]. There, he played [[Peter Sellers]]' Inspector Clouseau's illegitimate son who is assigned to save the Princess of Lugash. The film bombed in the US, but was a hit in Italy, his home country.

A serious role was in [[Federico Fellini]]'s last film, ''[[La voce della luna]]'' (1989). In earlier   years Benigni had started a long-lasting collaboration with screenwriter [[Vincenzo Cerami]], for a series of films which scored great success in Italy: ''[[Il piccolo diavolo]]'' ("The little devil", with [[Walter Matthau]]), ''[[Johnny Stecchino]]'' ("Johnny Toothpick"), and ''[[The Monster (1994 film)|Il Mostro]]'' ("The Monster").

===''Life Is Beautiful'' and beyond===
Benigni is probably best known outside [[Italy]] for his [[1997 in film|1997]] [[tragicomedy]] ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (''La vita <U+00E8> bella''), filmed in [[Cortona]] and [[Arezzo]], also written by Cerami. The film is about an Italian Jewish man who tries to protect his son's innocence during his internment at a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]], by telling him that [[the Holocaust]] is an elaborate game and he must adhere very carefully to the rules to win. Benigni's father had spent two years in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Bergen-Belsen]], and ''La Vita <U+00E8> bella'' is based in part on his father's experiences. In [[1998]], the film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and Benigni personally won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] is awarded to the film itself, but Academy rules stipulate that the  director will accept the award.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/79academyawards/rules/rule14.html Rule Fourteen - Special Rules for the Best Foreign Language Film Award]</ref> The score by [[Nicola Piovani]] also won an Oscar. Famously, in the midst of being so giddy with delight, he climbed on the back of the seat for his procession to the stage and applauded the audience after he was told he had won one of his Oscars. The next year's ceremony, when he read the nominees for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], host [[Billy Crystal]] playfully appeared behind him with a large net to restrain Benigni if he got excessive with his antics again.

Benigni played one of the main characters in ''[[Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar]]'' as Detritus, a corrupted Roman tax collector who wants to kill the Caesar and claim the throne of the [[Roman Empire]]. 

As a director, his [[2002 in film|2002]] film ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'', one of the most costly films of Italian cinema, was coldly received by critics, and bombed in North America, receiving a 0% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

That same year, he gave a typically energetic and revealing interview to Canadian filmmaker, [[Damian Pettigrew]] for ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2002), a cinematic portrait of the maestro that was nominated for Best Documentary at the [[European Film Awards]], Europe's equivalent of the [[Oscars]]. The film went on to win the prestigious Rockie Award for Best Arts Documentary at the [[Banff World Television Festival]] (2002) and the Coup de Coeur at the International Sunnyside of the Doc Marseille (2002).

Benigni's latest film is ''La tigre e la neve'' (''[[The Tiger and the Snow]]'', 2005), a love story set during the initial stage of the [[Iraq War]]. 

On [[October 15]], [[2005]], he performed an impromptu [[strip tease]] on Italy's most watched evening news program, removing his shirt and draping it over the newscaster's shoulders. Prior to removing his shirt, Benigni had already hijacked the opening credits of the news program, jumping behind the newscaster and announcing: "Berlusconi has resigned" (Benigni is an outspoken critic of media tycoon and former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]). The previous day, he led a crowd of thousands in Rome on Friday in protest at the center-right government's decision to cut state arts funding by 35 percent.

On [[February 2]], [[2007]], he was awarded the degree of [[Honorary Degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]] by the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], [[Belgium]].

Benigni was given offers to bring his Dante show to Broadway, but he has since turned them down.

==Other media==
Benigni is also a well appreciated improvisatory poet (''poesia estemporanea'' is a form of art popularly followed and practiced in [[Tuscany]]), and is appreciated for his explanation and recitations of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' by memory. He has reached over 45% of audience share on TV in [[Italy]] in his lectures on the Divine Comedy.

He is also a singer-songwriter. Among his performances recorded are some versions of [[Paolo Conte]]'s songs.

An animated clay Benigni fights and defeats [[Benito Mussolini]] in a ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' episode.
