'''Damme Priory''' ('''Priorat St. Benedikt, Damme''') is a [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] priory dependent on [[M<U+00FC>nsterschwarzach Abbey]], and is situated at Kemphausen in [[Damme, Germany|Damme]] in the [[Vechta (district)|district of Vechta]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]].

In December 1962 monks from M<U+00FC>nsterschwarzach settled in Kemphausen at the farm of the Kophanke family, the last member of whom (Fr<U+00E4>ulein Maria Kophanke) wished the property to be used for monastic purposes. From 1970 to 1983 the community had a small boarding-school and now run a guest-house.

The priory belongs to the [[Ottilien Congregation]] of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].
