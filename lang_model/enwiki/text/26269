'''Andrew William "Nicky" Barr''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]] (10&nbsp;December 1915 <U+2013> 12&nbsp;June 2006) was a member of the [[Australian national rugby union team]] and a [[flying ace|fighter ace]] with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&nbsp;II. He was credited with twelve aerial victories, all scored flying the [[Curtiss P-40]].  Born in [[New Zealand]], Barr was raised in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia against the [[United Kingdom]] in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940, and was posted to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]] in September 1941. His achievements as a combat pilot saw him awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]]. Shortly after taking command of his unit in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by [[Axis powers|Axis forces]], and incarcerated in Italy. He eventually escaped and assisted other [[Allied Powers|Allied]] fugitives to safety, earning the [[Military Cross]] for his efforts. After the war he was involved in the [[oilseed]] industry, for which he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1983. He died in 2006, aged ninety.

==Early career==
Barr was born in [[Wellington, New Zealand]] on 10&nbsp;December 1915. He grew up in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], where he attended [[Kew, Victoria|Kew Public School]] and played [[Australian rules football]]. After leaving school, he studied construction at Swinbourne Technical College, but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing [[rugby union]] in 1935, gaining selection for Victoria as a [[hooker (rugby)|hooker]] the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the [[United Kingdom]] with the Australian national team, the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. The tour was however cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2 September, due to the outbreak of World War II.<ref name="AWM 023231">[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/023231 Item 023231] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Returning to Australia, Barr joined the RAAF on 4&nbsp;March 1940. After undergoing instruction at No.&nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School and No.&nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School, he was commissioned as a [[Pilot Officer]] on 24 September.<ref name="AWM 023231"/><ref name="AWM">[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp Wing Commander Andrew William Barr, MC, DFC & bar] at Australian War Memorial.

==Combat service==
Barr was posted to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] on 28&nbsp;September 1941, flying [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Tomahawks]] with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]]. He achieved his first aerial victory, over a [[Messerschmitt Bf&nbsp;110]], on 12&nbsp;December, and followed this up with a [[Junkers Ju&nbsp;88]] and a [[Messerschmitt Bf&nbsp;109]] the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks, and Barr became an [[Flying ace|ace]] on New Year's day 1942, when he shot down two [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju&nbsp;87 ''Stukas'']] in the new model.<ref name="Garrisson">Garrisson 1999, pp. 113&ndash;115</ref><ref name="Thomas">Thomas 2005, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> On 8&nbsp;March, he led a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on [[Tobruk]] by twelve Ju&nbsp;87s escorted by ten [[Macchi C.&nbsp;202]]s and two Bf&nbsp;109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju&nbsp;87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref>Herington [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/10.pdf 1954, pp. 223&ndash;224]</ref> 

Eventually credited with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, Barr became No.&nbsp;3 Squadron's highest-scoring member. In one fortnight, he flew twenty [[sortie]]s,<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="AirForceNews">[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4811/features/feature01.htm "Goodbye to Aussie great"].

Retrieved on 30 April 2010.</ref> and six on 16&nbsp;June alone.<ref>Herington 1954, p. 241</ref> His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings "could be offset by unbridled aggression", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and  "overcome much better opponents by simply going for them".<ref name="Thomas"/> Promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]] on 1&nbsp;April 1942, he was made acting [[Squadron Leader]] and appointed [[Commanding Officer]] of No.&nbsp;3 Squadron in May, barely six months after commencing operations with the unit, following [[Bobby Gibbes]]' hospitalisation with a broken leg.<ref name="AWM"/><ref>Thomas 2005, p. 33</ref>

Three times while serving with No.&nbsp;3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11&nbsp;January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf&nbsp;109 and a [[Fiat G.50]], he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was "jumped" by two other Bf&nbsp;109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land. With the help of Libyan [[Senussi]] people in Libya, he was able to return to Allied lines.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="The Age">"Reluctant Hero". ''The Age''. 25 April 2002.

Retrieved on 15 June 2006.</ref> For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC), the full citation being published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 20&nbsp;February 1942:<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35463|startpage=844|date=20 February 1942|accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090320.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Andrew William Barr to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=on 30 April 2010}}</ref>

{{quote|This officer, who commenced operational flying in November, 1941, has displayed the greatest keenness and skill as a fighter pilot. In December, 1941, during a patrol over the Derna area, he shot down a Messerschmitt 110; the next day, in the same area, he destroyed a Messerschmitt 110 and a Junkers 88. One day in January, 1942, his squadron formed part of an escort to bomber aircraft operating over El Agheila. Enemy aircraft were encountered and, in the ensuing engagement, Flying Officer Barr attacked 2 Italian fighters, one of which he shot down. He then observed one of his fellow pilots, who had been shot down, waving to him from the ground but, when preparing to make a landing in an attempt to rescue him, Flying Officer Barr was attacked by 2 Messerschmitt 109s. Although the undercarriage of his aircraft was not fully retracted, he immediately manoeuvred to engage the attackers, only to find that his guns had jammed. Quickly rectifying the fault he delivered an accurate burst of fire which caused one of the Messerschmitts to disintegrate in the air. A further 2 enemy aircraft joined in the combat and Flying Officer Barr was wounded and forced down. While on the ground he was further wounded by the enemy's fire but, despite this, he made his way through the enemy's lines and rejoined our own forces some 3 days later. He brought back much valuable information regarding the disposition of enemy tanks and defences. Flying Officer Barr displayed the greatest courage and tenacity throughout. He has destroyed 8 enemy aircraft.}}

On 30&nbsp;May 1942, Barr engaged eight Bf&nbsp;109s and shot one down before being hit and forced to crash land at high speed behind enemy lines. He managed to walk back to base two days later.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="Wilson">Wilson 2005, pp. 86&ndash;87</ref> On 26&nbsp;June, however, after being shot down by two Bf&nbsp;109s and bailing out, he was captured by Italian soldiers and taken as a prisoner-of-war to Italy, where he received hospital treatment.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref>Thomas 2005, p. 38</ref>  Still incarcerated, he was awarded a [[medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC on 5&nbsp;February 1943, for "Destroying further enemy aircraft".<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35891|supp=yes|startpage=653|date=2 February 1943|accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090319.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Andrew William Barr to be awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=on 30 April 2010}}</ref>

Barr tried to escape from his Italian confinement four times, including one occasion where he jumped from a moving train. The fourth time, he managed to link up with an Allied special operations unit, which was gathering intelligence behind enemy lines. He also helped people escape over the [[Apennine Mountains]], along the so-called "Alpine Route". Barr eventually made it through this route himself. When he reached friendly lines in March 1944, he was sent to a military hospital in [[Vasto]], weighing only {{convert|55|kg|lb}} and in poor health.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref>Dornan 2002, pp. 231&ndash;239</ref> His escape and the assistance he rendered to other Allied fugitives earned him the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for "Exceptional courage", the award being promulgated on 1&nbsp;December 1944.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36820|supp=yes|startpage=5515|date=28 November 1944|accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090318.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Andrew William Barr to be awarded the Military Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=on 30 April 2010}}</ref> He is thought to be one of only five or six RAAF pilots to be awarded the MC during World War&nbsp;II.<ref name="Garrisson"/>

Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at [[Omaha Beach]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]+2 as officer-in-charge of an air support control unit. During the campaign in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]], he was able to fly rocket-armed [[Hawker Typhoon]]s on operations, despite officially being grounded.<ref>Dornan 2005, pp. 253&ndash;257</ref> After his return to Australia on 11&nbsp;September, he was promoted to acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] and appointed Chief Instructor at [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]], [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]]. Within a year, however, he was confined to No.&nbsp;6 RAAF Hospital, [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], and retired from the Air Force on 8&nbsp;October 1945.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="Garrisson"/>

|quote=I was not very proud of the things that I was called upon to do. Nonetheless, I accepted the fact that some people have to do the killing. But when you are recruited, it's not sold to you that way and you find out that after they teach you to fly they then teach you to kill. And, uh, I didn't like it at all, but I did it - that was my job.

After the war, Barr returned to Australia and to his wife, Dorothy. They had been married only a few weeks when he joined the RAAF, and she had been told on three occasions that her husband was dead.<ref name="The Age"/> The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947.<ref name="Dornan">Dornan 2005, pp. 273&ndash;274</ref> Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career but he became active in yachting, and briefly assisting fellow No.&nbsp;3 Squadron ace [[Bobby Gibbes]] in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms.<ref name="AirForceNews"/><ref name="Dornan"/> He also rejoined the RAAF on 20&nbsp;March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of Wing Commander.
