'''St Nicholas''' is the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[parish church]] of [[Blakeney, Norfolk]] in the deanery of [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] and the [[Diocese of Norwich]]. It stands just inland and about 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) above the small port. Of the original 13th-century building, only the [[chancel]] remains, the rest of the church having been rebuilt in the prosperous 15th century. The chancel may have survived owing to its link to the nearby [[monastery|friary]]. Unusual [[architecture|architectural]] features include a second tower, used as a beacon, at its east end, a stepped [[Window sill|seven-light]] window in the chancel, and a [[hammerbeam roof]] in the [[nave]]. Much of the original church furniture was lost in the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], but a [[Victorian restoration|late-Victorian restoration]] recreated something of the original appearance, as well as repairing and refacing the building itself.

The Victorian woodwork was created to match the few older pieces that remained, or to follow a similar style; thus, the new wooden [[pulpit]] follows the themes of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] [[Baptismal font|font]]. Of the [[stained glass]] smashed in the Reformation only fragments have been recovered, and these are incorporated in a window in the north [[aisle]] of the church. Nine [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] windows by [[James Powell and Sons]] are featured on the east and south sides of the church, and the north porch has two modern blue-themed windows. St Nicholas contains some notable memorials, including several plaques for the Blakeney [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s and their crews, and much pre-reformation [[graffiti]], particularly depictions of ships. The location of the latter suggests that they were [[worship|devotional]] in nature, although the saint concerned is now unknown. St Nicholas is a nationally important building, with a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listing]] for its exceptional architectural interest.

==History==
===Foundation to 1547===

St Nicholas is the parish church of Blakeney, a  small town that has a history dating back to at least early [[Neolithic]] times.<ref name = birk11>Birk (2003) p. 11</ref> It was one of a number of small ports opening onto the sheltered inlet of [[Blakeney Haven]], and exported a range of products including fish, grain, and timber.<ref name = pevsner/> In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1085, the town is recorded under the earlier name "Esnuterle" (Snitterley), the current name first appearing in 1340.<ref name= doom>Hinde (1998) pp. 182<U+2013>183</ref>

An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Snitterley, but its location is unknown, and it may well not have been the present site of St Nicholas.<ref name= wright>{{cite journal| last= Wright | first= John | year= 2002 | title =  The origins of Blakeney Church | journal= Glaven Historian | volume= 5 | pages= 26<U+2013>34 | url = | doi =  }}</ref> There are [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed]] ruins of a medieval building in the [[salt marsh]]es north of the present town described as "Blakeney Chapel", but, despite the name, it now seems likely that this was a domestic dwelling rather than a religious edifice.<ref name = BLB2>{{cite web| author = | title= Remains of Blakeney Chapel at Tg 043 452, Bodham | work= | url= http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-224568-remains-of-blakeney-chapel-at-tg-043-452 | publisher= British Listed Buildings }} Retrieved 19 September 2011 </ref><ref name = helm>{{cite web| author = | title= Blakeney Chapel SAM (Scheduled Ancient Monument), North Norfolk | work = HELM (Historic Environment Local Management) | url=http://www.helm.org.uk/server/show/ConCaseStudy.97  | publisher = [[English Heritage]] }} Retrieved 19 September 2011</ref><ref name =birk26>Birk (2003) p. 26</ref> Another possible chapel site east of the [[River Glaven|Glaven]] was shown on an 1835 map, but there is no documentation to support that identification.<ref name = birk2>Birk (2003) p. 2</ref>

The nearby [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[monastery|friary]] had its own church by 1321, built on land gifted by tenants of [[William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros|William de Roos]], "that the Carmelite friars, by the King's license, and that of Sir William Roos, might inhabit therein for ever, and might build a chapel". The friars were also given 100 [[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]] to build their church, in return for which they undertook "to pray for the good estate of the said Sir William Roos and his Lady Maud&nbsp;... and to have and to hold that lord and lady, and their heirs, for their principal founders".<ref name = blomefield/>

The original building on the present site was constructed in the late 13th or early 14th century,<ref name= wright/> at around the same time as the friary, which was founded in about 1296.<ref name= pevsner398>Pevsner (2002) p. 398</ref> Its hilltop location is unusual for the area; most nearby churches are built on mounds near water.<ref name= wrightdome>{{cite journal| last = Wright | first = John | year= 1998| title= Domesday Blakeney | journal = Glaven Historian | volume= 5 | pages= 46<U+2013>52 | url = | doi =  }}</ref> The new church was dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]], the [[patron saint]] of sailors.<ref name = bangor>{{cite web| author = | title= Deanery of Tindaethwy & Menai: St Mary & St Nicholas, Beaumaris | work= The Diocese of Bangor | url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/bangor/diocese/parish_details/tindaethwy_menai/stmarystnicholas.html | publisher= Church in Wales/Eglwys yng Nghymru }} Retrieved 11 September 2011</ref> and the [[Benefice|living]] was first recorded as being in the gift of Sir John de Cockfield, passing to his Bacon descendants before its acquisition by the [[Langley Abbey|Abbot and Convent of Langley]] in 1375.<ref name= blomefield>"[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=78565 Holt hundred: Blakeney or Sniterley]" in Blomefield (1808) pp. 361<U+2013>365</ref> The abbey controlled more than 60 Norfolk parishes,<ref name = langley>{{cite web| author = | title= Langley Abbey opens to the public for the first time since 1197 | work= | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/regions/east_of_england/press_releases/2010/280610.aspx Press release 8 June 2010 | publisher = [[Natural England]]}} Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> and the living of Blakeney was within its gift for the next sixty years,<ref name=linnellapp>Linnell (1984) Appendix: List of Rectors</ref> ending with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] of the abbey in 1435. The patronage seems then to have passed to the [[Earl of Sussex]],<ref name= blomefield/> but quickly transferred to John Calthorpe, a descendant of the original founder, John Cockfield, and it remained with his family until 1922.<ref name= blomefield/><ref name=linnellapp/> [[Alfred Jodrell|Sir Alfred Jodrell]] then acquired the patronage, bequeathing it to [[Keble College, Oxford]] on his death in 1956. Since 1989, the benefice has been in the gift of Keble College, and the [[Bishop of Norwich]].<ref name = gvb1/>

Blakeney gained its [[market charter]] in 1222, and by the early 15th century, Blakeney was one of the few ports permitted to trade in horses, gold and silver, through "merchants sworn by oath to the king", which contributed to the town's growing wealth.<ref name= Robinson3/> Few [[Early English Period|Early English]] churches survive in Norfolk owing to extensive rebuilding amid the prosperity of the 15th century,<ref name= pevsner49>Pevsner (2002) p. 49</ref> and the thriving port of Blakeney was no exception.<ref name = Linnell>Linnell (1984) pp.1<U+2013>9</ref> Only the [[chancel]] survived major reconstruction in 1434, probably because of its association with the Carmelite friary. John Calthorpe specified in his [[will(law)|will]] of 1530 that he was to buried  "in the White ffryes of Sniterlie [Blakeney] in the myddys of the chancel". The [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] [[nave]] and the 31&nbsp;m (104&nbsp;ft) west tower were part of the 1434 rebuilding, but the unusual second, slender, tower at the north-east corner of the church was of a later date.<ref name = pevsner>Pevsner (2002) pp. 394<U+2013>397</ref>

===Reformation and after===

The [[English Reformation]] inevitably affected St Nicholas. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] 1547 injunction decreed that all images in churches were to be dismantled or destroyed, including [[stained glass]], [[shrines]], [[rood]]s, statues and bells,<ref name= haigh>Haigh (1987) pp. 119<U+2013>121</ref> and [[altar]]s were to be dismantled and replaced by wooden tables.<ref name= nye>Nye (1965) p. 71</ref> Blakeney did not escape these changes; an ''Inventory of Church Goods of 1552'' and official visitations later in the century revealed that the chancel was falling into decay and "the church porche defiled with cattel".<ref name = Linnell/> The reports continue "the pavement is much broken&nbsp;... the walls are in decaie&nbsp;... east window is much broken&nbsp;... the chancel needs paving"&nbsp;<U+2013> it was even alleged that graves were left uncovered.<ref name= george/> The [[Rector#Anglican churches|rector]] from 1590 to 1621, Jacob Poynter, and his curate, Mr Aldriche, were keen [[Puritan]] reformers who refused to wear the [[surplice]] or use the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', and seemed to have had little concern for the fabric of the church.<ref name = Linnell/> One positive outcome of the Reformation was that registers were to be kept in every church to record baptisms, marriages and burials; the Blakeney registers are very largely complete from 1538.<ref name= george/>

By 1717, the local population seems to have been very homogeneous in terms of belief: "Persons, servants included, above the age of sixteen, the men chiefly sea-faring are supposed to be rather above three hundred. Papist none. Protestant dissenter none".<ref name = records1717>"Register bill of baptisms marriages and burials 1776<U+2013>1777"  ''Parish records of Blakeney''  PD619/19 at Norfolk Record Office</ref> Nevertheless, in 1854 there were [[Nonconformism|Non-conformist]] chapels of three denominations, of which only the [[Methodist]] remains.<ref name= white>White (1854) pp. 768<U+2013>769</ref>
[[File:Chancel stall.jpg|thumb|left|A chancel stall]]
The church was originally constructed of flint with stone dressings,<ref name = BLB/> but was substantially refaced with [[Knapping|knapped]] flint in the 1880s; the tower was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] at the same time. A wall was built behind the altar in 1886 to create a separate [[sacristy]] for storing [[vestment]]s and other items. The west tower was restored again in 1989, and the current doors to the sacristy were added in the same year.<ref name= pevsner/>

Electric lighting was installed in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962.<ref name = records1923>"Faculties, 1923<U+2013>1962" ''Parish records of Blakeney''  PD619/34 at Norfolk Record Office</ref> Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, [[plaster]]ing and [[whitewash|limewashing]] of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ.<ref name= Linnell/> The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a [[vestry]], toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the [[Local church|congregation]], a second altar was erected between the parclose screens to enable a more intimate celebration of the [[Eucharist]].<ref name= Robinson8/> St Nicholas was designated as a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listed building]] in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.<ref name = BLB>{{cite web| author = | title= Church of St Nicholas, Blakeney | work= | url= http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-222864-church-of-st-nicholas-blakeney | publisher= British Listed Buildings }} Retrieved 10 September 2011</ref>

The benefice has expanded during the long history of its church. [[Cockthorpe, Norfolk|Cockthorpe and Little Langham]] parish was added in 1606, [[Letheringsett with Glandford|Glandford]] in 1743, [[Wiveton]] in 1922,<ref name = gvb1>{{cite web| author = | title= St Martin's, Glandford: incumbents | work= | url= http://www.northnorfolkcentral.co.uk/GlavenValley/Glandford/history/rectors.html | publisher= The Glaven Valley Benefice }} Retrieved 23 September 2011</ref><ref name= Linnell/> and [[Cley next the Sea|Cley]] in 1935.<ref name = gvb2>{{cite web| author = | title= St Margaret's, Cley: incumbents | work= | url= http://www.northnorfolkcentral.co.uk/GlavenValley/Cley/History/rectors.html | publisher= The Glaven Valley Benefice }}  Retrieved 23 September 2011</ref> The parish is in the deanery of Holt, the Diocese of Norwich and the [[Province of Canterbury]].<ref name = CE>{{cite web| author = | title= Blakeney: St Nicholas, Blakeney | work= A church near you | url= http://www.achurchnearyou.com/blakeney-st-nicholas/| publisher= Church of England }} Retrieved 29 September 2011</ref> The rector originally received [[Tithes#Tithing in the Middle Ages|tithes]] to support himself and the church,<ref name= blomefield/> but this was later replaced by rent from the [[glebe]] (church lands).<ref name= white/> Rector Pointer, for example, received tithes and also had the income from the sales of his [[cereal|corn]] and [[saffron]] crops.<ref name= george>{{cite journal| last= George | first= Jean | year = 1998 | title =  The Reverend James Pointer: Rector of Blakeney (1584<U+2013>1621) and Wiveton (1591<U+2013>1621) | journal= Glaven Historian | volume = 1  |language = | issue =  | pages= 15<U+2013>19 | url = | doi =  }}</ref> The state had supported poorer clergy since the introduction of [[Queen Anne's Bounty]] in 1704, but since 1947 the [[Church Commissioners]] have been responsible for arranging the [[stipend]]s and pensions of Anglican priests.<ref name = CE1>{{cite web| author = | title= History | work= The Church Commissioners | url= http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/churchcommissioners/history.aspx | publisher=Church of England }} Retrieved 22 September 2011</ref><ref name = CE2>{{cite web| author = | title= Clergy Payroll Services | work= Office holders | url=http://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/clergypay.aspx | publisher=Church of England }} Retrieved 22 September 2011</ref>

The west tower of this large, lead-roofed church is supported by stepped [[buttress]]es at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces.<ref name= brandon20>Brandon (1860) p. 20</ref> They rest on stone [[plinth]]s, each bearing carved shields.<ref name = Linnell/> That on the north buttress has an inaccurate rendition of the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the [[diocese of Norwich|see]],<ref name= pevsner/> the other has a design featuring a cross and a dolphin,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal| last= Blomefield | first= Francis | year=1808  | title= Holt hundred: Blakeney or Sniterley | journal= An Essay towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk | volume= 9 | pages= 361<U+2013>365 | url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=78565 | doi =  }}</ref> The tower is surmounted with [[battlements|crenellation]]s and [[pinnacle]]s, and has three Perpendicular lights in the [[bell tower|belfry]] and a large [[Window sill|four-light]] west window in the same style.<ref name= pevsner/>

The 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) long and 14&nbsp;m (47&nbsp;ft) high [[nave]],<ref name= tea>St Nicholas Welcome Group (1992) ''Tea in the Tower'' leaflet</ref> and the [[aisle]]s on its north and south sides, have six [[bay (architecture)|bays]] lit by Perpendicular windows, each aisle bay window having four lights apiece, with three-light windows in the [[clerestory]] above.<ref name= pevsner/> The north porch, rebuilt in 1896,<ref name = Linnell/> occupies the westernmost bay in the north aisle. The nave's oak and chestnut [[hammerbeam roof]] dates from the 15th century, and features carved angels on the hammers. These rest on arched braces, except above each window, where the hammers rest on [[corbel]]s instead. The only trace of the earlier 13th-century nave is the reuse of some older stone, mainly in the north aisle,<ref name= pevsner/> and the raised chancel walls, and some [[Purbeck Marble]] fragments beneath the west tower.<ref name = Linnell/>
[[File:The church of St Nicholas - misericord - geograph.org.uk - 843962.jpg|Carved end of a [[misericord]]|thumb|upright|left|120px]]
The Lady Chapel in the south aisle and St Thomas' Chapel in the north aisle were dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St Mary]] and [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas of Canterbury]] respectively. They fell into disuse in the Reformation, but were restored in the 1880s.<ref name = Linnell/>

The 13th-century chancel has two [[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|rib vaulted]] bays, making it one of only six extant Early English vaulted chancels.<ref name= hoey>{{cite journal| last= Hoey | first= Lawrence | year= 1994 | title=  Stone Vaults in English Parish Churches in the Early Gothic and Decorated Periods | journal= Journal of the British Archaeological Association | volume=  147 | pages= 36<U+2013>51 | url = | doi =  }}</ref> Its walls were raised in the 15th century by constructing a chamber above the vaulting using stone from the demolished 13th-century nave,<ref name = Linnell/> but, from the outside, this end of the church is still lower than the western section. Internally, the chancel vault is much lower than the adjacent nave because of the room above. It has three 15th-century Perpendicular windows down each side,<ref name= pevsner/> and is notable for the unusual east window with seven stepped lights, a feature found in only two other Early English churches,<ref name= brandon84> Brandon (1860) p. 84</ref> [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and St Martins in [[Ockham, Surrey|Ockham]].<ref name= Robinson3>Robinson (2006) pp. 3<U+2013>5 </ref> The chancel contains three simple [[sedilia]], or priest's seats, with [[trefoil]] arches and round columns.

The [[polygon]]al eastern tower has stepped buttresses at its corners and [[louver|louvred]] [[bell tower|belfry]] windows just below the parapet.<ref name= pevsner/> Its origins are not entirely clear, but it was possibly originally a turret for stairs leading to a room over the chancel, later extended upwards as an aesthetic enhancement and to act as a beacon for mariners.<ref name = BLB/> Its date is uncertain, but it is much later than the chancel. Although its lack of height compared to the west tower has led to some questioning of its suitability as a beacon, it has been suggested that lining up the two towers guided ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks;<ref name= Robinson3/> this is the "leading light" practice later achieved using pairs of [[lighthouse]]s at different levels.<ref name = harwich>{{cite web| author = | title= High and Low Lighthouses | work= | url=http://www.harwich-society.co.uk/old/info_lighthouses.htm | publisher= Harwich Society| }} Retrieved 9 October 2011 </ref>

==Furnishings and fixtures==
[[File:The church of St Nicholas - baptismal font - geograph.org.uk - 843970.jpg|thumb|upright|The font]]

The octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]] dates from the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the [[Four evangelists#Evangelists' symbols|symbols]] of the [[Four Evangelists]] with seated figures of the [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]] ([[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], and [[Pope Gregory I]]).<ref name="Robinson3" /> The central column carries shields depicting the [[Arma Christi|Instruments of the Passion]] and the [[Holy Wounds]]. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers to the story of [[Saint Peter]] striking off the ear of [[Malchus]], the [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest's]] servant, in the garden of [[Gethsemane]].<ref name = Linnell/>

Most East Anglian churches lost their medieval furnishings in the upheavals of the Reformation, and Blakeney is no exception. Apart from the hammerbeam roof, there is little original wood work in the nave; a few benches in the aisles, the [[fleur-de-lis]]-decorated rood loft (a carved beam supporting the [[rood]]), and two panels of the [[rood screen]]. The chancel retains four of its original [[choir stall]]s with their [[misericord]]s, which are decorated with head and leaf motifs on the arms. St Nicholas benefited from sympathetic [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. The new stalls and misericords match the style of the old, and the 1886 [[pulpit]] echoes the font, with the Instruments of the Passion on the stone stand, and the twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] carved on the woodwork. The pulpit has been described as "Victorian craftsmanship of matchless quality". The north porch was restored in 1896, and in the following year the west tower was repaired, and [[pew]]s of a 15th-century pattern placed in the nave.<ref name = Linnell/><ref name= Robinson8/>

1910 saw the restoration of the rood screen in a style consistent with that of the two ancient panels, the reconstruction of the rood loft, and the installation of a [[Norman and Beard]] [[manual (music)|two-manual]] [[pipe organ|organ]] with more than a thousand pipes. The [[organ pipe]]s are above the parclose screens (extensions forward from the ends of the rood screen); the [[Bellows|bellow]]s, [[Pipe organ#Action and wind system|wind chest]] and electric blower are concealed in the chamber above the chancel.<ref name= Robinson8>Robinson (2006) pp. 8<U+2013>10</ref> The stalls with their [[misericord]]s were restored in 1913.<ref name = pevsner/> The rood [[crucifix]], flanked by St Mary and [[John the Evangelist|St John]], came from Germany in 1913.<ref name= Robinson8/>
[[File:The church of St Nicholas - Norwich School glass - geograph.org.uk - 843968.jpg|thumb|Fifteenth-century glass panel|left|125px]]
Much church plate, such as the [[chalice]] and [[pyx]] had been confiscated, sold or stolen in the heat of the Reformation.<ref name= Whiting>Whiting (2010) pp. 58<U+2013>61</ref> In the more tolerant climate of [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Elizabethan]] England, the excesses of extreme Protestantism were curbed by centralised control of the [[Church of England]], the [[Act of Uniformity]] and the ''Book of Common Prayer''.<ref name= nye/><ref name= Loades >Loades (2003) p. 46</ref> Most churches then had to buy a new [[chalice]]; Blakeney's was purchased in 1567, and exchanged for another in 1716. One lost treasure is a "Map of the World" (''Mappa Mundi et Chroniculum Mundi''), which was recorded as present in the church in 1368. This is thought more likely to be a version of [[Ranulf Higdon|Ranulf Higdon's]] ''Polychronicon'', a geographical text, than a true map like the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]].<ref name = Linnell/>

The [[stained glass]] is mostly late 19th-century [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] by [[James Powell and Sons]]. Powell, coincidentally based at Whitefriars, a former Carmelite friary in London, used leading members of the movement such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] as designers, and his nine windows at Blakeney are regarded as fine examples of his work.<ref name = Robinson2010>Robinson (2010) pp. 7, 11, 18</ref> The east window dating from 1895 represents the ''[[Te Deum]]'', and the south windows, glazed in 1900, tell the story of the early British church. Some 15th-century fragments of the original [[Norwich School (glassmakers)|Norwich School]] glass that had been buried in the churchyard during the Reformation were incorporated into one of the otherwise plain windows in the north aisle in 1938, showing "Christ rising from the tomb", with six angels above.<ref name = pevsner/><ref name = Linnell/><ref name = records1923/> The north porch is flanked by two blue-themed modern stained glass windows by [[Jane Gray (stained glass artist)|Jane Gray]] from 2002, one dedicated to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], the other to the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI).<ref name= Robinson8/> The current [[reredos]] and altar were erected in 1923, as was a wooden war memorial in the north aisle.<ref name = Linnell/>

Most churches prior to the Reformation had painted walls, often with [[mural]]s; these were whitewashed by the reformers, and often religious texts or the [[Ten Commandments]] replaced the images. These inscriptions were in turn obliterated under the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].<ref name=Whiting2>Whiting (2010) pp. 119<U+2013>132</ref> At Blakeney, as elsewhere, the coloured walls are now the plain white typical of English churches.<ref name = campion/>

==Memorials==
[[File:Calthorpe plaque4.JPG|John Calthorpe's "synfull body" lies under this plaque|thumb]]
John Calthorpe's "synfull body" lies at the eastern end of the nave under a marble gravestone and a brass plaque that carries his [[coat of arms|arms]] and a Latin inscription  describing him as {{lang|lat|''uni fundatorum fratum convent''}}, "a founder [benefactor] of the convent of friars".<ref name = Linnell/> It is possible that he was originally buried in the chancel of the Carmelite friary, as he requested, but was re-interred in the nave of St Nicholas at the Dissolution.<ref name= wright/><ref name= blomefield/> A number of other stones carry standard tags in Latin or English requesting prayers or simply stating the identity of the internee, but Sir John Smyth's 1460 memorial enjoined "As I am that shall you be, Pray for the sowle of me".<ref name= white/>

Blakeney was a [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] station from around 1825 to 1924. Various wall plaques commemorate the boats' rescues and crew losses from 1862, when the RNLI took over the running of the service, up to the station's closure. There are two blue wooden boards from the RNLI listing the earlier lifeboats and their achievements; the ''Brightwell'' (1862), another ''Brightwell'' (1863), the ''Zaccheus Burroughs'' (1891), and the ''Hettie'' (1873). Next to these is a stone plaque listing the rescues from 1877 to 1924, including those of the last lifeboat, the ''Caroline'' (1908), and further along the north aisle a painting of George Long, skipper of the ''Caroline'', is placed above the record of its most famous rescues on consecutive days on 7 and 8 January 1918, when 30 people were saved from two steamers in a storm.<ref name = edp>{{Cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = St Nicholas Church, Blakeney | newspaper = Eastern Daily Press | location = Norwich | pages = | language = | publisher = Archant Regional Ltd| date = 15 April 2010| url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/norfolk-history/27_st_nicholas_church_blakeney_1_214329 }}</ref> A large wooden board acts as a [[war memorial]], listing those locals who died in various military engagements.

The interiors of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation [[graffiti]], unless they have been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, [[merchant's mark]]s and other symbols, but is notable for the large number of depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone would have been much more conspicuous that they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as an act of devotion by the seafaring inhabitants of the port.<ref name= campion>{{cite journal | last = Champion | first = Matthew | year= 2011 | title = Walls have ears, noses, ships  | journal= Cornerstone | volume= 32 | issue = 2 | pages= 28<U+2013>32 | url = | doi =  }}</ref> The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the [[Bronze Age]],<ref name= Wachsmann>Wachsmann (1997) p. 147</ref> and has been found across Europe.<ref name= walsh>{{cite journal| last= Walsh | first= Michael J K | year= 2008 | title=  'On of the Princypalle Havenes of the See': The Port of Famagusta and the Ship Graffiti in the Church of St George of the Greeks, Cyprus  | journal= International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume= 37 |language = | issue = 1 | pages= 115<U+2013>129 | url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.2007.00171.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last= Crumlin-Pedersen | first= Ole | coauthors=  Thye, Birgitte Munch (eds) | year= 1994 |title = The ship as symbol in prehistoric and medieval Scandinavia | journal= Papers from an international research seminar at the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen, 5th<U+2013>7th May 1994 | volume=  |language = | issue =  | page= 182 | url = | doi =  }}</ref><ref name= Ovcharov >{{cite journal| last= Ovcharov | first= Dimitar | year= 1977 | title=  Ship graffiti from medieval Bulgaria | journal= International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume= 6 | issue = 1 |language = | pages= 59<U+2013>61 | url = | doi =  10.1111/j.1095-9270.1977.tb00988.x }}</ref>

The long patronage of the Calthorpes under their various incarnations as the [[Baron Calthorpe|Lords Calthorpe]], [[Gough-Calthorpe family|Gough-Calthorpes]] and [[Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe Baronets|Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpes]] has already been noted. A Henry Calthorpe was rector from 1743 to 1781, and was followed by Richard Thomas Gough, who held the living for 43 years. Gough and Richard Henry Tillard, incumbent from 1858 to 1906, are commemorated by plaques in the chancel. Of the other rectors, [[Mowbray O'Rorke]] had been [[Bishop of Accra]] from 1913, but accepted the Blakeney living in 1924, remaining until he retired in 1939, and [[Jim Bishop (bishop)|Clifford Leofric Purdy (Jim) Bishop]], rector from 1949 to 1953, rose to become [[Bishop of Malmesbury]] from 1962.<ref name = Linnell/>

The [[graveyard]], as in many coastal parish churches, contains mainly local people and seafarers. Several stones bear the surname "Long", a name carried by five of the crew of the ''Caroline'' on its epic rescues in January 1918.<ref>[http://www.beansboattrips.co.uk/lifeboat.html Lifeboat ''Caroline'']</ref> A notable outsider buried here is [[Tim Birkin|Sir Henry "Tim" Birkin]] a leading British racing driver and one of the "[[Bentley Boys]]" of the 1920s.<ref name = Linnell/>
