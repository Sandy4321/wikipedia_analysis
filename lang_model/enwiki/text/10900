==Background==
By 1851 a dirt, and often muddy, road had been completed between Portland and the Tualatin Valley following the canyon of Tanner Creek on the eastside of the Tualatin Mountains.<ref name=baun>Buan, Carolyn M. ''This Far-Off Sunset Land: A Pictorial History of Washington County, Oregon''. Donning Company Publishers, 1999.</ref> A [[plank road]] was suggested by Portland entrepreneur and proprietor [[Daniel H. Lownsdale]] as a means to transport abundant Tualatin Valley farm produce and grains to [[California Gold Rush]]-inflated markets in [[San Francisco, California]].<ref> {{cite web

The Portland & Valley Plank Road Company was formed and sold stock to finance the planking in 1851, with area residents such as [[John S. Griffin]] purchasing stock.<ref name=baun/>

The ratification and ceremonial first plank was laid at a ceremony in October 1851.  The road was completed in 1856, though never completely planked, it was favored by farmers of [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]], [[Yamhill County, Oregon|Yamhill]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] counties since it saved between three and ten miles travel to the next nearest ports at [[St. Johns, Oregon|St. Johns]] and [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]], but on a rough muddy road through deep woods.<ref name="scott112"/>

== Route ==
The historic route is almost completely paved over by modern roads.  Beginning at [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] near where the [[Vista Bridge]] is now, Jefferson Street transitions into Canyon Road, both in street signs and modern maps.  It went up the canyon behind the [[Vista Ridge Tunnels]] where the [[Sunset Highway (Oregon)|Sunset Highway]]<U+2014>also known as [[U.S. Route 26 (Oregon)|U.S. Route 26]]<U+2014>goes over Sylvan hill.  Part way up the hill, the road in front of the [[Oregon Zoo]] is named ''Canyon Road'', so perhaps the road zigzagged to ascend the grade.  Slightly west of Sylvan, an interchange with modern Canyon Road, also known as [[Oregon Route 8]], continues southwest into Beaverton.  At the junction with Hocken Road two blocks west of Cedar Hills Boulevard, the contemporary road name changes to [[Tualatin Valley Highway]] ("TV Highway"), though it is likely Canyon Road continued further west originally.
