It borders the [[Ceremonial county|counties]] of [[Somerset]] and [[Gloucestershire]], also located near the historic cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to the south east and [[Gloucester]] to the north. The city is built around the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]], and it also has a short coastline on the estuary of the [[River Severn]] where it flows into the [[Bristol Channel]].

Bristol is the largest centre of culture, employment and education in the region. Its prosperity has been linked with the sea since its earliest days. The commercial [[Port of Bristol]] was originally in the city centre before being moved to the [[Severn Estuary]] at [[Avonmouth]]; [[Royal Portbury Dock]] is on the western edge of the city boundary. In more recent years the economy has depended on the [[aerospace]] industry, and the city centre docks have been regenerated as a centre of heritage and culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/oct/30/property |title=Bristol: seemingly unstoppable growth |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-12-18 | publisher=The Guardian | date= 30 October 2007}}</ref>  There are 34 other populated places on Earth [[List of places called Bristol|named Bristol]], most in the [[United States]], but also in [[Peru]], [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Costa Rica]], all presumably commemorating the original.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geody.com/geolook.php?world=terra&map=col&q=bristol&subm1=submit|title=Bristol on Geody|work=Geody|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5409039.ece|title=Richmond, in Surrey, is the most widely copied British place name worldwide|work=Times Online|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

There are a number of different ways in which Bristol's boundaries are defined, depending on whether the boundaries attempt to define the city, the built-up area, or the wider "[[Greater Bristol]]". The narrowest definition of the city is the [[Bristol City Council|city council]] boundary, which takes in a large section of the [[Severn Estuary]] west as far as, but not including, the islands of [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1312817302&type=-1&title=Bristol%3b+City+of+UA+|title=NOMIS (www.nomisweb.co.uk) area boundary for the Bristol unitary authority|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> A slightly less narrow definition is used by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS); this includes built-up areas which adjoin Bristol but are not within the city council boundary, such as [[Whitchurch, Bristol|Whitchurch]] village, [[Filton]], [[Patchway]], [[Bradley Stoke]], and excludes non-built-up areas within the city council boundary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1371537983&type=-1&title=Bristol+Urban+Area+-+Bristol+(urban+area+subdivisions)|title= NOMIS (www.nomisweb.co.uk) area boundary for the Bristol urban area|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>  The ONS has also defined an area called the "Bristol Urban Area", which includes [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Mangotsfield]], [[Stoke Gifford]], [[Winterbourne, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], [[Frampton Cotterell]], [[Almondsbury]] and [[Easton-in-Gordano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D8271.xls|title=Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas|format=xls|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> The term "Greater Bristol", used for example by the Government Office of the South West,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwesteip.co.uk/downloads/documents/sts.pdf|title=Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study|last=Atkins|date=2005|publisher=South West Regional Assembly|format=PDF|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref> usually refers to the area occupied by the city and parts of the three neighbouring local authorities ([[Bath and North East Somerset]], [[North Somerset]] and [[South Gloucestershire]]), an area sometimes also known as the "former [[Avon (county)|Avon]] area" or the "[[West of England]]".

By the 14th century Bristol was one of England's three largest [[medieval]] towns after London, along with [[York]] and [[Norwich]], with perhaps 15,000<U+2013>20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the [[Black Death]] of 1348<U+2013>49.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/LocalHistory/LocalHistoryTable1.htm |title=Largest towns in England in 1334 |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-03-10 |work=Love my town }}</ref> 
The plague resulted in a prolonged pause in the growth of Bristol's population, with numbers remaining at 10,000&ndash;12,000 through most of the 15th and 16th centuries. The [[Diocese of Bristol]] was founded in 1542,<ref>{{cite web|url=URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=35299|title=BRISTOL: Introduction|last=Horn|first=Joyce M|date=1996|work=Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541-1857: volume 8: Bristol, Gloucester, Oxford and Peterborough dioceses|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|pages=3-6|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

Traditionally this is equivalent to the town being granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. During the [[English Civil War|1640s English Civil War]] the city was occupied by [[Cavalier|Royalist]] military, after they overran [[Royal Fort]], the last [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] stronghold in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title= Bristol | work=Fortified Places | url=http://www.fortified-places.com/bristol.html | accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> 

Renewed growth came with the 17th-century rise of England's [[American colonies]] and the rapid 18th-century expansion of England's part in the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic trade]] in Africans taken for [[slavery]] in the [[Americas]]. Bristol, along with [[Liverpool]], became a centre for the [[Triangular trade]].

Competition from [[Liverpool]] from c.&nbsp;1760, the disruption of maritime commerce caused by wars with [[France]] (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the [[North of England]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. The passage up the heavily [[tidal]] [[Avon Gorge]], which had made the port highly secure during the [[Middle Ages]], had become a liability which the construction of a new "[[Floating Harbour]]" (designed by [[William Jessop (engineer)|William Jessop]]) in 1804&ndash;9 failed to overcome, as the great cost of the scheme led to excessive harbour dues.<ref name="buchanan-cossons">{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=R A|coauthors=Cossons, Neil|title=The Industrial Archaeology of the Bristol Region|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|date=1969|pages=32-33|chapter=2|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Nevertheless, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801) quintupled during the 19th century, supported by new industries and growing commerce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/GBH_match_page.jsp?ons=Bristol |title=A vision of Bristol UA/City |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-01-29 |work=A Vision of Britain}}</ref>

Bristol's city centre suffered severe damage from [[Luftwaffe]] bombing during the [[Bristol Blitz]] of [[World War II]].<ref>[http://fishponds.org.uk/luftbrim.html John Penny MA; The Luftwaffe over the Bristol area 1940-44]Retrieved: 14 July 2008</ref> The original central shopping area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed out churches and some fragments of the castle. A third bombed church nearby, [[St Nicholas, Bristol|St Nicholas]], has been restored and has been made into a museum which houses a [[triptych]] by [[William Hogarth]], painted for the high altar of [[St Mary Redcliffe]] in 1756. The museum also contains statues moved from [[Arno's Court Triumphal Arch]], of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] and [[King Edward III]] taken from Lawfords' Gate of the city walls when they were demolished around 1760, and 13th century figures from Bristol's Newgate representing Robert, the builder of [[Bristol Castle]], and [[Geoffrey de Montbray|Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances]], builder of the fortified walls of the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Four figures on Arno's Gateway | work=Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project | url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR137.htm | accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

The rebuilding of [[Bristol city centre]] was characterised by large, cheap 1960s [[tower block]]s, [[brutalist architecture]] and expansion of roads.  Since the 1980s another trend has emerged with the closure of some main roads, the restoration of the [[Georgian period]] [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] and [[Portland Square, Bristol|Portland Square]], the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping area, and the demolition of one of the city centre's tallest post-war blocks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4608986.stm |title=Demolition of city tower begins |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-03-10 |work=BBC News | date= 13 January 2006}}</ref>
 
The removal of the docks to [[Avonmouth Docks]] and [[Royal Portbury Dock]], {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} downstream from the city centre during the 20th century has also allowed redevelopment of the old central dock area (the "[[Floating Harbour]]") in recent decades, although at one time the continued existence of the docks was in jeopardy as it was viewed as a derelict industrial site rather than an asset. However the holding, in 1996, of the first [[International Festival of the Sea, 1996|International Festival of the Sea]] in and around the docks, affirmed the dockside area in its new leisure role as a key feature of the city.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= |coauthors=|title=Bristol's Harbourside: A Guide to the City Docks |year=1997 |publisher=Hotwell Press |location=Bristol |isbn=0-9530270-0-7 |author=Jeremy McNeill ; illustrations by Ben Wookey. }}</ref>

Deals were originally struck on a personal basis in the former trading area around Corn Street, and in particular, over bronze trading tables, known as "[[The Exchange, Bristol#The Nails|The Nails]]". This is often given as the origin of the expression "cash on the nail", meaning immediate payment, however it is likely that the expression was in use before the ''nails'' were erected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knowles|first=Elizabeth|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|isbn=0198602197|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>

In the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at [[Filton]], by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], and aero-engine manufacture by [[Bristol Aero Engines]] (later [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]]) at [[Patchway]]. The aeroplane company became famous for the [[World War I]] [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]],<ref name="BOYNE">{{cite book|last=Boyne|first=Walter J|title=Air Warfare|publisher=ABC-Clio|date=1 July  2002|pages=105|isbn=1576073459|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=famous+bristol+planes&source=bl&ots=SfcPo0zjYU&sig=_EXbInDZkREunbEYGb7FZmPFkAQ&hl=en&ei=kTm9SanPFsPgtgel5rj3Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA105,M1|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> and [[World War II|Second World War]] [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] and [[Beaufighter]] aircraft.<ref name="BOYNE" /> In the 1950s it became one of the country's major manufacturers of civil aircraft, with the [[Bristol Freighter]] and [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]] and the huge [[Bristol Brabazon|Brabazon]] airliner. The [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] diversified into car manufacturing in the 1940s, producing hand-built [[luxury car]]s at their factory in [[Filton]], under the name [[Bristol Cars]], which became independent from the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1960.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.boc.net/history.html | work= Bristol Owners Club | title= A brief history of the Bristol Marque | accessdate= 2007-08-29}} </ref>  The city also gave its name to the Bristol make of buses, manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983, first by the local bus operating company, [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways]], and from 1955 by [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles]].

[[Image:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|left|The last ever flight of any [[Concorde]], 26 November 2003. The aircraft is seen a few minutes before landing on the [[Filton]] runway from which it first flew in 1969.]]
In the 1960s Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French ''[[Concorde]]'' supersonic airliner project. The Bristol Aeroplane Compny became part of the British partner, the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC). Concorde components were manufactured in British and French factories and shipped to the two final assembly plants, in [[Toulouse]] and Filton.  The French manufactured the centre fuselage and centre wing and the British the nose, rear fuselage, fin and wingtips, while the [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Olympus 593]] engine's manufacture was split between [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (Filton) and [[SNECMA]] ([[Paris]]). The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to [[RAF Fairford]] on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concordesst.com/history/earlyindex.html |title=Concorde Early History |work=concordesst.com |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2008-12-20 }}</ref>
In 2003 [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] decided to cease flying the aircraft and to retire them to locations (mostly museums) around the world. On 26&nbsp;November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Filton airfield to be kept there permanently as the centrepiece of a projected air museum.

===Dialect===
A dialect of [[English language|English]] is spoken by some Bristol inhabitants, known colloquially as ''Bristolian'', or even more colloquially as "Bristle" or "Brizzle". Bristol is the only large English city with a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], in which the ''r'' in words like ''car'' is pronounced. The unusual feature of this dialect, unique to Bristol, is the ''Bristol L'' (or ''terminal L''), in which an ''L'' sound is appended to words that end in an 'a' or 'o'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stoke |first=Harry |authorlink= |coauthors=Vinny Green |title=A Dictionary of Bristle |year=2003 |publisher=Broadcast Books |location=Bristol |isbn=1874092656 }}</ref> 
Thus "area" becomes "areal", etc. Further Bristolian linguistic features are the addition of a superfluous "to" in questions relating to direction or orientation (a feature also common to the coastal towns of [[South Wales]]), or using "to" instead of "at"; and using male [[pronouns]] "he", "him" instead of "it". For example, "Where's that?" would be phrased as "Where's he to?", a structure exported to [[Newfoundland English]].<ref>{{cite web | title=An Introduction to Newfoundland Vernacular English | work=Language Variation in Canada | url=http://www.unh.edu/linguistics/courses/790CS/final.papers/NF.English.paper.htm | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

[[Image:Cabot Tower (600px).jpg|thumb|[[Cabot Tower (Bristol)|Cabot Tower]] viewed from Brandon Hill park.]]
Stanley Ellis, a dialect researcher, found that many of the dialect words in the Filton area were linked to work in the aerospace industry.  He described this as "a cranky, crazy, crab-apple tree of language and with the sharpest, juiciest flavour that I've heard for a long time".<ref>Simon Elmes, "Talking for Britain", p.39</ref>

Bristol City Council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards. They are elected in thirds with two councillors per ward, each serving a four-year term. Wards never have both councillors up for election at the same time, so effectively two-thirds of the wards are up each election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Council-Democracy/Democracy-Elections/future-elections.en |title= Wards up for future elections|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |work=Bristol City Council }}</ref> 
The Council has long been dominated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but recently the [[Liberal Democrats]] have grown strong in the city and as the largest party took minority control of the Council at the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives joined forces to vote down the Liberal Democrat administration, and as a result, Labour ruled the council under a minority administration, with Helen Holland as the council leader.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6682343.stm |title=Council leader battle resolved |date=2007-05-27|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-31 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

[[Northavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northavon]] also covers some of the suburbs, but none of the administrative county. At the next General Election, the boundaries will be changed to coincide with the county boundary. Kingswood will no longer cover any of the county, and a new [[Filton and Bradley Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Filton and Bradley Stoke]] constituency will include the suburbs in South Gloucestershire.

Bristol has a tradition of local political activism, and has been home to many important political figures. [[Tony Benn]], a veteran left-wing politician, was Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South East]] from 1950 until 1983. [[Edmund Burke]], MP for the [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol constituency]] for six years from 1774, famously insisted that he was a Member of Parliament first, rather than a representative of his constituents' interests. In 1963, there was a boycott of the city's buses after the Bristol Omnibus Co. refused to employ black drivers and conductors. The boycott is known to have influenced the creation of the UK's [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/nov/10/race.immigrationpolicy |title=In praise of... the Race Relations Acts |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |author=Alan Rusbridger |authorlink=Alan Rusbridger |coauthors= |date=2005-11-10 |publisher=Guardian |pages=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 
The women's rights campaigner [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]] (1867<U+2013>1954) was born in Bristol. The city was the scene of the first of the 1980s riots. In St. Paul's, a number of largely African-Caribbean people rose up against racism, police harassment and mounting dissatisfaction with their social and economic circumstances before similar disturbances followed across the UK. Local support of [[fair trade]] issues was recognised in 2005 when Bristol was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status.<ref>

Bristol is unusual in having been a city with county status since medieval times.

==Geography==
[[Image:Bristol, Avon Gorge from Clifton Down.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Avon Gorge]], home to several unique plant species.]]
===Physical Geography===
Bristol is in a [[limestone]] area, which runs from the [[Mendip Hills]] to the south and the [[Cotswolds]] to the north east.<ref>{{cite web | title= Cotswold Hills Geopark | url= http://www.cotswoldhillsgeopark.org/ | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>
The rivers [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] cut through this limestone to the underlying clays, creating Bristol's characteristic hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through [[flood plain]]s and areas which were marshy before the growth of the city. To the west the Avon has cut through the limestone to form the [[Avon Gorge]], partly aided by glacial meltwater after the last [[ice age]].<ref name="10.1144/GSL">{{cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Alfred Brian|date=1973|title=The geology and slopes of the Bristol region|journal=Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology|publisher=Geological Society of London|location=London|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=185-205|accessdate=2009-03-07}}</ref> The gorge helped to protect Bristol Harbour, and has been quarried for stone to build the city. The land surrounding the gorge has been protected from development, as [[The Downs (Bristol)|The Downs]] and [[Leigh Woods]]. The gorge and [[estuary]] of the Avon form the county's boundary with [[North Somerset]], and the river flows into the [[Bristol Channel]] at [[Avonmouth]] at the mouth of the [[River Severn]]. There is another gorge in the city, in the [[Blaise Castle]] estate to the north.<ref name="10.1144/GSL" />

===Climate===
Situated in the south of the country, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK, with a mean annual temperature of 10.2-12&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (50-54 <U+00B0>F).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif |title=Average annual temperature |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |work=Met Office | year= 2000 }}</ref> 
It is also amongst the sunniest, with 1,541<U+2013>1,885&nbsp;hours sunshine per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif |title=Average annual sunshine |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |work=Met Office |year= 2000 }}</ref> 
The city is partially sheltered by the [[Mendip Hills]], but exposed to the [[Bristol Channel]], Annual rainfall is similar to the national average, at 741-1,060&nbsp;mm (29.2<U+2013>41.7&nbsp;in). Rain falls all year round, but autumn and winter are the wettest seasons. The Atlantic strongly influences Bristol's weather, maintaining average temperatures above freezing throughout the year, although cold spells in winter often bring frosts. Snow can fall at any time from mid-November through to mid-April, but it is a rare occurrence. Summers are drier and quite warm with variable amounts of sunshine, rain and cloud. Spring is unsettled and changeable, and has brought spells of winter snow as well as summer sunshine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif |title=Average annual rainfall |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |work=Met Office |year= 2000 }}</ref>

[[Image:castle.park.bristol.arp.jpg|thumb|St Peter's ruined church in Castle Park, Bristol.]]
Bristol was among the first cities to adopt the idea of [[town twinning]]. In 1947 it was twinned with [[Bordeaux]] in [[France]] and [[Hannover]], the first post-war twinning of British and [[Germany|German]] cities. Twinnings with [[Porto]], [[Portugal]] (1984), [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (1988), [[Puerto Morazan]], [[Nicaragua]] (1989), [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Mozambique]] (1990) and [[Guangzhou]], [[China (PRC)|China]] (2001) have followed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/ |title=Town twinning |dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2007-05-12 |work=Bristol City Council }}</ref>
