He is currently fighting in EliteXC.

==Career==
In the early half of his career, Smith <U+2013> fighting at heavyweight <U+2013> compiled victories in the [[International Fighting Championships]] and [[Gladiator Challenge]] shows across the United States.  While successful in the smaller promotions, Smith's first major appearance in the mixed martial arts world came in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting]] organization.  Smith entered a WEC [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]] tournament with limited name recognition, but was branded by experts as the [[dark horse]] of the competition.

Smith defeated WEC veteran [[Tim McKenzie]] in the semi-finals.  With that victory, Smith was slated to fight [[Justin Levens]] in the tournament finals; Levens, however, was halted on doctor's advice due to a shoulder injury he sustained in his semi-final bout.  The tournament alternate, [[Tait Fletcher]], was brought into the championship round instead.  Smith made short work of Fletcher, scoring a first-round technical knockout to become the WEC Light Heavyweight Champion.

Smith would defend his championship from Justin Levens at '''WEC 18''' before scheduling a fight with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in April of 2006, moving down a weight class to fight [[David Terrell (fighter)|David Terrell]] at ''[[UFC 59]]''.  The fight <U+2013> marked with questionable officiating <U+2013> ended in controversial fashion, prompting Smith to file a complaint with the California State Athletic Commission.

Smith was then seen as a middleweight contestant on [[The Ultimate Fighter|The Ultimate Fighter: The Comeback]], where he quickly lost his quarterfinal matchup against [[Travis Lutter]].  Smith appeared on the season finale, knocking out [[Pete Sell]] in the second round of a very exciting fight in a sequence that saw Smith sustain a hard punch to the body, and throw the bout-winning knockout punch before falling to the ground in pain.

Smith lost his next fight in the UFC by decision against [[Patrick Cote (fighter)|Patrick Cote]] at ''[[UFC 67]]''. [http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail.FightCard&eid=386]  More recently, Smith defeated [[Troy Miller (fighter)|Troy Miller]] by technical knockout at ''Palace Fighting Championship 2'' in [[Lemoore, California]]. He lost against [[Ed Herman (fighter)|Ed Herman]] at UFC 72. Herman submitted Smith with a rear naked choke at 2:25 in the second round after Herman landed a nasty elbow on Smith in the first round covering his face in blood.

Smith made his EliteXC debut on February 16th knocking out [[Kyle Noke]] seven seconds into round two.
The victory earned him a title shot against [[Robbie Lawler]]. The bout was declared a no contest after an accidental poke in the eye in the third round. The first two rounds were so exciting that [[Gary Shaw]] awarded both fighters their win bonuses and announced an immediate rematch.
