'''Wallis, Duchess of Windsor''' (born '''Bessie Wallis Warfield''', later '''Spencer''', then '''Simpson'''; 19 June 1896<ref name="birth"/> &ndash; 24 April 1986) was an American [[socialite]] who married, as her third husband, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor]], formerly King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom.

Wallis's father died shortly after her birth, and she and her widowed mother were partly supported by their wealthier relatives. Her first marriage, to a [[United States Navy|U.S. naval]] officer, was punctuated with periods of separation and eventually ended in divorce. In 1934, during her second marriage, she allegedly became the mistress of Edward, [[Prince of Wales]]. Two years later, after Edward's accession as [[British monarch|King]], Wallis divorced her second husband and Edward proposed to her.

The King's desire to marry a twice-divorced American with two living ex-husbands caused a [[constitutional crisis]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Dominion]]s, which ultimately led to the King's [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] in December 1936 to marry "the woman I love".<ref>{{citation|last=Windsor|first=The Duke of|authorlink=Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|publisher=Cassell and Co Ltd|location=London|title=A King's Story|year=1951|page=413}}</ref> After the abdication, the former king was created [[Duke of Windsor]] by his brother [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]. Edward married Wallis six months later, after which she was formally known as the Duchess of Windsor, without the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] "''Her Royal Highness''".

Before, during and after [[World War II]], the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were suspected by many in government and society of being [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] sympathisers. In the 1950s and 1960s, she and the Duke shuttled between Europe and the United States, living a life of leisure as society celebrities. After the Duke's death in 1972, the Duchess lived in seclusion and was rarely seen in public. Her private life has been a source of much speculation, and she remains a controversial figure in British history.

==Early life==
Bessie Wallis (sometimes written "Bessiewallis") Warfield  was born in Square Cottage at Monterey Inn, directly across the road from the [[Monterey Country Club]], in the resort town of [[Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania|Blue Ridge Summit]], [[Pennsylvania]]. She was the only child of Teackle Wallis Warfield and Alice Montague.<ref name="weir">{{citation|first=Alison|last=Weir|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy Revised edition |publisher=Random House|year=1995|page=328|isbn=0-7126-7448-9}}</ref> She was named in honour of her father and her mother's sister, Mrs Bessie Buchanan Merryman, and was generally known as Wallis.

The dates of her birth and of her parents' marriage are unclear.<ref name="birth">On a 1924 ship's passenger manifest for the [[SS France (1910)|SS ''France'']], accessible on ellisisland.org, her birthdate is given as 19 February 1892, though her age was listed as 28. According to the 1900 census returns, quoted by author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], she was born in June 1895, before her parents' marriage (Higham, p. 4). Author [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]], noted that, though Higham's "scandalous assertion of illegitimacy enlivens the telling of the Duchess's life", "the evidence to support it is slim indeed", and that it "strains credulity" (King, p. 11). Most sources agree on 19 June 1896.</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Greg|last=King|authorlink=Greg King (author)|title=The Duchess of Windsor|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1999|page=11|isbn=1-55972-471-4}}</ref><ref name="higham">{{citation|first=Charles |last=Higham|authorlink=Charles Higham (biographer)|title=Mrs Simpson|publisher=Pan Books|year=2005|page=4|isbn=0-330-42678-8}}</ref> Her parents were married on either 19 November 1895<ref name="king">King, p. 13</ref> or the same day of the following year.<ref name="higham" /> Her father died of [[tuberculosis]] on either 15 November 1896,<ref name="king" /> or the same day of the following year.<ref name="higham" /> For her first few years, she was raised in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in modest, even impoverished, circumstances, dependent upon the charity of a wealthy uncle, Solomon Warfield.<ref>Higham, p. 5</ref>

In 1901, her aunt Bessie Merryman was widowed, and the following year Alice and Wallis moved into her large and comfortable house at 9 West Chase Street, Baltimore. A fellow pupil at Wallis's school recalled, "She was bright, brighter than all of us. She made up her mind to go to the head of the class, and she ''did''."<ref>Higham, p. 7</ref> Wallis was always immaculately dressed and pushed herself hard to do well.<ref>Higham, p. 8</ref>

In 1908, Wallis's mother, Alice, married her second husband, John Freeman Rasin. On 17 April 1910, Wallis was confirmed at Christ Episcopal Church, Baltimore, even though there are no contemporaneous records of her ever being baptised.<ref name="higham" /> Between 1912 and 1914, Solomon Warfield paid for Wallis to attend [[Oldfields School]], the most expensive girls' school in Maryland. There she made friends with heiress Ren<U+00E9>e du Pont, a daughter of Senator [[T. Coleman du Pont]], of the [[du Pont family]], and Mary Kirk, whose family founded [[Stieff Silver|Kirk Silverware]].<ref>Higham, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

==First marriage==
In May 1916, Wallis met [[Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr.]], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] pilot, at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]], while visiting her cousin Corinne Mustin.<ref>Higham, p. 18</ref> It was at this time that Wallis witnessed two airplane crashes about two weeks apart, resulting in a life-long fear of flying.<ref>Higham, p. 20</ref> On 8 November 1916, the couple married at Christ Episcopal Church in Baltimore which had been Wallis's parish. Win, as her husband was known, was an alcoholic. He drank even before flying and once crashed into the sea, but escaped almost unharmed.<ref>Higham, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> After the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Spencer was posted to [[San Diego]] as the first commanding officer of a training base in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]], now known as [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. They remained there until 1920.<ref>Higham, pp. 26<U+2013>28</ref> In 1920, Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited San Diego but he and Wallis never met.<ref>Higham, p. 29</ref> Later that year, Spencer left his wife for a period of four months, but in the spring of 1921 they were reunited in [[Washington, D.C.]], where Spencer had been posted. They soon separated again, and in 1923, when Spencer was posted to the [[Far East]] as commander of the {{USS|Pampanga|PG-39|2}}, Wallis remained behind, continuing an affair with an Argentine diplomat, Felipe Espil.<ref name="dnb">{{citation|last=Ziegler|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=Windsor, (Bessie) Wallis, duchess of Windsor (1896<U+2013>1986)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/38277 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38277|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> In January 1924, she visited Paris with her recently widowed cousin Corinne Mustin,<ref>{{citation|last=Bloch|first=Michael|title=The Duchess of Windsor|year=1996|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|page=22|isbn=0297835904}}</ref> before sailing to the Far East aboard a troop carrier. The Spencers were briefly reunited until she fell ill from drinking contaminated water, after which she was evacuated to [[Hong Kong]].<ref>Higham, p. 38</ref>

An [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)#Fascist Italy|Italian]] diplomat remembered Wallis from her time in [[Warlord era|China]]: "Her conversation was brilliant and she had the habit of bringing up the right subject of conversation with anyone she came in contact with and entertaining them on that subject."<ref>Higham, p. 46</ref> According to Hui-lan Koo, the second wife of the Chinese diplomat and later [[President of the Republic of China]] [[Wellington Koo]], the only Mandarin phrase that Wallis learned during her sojourn in Asia was "Boy, pass me the champagne".<ref>{{citation|last=Koo|first=Madame Wellington|title=Hui-Lan Koo: An Autobiography as told to Mary van Rensselaer Thayer|location=New York|publisher=Dial Press|year=1943}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Catherine|last=Maher|title=Madame Wellington Koo's Life Story|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=31 October 1943|page=BR7}}</ref>

Wallis toured China, and stayed with Katherine and Herman Rogers, who were to remain long-term friends, while in [[Beijing]].<ref>Higham, p. 47</ref> According to the wife of one of Win's fellow officers, Mrs [[Milton E. Miles]], it was there that Wallis met Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]], later [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] son-in-law and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]], had an affair with him, and became pregnant, leading to a botched abortion that left her unable to conceive.<ref>Higham, p. 50</ref> The rumour was later widespread but never substantiated and Ciano's wife, [[Edda Mussolini]], denied it.<ref>{{citation|author=Moseley, Ray|year=1999|title=Mussolini's Shadow: The Double Life of Count Galeazzo Ciano|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-07917-6|pages=9<U+2013>10}}</ref> By September 1925, Wallis and her husband were back in the United States, though living apart.<ref>Higham, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> They divorced on 10 December 1927.<ref name="weir" />

==Second marriage==
By the time her marriage to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis had already become involved with [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson]], a mild-mannered half-English, half-American shipping executive and former captain in the [[Coldstream Guards]].<ref>Higham, pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref> He divorced his first wife, Dorothea (by whom he had a daughter, Audrey), to marry Wallis Spencer on 21 July 1928 at the [[Register Office]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[London]].<ref name="weir" /> Wallis had telegraphed her acceptance of his proposal from [[Cannes]] where she was staying with her friends, Mr and Mrs Rogers.<ref>Higham, p. 58</ref>

The Simpsons temporarily set up home in a furnished house with four servants in [[Mayfair]].<ref>Higham, p. 64</ref> In 1929, Wallis sailed back to the United States to visit her sick mother, who was by now married to Charles Gordon Allen. During the trip, Wallis's investments were wiped out in the [[Wall Street Crash]], and her mother died penniless on 2 November 1929. Wallis returned to England and with the shipping business still buoyant,<!--Pun intended!--> the Simpsons moved into a large flat with a staff of servants.<ref>Higham, p. 67</ref>

Through a friend, Consuelo Thaw, Wallis met Consuelo's sister [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Thelma, Lady Furness]], the then-mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales.<ref>Higham, p. 68</ref> On 10 January 1931, Lady Furness introduced Wallis to the Prince.<ref>Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 37</ref> The Prince was the eldest son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and [[heir apparent]] to the throne. Between 1931 and 1934, he met the Simpsons at various house parties, and Wallis was presented at court. Ernest was beginning to encounter financial difficulties, as the Simpsons were living beyond their means, and they had to fire a succession of staff.<ref>Higham, pp. 73<U+2013>80</ref>

==Relationship with Edward, Prince of Wales==
In December 1933, while Lady Furness was away in [[New York City|New York]], Wallis allegedly became the Prince's mistress. Edward denied this to his father, despite his staff seeing them in bed together as well as "evidence of a physical sexual act".<ref>Diary of [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram]] quoted in {{citation|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|year=1989|title=George VI|location=London|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|pages=145<U+2013>147|isbn=0297796674}}</ref> Wallis soon ousted Lady Furness, and distanced the Prince from a former lover and confidante, the Anglo-American textile heiress [[Freda Dudley Ward]].<ref>{{citation|last=Ziegler|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=King Edward VIII: The official biography|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1991|isbn=0-394-57730-2|pages=227<U+2013>228}}</ref>

By 1934, Edward was irretrievably besotted with Wallis, finding her domineering manner and abrasive irreverence toward his position appealing; in the words of his official biographer, he became "slavishly dependent" on her.<ref name="dnb" /> At an evening party in [[Buckingham Palace]], he introduced her to his mother<U+2014>his father was outraged,<ref>Ziegler, p. 231</ref> primarily on account of her marital history (divorced people were excluded from court).<ref>{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|coauthors=Edited by [[A.

In 1935, [[Special Branch]] detectives reported that Wallis was also having an affair with Guy Marcus Trundle, an engineer who was "said to be employed by the [[Ford Motor Company]]". Such claims were doubted, however, by Captain Val Bailey, who knew Trundle well and whose mother had an affair with Trundle for nearly two decades.<ref name="fox">{{citation|first=James|last=Fox|title=The Oddest Couple|journal=[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]|issue=517|pages=276<U+2013>291|date=1 September 2003|issn=07338899}}</ref>

==Abdication crisis==
{{main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}

On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his accession from a window of [[St. James's Palace]], in the company of the still-married Wallis.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 265</ref> It was becoming apparent to Court and Government circles that Edward meant to marry her.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 277<U+2013>278</ref> The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-led [[UK National Government|British government]], as well as distressing his mother and brother.<ref>Ziegler, pp. 289<U+2013>292</ref> Although the pre-war British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, foreign media widely reported their relationship.<ref>{{citation|last=Broad |first=Lewis|title=The Abdication|publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd|location=London|year=1961|page=44}}</ref>

[[Image:Wallis Time.jpg|thumb|Wallis was named [[Person of the Year|Woman of the Year]] by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in 1936. It was the first time the magazine had a Woman rather than a Man of the Year.]]The monarch of the United Kingdom is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]<U+2014>at the time of the proposed marriage, and until 2002, the [[Church of England]] did not permit the re-marriage of divorced people with living ex-spouses.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/mcad/|title=Marriage in Church After a Divorce|publisher=The Church of England|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Accordingly, while there was no civil law barrier to Edward marrying Wallis, the constitutional position was that the King could not marry a divorc<U+00E9>e and remain as King (for to do so would conflict with his role as Supreme Governor).<ref>Beaverbrook, pp. 39<U+2013>44 and p. 122</ref> Furthermore, the British government and the governments of the [[Dominion]]s were against the idea of marriage between the King and an American divorc<U+00E9>e for other reasons.<ref name="ziegler">Ziegler, pp. 305<U+2013>307</ref> She was perceived by many in the [[British Empire]] as a woman of "limitless ambition",<ref>Sir [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]] writing to [[Neville Chamberlain]] quoted in Higham, p. 191</ref> who was pursuing the King because of his wealth and position.<ref>Ziegler, p. 234 and p. 312</ref>

Wallis had already filed for divorce from her second husband and the [[decree nisi]] was granted on 27 October 1936.<ref name="ashley">{{citation|first=Mike|last=Ashley|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|publisher=Robinson|location=London|year=1998|page=701|isbn=1-84119-096-9}}</ref> Her relationship with the King had become public knowledge in the United Kingdom by early December. Wallis decided to flee the country as the scandal broke, being driven to the south of France in a dramatic race to outrun the press. For the next three months, she was under siege by the press at the Villa Lou Viei, near [[Cannes]], the home of her close friends Herman and Katherine Rogers.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 359</ref>

Back in the United Kingdom, the King consulted with the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a [[morganatic marriage]], where the King would remain King but Wallis would not be Queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia and South Africa.<ref name="ziegler" /> If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government would be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.<ref>Beaverbrook, p. 57</ref>

At her hideaway in the south of France, Wallis was pressured by the King's [[Lord-in-Waiting]], [[Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow]], to renounce the King. On 7 December 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he had helped her draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King.<ref>{{citation|first=Adrian|last=Tinniswood|authorlink=Adrian Tinniswood|title=[[Belton House]]|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]]|year=1992|page=34|isbn=0707801133}}</ref> However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. As the issue of abdication gathered strength, [[John Theodore Goddard]], Wallis's [[solicitor]], stated: "[his] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined." This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,191136,00.html |title=Edward and Mrs Simpson cast in new light|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|coauthors=Evans, Rob|date=2 March 2000|journal=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref>

The King signed the [[Instrument of Abdication]] on 10 December 1936, in the presence of his three surviving brothers, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|the Duke of York]] (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|the Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]]. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the [[Dominion]]s finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward made a broadcast to the people, saying of Wallis, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love."<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 413</ref>

Afterwards, Prince Edward left Britain and went to Austria, staying at Schloss [[Enzesfeld-Lindabrunn|Enzesfeld]], the home of Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was no danger of compromising the granting of a decree absolute in her divorce proceedings. Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, she resumed her maiden name of Wallis Warfield. The couple were reunited at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Cand<U+00E9>]], Monts, France, on 4 May 1937.<ref>Higham, p. 224</ref>

==Third marriage: Duchess of Windsor==
[[Image:Wallis and Edward.jpg|thumb|The Windsors on their wedding day]]

Wallis and Edward married one month later on 3 June 1937 at the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Cand<U+00E9>, lent to them by [[Charles Bedaux]], who later worked actively for [[Nazi Germany]] in World War II.<ref>{{citation|first=Patrick|last=Howarth|title=George VI|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1987|page=73|isbn=0091710006}}</ref> The date would have been King [[George V of England|George V]]'s 72nd birthday; Queen [[Mary of Teck|Mary]] thought the wedding had been scheduled for then as a deliberate slight.<ref>Letter from Queen Mary to Queen Elizabeth, 21 May 1937, Royal Archives, QEQM/PRIV/RF, quoted in {{citation|last=Shawcross|first=William|authorlink=William Shawcross|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother: The Official Biography|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=9781405048590|page=422}}</ref> No member of the [[British Royal Family]] attended, and the marriage was to be childless.

Edward had previously been created [[Duke of Windsor]] by his brother, the new George VI. However, [[letters patent]], passed by the new King and unanimously supported by the Dominion governments,<ref>Diary of [[Neville Chamberlain]] quoted in Bradford, p. 243</ref> prevented Wallis, now the Duchess of Windsor, from using the style of ''[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]]''. The new King's firm view, that the Duchess should not be given a royal title, was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother)]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/edward_duke.htm|title=Home Office memo on the Duke and Duchess's title|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> At first, the Royal Family did not accept the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former king sometimes met his mother and siblings after his abdication. Some biographers have suggested that Queen Elizabeth, Edward's sister-in-law, remained bitter towards Wallis for her role in bringing George VI to the throne (which she may have seen as a factor in George VI's early death),<ref>Higham, p. 437</ref> and for prematurely behaving as Edward's consort when she was his mistress.<ref>Bradford, p. 172</ref> But these claims were denied by Queen Elizabeth's close friends; for example, the [[Hugh FitzRoy, 11th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] wrote that she "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with."<ref>{{citation|last=Hogg|first=James|coauthors=Mortimer, Michael|title=The Queen Mother Remembered|publisher=BBC books|year=2002|isbn=0-563-36214-6|pages=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> On the other hand, the Duchess of Windsor referred to Queen Elizabeth as "Mrs Temple" and "Cookie", alluding to her solid figure and fondness for food, and to her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II)]], as "Shirley", as in [[Shirley Temple]].<ref>{{citation|last=Bloch|first=Michael|title=The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor|year=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|location=London|isbn=059301667X|page=259}}</ref> The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>See also, {{citation|last=Bloch|first=Michael (ed.)|title=Wallis and Edward: Letters 1931<U+2013>1937|publisher=Summit Books|year=1986|isbn=0-671-61209-3|pages=231, 233}} Cited in Bradford, p. 232</ref> However, within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style "''Her Royal Highness''" was used by those who were close to the couple.<ref>Higham, p. 232</ref>

According to the wife of former [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Diana Mitford]], who knew both the future Queen Mother and the Duchess of Windsor but was only friendly with the latter, the Queen's antipathy toward her sister-in-law may have had a deeper source. As Lady Mosley wrote to her sister, the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], after the death of the Duke of Windsor, "probably the theory of their [the Windsors'] contemporaries that Cake [a Mitford nickname for the Queen Mother, derived from her confectionary fashion sense] was rather in love with him [the Duke] (as a girl) & took second best, may account for much."<ref>Letter from Lady Mosley to the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], 5 June 1972, in Mosley, Charlotte (ed.)

[[Image:Nazi Windsors.jpg|left|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor with [[Adolf Hitler]].]]

The Duke and Duchess lived in France in the pre-war years. In 1937, they visited Germany as personal guests of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leader, [[Adolf Hitler]], a tour much publicised by the German media.

==World War II==
Following the outbreak of war in 1939, the Duke was given a military post in the British Army stationed in France. According to the son of [[William Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside]], the Duchess continued to entertain friends associated with the fascist movement, and leaked details of the French and Belgian defences gleaned from the Duke.<ref>Higham, p. 305</ref> When the Germans invaded the north of France and bombed Britain in May 1940, the Duchess told an American journalist, "I can't say I feel sorry for them."<ref>Higham, p. 313</ref> As the German troops advanced, the Duke and Duchess fled south from their Paris home, first to [[Biarritz]], then in June to Spain. There, she told the [[United States Ambassador to Spain|United States ambassador]], [[Alexander W. Weddell]], that France had lost because it was "internally diseased".<ref>Higham, p. 323</ref> In July, the pair moved to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where the British ambassador billeted them at first in the home of a banker who may have been a double agent working for both Germany and Britain.<ref>Bloch, ''The Duke of Windsor's War'', p. 102</ref> In August, a British warship dispatched the pair to [[the Bahamas]] and the Duke was installed as Governor.

Wallis performed her role as the Governor's lady competently for five years. However, she hated [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], calling it "our [[St Helena]]", in a reference to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s final place of exile.<ref>Higham, p. 330 and Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 153 and 159</ref> She was heavily criticised for her extravagant shopping trips to the United States, undertaken when Britain was under rationing and blackout.<ref name="dnb" /> Her racist attitudes towards the local population (she called them "lazy, thriving [[nigger]]s" in letters to her aunt) reflected her upbringing.<ref>Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 165</ref><ref>When telling a story of how Wallis complained about blacks being allowed on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)]], Joanne Cummings, the wife of [[Nathan Cummings]], said of Wallis, "She grew up in the South, at a certain time, with certain prejudices." Source: Menkes, p. 88</ref> In 1941, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] strenuously objected when she and her husband planned to tour the Caribbean aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom Churchill stated to be "pro-German". Churchill felt compelled to complain again when the Duke gave a "defeatist" interview.<ref>Howarth, p. 130</ref> The British [[The Establishment|establishment]] distrusted the Duchess; Sir [[Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Alexander Hardinge]] wrote that her anti-British activities were motivated by a desire for revenge against the country that rejected her as its queen.<ref>Howarth, p. 113</ref> After the war, the couple returned to France and retirement.

==Later life and death==
[[File:The Duchess of Windsor (1970).jpg|thumb|right|The Duchess of Windsor in 1970]]
In 1946, when the Duchess was staying at Ednam Lodge, the home of the [[William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley|Earl of Dudley]], some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the [[British Royal Family]], as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the [[Royal Collection]] by the Duke, or by the Windsors themselves<U+2014>they made a large deposit of loose stones at [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] the following year. However, in 1960, Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were only a small portion of the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.<ref>{{citation|last=Menkes|first=Suzy|authorlink=Suzy Menkes|title=The Windsor Style|publisher=Grafton Books|location=London|year=1987|pages=192<U+2013>193|isbn=0246132124}}</ref>

On George VI's death in 1952, the Duke returned to England for the funeral. The Duchess did not attend; the previous October whilst staying in London she had told her husband, "I hate this country. I shall hate it to my grave."<ref>Higham, p. 443</ref> Later that year, they were offered the use of a house by the Paris municipal authorities. The couple lived at 4 rue du Champ d'Entra<U+00EE>nement in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]] near Paris for most of the remainder of their lives, essentially living a life of easy retirement.<ref>Menkes, pp. 11<U+2013>48</ref> They bought a second home in the country, where they soon became close friends with their neighbours, Oswald and Diana Mosley.<ref>Higham, p. 449 and Ziegler, p. 545</ref> Years later, Diana Mosley claimed that the Duke and Duchess shared her and her husband's views that Hitler should have been given a free hand to destroy [[Communism]].<ref>Higham, p. 450</ref> As the Duke himself wrote in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' of 13 December 1966: "...it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever&nbsp;... I thought the rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out."<ref>Higham, pp. 259<U+2013>260</ref>

In 1965, when the Duke and Duchess visited London as the Duke required eye surgery, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] and [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]] visited them. Later, in 1967, the Duke and Duchess joined the Royal Family in London for the unveiling of a plaque by the Queen to commemorate the centenary of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s birth.<ref>Higham, pp. 466<U+2013>469</ref> Both the Queen and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] visited the Windsors in Paris in the Duke's later years, the Queen's visit coming only shortly before the Duke died.<ref>Higham, p. 473 and Bloch, ''The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor'', p. 299</ref>

Upon the Duke's death from cancer in 1972, the Duchess travelled to England to attend his funeral,<ref>Conducted by [[William Launcelot Scott Fleming]], [[Dean of Windsor]] (former [[Bishop of Portsmouth (Anglican)|Bishop of Portsmouth]]; and [[Bishop of Norwich|Norwich]]) ''[[The Times]]'', Monday, 5 June 1972; p. 2; Issue 58496; col. E</ref> staying at [[Buckingham Palace]] during her visit.<ref>Higham, pp. 477<U+2013>479</ref> The Duchess, increasingly senile and frail, lived the remainder of her life as a recluse, supported by both her husband's estate and an allowance from the Queen.<ref>Ziegler, p. 555</ref> In October 1976, she was due to receive [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|the Queen Mother]], but as the Duchess was too ill with dementia to receive her, her staff cancelled the visit at the last minute. The Queen Mother sent flowers with a card reading, "In Friendship, Elizabeth."<ref>Higham, pp. 487<U+2013>488</ref> After her husband's death, the Duchess gave her legal authority to her French lawyer, Suzanne Blum.<ref>Higham, p. 490 and Menkes, p. 199</ref> This potentially exploitative relationship was explored in [[Caroline Blackwood]]'s book ''The Last of the Duchess'', written in 1980, but not published until after Blum's death in 1995.<ref>{{citation|title=The Last of the Duchess|last=Blackwood|first=Lady Caroline|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=0679439706|year=1995}}</ref> In 1980, the Duchess lost the power of speech.<ref>Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 222</ref> Toward the end, she was bed-ridden and did not receive any visitors, apart from her doctor and nurses.

The Duchess of Windsor died on 24 April 1986 at her home in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], Paris.<ref name="weir"/> Her funeral was held at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St. George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]], attended by her two surviving sisters-in-law: the Queen Mother and [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]]. The Queen, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] attended both the funeral ceremony and the burial. She was buried next to Edward in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] near Windsor Castle, as "Wallis, Duchess of Windsor".<ref name="bbc">{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Simple funeral rites for Duchess|date=29 April 1998|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Until a 1965 agreement with Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke and Duchess had previously planned for a burial in a purchased cemetery plot at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the father of the Duchess was interred.<ref>{{citation|title=Windsors had a plot at Green Mount|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|location=Baltimore|date=29 April 1986}}</ref>

Most of her estate went to the [[Pasteur Institute]] medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the Royal Family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown no interest in charity during her life.<ref>Menkes, p. 200</ref> In an auction at [[Sotheby's]] in April 1987 the Duchess's remarkable jewelry collection raised $45 million for the Institute, approximately seven times its pre-sale estimate.<ref>{{citation|title=The Jewels of The Duchess of Windsor|last=Culme|first=John|coauthors=Rayner, Nicholas|publisher=Vendome Press|location=New York|year=1987|page=7}}</ref> In recognition of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of [[Louis XVI]] furniture, some porcelain and paintings were made over to the French state.<ref>Menkes, pp. 198, 206 and 207</ref> The British Royal Family received no major bequests. [[Mohammed Al-Fayed]], owner of [[Harrods]] department store, bought much of the non-financial estate, including the lease of the Paris mansion. The bulk of his collection was sold in 1998, the year after [[Dodi Al-Fayed|his son]]'s death in [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the car accident]] that also claimed the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. The sale raised more than <U+00A3>14 million for charity.<ref name="bbc" />

==Legacy==
Wallis was plagued by rumours of other lovers. The otherwise homosexual American playboy [[Jimmy Donahue]], an heir to the [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] fortune, claimed to have had a liaison with the Duchess in the 1950s, but Donahue was notorious for his inventive pranks and rumour-mongering.<ref>{{citation|first=Christopher |last=Wilson|title=Dancing With the Devil: the Windsors and Jimmy Donahue|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-00-653159-8}}</ref> The existence of a so-called "China dossier" (detailing the supposed sexual and criminal exploits of Wallis in [[China]]) is denied by virtually all historians and biographers.<ref>Higham, p. 119 and Ziegler, p. 224</ref> Although there have been rumours of pregnancy and abortion, most notably involving [[Count Ciano]] in China, there is no hard evidence that the Duchess became pregnant by any of her lovers or her three husbands. Claims that she suffered from [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], also known as testicular feminisation,<ref name="fox" /><ref>Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 10, 13, and 230</ref> seem improbable, if not impossible, given her operation for [[uterine fibroids]] in 1951.<ref>Ziegler, p. 533 and Higham, p. 496</ref>

The Duchess published her ghost-written memoirs, ''The Heart Has Its Reasons'', in 1956. Author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] says of the book, "facts were remorselessly rearranged in what amounted to a self-performed face-lift&nbsp;... reflecting in abundance its author's politically misguided but winning and desirable personality." He describes the Duchess as "charismatic, electric and compulsively ambitious".<ref>Higham, pp. 452<U+2013>453</ref> Hearsay, conjecture and politically motivated propaganda have clouded assessment of the Duchess of Windsor's life, unhelped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was anything other than a victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position to spend the rest of his life with her."<ref>Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 231</ref> Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that <blockquote>left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [Edward] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her "insatiable ambitions"&nbsp;... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, "You and I can only create disaster together"&nbsp;... she predicted to society hostess [[Sybil Colefax]], "two people will suffer" because of "the workings of a system"&nbsp;... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other&nbsp;... She had thought of him as emotionally a [[Peter Pan]], and of herself an [[Alice in Wonderland]]. The book they had written together, however, was a [[Paradise Lost]].<ref>{{citation|last=Weintraub|first=Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Weintraub|journal=[[Washington Post]]|date=8 June 1986|page=X05}}</ref></blockquote> The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance."<ref>Wilson, p. 179</ref>

===In popular culture===
Wallis was portrayed by [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''The Woman I Love'' (1972, made-for-TV movie), by [[Cynthia Harris]] in ''[[Edward & Mrs. Simpson]]'' (1978, seven-part miniseries), by [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] in ''The Woman He Loved'' (1988, made-for-TV movie), and by [[Joely Richardson]] in ''[[Wallis & Edward]]'' (2005, made-for-TV movie). ''[[Bertie and Elizabeth]]'' (2002, made-for-TV movie) tells the story from the point of view of Edward's brother Bertie, who became George VI after the abdication.<ref>{{citation|title=Bertie and Elizabeth|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310733/fullcredits#cast/|publisher=Internet Movie Database, Inc|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Jane Hartley portrayed Wallis Simpson in the 1997 [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''Always''.<ref>{{citation|title=Always, the Musical|http://www.musical-theatre.net/html/recordcabinet/biographical/always.html|publisher=Record Cabinet|accessdate=3 June 2009}}</ref> [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is reportedly planning a movie-musical about Wallis.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4636960/Madonna-bid-to-star-in-film-as-Wallis-Simpson.html|title=Madonna bid to star in movie as Wallis Simpson|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|author=Cockcroft, Lucy|date=16 February 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>

In his 1981 novel ''[[Famous Last Words (novel)|Famous Last Words]]'', award-winning [[Canadian]] author [[Timothy Findley]] concocts his plot around several World War II-era prominent characters; "Mrs Simpson" is depicted as manipulative yet also tragic. Author [[Anne Edwards]] wrote a sympathetic account of Wallis's early life culminating with her marriage to Edward in her 1991 book ''Wallis: The Novel''. Wallis also features in a short story by [[Rose Tremain]] called "The Darkness of Wallis Simpson", a play called ''The Duchess'' by [[Linda Griffiths]], and in the fifth and final Young Bond book by [[Charlie Higson]], ''[[By Royal Command]]''.
