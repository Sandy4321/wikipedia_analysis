'''State Route 16''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[Northern California|northern]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] that runs from [[California State Route 20|Route 20]] in [[Colusa County, California|Colusa County]] to [[California State Route 49|Route 49]] just outside [[Plymouth, California|Plymouth]] in [[Amador County, California|Amador County]]. It is discontinuous near [[Sacramento, California]], being an unsigned route that runs concurrently with both [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]].<ref name="tg" />

This route is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]<ref name="cafes">[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257 CA Codes (shc:250-257)]</ref> and is eligible for the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]]<ref name="scenic"> [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=260-284 CA Codes (shc:260-284)]</ref>.

==Route description==
===Western section===
State Route 16 begins in [[Colusa County, California|Colusa County]] near [[Wilbur Springs, California|Wilbur Springs]] at the junction with [[State Route 20 (California)|State Route 20]]. A few miles south of this terminus, SR 16 enters [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] and passes [[Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park]]. SR 16 parallels the [[Cache River]] on its routing from the county line to the end of the western segment. SR 16 then goes through [[Rumsey, California|Rumsey]], [[Guinda, California|Guinda]], [[Brooks, California|Brooks]], [[Capay, California|Capay]], [[Esparto, California|Esparto]], and [[Madison, California|Madison]], intersecting with [[County Route E4 (California)|County Route E4]] and passing by the [[Blue Cliffs]] and [[Bald Mountain]] in the process. East of Madison, SR 16 interchanges with [[Interstate 505 (California)|Interstate 505]] before heading east toward [[Woodland, California|Woodland]]. In Woodland, at the junction with [[County Route E7 (California)|County Route E7]] southbound, SR 16 turns north and merges with [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] southbound. Although SR 16 continues on Interstate 5 south to U.S. Route 50, this [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] is not signed or designated on most maps.<ref name="tg">{{Cite map | publisher=Thomas Brothers | title=California Road Atlas and Driver's Guide | year=2000 | page=32,33,39,40}}</ref><ref name="rmcn">{{Cite map | publisher = Rand McNally | title = The Road Atlas | year = 2008 | page = 12,13 }}</ref>

===Eastern section===
The eastern segment of SR 16 begins at [[U.S. Route 50 (California)|U.S. Route 50]] east of Sacramento. SR 16 heads east through [[Perkins, California|Perkins]] as Jackson Road. After it passes near [[Bridge House, California|Bridge House]] and [[Rancho Murietta, California|Rancho Murietta]], where it crosses the [[Cosumnes River]], SR 16 enters [[Amador County, California|Amador County]]. SR 16 then ascends into the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills, leaving the [[Central Valley]]. In Amador County, SR 16 passes near [[Forest Home, California|Forest Home]] before intersecting with [[State Route 124 (California)|State Route 124]] and terminating at [[State Route 49 (California)|State Route 49]].<ref name="tg" /><ref name="rmcn" />

==History==
The two ends of SR 16 were added to the state highway system by the third bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1919: '''Route 50''' from [[Lower Lake, CA|Lower Lake]] east to [[Rumsey, CA|Rumsey]] and '''Route 54''' from the [[Sacramento County, CA|Sacramento]]-[[Amador County, CA|Amador]] County line east to [[Drytown, CA|Drytown]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1919|res=yes|ch=46|p=1520}}: "Rumsey to Lower Lake"; "county line near Michigan Bar via Huot's ranch to Drytown"</ref> Each was connected to [[Sacramento, CA|Sacramento]] by existing or planned paved [[county highway]]s.<ref name=blow>Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 ([http://www.archive.org/details/californiahighwa00blowrich Archive.org] or [http://books.google.com/books?id=osgNAAAAYAAJ Google Books]), pp. 115-116, 206-207, 284-285</ref> Although the exact alignment of Route 50 was not specified, the state [[Department of Engineering (California)|Department of Engineering]] had already surveyed a 35-mile (56 km) route through [[Cache Creek Canyon]] pursuant to a 1915 law, which defined the '''Yolo and Lake Highway''' "following generally, the meanderings of Cache creek" but did not make it a state highway.<ref>[[Department of Engineering (California)|Department of Engineering]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Kc83AAAAIAAJ Fifth Biennial Report of the Department of Engineering of the State of California, [[December 1]], [[1914]], to [[November 30]], [[1916]]], 1917, pp. 185-186</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1915|ch=283|p=478}}</ref> By 1924, the [[California Highway Commission]]'s engineers had realized that building Route 50 through the canyon was impractical, and adopted a substitute plan for two highways connecting Lower Lake and Rumsey with the planned [[Legislative Route 15 (California pre-1964)|Route 15]] ([[Tahoe-Ukiah Highway]], now [[SR 20 (CA)|SR 20]]) to the north<ref name=1925report>California Highway Advisory Committee and Arthur Hastings Breed, Report of a Study of the State Highway System of California, California State Printing Office, 1925, p. 91</ref> in September 1925.<ref>[[Oakland Tribune]], Highway Commission Lays Plans for Building Lake Connection, [[September 6]], [[1925]]</ref><ref>[[Fresno Bee]], Route Follows Lake Shore, [[September 27]], [[1925]]</ref> The western connection, to Lower Lake, became part of [[Legislative Route 49 (California pre-1964)|Route 49]] (now [[SR 53 (CA)|SR 53]] there), which continued south from Lower Lake to [[Calistoga, CA|Calistoga]].

Each route was extended to Sacramento in 1933 over the aforementioned county highways, taking Route 50 southeast from Rumsey to [[Woodland, CA|Woodland]] near Cache Creek and then alongside the [[Sacramento River]] to the [[I Street Bridge]], and Route 54 west from the county line to [[Legislative Route 11 (California pre-1964)|Route 11]] just outside Sacramento.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2035}}: "State Highway Route 50 near Rumsey to State Highway Route 7 near Woodland." "Woodland to Sacramento." "State Highway Route 11 near Perkins to State Highway Route 54 near Michigan Bar."</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=278-279}}: "Route 50 is from Route 15 to Sacramento via Rumsey and Woodland." "Route 54 is from Route 11 near Perkins to Drytown, passing near Michigan Bar and via Huot's Ranch."</ref> The entirety of both routes, from SR 20 near [[Wilbur Springs, California|Wilbur Springs]] through Sacramento to [[SR 49 (CA)|SR 49]] just north of [[Drytown, CA|Drytown]] (and initially [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ping SR 49 to [[Jackson, CA|Jackson]]), was included in the initial state sign route system in 1934 as '''Sign Route 16'''.<ref>[[California Highways and Public Works]], [http://www.gbcnet.com/roads/ca_routes_1934.html State Routes will be Numbered and Marked with Distinctive Bear Signs], August 1934</ref> Through downtown Sacramento, SR 16 followed [[US 40 (CA)|US 40]] ([[Legislative Route 6 (California pre-1964)|Legislative Route 6]]) and [[US 50 (CA)|US 50]] ([[Legislative Route 11 (California pre-1964)|Legislative Route 11]]), mostly on Capitol Avenue, while Legislative Route 50 continued south on 5th Street (later a [[one-way pair]] of 3rd and 5th Streets) and turnead east on Broadway, carrying [[SR 24 (CA)|Sign Route 24]] most of the way to Freeport Boulevard.<ref>[[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]], [http://www.americanroads.us/citymaps/1944CaStateMapSacramento.png Sacramento], 1944</ref><ref>[[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]], [http://cahighways.org/maps/1963sac.jpg Sacramento], 1963</ref> In the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], Route 16 became the new legislative designation,<ref name=law-renumbering>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1173}}: "Route 16 is from: (a) Route 20 to Route 5 near Woodland via Rumsey and Woodland. (b) Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento. (c) Route 50 near Perkins to Route 49 near Drytown."</ref> and SR 24 through Sacramento was replaced with [[SR 99 (CA)|SR 99]] and [[SR 160 (CA)|SR 160]]. As neither of these used what had been SR 24 along 3rd and 5th Streets and Broadway, part of Route 16's new definition ("Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento") was used for several years on this alignment until it became part of SR 99 later that decade. This left the western segment of SR 16 ending at [[I-5 (CA)|I-5]] near the east end of the I Street Bridge<ref>[[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]], Annual Traffic Census: 1964, 1966, 1968</ref> until 1984, when the Woodland-Sacramento portion, which had become redundant with the parallel I-5 complete, was deleted from the legislative definition.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1984|ch=409|p=1770}}</ref> It was at about this time that SR 16 was rerouted from the intersection with [[County Route E7 (California)|County Route E7]] to continue north on a bypass of Woodland instead of east to Interstate 5.<ref name="cah 16"/><!--this could use a better source, but I can't find one-->
