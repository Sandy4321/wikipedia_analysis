During the early evening of May&nbsp;31, 2013, the widest [[tornado]] in recorded history occurred over rural areas of central  [[Oklahoma]]. Part of a [[May 26<U+2013>31, 2013 tornado outbreak|larger weather system]] that produced dozens of tornadoes over the preceding days, the tornado initially touched down at 6:03&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2303&nbsp;UTC) about {{convert|8.3|mi|km|}} west-southwest of [[El Reno, Oklahoma]]. The storm rapidly grew and became more violent. Remaining over mostly open terrain, the tornado did not impact many structures; however, measurements from mobile Doppler radars revealed extreme winds in excess of {{convert|296|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} within the tornado. As it crossed [[U.S. Route 81 in Oklahoma|Highway 81]], it had grown to a record-breaking width of {{convert|2.6|mi|km|}}. Turning northeastward, the tornado soon weakened. After crossing [[Interstate 40]], the tornado dissipated around 6:43&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2343&nbsp;UTC), after tracking for {{convert|16.2|mi|km|}}.

Although the tornado remained over mostly open terrain, dozens of storm chasers unaware of its immense size were caught off-guard. Along Highway 81, well-known storm chaser and researcher [[Tim Samaras]], along with his son Paul and research partner Carl Young, were killed when their vehicle was thrown by the tornado or a sub-vortex associated with it. An amateur chaser was also killed in the area. Other chasers, including Mike Bettes of [[The Weather Channel]] and [[Reed Timmer]], were either injured or had their vehicles damaged. Overall, the tornado was responsible for 8&nbsp;fatalities and 151&nbsp;injuries.<ref name="DowngradeandInjuries">{{cite web|author=Mark Johnson|publisher=NewsNet5|date=September 1, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013|title=Historic El Reno, OK tornado is downgraded by National Weather Service|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/large-el-reno-ok-tornado-has-its-intensity-downgraded-by-national-weather-service}}</ref>

Alongside rush hour traffic, thousands of residents in [[Oklahoma City]] attempted to outrun the storm by taking to the roads. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500&nbsp;lives could have been lost.<ref name="wunderblog"/>

A moderately strong [[jet stream|polar jet]] moved east-northeastward over the southern [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the southern [[Great Plains]].

The most intense severe weather activity was expected across the southern Great Plains, specifically central and eastern Oklahoma, during the afternoon hours. As such, the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms during the early morning hours of May 31 from southeastern [[Missouri]] to southwestern Oklahoma. The degree of wind shear, moisture and instability within the warm sector favored the development of discreete [[supercell]]s. Very large hail and tornadoes were expected with the supercells, with the possibility of a few strong to violent tornadoes.<ref name="Outlook"/> A [[particularly dangerous situation]] [[tornado watch]] was issued at 3:30 p.m. [[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] early that afternoon from southwestern through northeastern Oklahoma, surrounding the [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|Interstate 44]] corridor.<ref name="CentralOKTornadoWatch">{{cite web|publisher=National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2013|title=Special Weather Statement: Tornado Watch|url=http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2013-O-NEW-KOUN-TO-A-0262/USCOMP-N0Q-201305312025}}</ref><ref name="EasternOKTornadoWatch">{{cite web|publisher=National Weather Service Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2013|title=Special Weather Statement: Tornado Watch|url=http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2013-O-NEW-KTSA-TO-A-0262/USCOMP-N0Q-201305312025}}</ref> Thunderstorm activity across Oklahoma during the mid-afternoon hours was largely limited to far northern parts of the state due in part to a [[capping inversion]] that did not erode farther south until later in the day, aided by a [[shortwave trough]] that pushed into the region from the [[Texas Panhandle]] and a stronger trough located over [[Colorado]]. A quasi-linear complex of severe thunderstorms began developing near the [[Highway 81]] corridor west of Oklahoma City between 4:00 and 4:45 p.m. CDT.

===Intensity===
[[File:May 31, 2013 EF5 El Reno, OK Tornado showing multiple sub vortices.ogv|thumb|right|Video of several sub-vortices within the tornado]]
The intensity of the tornado has been a subject of internal debate in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency utilizes the Enhanced Fujita Scale to rate as assess tornado intensity based on damage left behind. This excludes the use of supplementary measurements, such as those from mobile radar, in concluding a tornado's intensity. Initially receiving an official EF3 rating based on damage, the El Reno tornado was subsequently upgraded to a radar-estimated EF5 rating, the highest on the scale, based on data from a mobile radar. The University of Oklahoma's RaXPol Doppler radar, positioned at a nearby overpass, measured winds in excess of {{convert|296|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. These winds are considered the second-highest ever measured worldwide, just shy of the {{convert|301|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded during the [[1999 Bridge Creek<U+2013>Moore tornado]].<ref name="JeffMJune4">{{cite web|author=Jeff Masters|publisher=Weather Underground|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|title=Largest Tornado on Record: the May 31 El Reno, OK EF-5 Tornado|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2426}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research|year=2010|accessdate=June 4, 2013|title=Doppler On Wheels|url=http://cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm}}</ref> These occurred in small sub-vortices along the south side of the main vortex.

Rick Smith, the warning coordinating meteorologist at the [[National Weather Service]] Office in Norman, Oklahoma stated that this tornado was among a "super-rare" category within the EF5 ranking, a type of tornado rarely seen. Smith also stated that it was fortunate the tornado did not track into more densely populated areas, "this would have been ...

On August&nbsp;30, the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma once again revised the intensity of the El Reno tornado, downgrading it from an EF5 to an EF3. Keli Pirtle, a Public Affairs worker at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, stated that, "despite the radar-measured wind speeds, the survey team did not find damage that would support a rating higher than EF3. While the wind measurements from the mobile radars are considered reliable, NWS policy for determining EF ratings is based on surveys of ground damage."<ref>{{cite web|author=Nate Johnson|title=NWS releases statement about El Reno tornado rating|url=http://digitalmeteorologist.wordpress.com/2013/08/31/elrenotornado/|publisher=Digital Meteorologist|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The lack of EF5 damage was likely a result of the rural nature of the area, as the sub-vortices that contained the EF5 wind speeds did not impact any structures.<ref>http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=453682</ref>

As the tornadoes approached the [[Oklahoma City]] metro, thousands of residents decided to leave the area for safety, possibly due to the still fresh memories of the devastation caused by the [[2013 Moore tornado|May&nbsp;20 Moore tornado]].<ref name="FoxNewsJune2">{{cite web|work=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=June 2, 2013|title=Body of 4-year-old boy found in river after Oklahoma tornado outbreak|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/02/4-year-old-boy-found-in-river-after-oklahoma-storm/}}</ref> Already congested with rush hour traffic, [[Interstate 35|Interstates 35]], [[Interstate 40|40]], [[Interstate 44|44]] and [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|240]], became "parking lots" as the storms neared.<ref name="FoxNewsJune2"/><ref name="NBC1">{{cite web|title=As tornadoes neared, drivers hit the road <U+2013> with deadly results|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/31/18666671-as-tornadoes-neared-drivers-hit-the-road-with-deadly-results?lite|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=June 1, 2013|date=May 31, 2013}}</ref> Residents reported the highways to be a scene of chaos, "people were going southbound in the northbound lanes.
