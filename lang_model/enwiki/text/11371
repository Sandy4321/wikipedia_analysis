She is best known for her starring roles in the sitcom ''[[Moesha]]'' and the 1997 version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (TV)|Cinderella]]'', and for her hit songs such as "[[Sittin' up in My Room]]" and "[[The Boy Is Mine]]".

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Brandy is the elder of two siblings born to Willie Ray Norwood, a [[pastor]] and choir director, and his wife Sonja Bates-Norwood, a former financial analyst, in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]], [[Mississippi]].<ref>Kevin R.

''[[Yahoo]] Movies''. Retrieved [[November 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

Due to her father's work Brandy started singing at their minister, Curtis W. McCullom's  [[Brookhaven, Mississippi|Brookhaven]] church at an early age of two. By the time she was four, Norwood's parents moved the family from McComb to [[Carson, California]], in hopes of jump-starting careers for their children.<ref>Tara Roberts.

May 1997.</ref> Inspired by singer [[Whitney Houston]], Brandy began performing at many West Coast functions as part of a youth singing group and then, at 11, barely a teenager herself, met manager Chris Stokes who landed her gigs as backup singer for the group called Norment and more successful teen R&B trio [[Immature]].<ref>Corey Moss. [http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019049/bio Snoop Reunites With Dre]. ''VH1.com''. [[September 26]], [[2006]].</ref>

In [[1993]], while shopping around record companies, seeking a record deal, Norwood attended a party held by the [[Atlantic Recording Corporation]]. After performing in front of hundreds of people, an executive indicated interest in her persona and eventually offered Brandy a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>[http://brandyfan.com/brandy.php?biography Brandy: Biography]. ''Brandyway.com''. [[November 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

===1994<U+2013>1997: Early commercial success===
[[Image:I Wanna Be Down (screenshot).jpg|thumb|left|195px|Brandy with [[MC Lyte]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] in the remix video to "[[I Wanna Be Down]]" ([[1994]]).]]
After months of recording, including sessions with producers Daryl Williams, and Keith Crouch, Brandy's [[Brandy (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on [[September 27]], [[1994]]. While the album debuted at a moderate number 20 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart only, ''Brandy'' soon became a [[double platinum|quadruple platinum]] success thanks to [[MTV]], [[BET]] and its singles: "[[I Wanna Be Down]]" and "[[Baby (Brandy song)|Baby]]" both entered the top 10 of the official Hot 100 and became number-one hits on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Although the album's success was limited elsewhere, the album produced another two top 10 hits with top "Best Friend" and the remix of "Brokenhearted" and made Brandy a successful recording artist in the [[United States]].

Subsequently the album earned Norwood two [[Grammy Award]] nominations for "[[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]" and "[[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]" (for her single "Baby"), four [[Soul Train Music Awards]], two [[Billboard Awards]], and the New York Children's Choice Award. Brandy continued to soar in [[1995]], teaming up with [[Lenny Kravitz]] for the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' soundtrack and scoring another hit with her number-two single, "[[Sittin' up in My Room]]" from the ''[[Waiting To Exhale]]'' soundtrack.

In 1996, Brandy teamed up with [[Tamia]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Gladys Knight]], for the single "Missing You," released from the ''[[Set It Off]]'' soundtrack.  Even with the superstar lineup, it was Brandy's least successful single yet, but was still a moderate hit, and peaked in the top 30 at #25 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] [[Hot 100]] [[Pop music|pop]] chart.  The song won Norwood her third Grammy nomination in the "[[Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]" category.

=== 1998<U+2013>2001: Worldwide popularity ===
[[Image:The Boy Is Mine (screenshot).jpg|thumb|right|195px|Brandy and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]] in the video for "[[The Boy Is Mine]]" ([[1998]]), one of both acts' biggest singles.]] 
[[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]] consulted on the album ''[[Never Say Never (album)|Never Say Never]]'', which was released on [[June 9]], [[1998]] and became Brandy's most successful album worldwide. Norwood co-wrote and produced six songs on the album which yielded her first number-one song on the U.S. ''Billboard Hot 100'', "[[The Boy Is Mine]]", a duet with singer [[Monica (singer)|Monica]]. The song rose to one of the most successful records of the year, staying on top of the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] [[Hot 100]] for thirteen weeks, and eventually garnered the pair a Grammy Award for "[[Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]". Critics rated ''Never Say Never'' highly, with [[All Music Guide]]'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine praising Brandy and her team for wisely finding "a middle ground between [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Mary J. Blige]] <U+2014> it's adult contemporary with a slight streetwise edge".<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0eozefykogf3 ''Never Say Never'' review]. ''[[All Music Guide]]''. Retrieved [[November 10]], [[2006]].</ref> Altogether the album spawned seven airplay or [[CD single]]s, including Norwood's second number-one song, [[Diane Warren]] written "[[Have You Ever]]". <ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=119457&model.vnuAlbumId=634096 Artist Chart History - Brandy]. ''Billboard.com''. Retrieved [[November 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

For the next three years, Brandy completed the remaining three seasons of her sitcom ''[[Moesha]]'' and starred in a number of widely successful and critically acclaimed television specials and movies.  She also landed a multitude of endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics, which she represented for several years. Brandy was the subject of a major advertisement campaign for DKNY Jeans for three seasons, and modeled Candies shoes in an eye-catching ad campaign photographed by [[David LaChapelle]].

After a lengthy hiatus that saw the end of her ''Moesha'' television series, and a flurry of tabloid headlines discussing her bout with "dehydration", in [[2001]] Brandy returned with a remake of [[Phil Collins]]' [[1980s]] hit "[[Another Day in Paradise]]", a collaboration with brother [[Ray J]]. Released as the lead single from ''Urban Renewal: A Tribute to Phil Collins'', the song became an instant international hit.

=== 2002<U+2013>2003: New image ===
[[Image:Brandy wau1.jpg|left|thumb|195px|"[[What About Us?]]" (2002) presented a more mature facet of Brandy's personality and her much-worked-on voice.]]
During the production of her third studio album, Norwood became romantically involved with producer Robert "Big Bert" Smith. The couple quietly "married" in the summer of [[2001]] but their union did not become known until February 2002 <U+2013> the same month Norwood revealed that she was expecting her first child. However, shortly after the birth of their daughter Sy'rai Iman Smith on [[June 16]], [[2002]] <U+2013> an event tracked by the four-part [[MTV]] [[reality series]] ''Special Delivery'' <U+2013> Norwood "divorced" Smith. The "marriage" itself was later exposed as not of legal status but instead was used as a ruse to protect Brandy's image. <ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12026717 Brandy And Her Husband On The Outs?]. ''Yahoo! Music''. [[June 27]], [[2006]]. Retrieved [[November 11]], [[2006]].</ref> Norwood later stated that she regarded her relationship with Smith as a "spiritual union and true commitment to each other".<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12175879 Brandy's Ex Claims Couple Never Married]. ''Yahoo! Music''. [[July 22]], [[2004]]. Retrieved [[November 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

''[[Full Moon (album)|Full Moon]]'', Norwood's third studio album, was released in [[March 2002]]. It once again comprised a row of R&B/Pop-oriented songs with adult contemporary, many of them co-created with Darkchild, Warryn Campbell and [[Mike City]]. While its lead single "[[What About Us?]]" became a worldwide top 10 hit, the album's title track failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the U.S. and the UK, where it managed to enter the Top 20 of the single chart. Media reception was generally lukewarm, with ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' saying that, "... this interminable (seventeen-track) product is frantic, faceless, fake-sexy R&B."<ref>Arion Berger. [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brandy/albums/album/138185/review/6067490/full_moon ''Full Moon'' Review]. ''Rollig Stone''. [[April 25]], [[2002]]</ref>

Still, the album was rather quietly and cautiously declared as a flop by the media. Brandy ignored the rumblings and instead settled further into motherhood. She began writing and producing for other artists, such as [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Toni Braxton]], within the coming year.

=== 2004<U+2013>2005: Critical highs and personal lows ===
[[Image:Screenshot talkaboutourlove2.jpg.jpg|right|thumb|195px|"[[Talk About Our Love]]" (2004), produced by rapper [[Kanye West]], failed to link ''Afrodisiac'' with previous successes.]]
By the following year, Norwood had entered a relationship with [[New York Knicks]] guard [[Quentin Richardson]]. The couple soon got engaged in [[2004]] but Brandy eventually ended her 15-month engagement with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player in [[October 2005]].<ref>[http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/brandy-breaks-off-engagement-quentin-richardson-morphs-tattoo-1005596.php Brandy breaks off engagement]. ''UPI News Service''. [[October 28]], [[2005]].</ref>

Returning from yet another musical hiatus, Brandy's fourth album ''[[Afrodisiac]]'' was released on [[June 29]] [[2004]], amidst both her weakest promotional blitz ever and the well-publicized termination of her short-lived business relationship with entertainment manager [[Benny Medina]]. Norwood ended her relationship with Medina's [[Los Angeles]]-based Handprint Entertainment after less than a year of representation. Controversy surrounded Medina's handling of the lead single "[[Talk About Our Love]]", and failed talks of a purported co-headlining tour with R&B singer [[Usher Raymond]] that was instead handed to [[Kanye West]], another Medina client, as an opening gig.

Despite the negative blitz, ''Afrodisiac'' (primarily produced by [[Timbaland]]) became Brandy's most critically acclaimed album to date,<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/brandy/afrodisiac Afrodisiac by Brandy]. ''Metacritic''. Retrieved on [[August 8]], [[2004]].</ref> with some citing the "more consistently mature and challenging" effect of Timbaland on Brandy's music,<ref>Terry Sawyer. [http://popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/brandy-afrodisiac.shtml Brandy - Afrodisiac (Atlantic)]. ''Popmatters''. Retrieved on [[June 28]], [[2004]].</ref> and others calling it "very listenable and emotionally resonant", comparing it to "[[Janet Jackson]] at her best".<ref>Andy Kellman. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A4q27gjer46ib Afrodisiac Review]. ''All Music Guide''. Retrieved on [[June 29]], [[2004]].</ref> Nevertheless it became the least successful album of Brandy's career: While ''Afrodisiac'' debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200]], selling less than 500,000 copies domestically, it failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the United States.<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/18021422 Brandy To Release Greatest Hits Album]. ''Yahoo.com''. Retrieved [[March 30]], [[2005]].</ref> 

The singles also did not perform well: "Talk About Our Love" became a moderate hit with a peak position of number 36 on the Billboard Top 100 charts, while the follow-up "[[Who Is She 2 U]]" was a minor hit, never making it out of the lower half of the ''Billboard Hot 100''. The title track "[[Afrodisiac (song)|Afrodisiac]]", released overseas as a single, was a Top 20 hit in the [[United Kingdom]]. At the end of 2004, Norwood asked for and received a release from Atlantic Records. As a direct consequence she brought a collection of all of her singles, ''[[The Best of Brandy]]'', on the market, before starting shopping for a new record deal under Knockout Entertainment.<ref>Tasheka Josephs.

=== Scientology === 
In 2004, Brandy was reported to be dabbling in [[Scientology]]. According to [[MSNBC]] she has been taking Scientology courses but has not "joined" the Church.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5698237/ MSNBC Home <U+00BB> Entertainment <U+00BB> Gossip: The Scoop accessed 2007-02-22</ref> She is quoted as telling Africana.com:<blockquote>It basically consists of questions that probe really deeply into your life.</blockquote><blockquote>You are confronting all of your experiences, and I knew, <U+2018>If I could confront every experience in my life and be cool with it, then nothing could stop me.<U+2019> They ask the questions, and you provide the answers. I am not a Scientologist, but I do love what I have experienced.</blockquote>

==Acting career==
Brandy starred from [[1996]] until [[2001]] in the popular television [[sitcom]] ''[[Moesha]]'', in which she played the lead character, a teenager. (This was not her first TV role; she had previously appeared in the short-lived [[1993 in television|1993]]-[[1994 in television|1994]] sitcom ''Thea'', starring [[Thea Vidale]]). 

In [[1997 in television|1997]], she played the title character in [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]<U+2019>s television version of ''[[Cinderella (TV)|Cinderella]]'' featuring a multi-cultural cast that also included [[Whitney Houston]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Bernadette Peters]]. The TV-movie garnered over 66 million viewers and won an [[Emmy]] award. 

Other roles include a [[television]] movie she co-produced and starred in with [[Diana Ross]] entitled ''[[Double Platinum]]''; and a role in the franchise-flick ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' where she portrayed the sassy Karla, best friend to [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]'s lead character. Brandy was said to be the considered lead in a [[Diana Ross]] biopic planned by the legendary singer. There has been no word on this project since 2001, however.

Brandy has also guest-starred in several television shows such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' and ''[[American Dreams]]''. She recently did four guest star appearances in the UPN sitcom ''[[One on One]]'' alongside her brother Ray J. Most recently in a TV Guide interview Brandy stated that her upcoming new sitcom was slated to start production in March 2006.
