The '''Royal Wardrobe''' (also known as the Great Wardrobe) was a building located on what is now Queen Victoria Street in the City of London, near Blackfriars. It was used as a storehouse for royal accoutrements, housing arms and clothing among other personal items of the Crown.

===History===
The Wardrobe was used to house orphans during the [[Commonwealth of England]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] records that a party of children sang to [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich]] when he was appointed as Master of the Royal Wardrobe during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] but he was unmoved, the orphans were evicted, and the Wardrobe resumed its usual function.

The Royal Wardrobe was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in [[1666]] and was not rebuilt.

===Trivia===
* The building's legacy survives in the curious name of the church of [[St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe]], also destroyed in the fire, but built anew by [[Sir Christopher Wren]].
