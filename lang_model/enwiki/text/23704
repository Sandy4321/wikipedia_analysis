==Economics==
In economics, a '''price book''' is a book in which the normal [[price]]s of an item are listed for all suppliers. This allows one to determine the lowest price possible.

If a group of suppliers adhere to a particular price book, in other words, they set the prices of the price book artificially higher than the [[market clearing]] price, then they are "fixing the price" of that item. This is illegal in most countries and is often found in [[oligopolies]] (industries with a few competitors (2-8), but not enough to make it a perfect market).

==Construction industry==
In construction a price book is used to estimate the cost of work. Historically the Carpenters' Company of the City and County of Philadelphia used there price book to control prices.<ref>Eggener, Keith. ''American architectural history: a contemporary reader''.
