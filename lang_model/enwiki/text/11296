The '''United States Constitution''' is the supreme [[law]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. It was adopted in its original form on [[September 17]], [[1787]] by the [[United States Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and later [[ratification|ratified]] by state-selected delegates representing the people of the [[U.S. state|several state]]s.<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/con/constitu.htm],[http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Constitution.html]</ref> When delegates in nine of the then thirteen states ratified the document, it marked the creation of a union of [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states, and a federal [[government]] to administer that union. It took effect on [[March 4]], [[1789]], replacing the weaker, non-centralized union that existed under the [[Articles of Confederation]].
The Constitution of the United States is the oldest federal constitution currently in use.[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/index.html] The original transcribed copy of the document is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] 

==Background ==
[[Image:Syng inkstand.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The [[Syng inkstand]], with which the Constitution was signed]]
In September 1786, commissioners from five states met in the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] to discuss adjustments to the Articles of Confederation that would improve commerce. They invited state representatives to convene in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, the Confederation Congress endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on [[February 21]], [[1787]]. Twelve states, [[Rhode Island]] being the only exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in May 1787. The resolution calling the Convention specified its purpose was to propose amendments to the Articles, but the Convention decided to propose a rewritten Constitution. The [[Philadelphia Convention]] voted to keep deliberations secret and decided to draft a new fundamental government design which eventually stipulated that only 9 of the 13 states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect (for the participating states). Congress, noting dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation government, unanimously agreed to submit the proposal to the states despite what some perceived as the exceeded terms of reference. On [[September 17]], [[1787]], the Constitution was completed in Philadelphia, followed by a speech given by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In it he talked about how he wasn't completely satisfied with it but that perfection would never fully be achieved. He accepted the document as it was and he wanted all those against the ratification of it to do the same.{{cite-needed}} The new government it prescribed came into existence on [[March 4]], [[1789]], after fierce fights over [[ratification]] in many of the states.

== Preamble ==
{{Politics of the United States}}
{{main|Preamble to the United States Constitution}}

The Preamble states:
{{cquote|We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.}}

The Preamble neither grants any powers nor inhibits any actions; it only explains the rationale behind the Constitution. The preamble is a basic statement of purpose that precedes the constitution. The Preamble, especially the first three words ("We the people"), is one of the most quoted and referenced sections of the Constitution.

== Articles of the Constitution ==
The remainder of the constitution consists of seven original articles and twenty-seven amendments.

===Legislative power===
{{main|Article One of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article One''' establishes the [[legislature|legislative branch]] of government, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], which includes the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Article establishes the manner of election and qualifications of members of each House. In addition, it provides for free debate in congress and limits self-serving behavior of congressmen, outlines legislative procedure and indicates the powers of the legislative branch. There is a debate as to whether the powers listed in Article 1 Section 8 are a list of [[enumerated powers]]. These powers may also be interpreted as a list of powers formerly either executive or judicial in nature, that have been explicitly granted to the [[U.S. Congress]]. This interpretation may be further supported by a broad definition of both the [[commerce clause]], and the [[necessary and proper clause]] of the Constitution. The argument for enumerated powers can be traced back to 1819 [[McCulloch v. Maryland]] [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling. Finally, it establishes limits on federal and state legislative power.
</td></tr></table>

===Executive power===
{{main|Article Two of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article Two''' describes the [[United States President|presidency]] (the [[executive branch]]): procedures for the selection of the president, qualifications for office, the oath to be affirmed and the powers and duties of the office. It also provides for the office of [[Vice President of the United States]], and specifies that the Vice President succeeds to the presidency if the President is incapacitated, dies, or resigns, although whether this succession was on an acting or permanent basis was left unclear.  In practice, this has always been treated as succession, and the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] provides explicitly for succession.

Article Two also provides for the [[impeachment]] and removal from office of civil officers (the President, Vice President, judges, and others). (See [[presidential system]])

===Judicial power===
{{main|Article Three of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article Three''' describes the [[United States Federal judiciary|court system]] (the [[judicial branch]]), including the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The article requires that there be one court called the Supreme Court; Congress, at its discretion, can create lower courts, whose judgments and orders are reviewable by the Supreme Court. Article Three also requires [[trial by jury]] in all criminal cases, defines the crime of [[treason]], and charges Congress with providing for a punishment for it, while imposing limits on that punishment.

===States' powers and limits===
{{main|Article Four of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article Four''' describes the relationship between the states and the Federal government, and amongst the states. For instance, it requires states to give "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" to the public acts, records and court proceedings of the other states. Congress is permitted to [[regulate]] the manner in which proof of such acts, records or proceedings may be admitted. The [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|"privileges and immunities" clause]] prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens (e.g., having tougher penalties for residents of Ohio convicted of crimes within Michigan). It also establishes [[extradition]] between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, especially by citizens who live near state borders; but in the days of the [[Articles of Confederation]], crossing state lines was often a much more arduous (and costly) process. Article Four also provides for the creation and admission of new states. The [[Territorial Clause]] gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of Federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States. Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a [[Republic|republican form of government]], and to protect the states from invasion and violence.

===Process of amendment===
{{main|Article Five of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article Five''' describes the process necessary to amend the Constitution. It establishes two methods of proposing amendments: by Congress or by a [[Convention to propose amendment to U.S. Constitution|national convention]] requested by the states. Under the first method, Congress can propose an amendment by a two-thirds vote (of a [[quorum]], not necessarily of the entire body) of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Under the second method, two-thirds (2/3) of the [[state legislature]]s may convene and "apply" to Congress to hold a national convention, whereupon Congress must call such a convention for the purpose of considering amendments. As of mid-2006, only the first method (proposal by Congress) has been used.

Once proposed&mdash;whether submitted by a national convention or by Congress&mdash;amendments must then be ratified by three-fourths of the states to take effect. Article Five gives Congress the option of requiring ratification by state legislatures or by special [[Conventions within the states to ratify an amendment to U.S. Constitution|conventions]] assembled in the states. The convention method of ratification has been used only once (to approve the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]). Article Five currently places only one limitation on the amending power&mdash;that no amendment can deprive a state of its equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent.

===Federal power===
{{main|Article Six of the United States Constitution}}
'''Article Six''' establishes the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States made in accordance with it, to be the [[supremacy clause|supreme law]] of the land, and that "the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding." It also validates national [[debt]] created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all legislators, federal officers, and judges take [[oath]]s or affirmations to "support" the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution-- and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state.

Article Six also lays out that no person seeking to hold office shall be required to be a person of faith, stating that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States". At issue was that in some States the person entering office was required take an oath of office expressing belief in "one God, the creator of the universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked"; or to declare belief in the "divine inspiration" of the Scriptures, or "faith in God the Father and in Jesus Christ, His only Son", and so on. The effect was that those whose belief prevented them from taking such an oath were excluded from office. Consequently such a "religious test" was forbidden by this clause of the Constitution. The adoption of this clause by the Constitutional Congress was unanimous.

'''Article Seven''' sets forth the requirements for [[ratification]] of the Constitution. The Constitution would not take effect until at least nine states had ratified the Constitution in state conventions specially convened for that purpose. [[New Hampshire]] became that ninth state on [[June 21]], [[1788]]. Once the [[Congress of the Confederation]] received word of New Hampshire's ratification, it set a timetable for the start of operations under the Constitution, and, on [[March 4]], [[1789]], the government under the Constitution began operations.

== Provisions for amendment ==
The authors of the Constitution were clearly aware that changes would be necessary from time to time if the Constitution was to endure and cope with the effects of the anticipated growth of the nation. However, they were also conscious that such change should not be easy, lest it permit ill-conceived and hastily passed [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]]. Balancing this, they also wanted to ensure that an overly rigid requirement of unanimity would not block action desired by the vast majority of the population. Their solution was to devise a dual process by which the Constitution could be altered.

[[Constitutional amendment#Form of changes to the text|Unlike most constitutions]], amendments to the U.S. constitution are appended to the existing body of the text, rather than being revisions of or insertions into the main articles. There is no provision for expunging from the text obsolete or rescinded provisions.

Some people feel that [[demographics|demographic]] changes in the U.S.&mdash;specifically the great disparity in population between states&mdash;have made the Constitution too difficult to amend, with states representing as little as 4% of the population theoretically able to block an amendment desired by over 90% of Americans; others feel that it is unlikely that such an extreme result would occur. However, any proposals to change this would necessarily involve amending the Constitution itself, creating something of a [[Catch 22 (logic)|Catch-22]].

Aside from the direct process of amending the Constitution, the practical effect of its provisions may be altered by judicial decision. The United States is a [[common law]] country, and courts follow the [[precedent]]s established in prior cases. However, when a Supreme Court decision clarifies the application of a part of the Constitution to existing law, the effect is to establish the meaning of that part for all practical purposes. Not long after adoption of the Constitution, in the 1803 case of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]],'' the Supreme Court established the doctrine of [[judicial review]], which is the power of the Court to examine legislation and other acts of Congress and to decide their [[constitutionality]]. The doctrine also embraces the power of the Court to explain the meaning of various sections of the Constitution as they apply to particular cases brought before the Court. Since such cases will reflect changing legal, political, economic, and social conditions, this provides a mechanism, in practice, for adjusting the Constitution without needing to amend its text. Over the years, a series of Court decisions, on issues ranging from governmental regulation of [[radio]] and [[television]] to the rights of the accused in criminal cases, has effected a change in the way many Constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.

Congressional legislation, passed to implement provisions of the Constitution or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, also broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many agencies of the federal government have a similar effect. In case of objection, the test in both cases is whether, in the opinion of the courts, such legislation and rules conform with the meanings given to the words of the Constitution.
==Amendments==
{{main|List of amendments to the United States Constitution}}
The Constitution has a total of 27 amendments. The first ten, collectively known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], were ratified simultaneously. The following seventeen were ratified separately.

=== The Bill of Rights (1&ndash;10) ===
[[Image:Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg|300px|thumb|United States Bill of Rights currently housed in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]
{{Main|United States Bill of Rights}}
The Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Those amendments were adopted between 1789 and 1791, and all relate to limiting the power of the federal government. They were added in response to criticisms of the Constitution by the state ratification conventions and by prominent individuals such as [[Thomas Jefferson]] (who was not a delegate to the Constitutional Convention). These critics argued that without further restraints, the strong central government would become tyrannical. The amendments were proposed by Congress as part of a block of twelve in September 1789. By December 1791 a sufficient number of states had ratified ten of the twelve proposals, and the Bill of Rights became part of the Constitution.

It is commonly understood that the Bill of Rights was not originally intended to apply to the states, though except where amendments refer specifically to the Federal Government or a branch thereof (as in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]], under which some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion), there is no such delineation in the text itself. Nevertheless, a general interpretation of inapplicability to the states remained until 1868, when the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was passed, which stated, in part, that:

{{cquote|No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}}

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to extend most, but not all, parts of the Bill of Rights to the states. Nevertheless, the balance of state and federal power has remained a battle in the Supreme Court.

The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were actually the last ten of the twelve amendments proposed in 1789. The second of the twelve proposed amendments, regarding the compensation of members of Congress, remained unratified until 1992, when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it and, as a result, it became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] despite more than two centuries of pendency. The [[Congressional Apportionment Amendment|first of the twelve]]&mdash;still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification&mdash;pertains to the apportionment of the [[United States House of Representatives]] after each decennial [[census]]. The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is [[Kentucky]] in 1792 during that commonwealth's first month of statehood.

*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: addresses the rights of [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of petition]], and also [[freedom of religion]], both in terms of prohibiting the Congressional [[establishment of religion]] and protecting the right to [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|free exercise of religion]].

*[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]: declares the necessity for "a well regulated militia", and prohibits infringement of "the right of the people to keep and bear arms".

*[[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]]: prohibits the government from using private homes as quarters for soldiers without the consent of the owners. The only existing case law regarding this amendment is a lower court decision in the case of [[Engblom v. Carey]]. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment03/]

*[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]: guards against searches, arrests, and seizures of [[property]] without a specific warrant or a "probable cause" to believe a crime has been committed. Some rights to privacy have been inferred from this amendment and others by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

*[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]: forbids [[trial (law)|trial]] for a major [[crime]] except after [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]]; prohibits [[double jeopardy|repeated trials]] for the same offense after an acquittal (except in certain very limited circumstances); forbids punishment without [[due process]] of law; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to testify against himself (this is also known as "[[Taking the fifth]]" or "Pleading the fifth"). This is regarded as the "rights of the accused" amendment. It also prohibits government from taking private property without "[[just compensation]]," the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States.

*[[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]: guarantees a speedy public trial for criminal offenses. It requires trial by a [[jury]] (of peers), guarantees the right to [[legal counsel]] for the accused, and guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused. It also guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against him. The Sixth Amendment has several court cases associated with it, including ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', and ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]''. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment prohibition on forced self incrimination and the sixth amendment clause on right to counsel were to be made known to all persons placed under arrest, and as a result these clauses have become known as the [[Miranda rights]].

*[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]: assures trial by jury in [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving anything valued at more than 20 [[United States dollar]]s at the time, which is currently worth $300, when accounting for [[inflation]].

*[[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]: forbids excessive [[bail]] or [[fines]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. 

*[[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive; and that the people have other rights not specifically mentioned, but rather retained elsewhere by the people.

*[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]: provides that powers that the Constitution does not delegate to the United States and does not prohibit the states from exercising, are "reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

===Subsequent amendments (11&ndash;27)===
Amendments to the Constitution subsequent to the Bill of Rights cover many subjects. The majority of the seventeen later amendments stem from continued efforts to expand individual civil or political liberties, while a few are concerned with modifying the basic governmental structure drafted in Philadelphia in 1787. Although the United States Constitution has been amended a total of 17 times, only 16 of the amendments are currently used because the 21st amendment supersedes the 18th.

* [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795): Clarifies judicial power over foreign nationals, and limits ability of citizens to sue states in federal courts and under federal law. ([[wikisource:Additional amendments to the United States Constitution#Amendment XI|Full text]])

== Unratified amendments ==
:''See also: [[Proposals for amendments to the United States Constitution]], [[List of unsuccessful attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution]].''

Over 10,000 Constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; in a typical Congressional year in the last several decades, between 100 and 200 are offered. Most of these concepts never get out of Congressional committee, much less get proposed by the Congress for ratification. Backers of some amendments <!-- (how many?) --> have attempted the alternative, and thus-far never-utilized, method mentioned in Article Five. In two instances&mdash;reapportionment in the 1960s and a balanced federal budget during the 1970s and 1980s&mdash;these attempts have come within just two state legislative "applications" of triggering that alternative method.

Of the thirty-three amendments that have been proposed by Congress, six have failed ratification by the required three-quarters of the state legislatures&mdash;and four of those six are still technically pending before state lawmakers (see ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]''). Starting with the 18th amendment, each proposed amendment (except for the 19th Amendment and for the still-pending Child Labor Amendment of 1924) has specified a deadline for passage. The following are the unratified amendments:

*The [[Congressional Apportionment Amendment]] proposed by the [[First United States Congress|1st Congress]] on [[September 25]], [[1789]], defined a formula for how many members there would be in the [[United States House of Representatives]] after each decennial [[census]]. Ratified by eleven states, the last being [[Kentucky]] in June 1792 (Kentucky's initial month of statehood), this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. In principle it may yet be ratified, though as written it became moot when the population of the United States reached ten million.
*The so-called [[the missing thirteenth amendment|missing thirteenth amendment]], or "Titles of Nobility Amendment" (TONA), proposed by the [[11th Congress]] on [[May 1]], [[1810]], would have ended the citizenship of any American accepting "any Title of Nobility or Honour" from any foreign power. Some maintain that the amendment ''was'' actually ratified by the legislatures of enough states, and that a conspiracy has suppressed it, but this has been thoroughly debunked.[http://www.thirdamendment.com/missing.html] Known to have been ratified by lawmakers in twelve states, the last in 1812, this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.
*The [[Corwin amendment]], proposed by the [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|36th Congress]] on [[March 2]], [[1861]], would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the Federal government to "abolish or interfere" with the "domestic institutions" of the states (a delicate way of referring to [[slavery]]). It was ratified by only [[Ohio]] and [[Maryland]] lawmakers before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. [[Illinois]] lawmakers&mdash;sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time&mdash;likewise approved it, but that action is of questionable validity. The proposed amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and may yet be ratified. However, adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War likely means that the amendment would be ineffective if adopted.
*A [[child labor amendment]] proposed by the [[Sixty-eighth United States Congress|68th Congress]] on [[June 2]], [[1924]], which stipulates: "The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age." This amendment is now moot, since subsequent federal [[child labor laws]] have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the [[commerce clause]]. This amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.

Properly placed in a separate category from the other four constitutional amendments that Congress proposed to the states, but which not enough states have approved, are the following two offerings which&mdash;because of deadlines&mdash;are no longer subject to ratification.

*The [[Equal Rights Amendment]], or ERA, which reads in pertinent part "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex." Proposed by the [[Ninety-second United States Congress|92nd Congress]] on [[March 22]], [[1972]], it was ratified by the legislatures of 35 states, and expired on either [[March 22]], [[1979]], or on [[June 30]], [[1982]], depending upon one's point of view of a controversial three-year extension of the ratification deadline, which was passed by the [[Ninety-fifth United States Congress|95th Congress]] in 1978. Of the 35 states ratifying it, four later rescinded their ratifications prior to the extended ratification period which commenced [[March 23]], [[1979]] and a fifth&mdash;while not going so far as to actually rescind its earlier ratification&mdash;adopted a resolution stipulating that its approval would not extend beyond [[March 22]], [[1979]]. There continues to be diversity of opinion as to whether such reversals are valid; no court has ruled on the question, including the Supreme Court. But a precedent against the validity of rescission was first established during the ratification process of the 14th Amendment when Ohio and [[New Jersey]] rescinded their earlier approvals, but yet were counted as ratifying states when the 14th Amendment was ultimately proclaimed part of the Constitution in 1868.
*The [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]] was proposed by the 95th Congress on [[August 22]], [[1978]]. Had it been ratified, it would have granted to [[Washington, D.C.]], two Senators and at least one member of the House of Representatives as though the District of Columbia were a state. Ratified by the legislatures of only 16 states&mdash;less than half of the required 38&mdash;the proposed amendment expired on [[August 22]], [[1985]].

There are currently only a few proposals for amendments which have entered mainstream political debate. These include the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], the [[Balanced Budget Amendment]], and the [[flag-burning amendment|Flag-Burning Amendment]].

==Historical influences==
[[Image:Detail_of_Magna_Carta_monument.JPG|thumb|270px|In 1957 the [[American Bar Association]] acknowledged the debt American law and constitutionalism had to the [[Magna Carta]] by erecting a monument at [[Runnymede]], [[England]].]]
In some instances, historians disagree on the specific international influences on the overall development of the Constitution, possibly because of the large variety of sources that are available. Many argue that several of the ideas in the Constitution were new, and that a large number of ideas were drawn from [[Classical Antiquity]] and the British governmental tradition of [[mixed government]], which was in practice among 12 of the 13 states. Many historians do not specifically consider other sources, but the ideas advocated by the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu]] are prominent among the contenders of non-British European influences. A number of historians also note the direct influence of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the United Provinces]], which had itself a Constitution in place for two centuries by 1781 with many similarities to the American Constitution <U+2014> some of their ideas though were also drawn from [[Classical Antiquity]].

Not surprisingly, the influence of the United Kingdom is considered more prominent than other contemporary European influences. [[John Locke]] is known to be a mild influence, and the [[due process]] clause of the United States Constitution was partly based on ideas from Article 39 from the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 which states that:

{{cquote|No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgement of his peers, or by the law of the land.}}

The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]] also acted as a source of ideas for the United States Constitution. For example, like the English Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution requires jury trials, contains a right to bear arms, and prohibits excessive bail and of <U+201C>cruel and unusual punishments.<U+201D>

Liberties guaranteed by Magna Carta and the 1689 English Bill of Rights were directly incorporated into state statutes and the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], and many were then further incorporated into the Constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

==Criticism==
=== Legality ===
{{weasel section}}

The Constitution was originally proposed by a convention which was convened for the express purpose of amending the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The Articles required ratification by the legislatures of all of the member states for amendments to take effect. Article Seven of the Constitution, however, only required ratification by conventions in nine states for that document to take effect. 

Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] in ''Founding Brothers'' charges that there is truth in the allegations that the:
# "Convention was extralegal, since its explicit mandate was to revise the Articles of Confederation, not replace them."
# "Machinery for ratification did not require the unanimous consent [as] dictated by the Articles [of Confederation] themselves."

Constitutional lawyer [[Michael P. Farris]] disagrees, arguing that:
# "No limits were placed on the authority of the convention to make amendments," and that the Constitution is, in effect, simply an amended version of the Articles of Confederation.
# "Congress and all thirteen state legislatures approved the new ratification process as required by the Articles." Eleven states held ratification conventions (approved by their legislatures) and approved the Constitution by [[July 26]], [[1788]], a direct approval of the change in procedure. The other two states' legislatures (of North Carolina and Rhode Island) also approved of the ratification process&mdash;North Carolina by holding a convention and Rhode Island by submitting the Constitution to a referendum, although they both rejected the Constitution (at first). Thus, the change in ''procedure'' was approved by all the states.

Constitutional lawyer [[Akhil Amar|Akhil Reed Amar]] disagrees with both. He argues that the United States under the Articles was a multilateral alliance among independent and sovereign nations and that the Constitution created a wholly new nation, which had the same name as the alliance. The states had the right under international law to withdraw from the Articles. Amar's interpretation has the appeal that it allows the Constitution ratification be legal, yet also makes the secession of the states prior to the [[American Civil War]] illegal, as, according to Amar, South Carolina and her sister states had ceased to be sovereign nations by ratifying the Constitution.

In contrast, American History professor Kevin R. C. Gutzman (Department of History and Non-Western Cultures, Western Connecticut State University) writes of this view that "this is simply erroneous: under the American theory of government, the People [of the individual states] are sovereign. As the Virginia General Assembly noted in the Report of 1800, the sovereign people of each state ratified the federal Constitution, so it is the people of each state that retains sovereignty".

In any case, all the states did ratify the Constitution, and a government has been operating under its provisions for over two centuries.
