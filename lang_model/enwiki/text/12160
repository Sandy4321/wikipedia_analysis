The '''Fraser Mansion''' is a building at 1701 20th Street NW, at the intersection of [[Connecticut Avenue]], 20th Street, and R Street in the [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]  Since its construction in 1890, the [[mansion]] has served as a private [[Home|residence]],<ref name="NRHP application">{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination, Golden Parrot Restaurant|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/75002054.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=3 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5riJfNfd8|archivedate=2010-08-03|date=1975-08-19}}</ref> a restaurant,<ref name="NRHP application" /> a [[boarding house]],<ref name="Kelsey">{{cite web|title=Scenes from the Past: The George S.

The mansion was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref name="NRHP Listing">{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places, District of Columbia|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/dc/district+of+columbia/state3.html|publisher=American Dreams|accessdate=6 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlopCW0A|archivedate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

== Design, construction, and early use ==
The mansion was designed by the architectural firm of Hornblower and Marshall in an early eclectic [[Beaux arts architecture|beaux arts]] style<ref name="NRHP application" /> to serve as the home of New York merchant George S. Fraser.<ref name="Kelsey" /><ref name="HABS" />  The building is three stories tall with two basement levels and an attic. It is constructed of red [[brick]] and pink [[granite]] with a [[colonnade]]d entrance porch with [[Baluster|balustraded]] deck,<ref name="NPS Photo Data">{{cite web|last=Hoagland|first=Alison|title=George Fraser House (Scott-Thropp House, Golden Parrot Restaurant, Golden Booeymonger Restaurant)|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/dc/dc0000/dc0069/data/dc0069.pdf|work=Historic American Buildings Survey|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=3 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ri29re7k|archivedate=2010-08-03}}</ref> and a tiled, [[hip roof|hipped roof]].  The interior was planned around a central open stair, with large, central halls on each floor.<ref name="NRHP application" />  It was constructed in 1890 at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]75,000, more than ten times the cost of a typical Washington home at that time.<ref name="Kelsey" />  

[[File:Fraser Mansion without retaining wall close up.png|thumb|left|Fraser Mansion prior to 1901 alterations]]

The building served as Fraser's residence until his death in 1896.  In 1901, Fraser's widow sold the mansion to Pennsylvania Congressman [[Joseph Earlston Thropp]], where he took up residence beginning on March 3, 1901.<ref name="Kelsey" />  The Thropps made exterior alterations, enlarging [[dormer]] windows and adding an [[oriel window]] in 1901.  In 1905, architects Totten and Rogers designed a [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] with an entrance to the house near the oriel window, and also redesigned the garden wall.<ref name="NRHP application" />

The mansion remained in the ownership of Thropp and his wife, Miriam Scott-Thropp, until Scott-Thropp's death in 1930.<ref name="Kelsey" />

== Restaurant ==
In 1932, the lower floor of the mansion<ref name="NPS Photo Data" /> began operation as the Parrot Tea Room, a [[tea house]], with a boarding house located on the upper levels.  In 1950, upon leasing to John Goldstein,<ref name="Kelsey" /> the facility was converted to a [[restaurant]]<ref name="NPS Photo Data" /> and renamed the Golden Parrot.  The mansion was sold in 1974, and the restaurant was renamed the Golden Booeymonger.<ref name="Kelsey" />  Later, the mansion became home to [[nightclub]]s Larry Brown's and Sagittarius.<ref name="Zoning Battle">{{cite news|last=Cannizzaro|first=Michael|title=Dupont Circle Zoning Battle Centers on Historic Fraser Mansion|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1342408.html|accessdate=3 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1987-09-10}}</ref><ref name="Kelsey" />  The mansion was again sold in 1981 to Walter Sommer for $2 million.  Following a $3 million renovation,<ref name="Kelsey" /> the building opened in 1982<ref name="Bermuda">{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Joe|title=Bermuda Bar and Grill flavors DC dining|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n39_v22/ai_6687168/|accessdate=3 August 2010|newspaper=Nation's Restaurant News|date=1988-09-26}}</ref> to house another restaurant, the Four Ways.<ref name="Kelsey" />  The Four Ways served [[Continental Europe]]an and American dishes under the leadership of chef Jacques Barre.<ref name="Bermuda" />

[[File:Fraser Mansion as Golden Parrot Restaurant.jpg|thumb|right|Fraser Mansion as the Golden Parrot restaurant]]

By 1988, Sommer had opened the patio-cafe Bermuda Bar and Grill in the mansion alongside the Four Ways.  According to the ''[[Nation's Restaurant News]]'', the restaurant seated 40 people inside and 60 outside, and was modeled after restaurants and [[Public house|pubs]] in [[Bermuda]].  Among other things, the restaurant featured an all-you-can-eat [[salad bar]], an unlimited Sunday [[brunch]], and "traditional Bermuda drinks made with island rum and freshly squeezed fruit juices."<ref name="Bermuda" />

== Proposed apartment building ==
In 1987, a proposal was made to construct a seven-story, 29-unit [[apartment]] building in the parking lot behind the mansion.<ref name="Fourways Condo">{{cite news|last=Foote|first=Cornelius|title=Fourways Condo Plan Gets Rehearing; Dupont Neighborhood Residents Vow to Fight New Proposals|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1345402.html|accessdate=3 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1987-09-26}}</ref>  At the time, the property was [[Zoning|zoned]] residential, with [[Variance (land use)|variances]] permitting a restaurant on the property.  Then-owner Walter Sommer claimed that the variances restricted him unfairly, requiring him to go to the zoning board multiple times for changes to his business, in a process that he considered costly and time consuming.  Additionally, Sommer claimed that without commercial zoning, he was unable to obtain a "realistic commercial [[loan]]" to fund maintenance costs.<ref name="Zoning Battle" />  Between 1982 and 1987, the D.C. Board of Zoning Appeals granted Sommer variances to expand the commercial use of the building above the first floor and permitting a business club to operate in the building.<ref name="Fourways Condo" />

While the proposed design for the building was approved by the D.C. Office of Planning and the Historic Preservation Review Board, and the Department of Public Works had determined that the plans, which would have included [[Multi-storey car park|underground parking]] for both the apartments and the restaurant, would not cause an increase in parking or traffic problems in the area, the community opposed the building's construction.  Nearby resident Duff Gilfont described the proposed apartment building as "such a [[Urban decay|blight]] to this area," and that "there would have been so many people inconvenienced by it."<ref name="Zoning Battle" />  Several neighborhood associations opposed rezoning the building, expressing concern that the new building would be used as a hotel.  Sommer denied that there were plans to use the building as a [[hotel]] or an [[office]] building.<ref name="Fourways Condo" />

[[File:Fraser Mansion circa 1975.png|thumb|right|Fraser Mansion in 1975, as the Sagittarius nightclub]]

Several [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] were proposed.  One would require that the new building only be used for residential purposes.  A second would have required that any future owners of the Fraser Mansion would be required to submit their plans for the building for review by the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board.  A third proposed covenant would have split the zoning of the property, allowing only residential use of the building, but requiring variances for any changes in the parking for the restaurant or the apartment building.<ref name="Fourways Condo" />

Despite the proposed covenants, however, [[Community organizing|community groups]] vowed to continue to fight the proposal.<ref name="Fourways Condo" />

== Bankruptcy and attempted sale ==
During the fight over the building's zoning, Sommer claimed that he would go bankrupt if he was unable to develop the property.  Four Ways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1989,<ref name="Scientology Purchase">{{cite news|last=Haggerty|first=Maryann|title=Church of Scientology Buys Historic Dupont Circle Mansion|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-887629.html|accessdate=3 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1994-04-25}}</ref> and by October 1989, the Four Ways restaurant had closed.<ref name="Four Ways closure">{{cite news|last=Richman|first=Phyllis|title=Off-the-Menu Billings|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1215839.html|accessdate=3 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1989-10-06}}</ref>

Trying to pay creditors, Sommer attempted to sell the mansion.  Sommer's initial asking price was $7 million, which he later reduced to $3 million.  A number of embassies and chanceries looked at the mansion, but none purchased.  According to real estate broker Stanley Holland, Sommer "thought it was worth more than it was."<ref name="Scientology Purchase" />

== Church of Scientology ==
In 1994, the Church of Scientology purchased the property with the intention of using the building as a church facility.  In purchasing the building, Scientology first purchased [[mortgage]]s on the building in 1993 from the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], which had assumed the loans after the 1990 failure of the [[National Bank of Washington]].  Following the purchase of the loans, Scientology [[Foreclosure|foreclosed]] on the building.  In the subsequent foreclosure auction, Scientology purchased the building for $2.7 million.<ref name="Scientology Purchase" />

Following $1 million in renovations,<ref name="Scientology Dedication" /> the building was dedicated as the new Founding Church of Scientology on October 21, 1995 by [[Religious Technology Center]] chairman [[David Miscavige]].<ref name="FCDC dedication">{{cite web|title=David Miscavige Chairman of the Board Religious Technology Center<U+2019>s Address from the Grand Opening of The Founding Church of Scientology Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.scientology-washingtondc.org/en_US/history/opening/|publisher=Founding Church of Scientology|accessdate=6 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlkcGKaG|archivedate=2010-08-05}}</ref>

The Founding Church of Scientology relocated from the Fraser Mansion to the nearby Embassy Building on [[16th Street Northwest (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street NW]] on October 31, 2009.<ref name="Celeb Barrier">{{cite news|title=Green & Glover: Celeb Barrier|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/03/green-glover-celeb-barrier/|accessdate=6 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=2009-11-03|author=Green, Stephanie|author2=Glover, Elizabeth|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlmRjEu2|archivedate=2010-08-06}}</ref><ref name="Ideal Org" />  Fraser Mansion now serves as the National Affairs office for the Church of Scientology.<ref name="Ideal Org" />
