The term '''Steadicam''' has several senses:
# In the loosest sense, it refers to a stabilizing mount for a motion-picture camera, which mechanically isolates the movement of the camera from that of the operator, providing a very smooth shot even when the operator is moving quickly over an uneven surface.
# Many familiar with the general concept use it to refer to the combined assembly of mount and camera.
# "Steadicam" is a registered [[trademark]] of [[Tiffen]] for their camera stabilizers.
For the remainder of this article, "steadicam" will be used in the first sense.

== Purpose ==
For static shots, a motion picture camera is typically stabilised with a [[tripod (photography)|tripod]], or one of a variety of mounting systems which place the camera firmly on the ground.

Traditionally, for moving (or "tracking") shots, a director has two basic choices. Typically, the camera is mounted on a [[camera dolly|dolly]]<U+2014>a wheeled camera mount that rolls on tracks or levelled boards. This has the advantage of permitting smooth camera movement, but takes time to set up, and can be impractical in certain situations. The director must compose the shot's movement so as to prevent the tracks or boards from appearing on screen.

Alternatively, the director can use "hand-held" camera work, in which the camera operator holds the camera in his hands. This has the advantage of speed and flexibility. With sufficiently small and lightweight cameras, camera operators can obtain shots that would otherwise be impossible. Even the most skilled camera operator cannot prevent the image from shaking, if only minutely, due to his body's natural movements. Hand-held footage has traditionally been considered suitable mostly for [[documentaries]], [[news]], reportage work, live action, unrehearsable footage, or as a special effect to evoke an atmosphere of authentic immediacy during dramatic sequences. The gritty police television drama ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' became quite famous for its use of hand-held camera work as a dramatic element.

A steadicam essentially combines the stabilised steady footage of a conventional tripod mount with the fluid motion of a dolly shot and the flexibility of hand-held camera work. The steadicam's armature absorbs the jerks, bumps, and other small movements of the operator, while smoothly following the broad movements needed to cover any given scene, such as moving over uneven terrain or through a crowd.

==History==

The steadicam was invented in the early 1970s by inventor and cameraman [[Garrett Brown]], who originally named the invention the "Brown Stabilizer". After completing the first working prototype, Mr. Brown shot a 10-minute demo reel of the revolutionary moves this new device could produce.

The reel was seen by numerous directors, including [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[John Avildsen]]. Avildsen directed ''[[Rocky]]'' in 1976, one of the first movies to feature steadicam shots. The Steadicam was first used in the [[biopic]] ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'', whilst Kubrick would use the Brown Stabilizer in his 1980 film ''[[The Shining (movie)|The Shining]]''.

Though he was not the first to use it in a mainstream film, Kubrick's use of the steadicam in ''[[The Shining (movie)|The Shining]]'' is considered the first breakthrough of the technology. The long, fluid tracking shots through the Overlook Hotel of the film had enormous impact on other filmmakers. Both [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] have specifically noted the low tracking shots Kubrick made of the boy Danny riding his Big Wheel through the lobby of the Overlook. Because the steadicam could position the camera so close to the ground, the shots are impossible with any sort of [[Camera dolly|dolly]] track. 

The invention was exclusively licensed by [[Cinema Products Corporation]] and later brought to market as the Steadicam. As of October 2000, Steadicam<U+00AE> became a trademark of camera manufacturer Tiffen. [http://www.tvcameramen.com/newsroom/news16.htm]

==Function==
[[Image:Steadicam and operator in front of crowd.jpg|thumb|This steadicam's 'sled' includes a battery pack and LCD monitor.]]

The operator wears a harness which is attached to an [[iso-elastic]] arm. This is connected by a [[gimbal]] to the steadicam armature which has the camera mounted at one end and a counterbalance weight at the other. The counterbalance usually includes the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] pack and a monitor. The monitor substitutes for the camera's viewfinder, since the range of motion of the camera relative to the operator makes the camera's own viewfinder unusable.  In the film industry the armature and weight are traditionally called the "sled", as they resembled a [[sled]] in an early model of the steadicam.

The combined weight of the counterbalance and camera means that the armature bears a relatively high [[inertia]]l mass which will not be easily moved by small body movements from the operator (much like it is difficult to quickly shake a [[bowling ball]]). The freely pivoting armature adds additional stabilization to the photographed image, and makes the weight of the camera-sled assembly acceptable by allowing the body harness to support it.

When the armature is correctly adjusted, the operator is able to remove his hands from the steadicam entirely and have the camera stay in place. During operation, the operator usually rests his/her hand on the the camera [[gimbal]] and applies force at that point to move the camera. To avoid shaking the camera when lens adjustments must be made during the shot, a wireless remote operated by the camera assistant is used to control focus and iris.

For low shots, the camera/sled arm can be rotated vertically, putting the camera where the sled normally sits and vice-versa; since both camera and display are inverted, the operator still sees a correctly oriented picture. The upside-down image recorded by the camera can be fixed in [[post-production]].

== Filmography ==

Today the steadicam is a standard piece of film-making equipment, used in many productions. Notable instances of steadicam use include:

* ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' (1976) was the first feature production to use the Steadicam.
* ''[[Marathon Man]]'' (1976) was the first feature released with Steadicam shots (although these were shot after ''Bound for Glory'')
* ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976) used a steadicam during its training montage sequence (including the famous run up a flight of museum steps) and certain fight scenes.
* ''[[John Carpenter's Halloween]]'' (1978) - Director John Carpenter used the steadicam for the infamous opening scene of the film where Michael murders his sister along with numerous other shots during the film.
* Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has made extensive use of the steadicam in many of his movies.
* Several tracking shots of Danny the little boy on his tricycle in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) were considered the steadicam's breakthrough.
* ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) used the steadicam with two cross-mounted [[gyroscope]]s for additional stability to film the background plates for the speeder bike sequence. <ref>Brown, Garrett. [http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/stcm/pg1.htm "Steadicam Plates for Return of the Jedi"], ''American Cinematographer'', June 1983.</ref>
* ''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002) consists of one uninterrupted 90-minute steadicam shot, with the camera following the principal character as he wanders through the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], the palatial museum in [[Saint Petersburg]].
* ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' (1999<U+2013>2006) is noted for its long steadicam "[[Walk and Talk]]" sequences showing staff members walking down hallways.
* The 2006 remake of "[[The Omen]]" used an extensive Steadicam shot in the scene in which the six-year old AntiChrist Damien Thorn knocks his mother off a balcony with his scooter.
* [[Britney Spears]]' Music Video for [[Gimme More]] (Director's Cut)
Steadicam as a prop:

* ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) utilized a steadicam harness to create the attachment point of the fictional [[M56 Smart Gun]] used by characters Vasquez and Drake.
