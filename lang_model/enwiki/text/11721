'''Israel the Grammarian'''{{efn|Israel is called the Grammarian by most modern scholars, but Edouard Jeauneau refers to him as "Israel Scot"<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 87, n. 1</ref> (meaning Irish) and Michael Wood as "Israel of Trier".<ref name=Wood135>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 135</ref>}} ({{circa|895}} <U+2013> c. 965) was one of the leading European scholars of the mid-tenth century. In the 930s, he was at the court of King [[<U+00C6>thelstan]] of England (924<U+2013>39). After <U+00C6>thelstan's death, Israel successfully sought the patronage of Archbishop Rotbert of [[Trier]] and became tutor to [[Bruno the Great|Bruno]], later the [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. In the late 940s Israel is recorded as a bishop, and at the end of his life he was a monk at the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Saint-Maximin]] in Trier.

Israel was probably a [[Breton people|Breton]]. He was an accomplished poet, a disciple of the ninth-century Irish philosopher [[John Scottus Eriugena]] and one of the few scholars of his time to understand Greek. He wrote theological and grammatical tracts, and commentaries on the works of other philosophers and theologians.

==Background==
The reign of [[Charlemagne]] saw a revival in learning in Europe from the late eighth century, known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The [[Carolingian Empire]] collapsed in the late ninth century, while the tenth is seen as a period of decline, described as the "Age of Iron" by a Frankish Council in 909. This negative picture of the period is increasingly challenged by historians; in [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood's]] view "the first half of the tenth century saw many remarkable and formative developments that would shape European culture and history."<ref name=Wood135/> The Bible remained the primary fount of knowledge, but study of classical writers, who had previously been demonised as pagans, became increasingly acceptable.<ref>Leonardi, "Intellectual Life", pp. 186<U+2013>188</ref>

When [[Alfred the Great]] became King of [[Wessex]] in 871, learning in southern England was at a low level, and there were no Latin scholars. He embarked on a programme of revival, bringing in scholars from Continental Europe, Wales and Mercia, and himself translated works he considered important from Latin to the vernacular. His grandson, [[<U+00C6>thelstan]], carried on the work, inviting foreign scholars such as Israel to England, and appointing a number of continental clerics as bishops. In the 930s the level of learning was still not high enough to supply enough literate English priests to fill the [[bishopric]]s. The generation educated in <U+00C6>thelstan's reign, such as the future [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester|<U+00C6>thelwold]], who was educated at court, and [[Dunstan]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], went on to raise English learning to a high level.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 5<U+2013>24; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 138; Leonardi, "Intellectual Life", p. 191</ref>

==Early life==
Very little is known about Israel's early life. [[Michael Lapidge]] dates his birth to around 900,<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> while Wood places it slightly earlier, around 890.<ref name="Wood p. 138">Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 138</ref> He was a disciple of Ambrose and spent time at Rome, but it is unknown who Ambrose was or whether he was Israel's tutor in Rome.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88, 92</ref> In Wood's view Israel was a monk at [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Saint-Maximin in Trier]] in the 930s.<ref name="Wood p. 138"/>

Tenth-century sources provide conflicting evidence on Israel's origin. Ruotger in his life of [[Bruno the Great|Bruno]] referred to Israel as Irish, whereas [[Flodoard]] in his ''Chronicle'' described him as "Britto", which may refer to [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]] or Wales, all three of which were [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] speaking refuges for Britons who had fled the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion of England]].<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 90</ref> According to Lapidge: "The consensus of modern scholarship is in favour of an Irish origin, but the matter has not been properly investigated."<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref>
He argues that the bishop of [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in [[County Down]], Dub Innse, described Israel as a "Roman scholar", and that he therefore does not appear to have recognised him as a fellow Irishman. Lapidge states that Flodoard was contemporary with Israel and may have known him, whereas Ruotger wrote after Israel's death and probably did not have first hand knowledge. Giving children [[Old Testament Hebrew]] names such as Israel was common in Celtic areas in the tenth century. Lapidge concludes that Brittany is more likely than Wales or Cornwall, as manuscripts associated with him have [[Breton language|Breton]] glosses, and <U+00C6>thelstan's court was a haven for Breton scholars fleeing Viking occupation of their homeland.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 89<U+2013>92, 99<U+2013>103</ref>

In 2007, Wood revived the Irish theory, questioning whether Flodoard's "Israel Britto" means "Breton", and stating that Ruotger knew Israel.<ref>Wood, "Stand Strong Against the Monsters", pp. 205<U+2013>206; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 141<U+2013>142</ref> <U+00C6>thelstan's biographer, [[Sarah Foot]], mentions Wood's view, but she rejects it, stating that Israel was not Irish and may have been a Breton.<ref name=Foot104>Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 104</ref> [[Thomas Charles-Edwards]], a historian of medieval Wales, thinks he may have been Welsh.<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', p. 635</ref>
[[File:Gospel Dice.jpg|thumb|A twelfth-century illustration of Gospel Dice, the board game which Israel and Franco drew for Dub Innse|265px]]

==<U+00C6>thelstan's court==
Israel's presence in England is known from a gospel book written in Ireland in about 1140, which contains a copy of a tenth-century drawing and explanation of a board game called "Gospel Dice", based on [[canon tables]] (concordances for parallel texts of the four gospels). According to a note on the manuscript:
:Here begins the Gospel Dice which Dub Innse, bishop of Bangor, brought from the English king, that is from the household of <U+00C6>thelstan, King of England, drawn by a certain Franco [or Frank] and by a Roman scholar, that is Israel.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 89</ref>

The twelfth-century copyist appears to have changed Dub Innse's first person note to the third person. In a later passage, he interprets "Roman scholar, that is Israel" as meaning a Roman Jew (''Iudeus Romanus''). This has been taken by some historians, including David Wasserstein, as showing that there was a Jewish scholar at <U+00C6>thelstan's court, but Lapidge argues that this interpretation was a misunderstanding by the copyist, and his view has been generally accepted by historians.<ref>Wasserstein, "The First Jew in England", pp. 283<U+2013>288; Lapidge,  ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 89, n. 17; Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 104</ref> Israel is thought to be Israel the Grammarian, described as a Roman scholar because of his time in the city, and the Gospel Dice manuscript shows that he spent a period at <U+00C6>thelstan's court. A number of manuscripts associated with Israel, including two of the four known copies of his poem ''De arte metrica'', were written in England.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 92<U+2013>103</ref> In Foot's view:
:Israel provides a tantalising link between the spheres of masculine camaraderie of a conventional royal court and the more rarefied, scholarly atmosphere that <U+00C6>thelstan may have liked both his contemporaries and posterity to think he was keen to promote.<ref>Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', p. 105</ref>

Israel was a practitioner of the "hermeneutic style" of Latin, characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. He probably influenced the scribe known to historians as "<U+00C6>thelstan A", an early exponent of the style in charters he drafted between 928 and 935.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 105; Gretsch, ''Intellectual Foundations'', pp. 314, 336; Woodman, "<U+00C6>thelstan A", pp. 227<U+2013>228</ref> Hermeneutic Latin was to become the dominant style of the English Benedictine reform movement of the later tenth century, and Israel may have been an early mentor of one of its leaders, <U+00C6>thelwold, at <U+00C6>thelstan's court in the 930s.<ref>Gretsch, ''Intellectual Foundations'', pp. 314<U+2013>315, 336; Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 111</ref> The Latin texts which Israel brought to <U+00C6>thelstan's court were influenced by Irish writers, and the historian Jane Stevenson sees them as contributing a Hiberno-Latin element to the hermeneutic style in England.<ref>Stevenson, "The Irish Contribution", p. 176</ref>

==Later career==
Israel's poem ''De arte metrica'' was dedicated to Rotbert, [[Archbishop of Trier]]. It was almost certainly composed in England, and the dedication was probably a successful plea for Rotbert's patronage when <U+00C6>thelstan died in 939. From about 940 Israel was the tutor of Bruno, the future [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and brother of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Otto the Great]]. Froumund of [[Tegernsee]] described Israel as Rotbert's "shining light". In 947 Israel attended a synod at [[Verdun]] presided over by Rotbert, where he was referred to as a bishop, but without identification of his see.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88, 103; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 159</ref> He was famous as a schoolmaster and  probably played an important role in Emperor Otto's establishment of a court school at Aachen.<ref name="Wood p. 142">Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 142</ref>

Tenth-century sources describe Israel as a bishop; around 950 a man with this name is identified as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aix|Bishop of Aix-en-Provence]], but it is not certain that he was the same person.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 88</ref> Between 948 and 950 he may have held a bishopric in [[Aachen]], where he debated Christian ideas about the [[Trinity]] with a Jewish intellectual called Salomon, probably the [[Byzantine]] ambassador of that name.<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", p. 160</ref> He retired to become a monk at the [[Benedictine]] monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier, and died on 26 April in an unknown year. Lapidge sets his death in about 970, whereas Wood dates it before 967<U+2013>68.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 88<U+2013>89; Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 138, 161</ref>

==Scholarship==
Charters produced from 928 by King <U+00C6>thelstan's scribe, "<U+00C6>thelstan A", include unusual words almost certainly copied from the Hiberno-Irish poems ''Adelphus adelphe'' and ''Rubisca''. The poems display a sophisticated knowledge of Greek and are described by Lapidge as "immensely difficult". It is likely that they were brought by Israel from the Continent, while ''Adelphus adelphe'' was probably, and ''Rubisca'' possibly, his work.<ref name=ASEIsrael/><ref name=Woodman227-228/>{{efn|Lapidge states that Israel probably wrote ''Rubisca'',<ref name=ASEIsrael/> but other scholars prefer a date before his time.<ref name=Woodman227-228>Woodman, "<U+00C6>thelstan A", pp. 227<U+2013>228</ref> Stevenson thinks it was written by an Irish scholar on the Continent in the late ninth or early tenth century.<ref>Stevenson, "The Irish Contribution", p. 277</ref>}}

Mechthild Gretsch describes Israel as "one of the most learned men in Europe",<ref>Gretsch, ''Intellectual Foundations'', p. 314</ref> and Lapidge says that he was "an accomplished grammarian and poet, and one of the few scholars of his time to have first-hand knowledge of Greek."<ref name=ASEIsrael>Lapidge, "Israel the Grammarian", ''Blackwell Encyclopedia''</ref> Greek scholarship was so rare in this period that in the 870s [[Anastasius the Librarian]] was unable to find anyone competent to edit his translation of a text from Greek, and had to do it himself.<ref>Leonardi, "Intellectual Life", p. 189</ref> Israel wrote on theology and collected works of medicine.<ref name="Wood p. 142"/> In the 940s he became interested in the Irish philosopher, [[John Scottus Eriugena]], and commented on his works in a manuscript which survives in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', pp. 87, 103</ref> In a manuscript [[Interlinear gloss|glossing]] [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphryr's]] [[Isagoge]], he recommended John's [[Periphyseon]]. His [[redaction]] of a commentary on [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus's]] ''Ars Minor'' was a major teaching text in the [[Middle Ages]], and still in print in the twentieth century.<ref>Wood, "A Carolingian Scholar", pp. 140, 149</ref>
