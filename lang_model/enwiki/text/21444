</ref> Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, he was not called up because the [[Selective Service System]] was only taking older men. When he became eligible for the draft, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant. He was granted 3-A status, the "hardship" exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.<ref>

Cheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman [[William A. Steiger]] during the [[Richard Nixon]] Administration.

In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and requiring it to oust the [[communist]] faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated.

In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

===Political climate and agenda===
Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]], could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the [[Warsaw Pact]] obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|North Atlantic Treaty Organization's]] (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his successor, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.<ref>

Cheney persuaded the [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[aristocracy]] to allow bases for US ground troops and war planes in the nation.

Using [[economic sanctions]] and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive [[Panama]]nian ruler General [[Manuel Antonio Noriega]] from power after he fell from favour.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> In May 1989, after [[Guillermo Endara]] had been duly elected [[President of Panama]], Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure.

The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect US lives and property, and restore Panamanian [[civil liberties]].<ref>

In 1991, the [[Somali Civil War]] drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 US troops to [[Somalia]] as part of the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, [[Les Aspin]] and [[William J. Perry]], had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.

====Iraqi invasion of Kuwait====
On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Gulf War|sent invading forces into neighboring Kuwait]], a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory.<ref name="gulf war pbs">

</ref> An estimated 140,000 [[Iraqi troops]] quickly took control of [[Kuwait City]] and moved on to the [[Saudi Arabia]]/Kuwait border.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the [[US Central Command]], headed by General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], because of its important petroleum reserves.

=====US and world reaction=====
[[Image:Cheney meeting with Prince Sultan.jpg|thumb|left|Cheney meets with [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan, Minister of Defence and Aviation]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] to discuss how to handle the [[invasion of Kuwait]]]]
Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale US military operation. According to General [[Colin Powell]], Cheney "had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions."<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where [[King Fahd]] requested US military assistance. The [[United Nations]] took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the [[UN Security Council]] authorized "all means necessary" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/> By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Other nations, including [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Canada, France, Italy, [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/>

=====Military action=====
The first phase of [[Operation Desert Storm]], which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraq's forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]]. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> He flew with Powell to the region (specifically [[Riyadh]]) to review and finalize the ground war plans.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/>

After an air offensive of more than five weeks, the UN coalition launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective<U+2014>expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait<U+2014>had been met on February 27.<ref name="gulf war military">

=====Aftermath=====
A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/><ref name="gulf war military"/> Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>  There was subsequent debate about whether the UN coalition should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.<ref>

He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.<ref name=cfr/> From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[Halliburton]], a [[Fortune 500]] company and market leader in the energy sector. 

Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among [[Wall Street]] analysts; a 1998 merger between Halliburton and [[Dresser Industries]] attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.<ref>

A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming.  This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice-President.

Cheney campaigned against [[Al Gore]]'s running mate, [[Joseph Lieberman]], in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.<ref>

After his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator [[John McCain]].<ref>

The article characterized the Cheney doctrine as "cast iron strength at all times<U+2014>never apologize, never explain" while Bush moved towards a conciliatory approach.

On July 11, 2009 CIA Director [[Leon E. Panetta]] told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Dick Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the [[Enhanced Interrogation Techniques|CIA interrogation program]] and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.<ref>{{cite news|author=Scott Shane|title=Cheney Is Linked to Concealment of C.I.A.

===Criticism of President Obama===
Cheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. On Dec. 29, 2009, four days after the [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States]], Cheney criticized Obama: "[We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency<U+2014>social transformation<U+2014>the restructuring of American society."<ref name=politico_dec2009>
