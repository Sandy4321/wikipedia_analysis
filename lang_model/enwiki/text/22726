===Early life & Ministry===
Hayes was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to Patrick Nagle and Mary Jane (O<U+2019>Donnell) Hayes.  He received his high school and college education at Holy Ghost College (now [[Duquesne University]]).  He played on the school football, basketball and baseball teams while in college, and in the summer on a semi-pro baseball team.    He studied for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College and the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|University of the Congregation of Propagation of the Faith]] in [[Rome]].

While in Pittsburgh, Hayes continued to look after the financial and other business matters relating to the college.  He also assisted Bishop Boyle in his episcopal responsibilities.<ref>Schmidt, 220</ref>

===Bishop of Davenport===
On November 16, 1944 Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Hayes as fifth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport.<ref name=Catholic/>   He was installed in [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] on January 11, 1945.

Kenedy & Sons|location=New Providence, New Jersey|page=362}}</ref>

During his 22 years in Davenport there was an expansion to school facilities across the diocese.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson |first= W.F|title=New Catholic Encyclopedia|volume=vol. 4|year=1967|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=656}}</ref>  Muscatine Central Catholic High School (now closed) in [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]] (1953), [[Notre Dame High School (Burlington, Iowa)|Notre Dame High School]] in [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]] (1957), [[Regina High School (Iowa)|Regina High School]] in [[Iowa City]] (1958), [[Assumption High School (Davenport, Iowa)|Assumption High School]] in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] (1958), Aquinas High School (now  [[Holy Trinity High School (Fort Madison, Iowa)|Holy Trinity]]) in [[Fort Madison, Iowa|Fort Madison]] (1959), Walsh High School (now closed) in [[Ottumwa]] (1960), and Cardinal Stritch High School (now closed) in [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]] (1965) were all established.<ref>Schmidt, 258-9</ref>  Many of these communities had been served by parish high schools, while Davenport's new high school was a merger of [[St. Ambrose University|St Ambrose]] and [[Immaculate Conception Academy (Davenport, Iowa)|Immaculate Conception]] academies.  New buildings were also added at [[Saint Ambrose University|St. Ambrose]], [[Marycrest International University|Marycrest]] and Mt. St. Claire Colleges.  The four bishops of Iowa built Mt. St. Bernard<U+2019>s Seminary in Dubuque.

Enrollment in the Catholic Schools reached their highest enrollments during Bishop Hayes<U+2019> episcopate.   Elementary school enrollment reached its highest mark in 1960 at 12, 074.  The high schools reached their highest mark in 1965 with 4,129 students.<ref>Schmidt, 316</ref>

There was also an expansion in facilities to care for the elderly.  The Kahl Home for the Aged and Infirmed in Davenport, which is operated by the [[Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm|Carmelite Sisters]], built a new building.  New facilities were established in Burlington (St. Francis) and Clinton (Alverno).

The church<U+2019>s social teachings was a theme that ran throughout Bishop Hayes<U+2019> episcopacy.  A four-day conference sponsored by the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] was held in Davenport in 1949.  It focused on the themes of industry, education and rural life.  From 1954<U+2013>1956 Bishop Hayes served as the president of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference.<ref>Schmidt, 224</ref>    Their national convention was held in Davenport in 1956. The Papal Volunteers of Latin America were established in the diocese in February 1961 in response to a plea from [[Pope John XXIII]].  Rev. Luis Colonnese, who would later become Director of the Latin American Bureau of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|United States Catholic Conference]],  was put in charge.   Fundraising was led by the [[Knights of Columbus]], and [[Johnny Lujack]], who was responsible for a special gift drive.  For the most part, missionaries from the diocese went to [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]] or to [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]].<ref>Schmidt, 244</ref>  The [[Pacem in Terris Award|Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award]] was created by the Davenport Catholic Interracial Council in 1964 in commemoration of the 1963 encyclical ''[[Pacem in terris]]'' by Pope John.

Bishop Hayes attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  He was the oldest bishop from the United States at the council.<ref name="Schmidt, 241">Schmidt, 241</ref>    The ''Catholic Messenger'' published the decrees of the council in their entirety in the paper.   Liturgical renewal was already underway in the diocese under the direction of the Rev. [[Cletus Madsen]].  In the 1950s he had been working on reforming liturgical music in the diocese by advocating the replacement of the more sentimental devotional music with liturgical music and participation by the laity.  He also advocated teaching children [[Gregorian Chant]] so as to lead the congregation in singing.<ref>Schmidt, 228-9</ref>    Work had also begun, under Bishop Hayes<U+2019> direction, to establish a Priests<U+2019> Senate.

===Later life & Death===
On his 82nd birthday, September 21, 1966, Bishop Hayes submitted his resignation to the [[Holy See]] in compliance with the Vatican II decree [[Christus Dominus]].  His resignation was the first such resignation accepted by [[Pope Paul VI]].<ref name="Schmidt, 241"/> On October 20, 1966 he was named Titular Bishop of [[Naraggara]] and Bishop Emeritus of Davenport.  He retired to the Kahl Home.<ref name="Schmidt, 241"/> He died there in 1970 at the age of 85.  Following his funeral in Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bishop Hayes was laid to rest in the Bishop's Circle of [[Mount Calvary Cemetery (Davenport, Iowa)|Mt. Calvary Cemetery]].
