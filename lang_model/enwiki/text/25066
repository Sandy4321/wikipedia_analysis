'''Radio broadcasting''' is a one-way sound broadcasting service, transmitted over [[radio waves]] (a form of electromagnetic radiation) from a transmitter to a receiving antenna and intended to reach a wide audience. Stations can be linked in radio networks to broadcast common programming, either in syndication or simulcast or both.  Audio broadcasting also can be done via [[cable radio|cable FM]], local wire [[television network|networks]], [[satellite]] and the [[Internet]].

==History==
{{main|History of radio}}
The earliest [[radio]] stations were simply [[radiotelegraphy]] systems and did not carry audio. The first claimed audio transmission that could be termed a ''broadcast'' occurred on [[Christmas Eve]] in 1906, and was made by [[Reginald Fessenden]]. Whether this broadcast actually took place is disputed.<ref>Fessenden <U+2014> The Next Chapter [http://www.rwonline.com/article/72046 RWonline.com]</ref> While many early experimenters attempted to create systems similar to [[radiotelephone]] devices where only two parties were meant to communicate, there were others who intended to transmit to larger audiences. [[Charles Herrold]] started broadcasting in [[California]] in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year. (Herrold's station eventually became [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]]).

For the next decade, radio tinkerers had to build their own radio receivers. In The Hague, the Netherlands, PCGG started broadcasting on November 6, 1919. Dr. [[Frank Conrad]] began broadcasting from his [[Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania]] garage with the call letters [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]]. KDKA's first commercial broadcast was made from Saxonburg, Butler County, PA on November 2, 1920. Later, the equipment was moved to the top of an office building in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] and purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]].  KDKA of Pittsburgh, under Westinghouse's ownership, started broadcasting as the first licensed "commercial" radio station on November 2, 1920.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Baudino | first = Joseph E | coauthors = John M. Kittross | title = Broadcasting's Oldest Stations: An Examination of Four Claimants | journal = Journal of Broadcasting | pages = pp. 61<U+2013>82 | date = Winter, 1977 | url = http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/kdka.html | accessdate = 2008-08-08 }}</ref>  The commercial designation came from the type of license; [[advertising|advertisement]]s did not air until years later. The first broadcast in USA was the results of the [[U.S. presidential election, 1920]]. The [[Montreal]] station that became [[CFCF-AM|CFCF]] began program broadcasts on May 20, 1920, and the [[Detroit]] station that became [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] began program broadcasts beginning on August 20, 1920, although neither held a license at the time. 

Radio Argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the Teatro Coliseo in [[Buenos Aires]] on August 27, 1920, making its own priority claim. The station got its license on November 19, 1923. The delay was due to the lack of official Argentine licensing procedures before that date. This station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades.<ref>Atgelt, Carlos A.

==Types==
[[Image:Radio transmition diagram en.png|thumb|right|300px|Transmission and reception schematic]]
Broadcasting by radio takes several forms. These include [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations. There are several subtypes, namely [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]], [[Public broadcasting|public]] and [[nonprofit]] varieties as well as student-run  [[campus radio]] stations and [[hospital radio]] stations can be found throughout the world.

Many stations that broadcast on [[shortwave]] bands using AM technology that can be received over thousands of miles (especially at night). For example, the [[BBC]] has a full schedule transmitted via shortwave to Africa and Asia. These broadcasts are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and solar activity. 

[[Arbitron]], the United States based company that reports on radio audiences, defines a "radio station" as a government-licensed AM or FM station; an HD Radio (primary or multicast) station; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station; one of the satellite radio channels from [[XM Satellite Radio]] or [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]; or, potentially, a station that is not government licensed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/newbay/rw_20081008/index.php|title=What is a Radio Station?|work=[[Radio World]]|page=6}}</ref>


===Shortwave===
See [[Shortwave]] for the differences between shortwave, [[medium wave]] and [[long wave]] spectra. Used largely for national broadcasters, international propaganda, or religious organizations.

===AM===
[[Image:2006AM broadcast stations.PNG|thumb|right|AM radio broadcast stations in 2006]]
AM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to [[amplitude modulation]], a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted.

The medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the [[long wave]] band.  In response to the growing popularity of [[FM radio]] stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some [[North America]]n stations began broadcasting in [[AM stereo]], though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold.

One of the advantages of AM is that its signal can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed; building an unpowered [[crystal radio|crystal radio receiver]] is a common childhood project.   

AM broadcasts occur on [[North America]]n airwaves in the [[medium wave]] frequency range of 530 to 1700 [[Hertz|kHz]] (known as the "standard broadcast band").  The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine [[channel (communications)|channels]] from 1620 to 1700&nbsp;kHz.  Channels are spaced every 10&nbsp;kHz in the [[Americas]], and generally every 9&nbsp;kHz everywhere else.

The signal is subject to interference from electrical storms ([[lightning]]) and other [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]]. 

AM transmissions cannot be ionospherically [[radio propagation|propagated]] during the day due to strong absorption in the D-layer of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called [[clear-channel station]]s. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. This is not to be confused with [[Clear Channel Communications]], merely a brand name, which currently owns many U.S. radio stations on both the AM and FM bands. During the night, this absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections. However, fading of the signal can be severe at night. 

AM radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15&nbsp;kHz (now limited to 10&nbsp;kHz in the US due to FCC rules designed to reduce interference), but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5&nbsp;kHz or less. At the time that AM broadcasting began in the 1920s, this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones, 78 rpm recordings, and loudspeakers. The fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably, but the receivers did not. Reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference. AM stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area. This prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other. [[Bob Carver]] created an AM stereo tuner employing [[notch filter]]ing that demonstrated that an AM broadcast can meet or exceed the 15&nbsp;kHz baseband bandwidth allocted to [[FM]] stations without objectionable interference.  After several years, the tuner was discontinued. Bob Carver had left the company and the Carver Corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely. AM stereo broadcasts declined with the advent of [[HD Radio]].

===FM===
[[Image:2006FM broadcast stations.PNG|thumb|right|[[FM radio]] broadcast stations in 2006]]
FM refers to [[frequency modulation]], and occurs on [[VHF]] airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 [[Megahertz|MHz]] everywhere (except [[Japan]] and [[Russia]]).  Japan uses the 76 to 90&nbsp;MHz band. Russia has two bands widely used by the Soviet Union, 65.9 to 74&nbsp;MHz and 87.5 to 108&nbsp;MHz worldwide standard. FM stations are much more popular since higher sound fidelity and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] broadcasting became common in this format.

FM radio was invented by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Edwin H. Armstrong]] in the 1930s for the specific purpose of overcoming the interference problem of AM radio, to which it is relatively immune. At the same time, greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart. Instead of 10&nbsp;kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US, FM channels are 200&nbsp;kHz (0.2&nbsp;MHz) apart.  In other countries greater spacing is sometimes mandatory, such as in New Zealand, which uses 700&nbsp;kHz spacing (previously 800&nbsp;kHz). The improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s, but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband FM.

Bandwidth of 200 [[kHz]] is not needed to accommodate an audio signal &mdash; 20&nbsp;kHz to 30&nbsp;kHz is all that is necessary for a narrowband FM signal.  The 200&nbsp;kHz bandwidth allowed room for <U+00B1>75&nbsp;kHz signal deviation from the assigned frequency, plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference.  The larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15&nbsp;kHz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38&nbsp;kHz stereo "subcarrier"<U+2014>a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal. Additional unused capacity is used by some broadcasters to transmit utility functions such as background [[music]] for public areas, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] auxiliary signals, or financial market data.

The AM radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - by a factor of approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter, thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime.

The original FM radio service in the U.S. was the Yankee Network, located in [[New England]].<ref>Halper, Donna L. [http://www.bostonradio.org/essays/shepard-fm.html "John Shepard's FM Stations<U+2014>America's first FM network."] Boston Radio Archives (BostonRadio.org).</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonradio.org/yankee-36.html "The Yankee Network in 1936."] Boston Radio Archives (BostonRadio.org)</ref><ref>Miller, Jeff. [http://jeff560.tripod.com/chronofm.html "FM Broadcasting Chronology."] Rev. 2005-12-27.</ref> Regular FM broadcasting began in 1939, but did not pose a significant threat to the AM broadcasting industry. It required purchase of a special receiver. The frequencies used, 42 to 50&nbsp;MHz, were not those used today. The change to the current frequencies, 88 to 108&nbsp;MHz, began after the end of [[World War II]], and was to some extent imposed by AM broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat.

FM radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a commercial venture it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts' medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station ("[[simulcasting]]"). The FCC limited this practice in the 1970s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and FM tuners, FM became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments.

===Pirate radio===
{{Main|Pirate radio}}
Pirate radio is radio broadcasting not sanctioned by the regulations of the originating country. Pirate radio may be a commercial enterprise supported by advertising targeted to listeners in the reception area, or may be privately run for entertainment, or political reasons, sometimes on a very small scale covering only a few city blocks. 

===Terrestrial digital radio ===
[[Digital radio]] broadcasting has emerged, first in [[Europe]] (the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1995 and [[Germany]] in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa and many other countries worldwide. The most simple system is named DAB Digital Radio, for [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]], and uses the  [[public domain]] [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|EUREKA 147]] (Band III) system. DAB is used mainly in the UK and South Africa. Germany and Holland use the DAB and DAB+ systems, and France use the L-Band system of DAB Digital Radio.

In the United States digital radio isn't used in the same way as Europe and South Africa.  Instead, the [[IBOC]] system is named [[HD Radio]] and owned by a [[consortium]] of private companies that is called [[iBiquity]]. An international non-profit consortium [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), has introduced the [[public domain]] DRM system.

===Satellite===
{{Expand-section|date=November 2008}}
[[Satellite radio]] broadcasters are slowly emerging, but the enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters, and restrictions on available [[radio spectrum]] licenses has restricted growth of this market. In the USA and [[Canada]], just two services, [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] exist.  Both XM and Sirius are owned by [[Sirius XM Radio]], which was formed by the merger of XM and Sirius on July 29, [[2008 in radio|2008]], whereas in [[Canada]], [[XM Radio Canada]] and [[Sirius Canada]] remain separate companies.

==Program formats==
{{main|Radio format}}
Radio program formats differ by country, regulation and markets. For instance, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] designates the 88&ndash;92 megahertz band in the U.S. for non-profit or educational programming, with advertising prohibited.

In addition, formats change in popularity as time passes and technology improves. Early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time, known as ''live'' broadcasting. As technology for [[sound recording]] improved, an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material. A current trend is the [[automation]] of radio stations. Some stations now operate without direct human intervention by using entirely pre-recorded material sequenced by [[computer]] control.
