'''''Omphalotus nidiformis''''', or '''ghost fungus''', is a gilled [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] most notable for its [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. It is known to occur primarily in southern Australia and [[Tasmania]], but was reported from India in 2012. The fan- or funnel-shaped [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are up to {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, with cream-coloured [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] overlain with shades of orange, brown, purple, or bluish-black. The white or cream [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] run down the length of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], which is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and tapers in thickness to the base. The fungus is both [[saprotroph]]ic and [[parasitism|parasitic]], and its fruit bodies are generally found growing in overlapping clusters on a wide variety of dead or dying trees.

First [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1844, the fungus has been known by several names in its [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] history. It was assigned its current name by [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1994. Its scientific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''nidus'' "nest", hence 'nest shaped'. Similar in appearance to the common edible [[oyster mushroom]], it was previously considered a member of the same genus, ''[[Pleurotus]]'',  and described under the former names ''Pleurotus nidiformis'' or ''Pleurotus lampas''. Unlike oyster mushrooms, ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]]; while not lethal, its consumption leads to severe [[cramp]]s and vomiting. The toxic properties of the mushroom are attributed to compounds called [[illudin]]s. ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' is one of several species in the [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'', all of which have bioluminescent properties.

== Taxonomy and naming ==

The ghost fungus was initially described in 1844 by English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] as ''Agaricus nidiformis''. Berkeley felt it was related to ''Agaricus ostreatus'' (now ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'') but remarked it was a "far more magnificent species".<ref name="Berkeley 1844"/> Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] in 1841 on ''[[Banksia]]'' wood along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]. He wrote "when this fungus was laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light, enabling us to read the words around it; and it continued to do so for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up."<ref name="Drummond 1841"/> More material collected from near the base of a "sickly but living" ''[[Grevillea drummondii]]'' was named as ''Agaricus lampas'' by Berkeley. He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species.<ref name="Berkeley 1845"/> [[Tasmania]]n botanist [[Ronald Campbell Gunn]] collected material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less [[decurrent]] gills and a shorter stipe, and named it ''Agaricus phosphorus'' in 1848.<ref name="Berkeley 1848"/> Italian mycologist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] placed all three named taxa in the genus ''[[Pleurotus]]'' in 1887.<ref name="Saccardo 1887"/> These names have been [[synonym (biology)|synonymised]] with ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'', although the name ''Pleurotus lampas'' persisted in some texts,<ref name="rbg"/> including the 1934<U+2013>35 [[monograph]] of Australian fungi by [[John Burton Cleland]].<ref name="Miller 1994"/> In reviewing the published literature, Victorian botanical liaison officer [[James Hamlyn Willis|Jim Willis]] was aware of [[Rolf Singer]]'s placing of ''Pleurotus olearius'' into the genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'', but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across, even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in ''Pleurotus''.<ref name="Willis 1967"/> Investigating the species in 1994, [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus ''Omphalotus'' with other bioluminescent mushrooms.<ref name="Miller 1994"/>

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''nidiformis'' is derived from the [[Latin]] terms ''n<U+012B>dus'' 'nest' and ''forma'' 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'.<ref name="Simpson 1979"/> ''Lampas'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''lampas''/<U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C2> 'torch'.<ref name="Liddell 1980"/>  [[Common name]]s include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus.<ref name="Allen"/> Drummond reported that the local [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aborigine]]s were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out ''chinga'', a local word for spirit;<ref name="Cleland l976"/> Drummond himself likened it to a [[will-o'-the-wisp]].<ref name="Drummond 1841"/> Likewise on the [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook Plateau]] in southeastern Queensland, the local [[History_of_Gold_Coast,_Queensland#Yugambeh_Aboriginal_History_in_the_Gold_Coast_Region|Kombumerri]] people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.<ref name="Maguire 2011"/>

Several ''Omphalotus'' species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olearius|O.&nbsp;olearius]]'') and the ''tsukiyotake'' (''[[Omphalotus japonicus|O.&nbsp;japonicus]]'' (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as ''Lampteromyces japonicus'' (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olivascens|O.&nbsp;olivascens]]''), which is abundant in Southern and Central [[California]].<ref name="Kirchmair 2004"/> Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.<ref name="Miller 1994"/>

Laboratory breeding experiments with it and other ''Omphalotus'' species have revealed a low level of compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time.<ref name="Peterson 1997a"/> It is particularly poorly compatible with ''[[Omphalotus illudens|O.&nbsp;illudens]]'', the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the [[Pennsylvanian|Late Carboniferous]] separation of [[Gondwana]] from [[Laurasia]] but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.<ref name="Hughes 1997"/>

=== Variation ===
Miller noted there appeared to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent<U+2014>the brightest of any fungus in the genus<U+2014>with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all [[Mating in fungi|interbred]] freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variants of a single [[taxon]].<ref name="Miller 1994"/><!-- cites para -->

== Description ==
[[File:Omphalotus nidiformis-darker.JPG|thumb|left|Darker-coloured fruit bodies, Botany, Sydney]]
The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood.<ref name="Marks 1982"/> They may be first seen at night as a pale whitish glow at the base of trees in a eucalypt forest.<ref name="Cleland l976"/> The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is very variable in colour, sometimes cream though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish, purple or even bluish-black shades. The margin is lighter, generally cream, though brown forms have tan or brown edges. The centre generally has several darker shades,<ref name="Miller 1994"/> and younger specimens are often darker. Growing up to {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance with inrolled margins. The cream-white [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are decurrent and often drip with moisture.<ref name ="fungimap"/> They are up to {{convert|13|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} deep, somewhat distant to closely spaced, and have a smooth edge until they erode in maturity.<ref name="Bougher 1998"/> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] may be central to lateral in its attachment to the cap and is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and tapers to the base. The thin [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is generally creamy white in colour,<ref name ="fungimap"/> but can have reddish tones near the base of the stipe. There is no distinctive smell or taste. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="Bougher 1998"/>

The [[spore]]s are roughly elliptical, or, less commonly, somewhat spherical, and have dimensions of 7.5<U+2013>9.5 by 5<U+2013>7&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+03BC>m]]. They are thin-walled, [[amyloid (mycology)|inamyloid]], and have a smooth surface. Each features a prominent [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendage]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32<U+2013>42 by 6<U+2013>9&nbsp;<U+03BC>m, are club-shaped and four-spored, with [[sterigmata]] up to 7&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long. Cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15<U+2013>40 by 3<U+2013>6&nbsp;<U+03BC>m; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill faces) are present. The [[cap cuticle]] comprises a thin layer of 3<U+2013>6&nbsp;<U+03BC>m-wide [[hypha]]e that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Bougher 1998"/>

The bioluminescence of ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions when the viewer's eyes develop [[night vision]]. The gills are the most luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although the intensity of the luminescence is variable,<ref name="Bougher 1998"/> [[William Henry Harvey]] once reported that it was bright enough to read a watch face by.<ref name="Ducker l995"/> It is not known if the [[mycelium]] is also luminescent.<ref name="Desjardin 2008"/>

''Omphalotus nidiformis'' may be confused with the [[edible mushroom|edible]] brown oyster mushroom (''[[Pleurotus australis]]''), which is brown and does not glow in the dark.<ref name ="fungimap"/> Confusion with another edible lookalike, ''Pleurotus ostreatus'', common in the Northern Hemisphere and cultivated commercially, has been the source for at least one case of poisoning reported in the literature.<ref name="Cole 1994"/>

== Distribution and habitat ==

''Omphalotus nidiformis'' occurs in two disjunct ranges in southern Australia. In southwest [[Western Australia]], it has been recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance.<ref name="FloraBase"/> In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern [[South Australia]], where it has been recorded from [[Mount Gambier]] and the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] around Adelaide, the [[Murraylands]], and north to the [[Flinders Ranges]] and from [[Lincoln National Park]] at the apex of the [[Eyre Peninsula]],<ref name="fungimap15"/> through to southeast [[Queensland]]. It also occurs in Tasmania.<ref name="fungimap"/> It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests,<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/> in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of [[Wyperfeld National Park]] and subalpine areas of [[Mount Buffalo National Park]],<ref name="Willis 1967"/> as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood.<ref name="fungimap"/> Outside Australia, it has been recorded from [[Norfolk Island]].<ref name="landcarenz"/> In 2012, it was reported for the first time from [[Kerala]], India, where it was discovered growing on a [[Cocos nucifera|coconut tree]] stump.<ref name="Shirmila Jose 2012"/>

== Ecology ==
[[File:Omphalotus nidiformis Sylvan Grove 3 email.jpg|thumb|right|Fruit bodies growing out of deep fissures in the bark of a dead ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' tree,<br> Sylvan Grove Native Garden, [[Picnic Point, New South Wales]]]]
A [[Saprotroph|saprobe]] or [[Parasitism|parasite]], ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' is nonspecific in its needs and is compatible with a wide variety of [[host (biology)|hosts]]. It has been recorded on native ''Banksia'' (including ''[[Banksia attenuata|B.&nbsp;attenuata]]'' and ''[[Banksia menziesii|B.&nbsp;menziesii]]''<ref name="Miller 1994"/>), ''[[Hakea]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' and various [[Myrtaceae]],<ref name="Bougher 1998"/> including ''[[Agonis flexuosa]]'' and ''[[Melaleuca]]'' species,<ref name="Miller 1994"/> and  especially ''[[Eucalyptus]]'',<ref name="Willis 1967"/> as well as  ''[[Nothofagus]]'',<ref name="Williams 1997"/> ''[[Casuarina]]'' species and ''[[Allocasuarina fraseriana]]'',<ref name="Miller 1994"/> and even [[introduced species|introduced]] trees such as ''[[Pinus]]'' or ''[[Platanus]]'' species.<ref name="Bougher 1998"/> It plays an important role in breaking down wood and [[nutrient cycle|recycling nutrients]] into the soil.<ref name="WAH"/>

''Omphalotus'' species cause a [[Wood-decay fungus#white rot|white rot]] by breaking down [[lignin]] in their tree hosts.<ref name="Kirchmair 2004"/> The fungus infiltrates the [[wood#Heartwood_and_sapwood|heartwood]] of the tree via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or [[mistletoe]], or by mechanical damage from logging.<ref name="Williams 1997"/> ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (''[[Corymbia calophylla]]'') in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata|C.&nbsp;maculata]]'') and messmate (''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]'') in [[New South Wales]], and in blackbutt (''[[Eucalyptus pilularis|E.&nbsp;pilularis]]''), Sydney blue gum (''[[Eucalyptus saligna|E.&nbsp;saligna]]''), red stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|E.&nbsp;macrorhyncha]]'') and  Forth River peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E.&nbsp;radiata]]'') in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref name="Keane 2000"/>

The [[US Department of Agriculture]] considers there is a moderate to high risk of  ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' being accidentally introduced to the United States in untreated eucalyptus woodchips from Australia.<ref name="Kliejunas 2003"/> Nearly a century ago, Cleland and [[Edwin Cheel]] suggested that even though the fungus was of "no great economic importance", "it would be advisable to destroy it by burning wherever found."<ref name="Burton 1916"/>

Several species of ''[[Tapeigaster]]'' flies have been collected from the fruit bodies, including ''[[Tapeigaster cinctipes|T.&nbsp;cinctipes]]'', ''[[Tapeigaster annulipes|T.&nbsp;annulipes]]'', and ''[[Tapeigaster nigricornis|T.&nbsp;nigricornis]]''; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear its young.<ref name="McAlpine 1982"/> Fruit bodies in [[Springbrook National Park]] have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket (''[[Papuastus]]'' spp.) and thorny cricket), as well as [[Hedleyella falconeri|giant rainforest snails]] (''Hedleyella falconeri'') and [[red triangle slug]]s (''Triboniophorus graeffei''), which voraciously consume the fungus.<ref name="Maguire 2011"/><ref name="Young 1996"/>

== Biochemistry ==

''Omphalotus nidiformis'' is not edible. Although reputedly mild tasting,<ref name="Bougher 1998"/> eating it will result in vomiting which generally occurs 30 minutes to two hours after consumption and lasts for several hours. There is no diarrhea and patients recover without lasting ill-effects.<ref name="Southcott 1974"/> Its toxicity was first mentioned by [[Anthony M. Young]] in his 1982 guidebook ''Common Australian Fungi''.<ref name="Miller 1994"/> The toxic ingredient of many species of ''Omphalotus'' is a [[sesquiterpene]] compound known as [[illudin]] S.<ref name="Benjamin 1995"/> This, along with illudin M and a co-metabolite illudosin, have been identified in ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis''.<ref name="Burgess 1999"/><ref name="Kirchmair 1999"/> The two illudins are common to the genus ''Omphalotus'' and not found in any other basidiomycete mushroom.<ref name="Kirchmair 1999"/> An additional three compounds unique to ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' have been identified and named illudins F, G and H.<ref name="Burgess 1999b"/>

Extracts of several species of Australian mushrooms have been investigated for [[cytotoxicity]] to cancer cells; material from ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' showed marked toxicity to gastric (AGS), colon (HT-29) and estrogen-independent breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) [[cell line]]s.<ref name="Beattie 2011"/> [[Irofulven]], a compound derived from illuden S, is undergoing [[phase II clinical trial]]s as a possible [[chemotherapy|therapy]] for various types of cancers.<ref name="Anke 2009"/> Fruit body extracts have [[antioxidant]] and [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] properties, which may be attributed to the presence of [[natural phenol|phenolic]] compounds.<ref name="Shirmila Jose 2012"/>
