'''Unterseeboot 28''' (also known as '''U-28''') was a [[Type VII U-boat|Type VIIA submarine]] of the [[Kriegsmarine]].

Her keel was laid down [[December 2]] [[1935]], by [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. She was [[ship launching|launched]] on [[July 14]] [[1936]], and [[ship naming and commissioning|commissioned]] into the Kriegsmarine on [[September 12]] [[1936]], with [[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]] [[Wilhelm Ambrosius]] in command. Ambrosius was succeeded by nine other commanding officers over the next eight years.

The first war patrol of ''U-28'' took place from [[August 19]] 1939 to [[September 29]] 1939 under the command of [[G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke]]. On [[September 14]] while patrolling around the mouth of [[St George's Channel]], ''U-28'' sunk a 5,000&nbsp;ton freighter which was her only sinking of the patrol.

''U-28'''s second war patrol took place from [[November 8]] 1939 to [[December 12]] 1939 again under the command of G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke. For this patrol ''U-28'' was instructed to lay a minefield near the port city of [[Swansea]]. En route to [[Bristol]] ''U-28'' sank two ships; the 5,000&nbsp;ton Dutch tanker [[MV Sliedrecht]] and the 5,100&nbsp;ton British freighter [[SS Royston Grange]]. ''U-28'' then laid its minefield near Swansea and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, 60 days after it was laid it sank the 9,600&nbsp;ton British freighter [[SS Protesilaus]].

''U-28'''s third war patrol took place from [[February 18]] 1940 to [[March 25]] 1940 again commanded by G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke. On yet another mine laying mission, ''U-28'' was instructed to lay mines off a British Naval Base at [[Portsmouth]]. After ''U-28'' laid the minefield she went on to sink two ships for 11,200&nbsp;tons.

''U-28'''s fourth war patrol was aborted while still in the [[North Sea]] due to mechanical problems.

''U-28'''s fifth war patrol took place from [[June 8]] 1940 to [[July 7]] 1940 again commanded by G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke. On this patrol ''U-28'' was sent to the [[Western Approaches]] and turned in an average performance of three ships for 10,300&nbsp;tons.

''U-28'''s sixth war patrol took place from [[August 11]] 1940 to [[September 17]] 1940 and was one of G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke most productive. In August, ''U-28'' sunk two ships for 5,500&nbsp;tons. On [[September 10]] ''U-28'' found and tracked an Outbound 210. In the darkness of early morning on [[September 11]], ''U-28'' attacked the convey and claimed to have sunk two large freighter's (13,000&nbsp;tons each) and damage to a 10,000&nbsp;ton tanker bringing his total for the patrol to five ships for 30,000&nbsp;tons. However during the postwar analysis he was only credited with sinking a 2,000&nbsp;ton Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700&nbsp;ton British freighter; which combined with his earlier sinkings brought his total to 4 ships for 9,945&nbsp;tons. On his return to [[Lorient]] he was awarded a [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] for his work.

''U-28'''s seventh and final war patrol took her from Lorient back to Germany; because of the heavy seas and foul weather ''U-28'' sank only half a ship for 2,694&nbsp;tons. (U-28 and [[Unterseeboot 31|U-31]] shared credit for the sinking of the [[SS Matina]]). On [[November 15]] 1940 ''U-28'' returned to Germany and was turned over to the training command. G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke went on to command [[Unterseeboot 125|U-125]].

''U-28'' conducted seven patrols, sinking 13 ships totaling 56,272&nbsp;tons and damaging two others totaling 10,067&nbsp;tons.

In comparison to the other U-boats that operated during this time span ''U-28'' was a below average performer.

==Fate==
''U-28'' sank by accident on [[March 17]] [[1944]], at the U-boat pier in [[Neustadt in Holstein|Neustadt]]. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed to note the position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March [[1944]] but was stricken on [[August 4]], [[1944]]. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.
