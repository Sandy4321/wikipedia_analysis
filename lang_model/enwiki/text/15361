The '''naked [[Blesmol|mole rat]]''' (''Heterocephalus glaber''), also known as the '''sand puppy''' or '''desert mole rat''', is a burrowing [[rodent]] native to parts of [[East Africa]] and the only [[species]] currently classified in the [[genus]] '''''Heterocephalus'''''. It is one of only two known [[eusociality|eusocial]] [[mammal]]s (the other being the [[Damaraland Mole Rat|Damaraland mole rat]]) and has a highly unusual set of physical traits that enables it to thrive in a harsh, underground environment, including a lack of pain sensation in its skin and a very low [[metabolism]].

==Physical description==
Typical individuals are {{convert|8|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|30|to|35|g|oz}}. Queens are larger and may weigh well over {{convert|50|g|oz}}, the largest reaching {{convert|80|g|oz}}. They are well-adapted to their underground existence. Their eyes are quite small, and their visual acuity is poor. Their legs are thin and short; however, they are highly adept at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig, and their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin.

The naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of [[oxygen]] within the tunnels that are its habitat: its [[lung]]s are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake.  It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about 2/3 that of a mouse of the same size, thus using oxygen minimally.  In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, its metabolic rate can be reduced by up to 25 percent.

The naked mole rat cannot generally regulate its body temperature in typical mammalian fashion, ''[[homeostasis]]''. They can overcome this via behavioral means to keep a constant temperature as when cold, naked mole rats huddle together or bask in the shallow, more sun-warmed parts of their burrow systems. Conversely, when they get too hot, they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of their tunnel system. 

The skin of naked mole rats lacks a key [[neurotransmitter]] called [[substance P]] that is responsible in [[mammal]]s for sending [[pain]] signals to the [[central nervous system]]. When naked mole rats are exposed to acid or [[capsaicin]], they feel no pain. When injected with Substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with the acids. This is proposed to be adaptation to the animal living in high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Park |first=Thomas J. |coauthors=et ''al.'' |year=2008 |pmc=2214810|title=Selective Inflammatory Pain Insensitivity in the African Naked Mole-Rat (''Heterocephalus glaber'') |journal=[[PLoS Biology]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e13 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060013 |pmid=18232734}}</ref>

Naked mole rats' substance P deficiency has also been tied to their lack of the histamine-induced itching and scratching behavior typical to rodents.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Absence of histamine-induced itch in the African naked mole-rat and "rescue" by Substance P.|url=http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/29|doi=10.1186/1744-8069-6-29|pmc=2886013|pmid=20497578|year=2010|last1=St John Smith|first1=E|last2=Blass|first2=GR|last3=Lewin|first3=GR|last4=Park|first4=TJ|volume=6|issue=1|pages=29|journal=Molecular pain}}</ref>

==Ecology and behavior==
===Distribution and habitat===
The naked mole rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, predominantly southern [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], and [[Somalia]].

Clusters averaging 75 to 80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts.  The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length.<ref name=selfish_gene>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|year=1976|title=The Selfish Gene|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-286092-5}}</ref>

=== Roles ===
There is dimorphism between the queen, her breeding males, and two kind of workers. They have a complex social structure in which only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony function as workers. The queen and breeding males are able to breed at one year of age. Workers are sterile, with the smaller focusing on gathering food and maintaining the nest, while larger workers are more reactive in case of attack.

The naked mole rat is one of the two species of mammals that exhibit [[eusociality]]. This eusocial social structure, similar to that found in [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s, and some [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s, is very rare among [[mammal]]s. The [[Damaraland Mole Rat]] (''Cryptomys damarensis'') is the only other eusocial mammal currently known.

;Queen and Gestation
The relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years, others females are temporally sterile. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors.

Gestation is about 70 days. A litter typically ranges from three to twelve pups, but may be as large as 28. The average litter size is 11.<ref>[http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug99/rat_mamm.hrs.html ''Counting mole-rat mammaries and hungry pups, biologists explain why naked rodents break the rules''], Roger Segelken, Cornell News, August 9, 1999</ref> In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days.<ref name=ross>{{cite book |author=Ross Piper |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2007 |isbn=0-313-33922-8 }}</ref>  The young are born blind and weigh about {{convert|2|g|oz}}. The queen nurses them for the first month; after which the other members of the colony feed them [[feces]] until they are old enough to eat solid food.

;Workers
Smaller workers focus on acquiring food and maintaining tunnels, while the larger workers are more reactive in case of attacks.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10088502.stm|title=Meet the 'sabre-toothed sausage'|author=Rebecca Morelle|publisher=BBC News|date=2010, May 5th}}</ref> As in certain bee species, the workers are divided along a continuum of different worker-caste behaviors instead of discrete groups.<ref name=selfish_gene/> Some function primarily as tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, and some primarily as [[soldier]]s, protecting the group from outside [[predation|predators]]. Workers are sterile when there is no new reproductive role to fill. 

;Colonies
Colonies range in size from 20 to 300 individuals, averaging 75 individuals.<ref>[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2002/3/nakedmolerats.cfm ''The Naked Truth About Mole-Rats''], Jill Locantore, Smithsonian Zoogoer, May/June 2002</ref>

===Diet===
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|A captive naked mole rat eating]]
Naked mole rats feed primarily on very large [[tuber]]s (weighing as much as 1000 times the body weight of a typical mole rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations, but also eat their own feces ([[coprophagia]]).<ref name=selfish_gene/>  A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food<U+2014>lasting for months, or even years,<ref name=selfish_gene/> as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. [[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] in their intestines ferment the fibres, allowing previously indigestable  cellulose to be turned into volatile fatty acids.

==Longevity==
The naked mole rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 28 years) and holds the record for the longest living rodent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buffenstein R, Jarvis JU |title=The naked mole rat<U+2014>a new record for the oldest living rodent |journal=Sci Aging Knowledge Environ |volume=2002 |issue=21 |pages=pe7 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=14602989 |doi=10.1126/sageke.2002.21.pe7 |url=http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14602989}}</ref> The reason for their longevity is debated, but is thought to be related to the fact that they can substantially reduce their metabolism during hard times, and so prevent oxidative damage. This has been summed up as "They're living their life in pulses."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071015225336.htm |title=Ugly Duckling Mole Rats Might Hold Key To Longevity |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> Because of their extraordinary longevity, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole rat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genomics.senescence.info/sequencing/heterocephalus.html |title=Proposal to Sequence an Organism of Unique Interest for Research on Aging: Heterocephalus glaber, the Naked Mole-Rat |publisher=Genomics.senescence.info |date= |accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>

==Resistance to cancer==
Naked mole rats appear to have a high resistance to cancer; cancer has never been observed in them. The mechanism that stunts cancer is a gene called [[p16 (gene)|p16]], known as an "over-crowding" gene, which prevents the creation of new cells once a group of cells reaches a certain size. Most mammals, including naked mole rats, have a gene called [[p27 (gene)|p27]] which does a similar task, but prevents cellular reproduction at a much later point than p16 does. The combination of p16 and p27 in naked mole rats creates a double-layered barrier that prevents the formation of cancer cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/1026/2 |title=Naked Mole Rat Wins the War on Cancer: Jocelyn Kaiser |publisher=AAAS |date= 26 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> Hypersensitivity to [[contact inhibition]] may be the reason for the cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat. <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0905252106 | author=Seluanov A, Hine C, Azpurua J, Feigenson M, Bozzella M, Mao Z, Catania KC, Gorbunova V | title=Hypersensitivity to contact inhibition provides a clue to cancer resistance of naked mole-rat | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  | volume=106 | issue=46 | year=2009 | pages=19352<U+2013>7  | format = [[HTML]]  | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/46/19352.long | pmid=19858485 | pmc=2780760 }}</ref>

==Conservation status==
Naked mole rats are not threatened. Despite their tough living conditions, they are widespread and numerous in the drier regions of [[East Africa]].
