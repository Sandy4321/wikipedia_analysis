'''Kenneth Whiting''' (22 July 1881 - 24 April 1943) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Commissioned officer|officer]] who was a pioneer in [[submarine]]s and is best known for his lengthy carrier as a pioneering naval aviator. During [[World War I]], he commanded the first American military force to arrive in [[Europe]] for combat. After the war, he was instrumental in development of the [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[United States]], where he sometimes is known as the U.S. Navy{{'}}s "father of the aircraft carrier." He was involved in some way in the design or construction of five of the first six U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, and served as acting [[commanding officer]] of the first carrier to enter U.S. Navy service and as [[executive officer]] of the first two American carriers. In the earliest days of the U.S. Navy{{'}}s development of an aircraft carrier force, he led many shipboard innovations still in use aboard carriers today.

==Birth and early career==
Whiting was born in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], [[Massachusetts]], on 22 July 1881, but moved to [[Larchmont, New York|Larchmont]], [[New York]], at an early age. Larchmont remained his residence for the rest of his life. <ref>[http://larchmonthistory.org/memorials/individual/Times/19430429WhitingAnnouncement.html ''Larchmont Times'' obituary of Kenneth Whiting, April 1943.]</ref> He was appointed as a [[Naval Cadet]] on 7 September 1900 and became a [[midshipman]] from New York at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], in 1901. After graduating from the Naval Academy on 30 January 1905,<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294] </ref> he reported aboard the [[armored cruiser]] {{USS|West Virginia|ACR-5|6}}. After serving the requisite sea duty, he was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on either 31 January 1907<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library: Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943]</ref> or 25 February 1908, according to different sources.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k2/kenneth_whiting.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k2/kenneth_whiting.htm]</ref>

In June 1907, Whiting detached from ''West Virginia'' and transferred to the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Concord|PG-3|6}} on the [[Asiatic Station]]. He transferred again, to the [[Steamboat|steamer]] {{USS|Supply|1873|6}}, in May 1908.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

==Submarine service==
After a brief stint aboard ''Concord'' again from August to October 1908,<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref> Whiting volunteered for [[submarine]] duty<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/41/pdf/09411405.pdf Navsource.org Kenneth Whiting.]</ref> and was reassigned to command of the submarine {{USS|Shark|SS-8|6}} at [[Naval Station Cavite]] in the [[Philippine Islands]] to oversee her [[fitting-out]].  He then assumed command of the submarine {{USS|Porpoise|SS-7|6}} at Cavite on 20 November 1908.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

On 15 April 1909, Whiting took ''Porpoise'' out for what his crew of six thought would be a routine run. After ''Porpoise'' leveled off in [[Manila Bay]] at a depth of 20 feet (6.1 meters), Whiting informed his crew that he was convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through a [[torpedo tube]] and that he intended to test the idea on himself. He squeezed into ''Porpoise{{'}}''s 18-inch (460-mm) tube and clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door as the crew closed the inner door. When the crew opened the outer door and seawater rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar, which drew his elbows out of the tube{{'}}s mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms. After 77 seconds, he was free of the submarine and swam to the surface; ''Porpoise'' soon surfaced and recovered him. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public &ndash; in ''Porpoise''{{'}}s log that day, Whiting simply commented, "Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in water in normal condition, as an experiment..." &ndash; he nevertheless informed his [[flotilla]] commander, [[Lieutenant]] [[Guy W. S. Castle]], who submitted a report on how the feat had been accomplished.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a1/a-6.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a1/a-6.htm.]</ref>

In September 1910, Whiting detached from ''Porpoise''. He next took command of the [[United States Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] submarine {{USS|Tarpon|SS-14|6}}. In January 1911, he reported to the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Virginia]], to fit out the new submarine [[USS G-1 (SS-19<U+00BD>)|USS ''Seal'']], which was renamed ''G-1'' later that year.  He became the first commanding officer of ''G-1'' when she was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on  28 October 1912.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

==Naval aviation==
In 1910, Whiting applied for flight training by [[Glenn Curtiss]] and talked his friend from the submarine service [[Theodore G. Ellyson]] into applying as well. Ellyson was accepted and went on to become Naval Aviator No. 1 in 1911, but Whiting was not and continued his submarine duties.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/41/pdf/09411405.pdf NavSource.org Kenneth Whiting]</ref> On 29 June 1914, however, Whiting finally began his career in naval aviation, the field in which he was to make his name as a true pioneer, when he reported to the [[Wright Company]] at [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], to learn to fly.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref> The last naval officer to take flight training from [[Orville Wright]] personally,<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/41/pdf/09411405.pdf NavSource.org Kenneth Whiting]</ref> Whiting was designated Naval Aviator No. 16 on 6 September 1914.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

Whiting then became officer-in-charge of the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|Naval Aeronautic Station]] at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. He and fellow naval aviator [[Henry C. Mustin]] worked together on [[seaplane]] designs and filed a [[patent]] application for the design of a "hydroaeroplane" on 27 October 1916.<ref>[http://wavetops.usna.com.s3.amazonaws.com/July2011/Aviation.pdf Universal Ship Cancellation Society Log, July 2011, p. 21.]</ref> In November 1916, he transferred to the armored cruiser {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}} &ndash; renamed USS ''Seattle'' on 1 December 1916 &ndash; and took command of a unit of seaplanes attached to the ship.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

Whiting would later become a member of the [[Early Birds of Aviation]], an organization founded in 1928 and dedicated to the history of pilots who learned to fly before 17 December 1916.

===World War I===
The United States entered [[World War I]] on 6 April 1917, and Whiting was selected to command the [[1st Naval Air Unit]] (or [[First Aeronautic Detachment]]) and assigned to the [[Collier (ship)|collier]] {{USS|Neptune|AC-8|6}} in May 1917.  The unit{{'}}s seven officers and 122 [[Enlisted personnel|enlisted men]] crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[France]] aboard ''Neptune'' and the collier {{USS|Jupiter|AC-3|6}} to become the first American military unit to debark in [[Europe]] for combat, with ''Jupiter'' arriving at [[Pauillac]] on 5 June 1917 and ''Neptune'' at [[St. Nazaire]] on 8 June 1917.<ref>Layman, p. 116.</ref><ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref><ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/avchr2.htm Naval History and Heritage Command Naval Aviation Chronology 1917-1919.]</ref>

With only vague guidance and, at first, no aircraft, Whiting set about establishing a European presence for U.S. Navy aviation.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3101/is_2_58/ai_n57783595/ ResourceLibrary.comn Review by Sherman N. Mullin of ''Stalking the U-Boat: U.S. Naval Aviation in World War I'' by Geoffrey L. Rossano.]</ref> In June 1917, he selected [[Dunkirk]] as the site for a U.S. Navy air base,<ref>[http://www.americanmilitaryhistorymsw.com/blog/745389-usn-northern-bombing-group-i/ American Military and Naval History USN Northern Bombing Group I]</ref> laying the groundwork for the establishment in 1918 of the U.S. Navy{{'}}s [[Northern Bombing Group]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/avchr2.htm Naval History and Heritage Command Naval Aviation Chronology 1917-1919.]</ref> He also instructed French pilots. 

On 1 June or 20 July 1918, according to different sources, Whiting, by now promoted to [[lieutenant commander]], took command of [[Naval air station|Naval Air Stations]] 14 and 15 at [[Killingholme]], [[England]].<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref><ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/avchr2.htm Naval History and Heritage Command Naval Aviation Chronology 1917-1919.]</ref>

For his World War I service, Whiting was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] "for exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility,"<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k2/kenneth_whiting.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k2/kenneth_whiting.htm]</ref> and France awarded him the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor (Chevalier)]].<ref>[http://larchmonthistory.org/memorials/individual/Times/19430429WhitingAnnouncement.html ''Larchmont Times'' obituary of Kenneth Whiting, April 1943.]</ref>

===Interwar aircraft carrier advocacy===

Whiting sometimes is referred to as the U.S. Navy{{<U+2018>}}s <U+201C>father of the aircraft carrier.<U+201D> He had begun agitating for U.S. Navy development of what were then called "plane carriers" in the spring of 1916,<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/41/pdf/09411405.pdf NavSource.org Kenneth Whiting]</ref> and as early as March 1917 he had proposed to [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] that the Navy acquire a ship with an [[aircraft catapult]] and a [[flight deck]], prompting the first serious U.S. Navy consideration of the acquisition of any kind of aviation ship since the [[American Civil War]] of 1861<U+2013>1865.<ref>Layman, p. 116.</ref> The [[United States Department of the Navy]] rejected his proposal on 20 June 1917.<ref>Layman, R.D., ''Before the Aircraft Carrier: The Development of Aviation Vessels 1849-1922'', Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1989, ISBN 0-87021-210-9, p. 116.</ref> In the years between World War I and [[World War II]], however, Whiting would be instrumental in the construction of five of the U.S. Navy{{<U+2018>}}s first six aircraft carriers, and serve as [[executive officer]] of its first two,<ref>[http://wavetops.usna.com.s3.amazonaws.com/July2011/Aviation.pdf Universal Ship Cancellation Society Log, July 2011, p. 23.]</ref> and as acting commanding officer of its first carrier at a time when the United States was experimenting with many aspects of the operation of aircraft carriers and their aircraft.

Returning to the United States after World War I, Whiting was assigned to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]{{'}} Office of Naval Aviation in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1919.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref> Testifying along with with other leading naval aviators, including [[Henry C. Mustin]] and [[John Henry Towers]], before the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] about the need for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, Whiting was partially responsible for the General Board{{'}}s April 1919 recommendation that the [[Collier (ship)|collier]] {{USS|Jupiter|AC-3|6}} be converted into the U.S. Navy{{'}}s first aircraft carrier. On 11 July 1919, the [[United States Congress]] authorized ''Jupiter''{{'}}s conversion into the carrier, which  later would be named {{USS|Langley|CV-1}}.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref><ref>Wadle, p. 13.</ref><ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/avchr2.htm Naval History and Heritage Command Naval Aviation Chronology 1917-1919.]</ref> 

Later in 1919, after the [[battleship]] {{USS|Texas|BB-35}} experimented successfully with the use of aircraft to spot her gunfire and found that the aircraft spotters allowed her greater accuracy, Whiting testified before the General Board, attesting that aircraft spotting could increase the accuracy of ship gunnery by up to 200 percent.<ref>Hone and Hone, p. 81.</ref> The success of the experiments led the Navy to embark [[floatplane]]s aboard all of its battleships and [[cruiser]]s.<ref>Hone and Hone, pp. 94-96.</ref>

On 1 September 1921 Whiting transferred to the Navy{{'}}s newly established [[Bureau of Aeronautics]].<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294] </ref> There he continued his advocacy for an American aircraft carrier force. In January 1922, he said, "The ''Langley'' when commissioned will provide our Navy with an experimental {{'}} carrier{{'}} which, while not ideal, will be sufficiently serviceable to conduct any experiment required for the design of future {{'}}carriers{{'}} and for the development of naval aerial tactics, and for the development of the various types of aircraft...for these last are also lacking in our Navy, due to concentrating on anti-submarine work during the War [i.e., World War I]. That {{'}}carriers{{'}} will be successful, and an absolute necessity to any well-equipped navy in the future, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind. We are asking this [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first properly designed 'carrier.' It will take from three to four years to build it. Will they give it to us?"<ref>Quote from "Aircraft Caiiers: Floating Homes For Naval Planes," ''Literary Digest'', February 18, 1922, at [http://www.1920-30.com/military/aircraft-carriers.html 1920-30.com The First Aircraft Carriers.]</ref> The "properly designed" carriers Whiting wanted first began to appear in 1927, with the commissioning of {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}} and {{USS|Lexington|CV-2}}.

===USS ''Langley'' (CV-1)===

Whiting reported aboard ''Langley'' on 20 March 1922, the day of her commissioning, as her first [[executive officer]], also serving on an acting basis as her first commanding officer and thus becoming the first person to command a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294].</ref> ''Langley'' was far too slow to keep up with the [[Battle Fleet|battle fleet]],<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906-1921'', p. 121.</ref> and her main purpose was to serve as a laboratory for the exploration of the new naval warfare discipline of [[Aircraft Carrier Operations|aircraft carrier operations]], with her personnel and those of her embarked air [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] experimenting to discover what practices worked best.<ref>Tate, p.66.</ref> Flying a [[Vought VE-7]], Lieutenant [[Virgil C. Griffin]] made the first takeoff from an American carrier from ''Langley'' on 17 October 1922, and Lieutenant Commander [[Godfrey Chevalier]] made the first landing on 26 October 1922 in an [[Aeromarine 39]]B.<ref>[http://www.navalhistory.org/2011/03/20/navy%E2%80%99s-first-carrier-commissioned-20-march-1922/ Naval History Blog, U.S. Naval Institute-U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command, "Navy's First Carrier Commisioned, 20 March 1922," 20 March 2011, 12:01 a.m.]</ref> On 18 November 1922, Whiting himself made the world{{'}}s first [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] launch of an aircraft from an aircraft carrier while aboard ''Langley'', piloting a [[Naval Aircraft Factory PT]]<ref>Sweeny, p. 150.</ref><ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/41/pdf/09411405.pdf NavSource.org Kenneth Whiting]</ref> while ''Langley'' was at anchor in Virginia{{'}}s [[York River (Virginia)|York River]].<ref>[http://www.dcmilitary.com/article/20111117/NEWS12/711179961/this-week-in-naval-history DCMilitary.com This Week in History 17 November 2011]</ref>

Whiting was credited with establishing many basic tenets of carrier aviation, largely worked out during his first ''Langley'' tour. He established the first pilot [[ready room]]s aboard ''Langley''.<ref>Tate, pp. 62-69</ref> He had a hand-cranked movie camera film every landing on the carrier to aid in the evaluation of landing techniques,<ref>Tate., p. 68.</ref> and had a [[darkroom]] and [[photography]] laboratory installed on board to allow the landing films to be developed at sea.<ref>Tate, pp. 62-69.</ref> ''Langley''{{'}}s pilots had no signaling system with which shipboard personnel could assist them in landing,<ref>Tate, p.68.</ref> so when not flying himself, Whiting observed all landings from the aft port corner of ''Langley''{{'}}s flight deck.<ref>Tate, p. 68.</ref> where he was visible to pilots in critical touchdown attitudes when the nose of the aircraft might obscure their view straight ahead as they approached the ship to land. Pilots found Whiting{{'}}s body language helpful and suggested an experienced pilot be assigned to occupy that position as a "[[landing signal officer]]" or "landing safety officer" (LSO), using signals to guide them to safe landings. In an advanced form, the LSO concept survives aboard aircraft carriers to this day.<ref>Tate, p. 68.</ref> Whiting also was influential in the U.S. Navy{{'}}s decision to make pilot qualification a requirement for command of an aircraft carrier.<ref>Tate, pp. 62-69</ref>.

===Later duties===
In July 1924, Whiting returned to duty at the Bureau of Aeronautics to serve as its assistant chief. Later he became head of the Aircraft Carriers Division.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref> In September 1926, he reported to the [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Brown-Boveri Electric Company]] in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]], to oversee the construction of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}, which was commissioned in 1927 as the second American aircraft carrier and the first one capable of operating with the battle fleet. He became her first executive officer on 16 November 1927, remaining in that position until May 1929.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

Whiting was promoted to [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|captain]] on 1 July 1929. He became aide and chief of staff to Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, [[Battle Fleet]], in September 1929.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

In August 1930, Whiting took command of [[Naval Air Station Norfolk]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia.  In June 1932, he departed Norfolk for [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], where he attended the [[Naval War College]] and received instruction at the [[Naval Torpedo Station]].<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref> He returned to USS ''Langley'' as her commanding officer on 15 June 1933, leaving her in December 1933 to fit out the new aircraft carrier {{USS|Ranger|CV-4}} at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. He left ''Ranger'' in 1934 to assist in developing plans for the new aircraft carriers {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6}}. In June 1934 he returned to USS ''Saratoga'' to serve as her commanding officer.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

Whiting left ''Saratoga'' in July 1935 and next became Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, serving simultaneously as commander of Fleet Air Base [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Territory of Hawaii]]. In September 1937, he became commanding officer of [[Patrol Wing 2]], remaining in that position until 3 June 1938.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

On 14 July 1939, Whiting reported for duty as General Inspector of Naval Aircraft, Eastern Division, in the [[Third Naval District]] at [[New York, New York|New York]], [[New York]].  He was still in this position when he was placed on the retirement list on 30 June 1940. However, instead of retiring, he was retained on active duty.<ref>[http://www.usna.edu/Library/sca/findingaids/whiting/index.html Nimitz Library Special Collections and Archives Guide to the Kenneth Whiting Papers, 1914-1943 MS 294]</ref>

===World War II===
After the United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941, Whiting continued his general inspector duties until 19 February 1943, when he took command of [[Naval Air Station New York]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York]], serving also as District Aviation Officer, Third Naval District. He held these posts until his death.
