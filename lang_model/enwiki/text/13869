The former '''French Convalescent Home''' (now a residential development called '''The French Apartments''') was a seafront [[sanatorium]] and rest home built in [[Brighton]], part of the English seaside city of [[Brighton and Hove]], on behalf of the [[Government of France|French government]].  It received patients from the French Hospital in London and served as a home for elderly French nationals.  It was sold for redevelopment in 1999 and was briefly threatened with demolition; but [[English Heritage]] [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance, and it was converted into [[Apartment|flats]].  The unusual [[ch<U+00E2>teau]]-style [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance Revival]] building has been criticised as "dreary" and "[[wikt:gauche|gauche]]", but is believed to be unique in England and demonstrated innovation in its use of [[Insulated glazing|double glazing]].

==History==
A hospital to serve [[London]]'s [[French diaspora|French residents]] was opened in 1867; four years later, a French [[dispensary]] was opened on another site.  In 1890, the institutions moved to a combined facility, the French Hospital, on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]; funding came from the French government and other donors.<ref name="DF">{{cite web|url=http://www.dispensairefrancais.org.uk/article.php3?id_article=62|title=Dispensaire Fran<U+00E7>ais: Background|year=2010|publisher=Le Dispensaire Fran<U+00E7>ais|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>

The French government sought to establish a home outside London where former patients of the hospital could recuperate.<ref name="HG479657">{{cite web|title=Heritage Gateway Listed Buildings Online <U+2014> French Convalescent Home and attached wall and railings, De Courcel Road, Brighton, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=479657&resourceID=5|accessdate=14 June 2010|publisher=Heritage Gateway ([[English Heritage]], Institute of Historic Building Conservation and [[ALGAO|ALGAO:England]])|year=2006|work=Heritage Gateway website}}</ref>  Brighton had grown in the previous century because of its proximity to London, excellent climate and status as a fashionable, high-class resort;<ref name="EncB17">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=<U+00A7>17.}}</ref> these advantages helped Brighton to be chosen, and a site on the cliff above [[Black Rock (Brighton and Hove)|Black Rock]] and behind Marine Parade was found.  On 5 October 1895, Baron de Courcel, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, laid the building's [[Foundation stone|first stone]].<ref name="HG479657"/><ref name="NEB130">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=130.}}</ref>  Local architecture firm Clayton & Black, who were responsible for many buildings throughout Brighton and the surrounding area, were commissioned to design the home; it has been described as an "interesting example of their work",<ref name="BoB71">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic.

School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|p=56.}}</ref>

The institution opened in 1896,<ref name="NEB130"/> and was finished in its original form in 1898.<ref name="Antram153">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=153.}}</ref><ref name="Pevsner450">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=450.}}</ref>  Its capacity was 61.<ref name="NEB130"/>  Two pavilions were added at the ends in 1904 and 1907: the eastern pavilion<U+2014>named after Gambon, a later French Ambassador<U+2014>came first, followed by the Ruffer pavilion (named after the French Hospital's president) on the west side.<ref name="HG479657"/><ref name="Antram153"/>

From the beginning, [[nun]]s were used as nurses (the Sisters of St Paul of Chartres were responsible for the home until 1994), and non-French nationals were sometimes accepted as residents; during World War I, British soldiers injured in action were treated there.<ref name="HG479657"/>  Structural alterations since 1907 included an extra wing on the east end in 1914, adding more capacity,<ref name="NEB130"/> and a new rendered fa<U+00E7>ade, larger [[Elevator|lift shaft]], new internal doors, tiling and the removal of some chimneys.<ref name="HG479657"/>

In 1986, the local health authority registered the institution as a nursing home under its control.  The Sisters of St Paul of Chartres still ran the home until 1994, though; at that time they were replaced by local authority nurses.<ref name="HG479657"/><ref name="NEB130"/>  Five years later, the building's future was in doubt when its trustees sold it to housebuilder [[Bovis Homes Group]].  The decision, on 29 October 1999, was followed four months later by an announcement that the home would close: all staff would be made redundant and all residents would have move to other institutions by 31 May 2000.  In the meantime, [[English Heritage]] granted Grade II [[Listed building|listed status]] to the building, and instead of being demolished it was converted into fourteen luxury flats under the name "The French Apartments".<ref name="NEB130"/>  Listed status was granted on 26 January 2000;<ref name="HG479657"/> the Grade II designation is given to "nationally important buildings of special interest".<ref name="EH2">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1373#grades|title=Listed buildings: What do the different grades mean?|year=2008|work=English Heritage website|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>  As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of [[Brighton and Hove]].<ref name="IoEStats-ESx">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> Statistics by County (East Sussex)|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=EAST%20SUSSEX|work=[[Images of England]] website|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>  It is the only known current or former French convalescent home in England,<ref name="HG479657"/> and was known in French as ''La Maison Fran<U+00E7>aise de Retraite et de Convalescence''<ref name="BoB71"/> or ''La Maison de Convalescence Fran<U+00E7>aise''.<ref name="Pevsner450"/>

==Architecture==
The French Convalescent Home was designed by the Clayton & Black firm in the [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance Revival style]], making it appear "out of place on Brighton's seafront"<ref name="BoB71"/> (which consists almost exclusively of [[stucco]]ed [[Regency architecture|Regency-style]] buildings).<ref name="NEB12">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=12.}}</ref>  [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and [[Ian Nairn]] criticised it as a "dreary institution",<ref name="Pevsner450"/> and the greyish-green [[cement]] applied to the exterior in the 20th century has made it appear drab.<ref name="Antram153"/>  Other descriptions have included "[[wikt:gauche|gauche]]"<ref name="Antram153"/> and "interesting",<ref name="BoB71"/> and the building has been likened to a [[ch<U+00E2>teau]].<ref name="NEB130"/>

The structure is built of Belgian brick (subsequently covered with cement) with some stonework.  The roof is of slate with some ironwork at the tops of the pavilions.<ref name="HG479657"/><ref name="Antram153"/>  The use of concrete suspended floors and "secondary glazing" in most of the wooden-framed windows was requested in the design requirements; the latter represented the first use of [[Insulated glazing|double glazing]] in an English building.<ref name="HG479657"/>  The entrance, facing north away from the sea, is set in a [[gable]]d recess below a [[cornice]]; there is a six-window range with some [[stained glass]], and a double doorway at the top of a [[balustrade]]d staircase.<ref name="HG479657"/>  Facing the sea on the south side, behind a garden, is a five-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]], three-storey fa<U+00E7>ade with {{smallcaps|french convalescent home}} and {{smallcaps|1898}} in black lettering, a ground-floor round-arched [[colonnade]] and small single-storey projections between the outer bays and the four-storey pavilions flanking them.<ref name="HG479657"/>

Interior facilities which existed before the building was sold for conversion included a three-bay chapel in the base of the eastern pavilion (with [[mural]]s, wooden panelling and [[lancet window]]s), a [[billiards]] room in the western pavilion, two lounges and a dining room.  Near the original oak staircase is a [[bronze]] statue of the founder of the French Hospital.<ref name="HG479657"/>
