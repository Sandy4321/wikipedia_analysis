The '''23rd ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Kama'' (2nd Croatian)''' was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Gebirgsjager|mountain infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]] of the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', the armed wing of the German [[Nazi Party]] that served alongside but was never formally part of the [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]]. It was composed of [[Germans|German]] officers and [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslim]] soldiers. Named ''Kama'' after a small [[dagger]] used by Balkan shepherds, it was one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the ''Waffen-SS'' during World War II. Formed on 19 June 1944, it did not reach its full strength and never saw action as a formation, but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. The division was formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.

==Background==
After the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] by the [[Axis powers]] on 6 April 1941, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of an [[Usta<U+0161>e]]-led Croatian state <U+2013> the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (often called the NDH, from the {{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska}}). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]] into an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} NDH authorities, led by the [[Usta<U+0161>e militia]], immediately launched a campaign of mass killings, expulsions and forced religious conversions to [[Catholicism]] targeting the [[Serb]] [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population living within the borders of the new state.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=397<U+2013>409}}

Despite Paveli<U+0107>'s assurances of equality with the predominantly Catholic Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Usta<U+0161>e rule. An [[Islam]]ic leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. By early 1942, fierce fighting had broken out between the Usta<U+0161>e, [[Chetniks]] and Partisans in NDH territory. Some Usta<U+0161>e militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Usta<U+0161>e violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]], the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as "of minimal combat value". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the [[Tuzla]]-based Home Guard "[[Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107> Legion]]" led by [[Muhamed Had<U+017E>iefendi<U+0107>]], was of any significance.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|pp=15<U+2013>16}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=488<U+2013>493}}

The Bosnian Muslims sought protection and independence from the NDH, and saw German support as a means to achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg ([[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Paveli<U+0107> as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect their people and wrote to [[Adolf Hitler]] asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because he did not want to create problems for Paveli<U+0107>, ''[[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw this as an opportunity to create a ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|pp=16<U+2013>17}} In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people, the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|13th ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Handschar'' (1st Croatian)]]. The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=496}}{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=19}}

==History==
[[File:Gustav Lombard.jpg|thumb|left|''SS Oberf<U+00FC>hrer'' Gustav Lombard commanded an ad-hoc force that fought the Red Army in southern Hungary. It included Bosnian Muslims of the 23rd SS Division.|alt=German officer in uniform]]
The Germans wanted to recruit a second SS division from the Muslims of Bosnia,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=500}} as part of Himmler's goal to expand ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting in the Balkans. His plan was to form two [[corps]] of two divisions, with one corps to operate in the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian region]] of the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the ''[[Germans of Yugoslavia|Volksdeutsche]]'' [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ''Prinz Eugen'']] and together would form a Balkan SS mountain army of five divisions.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=223}} On 28 May 1944, Hitler gave his formal approval for the creation of a 23rd SS Division, and its formation began on 19 June. Himmler followed the advice of the commander of the 13th SS Division ''Handschar'', ''[[Brigadef<U+00FC>hrer|SS Brigadef<U+00FC>hrer and Generalmajor of Waffen-SS]]'' (Brigadier) [[Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig]], and agreed to form the division in the neighbouring [[Ba<U+010D>ka]] region [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupied by Hungary]] instead of Bosnia. Sauberzweig believed that if the division was raised in the NDH, the Usta<U+0161>e would undermine the morale of the recruits.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|pp=223 & 228}} The new division was named ''Kama'' after a small [[dagger]] used by Balkan shepherds.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=228}}

Orders were given to the 13th SS Division to provide a [[En cadre|cadre]] for the new division, and ''[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (Colonel) [[Helmuth Raithel]], a regimental commander from the 13th SS Division, was appointed as the new division's commanding officer. On 21 June, Himmler promoted Sauberzweig to ''[[Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer and Generalleutnant of Waffen-SS]]'' (major general) and appointed him to command the Bosnian corps, which was given the title [[IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian)|IX ''Waffen'' Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian)]]. The corps was to form at [[B<U+00E1>csalm<U+00E1>s]] in southern [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]].{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=228}}

Beginning on 23 June, nearly 1,400 men from the 13th SS Division that had been selected for transfer to the 23rd SS Division ''Kama'' were assembled in [[Bo<U+0161>njaci]] in northern [[Syrmia|Srijem]] and were moved to southern Hungary in mid-July. They included three [[non-commissioned officer]]s from every company of the 13th SS Division.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=228}} The 10,000 men for a full-strength division were to be obtained from volunteers, from Muslim conscripts born in 1926 and 1927 (with some exceptions), and if necessary, from the various Muslim militias in the NDH. The conscripts were subjected to the draft by the NDH government then transferred to German command along with the others. These men were to report by 15 September 1944, but in mid-August, ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting officer ''[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Gottlob Berger]] reported to Himmler that there would be insufficient reliable Muslim men available, and Catholic Croats would also have to be accepted into the 23rd SS Division.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=223}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=500}} During Paveli<U+0107>'s visit to Hitler in September 1944, General [[<U+0110>uro Gruji<U+0107>]], chief of Paveli<U+0107>'s Military Office, indicated to the Germans that it would be difficult to recruit another 5,000 men to complete the division after 5,000 had already been assigned.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=500}}

On 10 September the division reached a strength of 126 officers, 374 non-commissioned officers and 3,293 men,{{sfn|Pencz|2010|p=3}} composed of [[Germans|German]] officers and [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslim]] soldiers.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=268}} By this time, morale was waning within the new division just as it completed the final phase of its training in Hungary; the war was not going well, and there were rumours that the Germans were going to abandon the Balkans and leave the Muslims to defend themselves.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=252}} Faced with high rates of desertion from the 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed a plan to disarm the Bosnians in both divisions, and on 18 September travelled to see Himmler. The ''Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS'' instead opted for a plan to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division to the area of operations of the 13th SS Division in Bosnia and re-organise both divisions there. [[Combat Arms|Combat arms]] units from the 13th SS Division were to be brought under the direct control of IX ''Waffen'' Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian), which would also move to Bosnia. Issued on 24 September, the plan included the formation of a new SS infantry division from the German cadre of the 23rd SS Division in Hungary under the command of ''[[Oberf<U+00FC>hrer|SS Oberf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (Senior Colonel) [[Gustav Lombard]].{{sfn|Lepre|1997|pp=256<U+2013>257}}

The staff of IX ''Waffen'' Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) headquarters left Hungary and arrived in the village of [[Andrija<U+0161>evci]], near [[Vinkovci]] in the Srijem region, on 3 October 1944. The headquarters became partially operational on 7 October. In the meantime, Russian forces continued to advance into Hungary, and on 9 October 1944 a telegram was sent by the commander of ''Waffen-SS'' forces in Hungary to IX SS Mountain Corps in Bosnia announcing that "battle ready units from SS Oberf<U+00FC>hrer Lombard's division ([[31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division]]) and Bosnians from the Division ''Kama'' had been thrown into the fighting in Bacska (Ba<U+010D>ka)".{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=263}}{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=185}} As a result, the return of the 23rd SS Division to Bosnia was delayed.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=263}}

The Bosnians of the division were soon withdrawn from the front line in Hungary and had begun the move to Bosnia to join the 13th SS Division when they mutinied on 17 October 1944. Raithel quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in the disbanding of the division. A small number of reliable Bosnians from the division were used as replacements in the 13th SS Division, and the 23rd SS Division was formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.{{sfn|Lepre|1997|p=266}} Despite its short existence, the 23rd SS is considered one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the ''Waffen-SS'' during World War II.{{sfn|Keegan|1970|pp=156<U+2013>159}} After the division was disbanded, the numerical designator "23rd" was given to the [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland|23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division ''Nederland'']],{{sfn|Keegan|1970|p=158}} and Raithel went on to command the 11th SS-Gebirgsj<U+00E4>ger Regiment  "''[[Reinhard Heydrich]]''" of the [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|6th SS Mountain Division ''Nord'']] against the [[United States Army]] in southern Germany during the final months of World War II.{{sfn|Rusiecki|2011|pp=38 & 340}}

==Order of battle==
