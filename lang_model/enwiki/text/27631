==Early life==

Enzo Ashford Zelocchi was raised between Europe and USA, he's Italian and French descent. His mother, Fatma, is a former dancer and grew up in France. His father, Carl Alberto, is a criminal attorney. Fatma and Carl Alberto met in Paris and later set up a home in northern Italy.

The relationship was a troubled one and 3 years after Enzo's birth Fatma and Carl Alberto chose to go their separate ways and rebuild their lives away from each other.

Enzo grew up between several homes, welcome in all but not belonging to any, as families evolved in ways that did not allow him a place to fit in. Paternal grandparents and uncles from his father's side were considered his main guardians during his childhood and formative years. Enzo has extended family between New York, Kansas, New Jersey, North Italy and France.

Enzo graduated with a degree in Accounting from a private international school in Rome and moved to Milan shortly afterwards to pursue a specialty in marketing, media strategy and public relations at the private university IULM.

Despite excelling in his coursework, Enzo still lived with a deep emptiness. He began to do some modeling, became a scholar of the Theatre Center in Milan where the Stanislavski method was taught, performed live theatre, booked commercials, indie films and eventually a starring role in a television show for several seasons, where he felt the inspiration and fulfillment of performing and at last a sense of being "home."

His acting skill set was strongly developed when he moved back to New York and studied acting from coach, Susan Batson, whose Lee Strasberg inspired method he totally connected with.

Enzo continues to hone his craft, exploring and developing his abilities as an actor. He resides in Los Angeles where his strong commitment is transforming his dreams into media marketing strategy, producing projects, and honoring his passion for acting and professional career.
