'''Design management''' is concerned with the integration of design into management and vice versa. It is an approach whereby [[organisation]]s make design-relevant decisions in a market and customer-oriented way as well as optimising design-relevant (corporate-) processes. It is a comprehensive activity on all levels of business performance that effect design, from the fuzzy front-end to the execution of design. Design management acts as the interface of [[management]] and [[design]] and functions as link between the platforms of [[technology]], [[design]], [[design thinking]], [[corporate management]], [[brand management]] and [[marketing management]] at internal and external interfaces of the enterprise.

==Extended definition==
[[Image:Dm-definition.pdf|thumb|right| Design management plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market.]]
Design management is not limited on a single design discipline.  In his 'Classification of Design' (1976), Gorb<U+2019>s divided design into three different classes; design management operates in and across all three categories:
* Product (e.g. [[industrial design]], packaging design, service design)
* Information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design)
* Environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design)

Design management is not independent from the organizational and product situational context, and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market:
# align design strategy with corporate and/or brand strategy
# manage quality and consistency of design outcomes across and within different design disciplines (design classes)
# enhance new ways of user experience and differentiation from competitors

Supportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient ('doing the things right') and effectively ('doing the right things'). Depending on a multitude of factors (such as industry, company size, design focus, market situation and the position / role of design within the company), design managers have a broad range of job profiles, with very different roles, activities and responsibilities.

The term 'design management' includes a semantic contradiction and can be interpreted in two different ways: (1) managing design and (2) designing management.<ref>http://design.case.edu/articles/Design%20Matters.pdf</ref> This distinction refers to the traditional understanding of design management on an operational level as well as to a relative new approach of integrating design thinking as a mental concept in different business functions (e.g. using design thinking on board level or within the context of innovation management).

==Historical development==
Difficulties arise in tracing the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise. Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines (e.g. [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[management]], [[software development]], [[engineering]]) and movements (e.g. [[system theory]], [[design methodologies]]) and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to [[design]] nor to [[management]].

* <u>1907</u>:  Establishment of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) in [[Munich]] by twelve architects and twelve business firms as an state-sponsored effort to better compete with [[Great Britain]] and [[United States]] by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. The German designer and architect [[Peter Behrens]] designed as an external consultant the entire [[corporate identity]] (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of [[AEG]] (Allgemeine Elektrizit<U+00E4>ts Gessellschaft) and is known as first [[industrial design]]er in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]]'s initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.<ref name="B<U+00FC>rdek 1989">{{cite book |last=B<U+00FC>rdek |first=Bernhard E. |coauthors= |title=Design - Geschichte, Theorie und Praxis in der Produktgestaltung |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=Birkh<U+00E4>user - Verlag f<U+00FC>r Architektur |location=Berlin |isbn=3-7643-7028-9 |pages=358ff }}</ref>
* <u>1914</u>: The success of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] inspired a group of British designers, industrialists and business people (who have seen the organization on the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne) to found the [[Design and Industries Association]] and campaigned for a greater involvement of government in the promotion of good design.<ref>From Solving Problems to Selling Product, Andrew Jackson, University of Brighton</ref>
* <u>1933-1945</u>: [[Adolf Hitler]] instrumentalised [[design]], [[architecture]] and [[propaganda]] to stage his power, most exemplary shown through the annual [[Reichsparteitage]] in [[N<U+00FC>rnberg]] on September 5th. [[Heinrich Himmler]] coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including the [[all-black SS-uniform]] (designed by Prof. [[Karl Diebitsch]] and [[Walter Heck]] in 1933), the [[Dachau concentration camp]] (designed by [[Theodor Eicke]] and prototype for the other [[Nazi concentration camps]]) and the [[Wewelsburg]] (redesign commissioned by [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1944).
* <u>1936</u>: [[Olivetti]] hired [[Giovanni Pintori]] (publicity department) and promoted [[Marcello Nizzoli]] (product design department) to develop design into a comprehensive corporate philosophy. The company got famous for its attention to design through their [[corporate design]] activities, which is understood as early contribution to design management.
* <u>1944</u>: In [[Great Britain]], the [http://www.design-council.org.uk/ British Design Council] was founded in 1944 by the [[British wartime government]] as the [[Council of Industrial Design]], with the objective "to promote by all practicable means the improvement of [[design]] in the [[Product (project management)|products]] of British [[industry]]".
* <u>1949</u>: The Royal College of Art ([[London]]) starts a research programme on the principles of art and design in relation to industrial and commercial processes.
* <u>1951</u>: [[Chicago]] industrialist [[Walter Paepcke]] of the [[Container Corporation of America]] founded the [http://aspendesignsummit.aiga.org/ Aspen Design Conference] in the [[United States]] after [[World War II]] as a way of bringing [[business]] and [[designers]] together <U+2013> to the benefit of both. In 1951, the first conference topic, <U+201C>Design as a function of management,<U+201D> was chosen to ensure the participation of the business community. After several years, [[business]] leaders stopped attending because the increased participation of [[designers]] changed the dialogue, focusing not on the need for collaboration between [[business]] and [[design]], but rather on the [[business]] community<U+2019>s failure to understand the value of [[design]].

* <u>1972</u>: The Royal School of Art ([[London]]) established its scientific design research department in 1972.
* <u>1973</u>: Horst Rittel formally introduced the term '[[wicked problems]]' to describe a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements. His work contributed to the understanding of complex decision making in design and a systemic approach (in the context of first order cybernetics) to divide the design process in independently, clearly defined steps.
* <u>1975</u>: The [http://www.dmi.org/ Design Management Institute] was founded 1975 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] in [[Boston]].

Peter Gorb, a Life Fellow of the [[Design Management Institute]] and a long time Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Art|RSA]], has led the Design Management department for over 20 years and is seen as a godfather for design management.
* <u>1977</u>: Christopher Alexander publications 'A Pattern Language' (1977) and 'A Timeless Way of Building' (1979) were vital to the paradigm shift in design and the new approach to design methodologies (beside the work from Paul Feyerabend in 1976). In contrast to the old methodologies (with an deductive approach, from outside-in), focused the new methodology ('New German Design') on an inductive approach to the design problem (from inside-out) and questioned for which target group the solution was designed and marketed.

Because companies were unsure how to exactly manage design, there was a market for several consultancies, focussing on helping companies in managing the [[product development]] process, including [[market research]], concept, project, communication and market launch phases, as well as positioning of products or companies. The new method based design management approach helped to improve the communication to technical and marketing managers. The new methods included for example [[trend research]], product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings etc. and gave design a more communicative and central role in the company.

==Design management in Companies==
===Design Management Hierarchy===
If and how the design management levels are applied in the company correlates often with the importance and integration of design in the company, but depends also on industry type, company size, ownership for design and type of competitive competence. The research from the Danish Design Centre (DDC), which led to the Danish Design Ladder, shows effective how companies interpreted already design with different depths:<ref>Danish Design Center, Danish Design Ladder</ref>
# <u>non-design</u>: Companies that do not use design (15% in 2007).
# <u>design as styling</u>: Companies that use design as styling appearance (17% in 2007).
# <u>design as process</u>: Companies that integrate design into the development process (45% in 2007).
# <u>design as innovation</u>: Companies that consider design as key strategic element (21% in 2007).
The research showed that companies that considered design on a higher level of the ladder were constantly growing. Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an 'Evaluation of the Importance of Design' in 2006 with the result that most companies considered design as promoter for innovation (71%), as growth potential for the company (79%) and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, also design management gets more important.

Design management can be divided by its different fields of application into the three different levels:

===Design Management Function===
Design management is not a standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that would lead to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different [[industries]] and [[Business|enterprises]] with different sizes and [[tradition]]s, whilst having different [[target group]]s and [[market]]s to serve. Design management is multifaceted and so are the different applications of and views on design management.

The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority and practice.<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | year = 1996| month = | title = 18 Views on the Definition of Design Management | journal     = Design Management Journal | volume      =  IX, 1998| issue = 3 | pages =14<U+2013>19 | publisher = Design Management Institute | isbn =  | issn=  | url= http://www.dmi.org |format =  | accessdate  = February 2000 | quote= }}</ref>

====Design management tasks====
Similar tasks can be grouped into categories to describe the job profile of a design manager. Cooper and Press (2005) identify in their management model five different categories in management that encompass design. Design managers face different tasks on strategic, tactical and operational level in the following categories.<ref name="Cooper and Press 2005"/>

* vision / mission
* strategy / policy formation
* goals / targets / objectives
* planning / scheduling / resourcing
* activity / monitoring / evaluation

====Design management authority & position====
The authority and position of the design management function has a huge influence on what the design manager does in his or her  daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by its organisational function:<ref name="Kootstra 2006"/>

* '''Design management as line function'''
:Design management as a line function is directly responsible for design execution in the <U+201C>primary<U+201D> organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line is the extensive authority and the direct responsibility for the result.
* '''Design management as staff function'''
:Design management as staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the <U+201C>primary<U+201D> organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function is their limited authority and their function to consult line managers and staff.
* '''Design management as support function'''
:When the design process is defined as a <U+201C>secondary<U+201D> organisational process, design management is seen as supportive function. In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R&D and communication.<ref name="Kootstra 2006"/>

==Education==
Design management was first taught on a business school, since teaching design to managers is pioneered at the London Business School in 1976 and the first program of design management on a design school started in the 1980s at the Royal College of Art, DeMontfort, Middlesex, Staffordshire. Although in the UK many of the courses have not been sustainable, for instance the RSA course was closed, so was the Westminster MBA.However other courses came through and continue for example Brunel, Salford, and Lancaster. Today, design management is much less common in business universities as it is in design universities. The BusinessWeek publishes every year a list of the best programs that combines design thinking with business thinking ([http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/dschools_2009/ D-schools 2009] and [http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/dschools_2009/programs_to_watch.asp D-school programs to watch 2009]).

==Current Debates==
===Design management versus design leadership===
In the daily business, design managers often operate in the area of [[design leadership]]. However, design management and [[design leadership]] are not interchangeable, but interdependent.

Like  management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of [[Objective (goal)|objective]]s, accomplishments and outcomes. Design leadership is ''pro-active'': it leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates [[communication]] and collaboration through [[motivation]] and [[enthusiasm]], sets ambitions and points out the future direction to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is ''re-active'' and responds to a given [[business]] situation by using specific skills, tools, methods and techniques. Design management and [[design leadership]] are interdependent: design management needs [[design leadership]] to ''know where to go'' and [[design leadership]] needs design management to know ''how to get there''.

===Other current debates===
* Design management versus brand management
* Design management performance & efficiency
* Design thinking versus managerial thinking
* Design management in innovation management
