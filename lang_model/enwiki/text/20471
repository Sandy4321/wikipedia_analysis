'''''Champions of Krynn''''' is the first in a three-part series of ''[[Dragonlance]]'' ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' "[[Gold Box]]" [[computer role-playing game]]s.  The game was released in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

==Story==

The adventure begins at an outpost near Throtl, the capital city of the Hobgoblins.  The party soon meets a group of Baaz [[Draconian (Dragonlance)|Draconians]] ambushing some good settlers.  After the battle, a greater Aurak Draconian named Myrtani shows up, and steals an ancient book.  Myrtani teleports away, ignoring the party.  The party then reports the events to Sir Karl.  Sir Karl realizes that the evil forces are not at all weakened as was believed, and the party sets out to investigate and defeat Myrtani and his forces.

==Gameplay==

To play ''Champions of Krynn'', one simply needs to create characters and form a party. The gameplay basics are identical to all games in the series.  There is no character-transferring system in this game, as it is the first.  Characters from ''Champions of Krynn'' may be transferred to the sequel, ''[[Death Knights of Krynn]]''.

==Game differences==

''Champions of Krynn'' does bear similarities to the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' series of games in its gameplay and graphics.

Graphics are about on par with ''[[Secret of the Silver Blades]]'', and everything is drawn in 16 colors.

The game offers additional races one may choose, including [[Kender]], Qualinesti Elves, Silvanesti Elves, Hill Dwarves, and Mountain Dwarves.

Mages may also benefit from the phases of the moons.  Good mages benefit from [[Solinari]], for example.

Clerics can choose one from a handful of [[List of Dragonlance deities|deities]] in this game, and may receive varying bonuses depending on the choice.

Instead of the Paladin, the [[Knight of Solamnia]] is a [[Character class|class]] one can choose.

[[Draconian (Dragonlance)|Draconians]] are very common enemies in the game, and all five types are seen.  The game does a pretty faithful job in implementing their death throes as they appear in the ''Dragonlance'' novels and RPG supplements.  In the PC version of the game, any weapons encased in a dead Baaz will be available after combat in the character's inventory screen.  The player must re-equip the recovered weapons.

The arrow keys are conveniently usable to select menu options as opposed to using hotkeys, which was the only way in two of the earlier ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' titles, though the hotkey option is still available for many menus.

There are two known versions for MS-DOS:<br /><br />
