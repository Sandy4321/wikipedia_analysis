==Background==

The island of [[Hispaniola]] shared by Haiti and the [[Dominican Republic]] is seismically active and has experienced significantly destructive tremors in the past. An earthquake previously struck in 1751 when the island was still under French control, and yet [[1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake|another struck in 1770]]. According to French historian [[M<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Louis <U+00C9>lie Moreau de Saint-M<U+00E9>ry|Moreau de Saint-M<U+00E9>ry]] (1750<U+2013>1819), "only one masonry building had not collapsed" in [[Port-au-Prince]] following the 18 October 1751 earthquake, but "the whole city collapsed" during the earthquake of 3 June 1770. Another earthquake hit the city of [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien]] and other towns in the northern part of Haiti and the [[Dominican Republic]], which were destroyed on 7 May 1842.<ref>{{Citation |first=Claude |last=Prepetit |url=http://www.bme.gouv.ht/risques%20geologiques/LeMatin_s%E9ismes.pdf |title={{lang|fr|Tremblements de terre en Ha<U+00EF>ti, mythe ou r<U+00E9>alit<U+00E9> ?}} |work=Le Matin |volume=N<U+00B0> 33082 |date=9 October 2008 }}, quoting {{Citation |authorlink=M<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Louis <U+00C9>lie Moreau de Saint-M<U+00E9>ry |last=Moreau de Saint-M<U+00E9>ry |first=M<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Louis <U+00C9>lie |title={{lang|fr|Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie fran<U+00E7>aise de l<U+2019>Ile Saint Domingue}} }} and {{Citation |author=J.

A 1992 earthquake hazard study by C. DeMets and M.

Since the quake occurred under land rather than water, structures and people on the surface were directly exposed to the tremors, particularly since the fault was quite shallow.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8455629.stm|title=Haiti earthquake feared to have killed many |date=13 January 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

Dark areas are in compression, light areas in tension, and North is up. Arrows show [[Sinistral and dextral|left-lateral]] relative motion along the fault, and the fault plane lies along the transition from dark to light between the two arrows. This motion is due to the Caribbean Plate (south, bottom) moving to the east with respect to the North American Plate (north, top).]]
The quake occurred in the vicinity of the northern boundary where the [[Caribbean plate|Caribbean]] [[tectonic plate]] shifts eastwards by about 20&nbsp;mm per year relative to the [[North American plate]]. The [[strike-slip fault]] system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the [[Septentrional-Orient fault zone|Septentrional fault]] in the north and the [[Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone|Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault]] in the south; [[seismology|seismic]] data suggests that the January 2010 quake was on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault, which had been locked solid for 250 years, gathering [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].

== Living conditions in the aftermath ==
