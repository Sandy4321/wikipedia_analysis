The '''State University of New York''', abbreviated '''SUNY''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>su<U+02D0>ni<U+02D0>}}) is a system of public institutions of higher education in [[New York]], [[United States]]. It is the largest comprehensive system of [[universities]], [[colleges]], and [[community college]]s in the world,<ref name='SUNY1'> {{cite web|url=http://www.suny.edu/student/university_suny_history.cfm |title=Short History of SUNY |accessdate=2009-04-05 |work=The State University of New York |publisher=[[SUNY]] }}</ref> with a total enrollment of 438,361 students, plus 1.1 million [[adult education|continuing education]] students spanning 64 campuses across the state. The SUNY system has 83,547 faculty members and some 6,650 degree and certificate programs overall. SUNY includes many institutions and four University Centers: [[University at Albany, The State University of New York|Albany]] (1844), [[Binghamton University|Binghamton]] (1946), [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo]] (1846), and [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|Stony Brook]] (1957) and Syracuse (Upstate University). [[SUNY System Administration Building|SUNY's administrative offices]] are in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

The State University of New York was established in 1948 by then-Governor of New York, [[Thomas E. Dewey]], through legislative implementation of recommendations made by the Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University (1946-1948). The Commission was chaired by [[Owen D. Young]], then-Chairman of the [[General Electric Company]]. The system was greatly expanded during the administration of Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who took a personal interest in design and construction of new SUNY facilities across the state.

SUNY comprises all institutions of higher education statewide that are state-supported, with the exception of the institutions that are units of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).

== Organization ==
SUNY is governed by a Board of Trustees, which consists of sixteen members, fifteen of whom are appointed by the [[Governor of New York|Governor]], with consent of the [[New York Legislature|New York State Senate]]. The sixteenth member is the President of the [[SUNY Student Assembly]]. The Board of Trustees appoints the Chancellor who serves as SUNY Chief Executive Officer.  The  SUNY Chancellor is  Nancy L. Zimpher.

The state of New York assists in financing the SUNY system, which, along with [[CUNY]], provides lower-cost college-level education to residents of the state. SUNY students also come from out-of-state and 171 foreign countries, though tuition is higher for these students.

There are a large variety of colleges in the SUNY system with some overlap in specialties from site to site. SUNY divides its campuses into four distinct categories: university centers/doctoral-granting institutions, university colleges, technology colleges, and community colleges.  SUNY also has a unique relationship with its [[statutory college]]s which embeds state-owned, state-funded colleges within other institutions such as [[Cornell University]] and [[Alfred University]].  Students at the statutory  colleges have the benefit of state-subsidized tuition while receiving all of the campus life amenities of the host institutions.

SUNY and the City University of New York are entirely different university systems, despite the fact that both are public institutions which receive funding from New York State. Also, SUNY is not to be confused with the [[University of the State of New York]] (USNY), which is the governmental umbrella organization for most education-related institutions and many education-related personnel (both public and private) in New York State, and which includes, as a component, the New York State Education Department.

== Athletics ==
Every school within the SUNY system manages its own athletics program, which greatly varies the level of competition at each institution.

===Division I===
*The four university centers all compete at the [[Division I]] level for all of their sports. All but Binghamton field [[American football]] teams, with Buffalo in [[Division I-FBS]] (formerly Division I-A) and Albany and Stony Brook in [[Division_I-FBS#Football_Championship_Subdivision|Division I-FCS]] (formerly Division I-AA).  The four Cornell statutory colleges compete as a part of the [[Ivy League]].
**A small number of community college compete at the [[NJCAA Div. 1]] level

===Division II and III===
*Most SUNY colleges, technical schools and community schools compete at the NCAA or [[NJCAA]] Div. II or III level.

===Rivalries===
The most prominent SUNY rivalry is between the Albany Great Danes and Binghamton Bearcats.  The two both belong to the [[America East]] athletic conference. Frequently referred to as the ''I-88 Rivalry'', Binghamton and Albany sit at either end of Interstate 88 (roughly 2.5 hours apart).  Both teams are known to post the highest visitor attendance at either school's athletic events.

SUNY Oswego and SUNY Plattsburgh also share a notable rivalry in Division 3 Hockey, with that game almost always having the SUNYAC regular season title up for grabs.

SUNY Cobleskill and SUNY Delhi rivalry is mainly involving basketball, cross country, and previously track, although Cobleskill track and field competes at the NCAA Division III level starting spring 2009.  They are in fairly close proximity to each other.  The SUNY Delhi 2003-2004 basketball season was canceled after a basketball game was called with 48 seconds left after several SUNY Delhi basketball players nearly started a brawl in the Ioro Gymnasium at SUNY Cobleskill on Wednesday February 4th 2004.
