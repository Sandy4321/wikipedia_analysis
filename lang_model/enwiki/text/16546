An '''insertion reaction''' is a [[chemical reaction]] where one chemical entity (a [[molecule]] or molecular fragment) interposes itself into an existing [[Chemical bond|bond]] of typically a second chemical entity ''e.g.'': 

:<span style="color:red;">A</span>  +  <span style="color:blue;">B&ndash;C</span>    <U+2192>    <span style="color:blue;">B&ndash;</span><span style="color:red;">A</span><span style="color:blue;">&ndash;C</span>

The term only refers to the result of the reaction and does not suggest a mechanism.  Insertion reactions are observed in [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], and [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] chemistry.  In cases where a metal-[[ligand]] bond in a [[coordination complex]] is involved, these reactions are typically organometallic in nature and involve a bond between a [[transition metal]] and a [[carbon]] or [[hydrogen]].<ref name="DMA">{{cite book|last=Douglas, McDaniel, and Alexander|title=Concepts and Models of Inorganic Chemistry 3rd Ed|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-471-62978-8}}</ref>    It is usually reserved for the case where the [[coordination number]] and [[oxidation state]] of the metal remain unchanged.<ref name="Brown">{{cite book|title=The chemistry of the metal-carbon bond, vol. 2|year=1985|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|author=J.J. Alexander|authorlink=Insertions into transition metal-carbon bonds|editor=Hartley and Patai}}</ref>  When these reactions are reversible, the removal of the small molecule from the metal-ligand bond is called extrusion or elimination.
[[File:Insertions 1'1&1'2.gif|thumb|center|300px|Examples of type 1,1 (a) and 1,2 (b) resulting geometries for insertion reactions]]

There are two common insertion geometries<U+2014> 1,1 and 1,2 (pictured above). Additionally, the inserting molecule can act either as a [[nucleophile]] or as an [[electrophile]] to the metal complex.<ref name=Brown />  These behaviors will be discussed in more detail for [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], nucleophilic behavior, and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]], electrophilic behavior.

==Organometallic chemistry==
{{main|migratory insertion}}
Many reactions in organometallic chemistry involve insertion of one ligand (L) into a metal-hydride or metal-alkyl/aryl bond.  Generally it is the hydride, alkyl, or aryl group that migrates onto L, which is often CO, an alkene, or alkyne.

===Carbonylations===
The insertion of carbon monoxide and alkenes into metal-carbon bonds is a widely exploited reaction with major industrial applications.<ref>Elschenbroich, C. <U+201D>Organometallics<U+201D> (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-527-29390-2</ref><ref>Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. ISBN 1-891389-53-X</ref>

[[File:Square Planar.png|thumb|center|800px|Nucleophilic insertion and rearrangement of a square planar complex]]
Such reactions are subject to the usual parameters that affect other reactions in coordination chemistry, but [[steric effects]] are especially important in determining the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of the reactions. The reverse reaction, the de-insertion of CO and alkenes, are of fundamental significance in many catalytic cycles as well.

Widely employed applications of migratory insertion of carbonyl groups are [[hydroformylation]] and the carbonylative production of acetic acid.  The former converts alkenes, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide into aldehydes.  The production of acetic acid by carbonylation proceeds via two similar industrial processes.  More traditional is the rhodium-based [[Monsanto process|Monsanto acetic acid process]], but this process has been superseded by the iridium-based [[Cativa process]].<ref name = "Cativa">{{cite journal|title = The Cativa<sup>TM</sup> Process for the Manufacture of Acetic Acid|author =  Jones, J.

:[[File:Cativa-process-catalytic-cycle.png|center|400px|The catalytic cycle of the Cativa process]]

The Cativa process [[catalytic cycle]], shown above, includes both insertion and de-insertion steps.  The oxidative addition reaction of [[methyl iodide]] with ('''1''') involves the formal insertion of the iridium(I) centre into the carbon-iodine bond, whereas step ('''3''') to ('''4''') is an example of migratory insertion of carbon monoxide into the iridium-carbon bond.  The active catalyst species is regenerated by the [[reductive elimination]] of [[acetyl iodide]] from ('''4'''), a de-insertion reaction.<ref name = "Cativa" />

===Olefin insertion===
The insertion of ethylene and propylene into titanium alkyls is the cornerstone of [[Ziegler-Natta catalysis]], the commercial route of polyethylene and polypropylene.  This technology mainly involves heterogeneous catalysts, but it is widely assumed that the principles and observations on homogeneous systems are applicable to the solid-state versions.  Related technologies include the [[Shell Higher Olefin Process]] which produces [[detergent]] precursors.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|author = Crabtree, R.

===Other insertion reactions in coordination chemistry===
Many electrophilic oxides insert into metal carbon bonds; these include [[sulfur dioxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and nitric oxide.  These reactions have limited practical significance, but are of historic interest.  With transition metal alkyls, these oxides behave as electrophiles and insert into the bond between metals and their relatively nucleophilic alkyl ligands. As discussed in the article on [[Metal sulfur dioxide complex]]es, the insertion of SO<sub>2</sub> has been examined in particular detail.
