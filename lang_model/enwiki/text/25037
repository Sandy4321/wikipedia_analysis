The '''Croatian special police order of battle in 1991<U+2013>95''' consisted of up to 30 individual [[special forces]] units subordinated to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Ministry of the Interior]]. The special police was created around the existing airborne special forces unit of the Ministry of the Interior following an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]] in August 1990, and increasing involvement of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] in the conflict that escalated into the [[Croatian War of Independence]] in 1991, when the special police took part in the first clashes of the war in [[Pakrac clash|Pakrac]] and at the [[Plitvice Lakes incident|Plitvice Lakes]]. By then, the 3,000-strong special force became the most effective fighting force of [[Croatia]] as it had no army.

Even though several special police units were transformed into the [[Croatian National Guard]] (later renamed the [[Croatian Army]]) in 1991, the special police continued to operate throughout the war as special forces units supporting virtually all army operations. The last large deployment of the special police in the war occurred in [[Operation Storm]] in August 1995, when the force contributed 3,100 troops to the offensive. During the war, the special police units sustained a loss of 179 killed, 790 wounded and 14 missing troops.

==Establishment==
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions worsened. The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] ({{lang|hr|''Jugoslavenska narodna armija''}} <U+2013> JNA) confiscated Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] ({{lang|hr|''Teritorijalna obrana''}} - TO) weapons to minimize resistance.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=117}} On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an [[Log Revolution|open revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]],{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=118}} centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around Knin,{{sfn|The New York Times|19 August 1990}} parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[eastern Croatia]].{{sfn|ICTY|12 June 2007}}

In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled [[Law enforcement in Croatia|police personnel]] to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve battalions adopting [[special forces]] military organisation.{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=86}} The first special police unit established in the 1990s was the [[Lu<U+010D>ko Anti-Terrorist Unit]] (ATU).{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=103}} Its ranks were largely filled through selection of police officers trained Zagreb in 1990 and a comparably small number of a special forces unit of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Ministry of the Interior]] in existence before the 1990s.{{sfn|Biland<U+017E>i<U+0107>|Milkovi<U+0107>|2009|p=43}} The first commanding officer of the Lu<U+010D>ko ATU was Marko Luki<U+0107>.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=103}} The special police were visually distinguished from the rest of the police by gradual introduction of a distinct type of green uniform and a [[shoulder sleeve insignia]], worn on the right sleeve, whose design was inspired by the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] insignia.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|2006|p=49}}

In late 1991, the Ministry of the Interior established the Special Police Department to facilitate efficient command and control of the special police. In 1994, the department was reorganised into the Special Police Sector of the ministry due to expanding scope of operations, including planning and oversight of training processes. Joint Special Police Force framework was set up by the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia]] in order to improve integration of the special police into military operations.{{sfn|Biland<U+017E>i<U+0107>|Milkovi<U+0107>|2009|p=43}} In major offensives, such as [[Operation Storm]], when the force fielded 3,100 troops, the special police was directly subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces.{{sfn|Marijan|2007|p=76}}

Special Police Airborne Unit was already in existence since 1968. On 17 August 1990, the unit was deployed to quell Croatian Serb insurrection in and around Knin using three helicopters as the single combat capable unit of [[Croatian military]]. Two [[Yugoslav Air Force]] fighters intercepted the helicopters and forced them to land in [[Ogulin]] instead.{{sfn|Index.hr|18 August 2003}} The day is now considered to be the date when the first unit of the Croatian special police was founded. The bulk of the additional special police units were set up between September 1990 and September 1991.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=103}}{{sfn|Nazor|2007|pp=107-109}} The special police took part in all military operations in the Croatian War of Independence.

In November 1991, the Ministry of the Interior redefined organisation of the special police force, retaining few units under direct control of the ministry and assigning others to [[Counties of Croatia|county]] police administrations.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=105}} The move was devised in response to [[1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|advance of the JNA]].{{sfn|Biland<U+017E>i<U+0107>|Milkovi<U+0107>|2009|p=43}} The scheme included establishment of a SPU in each of the 20 county police administrations. At the time, there were 19 SPUs assigned to the county police administrations.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|pp=107-109}} The scheme defined that Karlovac, Gospi<U+0107>, Osijek, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb SPUs shall consist of 180 troops each. Rijeka, Sisak, Bjelovar and <U+0160>ibenik SPUs were scheduled to comprise 150 troops each, while Split, Zadar, Kutina, Vinkovci, <U+017D>upanja and Vukovar SPUs were planned as 120-strong units. The smallest, 100-strong units were required in [[Pula]], [[Vara<U+017E>din]], [[Zabok]] and [[Dubrovnik]]. Overall, the scheme called for 2,620 active special police troops in the regionally organised units alone,{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=105}} and defined that each of the units shall have a matching number of reserve troops.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|p=106}} By early 1993, no additional SPUs were set up regardless of the November 1991 reorganisation scheme. Two additional SPUs were set up and assigned to the [[Koprivnica-Kri<U+017E>evci County|Koprivnica-Kri<U+017E>evci]] and [[Po<U+017E>ega-Slavonia County|Po<U+017E>ega-Slavonia]] police administrations in 1993.{{sfn|Nazor|2007|pp=107-109}}
