A '''fiber roll''' is a temporary [[erosion control]] and [[sediment control]] device used on [[construction]] sites to protect [[water quality]] in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and bays. It is made of [[straw]], [[coconut]] fiber or similar material formed into a tubular roll.  Fiber rolls are installed on slopes or at the base of slopes below the active construction area, before [[soil]] disturbance (earth moving) begins.  They are installed in shallow trenches 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep, and fastened to the ground with wooden stakes. During rain storms, the rolls intercept [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] and reduce the velocity of flows, which reduces [[erosion]].  Fiber rolls are also effective at trapping [[sediment]], generally more effectively than [[straw bale]]s.<ref>[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
