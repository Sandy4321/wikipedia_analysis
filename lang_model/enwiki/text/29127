'''Francisco V<U+00E1>squez de Coronado y Luj<U+00E1>n''' (1510 &ndash; 22 September 1554) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]], who visited [[New Mexico]] and other parts of what are now the southwestern [[United States]] between 1540 and 1542. Coronado had hoped to conquer the mythical [[Seven Cities of Gold (myth)|Seven Cities of Gold]].

==Early life==

Coronado was born into a rich family in Salamanca, Spain, in 1510, the second son of Juan V<U+00E1>squez de Coronado y Sosa de Ulloa and Isabel de Luj<U+00E1>n. Juan V<U+00E1>squez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured [[Emirate of Granada]] under I<U+00F1>igo L<U+00F3>pez de Mendoza, its first Spanish governor.<ref name=Flint>[http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=466 Richard Flint and Shirley Cushing Flint.

Francisco V<U+00E1>squez de Coronado went to [[Mexico]] in 1535 at about age 25, in the entourage of its first [[Viceroy]], [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the son of his father's patron.<ref name=Flint/> In Mexico, he married Beatriz de Estrada, called ''the Saint'' (''la Santa''), sister of Leonor de Estrada, ancestor of the de Alvarado family and daughter of [[Treasurer]] and [[Governor]] Alonso de Estrada y Hidalgo, Lord of [[Pic<U+00F3>n]], and wife Marina Flores Guti<U+00E9>rrez de la Caballer<U+00ED>a, from a [[converso]] [[Sefardi Jews|Jewish]] family.<ref>[http://pages.prodigy.net/bluemountain1/estrada1.htm estrada1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Coronado inherited a large portion of a Mexican estate from Beatriz and had eight children by her. <!-- It has been affirmed repeatedly and unfoundly that Beatriz's father was a bastard son of King [[Ferdinand V of Castile]], the Catholic, but no documentary proof exists to prove this assertion. -- comment hidden as I can find no reliable source on either side of this question, just lots of blogs and such. -->

==Mounting the expedition==
Coronado was the conqueror and Governor of the Kingdom of [[Nueva Galicia]] (New Galicia, a province of New Spain located northwest of Mexico and comprising the contemporary [[Mexican state]]s of [[Jalisco]], [[Sinaloa]] and [[Nayarit]]). In 1539, he dispatched Friar [[Marcos de Niza]] and [[Estevanico]], a survivor of the [[Narv<U+00E1>ez expedition]], on an expedition north from [[Compostela, Nayarit|Compostela]], in the present state of [[Nayarit]], toward [[New Mexico]]. When Marcos de Niza returned, he told about a city of vast wealth, a golden city called [[Quivira and C<U+00ED>bola|C<U+00ED>bola]], and that Estevanico had been killed by the Zuni citizens of C<U+00ED>bola. Though he did not claim to have entered the city of C<U+00ED>bola, he claimed that the city stood on a high hill, that it was made of gold, and that he could see the Pacific Ocean off to the west.

Coronado assembled an expedition with two components. One component carried the bulk of the expedition's supplies, and traveled by guadelope river under the leadership of Hernando de Alarcon.<ref>Winship. P. 39-40</ref> The other component traveled by land, along the trail Friar Marcos de Niza had used. Coronado and Viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]] invested large sums of their own money in the venture. Mendoza, Coronado's friend and fellow investor, appointed him as the commander of the expedition, with the mission to find the seven golden cities and take their gold. This is the reason he pawned his wife's estates and was lent 70,000 more pesos.

In the autumn of 1539, Viceroy Mendoza ordered Melchor Diaz, the commander of San Miguel de [[Culiac<U+00E1>n]], to investigate Friar de Niza's findings, and on November 17, 1539 Diaz departed on the trail to C<U+00ED>bola, with fifteen horsemen.<ref name="autogenerated1">Winship. P. 38</ref> At the ruins of Chichilticalli, he turned around because of "snows and fierce winds from across the wilderness".<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Diaz encountered Coronado before he had departed San Miguel de Culiac<U+00E1>n, and reported that initial investigations into Friar de Niza's report disproved the existence of a bountiful land. Diaz' report was delivered to Viceroy Mendoza on March 20, 1540.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Coronado set out from Compostela on February 23, 1540, at the head of a large expedition composed of 335 Spaniards, 1300 natives, four Franciscan monks (the most notable of whom were [[Juan de Padilla]] and the newly appointed [[provincial superior]] of the Franciscan order in the New World, Marcos de Niza), and several slaves, both natives and Africans<ref>Winship. P. 32-4, 37</ref> [[Image:Coronado expedition.jpg|thumb|left|600px|The Coronado Expedition 1540&ndash;1542]]
He followed the Sinaloan coast northward, keeping the [[Sea of Cortez]] to his left until he reached the northernmost Spanish settlement, San Miguel de Culiac<U+00E1>n, about March 28, 1540, whereupon he rested his expedition before they began trekking the inland trail on April 22, 1540.<ref>Winship. P. 38, 40</ref> Aside from Diaz's mission to verify Fray de Niza's report, he also took notice of the forage and food situation along the trail, and he reported that the land along the route would not be able to support a large concentrated body of soldiers and animals. Coronado decided to divide his expedition into small groups and time their departures so that grazing lands and water holes along the trail could recover. At intervals along the trail, Coronado established camps and garrisoned soldiers to keep the supply route open. For example, in September, 1540, Melchior Diaz along with "seventy or eighty of the weakest and least reliable men" in Coronado's army remained at the town of San Hieronimo, in the valley of Corzones or Hearts.<ref>Winship. P. 60</ref> Once the scouting and planning was done, Coronado led the first group of soldiers up the trail. They were horsemen and foot soldiers who were able to travel quickly, while the main bulk of the expedition would set out, at intervals, later.

After "leaving Culiacan on April 22, Coronado followed the coast, "bearing off to the left," as Mota Padilla says, by an extremely rough way, to the Cinaloa. The configuration of the country made it necessary to follow up the valley of this stream until he could find a passage across the mountains to the course of the Yaquimi. He traveled alongside this stream for some distance, then crossed to Sonora river. The Sonora was followed nearly to its source before a pass was discovered. On the southern side of the mountains he found a stream he called the ''Nexpa'', which may have been either the Santa Cruz or the Pedro of modern maps. The party followed down this river valley until they reached the edge of the wilderness, where, as Friar Marcos had described it to them, they found Chichilticalli.<ref>Winship. P. 40-1</ref> Chichilticalli is in southern Arizona in the Sulfur Springs Valley, within the bend of the Dos Cabeza and [[Chiricahua Mountains]]. This fits the chronicle of Laus Deo description, which reports that "at Chichilticalli the country changes its character again and the spiky vegetation ceases. The reason is that the gulf reaches as far up as this place, and the mountain chain changes its direction at the same time that the coast does. Here they had to cross and pass the mountains in order to get into the level country".<ref>Winship. P. 143</ref> There he met a crushing disappointment. C<U+00ED>bola was nothing like the great golden city that Marcos had described. Instead, it was just a complex of simple [[pueblo]]s constructed by the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] Indians. The soldiers considered killing Marcos for his mendacious imagination, but Coronado intervened and sent him back to [[Mexico]] in disgrace.

==Conquest of C<U+00ED>bola==
Coronado traversed Arizona's [[Mogoll<U+00F3>n Rim]], and from the headwaters of the Little Colorado he continued on until he came to the [[Zuni River]]. He followed the Zuni until he found the region inhabited by the [[Zuni (tribe)|Zunis]]. The members of the expedition were almost starving and demanded entrance into the village of [[Hawikuh Ruins|Hawikuh]]. The natives refused, denying the expedition entrance to the village or trade. Coronado and his frustrated soldiers entered Hawikuh on Coronado's demands, when the Spanish requested intelligence and resources. The ensuing skirmish constituted the extent of what can be called the Spanish "Conquest of C<U+00ED>bola." During the battle, Coronado was injured and had to stay with the Zuni while healing. From the knowledge gathered during this time he sent out several more scouting expeditions.

The first scouting expedition was led by [[Pedro de Tovar]]. This expedition headed northwest to the Hopi villages, which they recorded as ''Tusayan''. Upon arrival, the Spanish were denied entrance to the village they came across, and once again resorted to using force to enter. Afterwards, the remaining villages dared to fight the Spanish, but held a meeting and decided not to. Materially, the Hopi region was just as poor as the Zuni, but the Spanish did find out that a large river (the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]]) lay in the west.

The scouting party returned to Zuni territory and reported their findings. Coronado sent another scouting expedition led by [[Garcia Lopez de C<U+00E1>rdenas]] to find the Colorado River. This expedition returned to Hopi territory to acquire scouts and supplies that could be used to find this river. Members of this expedition reached the [[Grand Canyon]] and the Colorado River, becoming the first Europeans to see the magnificent canyon.

After trying and failing to climb down into the Grand Canyon to reach the river below, the expedition reported that they would not be able to use the Colorado to link up with their ships. After this, the main body of the expedition began its journey to the next populated center of pueblos, along the [[Rio Grande]] River in [[New Mexico]].

{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}

==Exploration of the Colorado River==
Three leaders affiliated with the Coronado Expedition were able to reach the Colorado River. The first was [[Hernando de Alarc<U+00F3>n]], then [[Melchior D<U+00ED>az]] and lastly Don Garcia Lopez de Cardenas. Alarc<U+00F3>n's fleet was tasked to carry supplies and to establish contact with the main body of Coronado's expedition, but was unable to do so because of the extreme distance to Cibola. He traveled up the Colorado river until the river entered the lower half of the Grand Canyon. In this exploration he hauled some supplies for Coronado, but eventually he buried them with a note in a bottle. Melchior D<U+00ED>az was sent down from Cibola by Coronado take charge of the camp of Corazones and to establish contact with the fleet. Soon after arriving at the camp he set out from the valley of Corazones in Sonora and traveled overland in a north/northwesterly direction until he arrived at the junction of the [[Colorado River]] and [[Gila River]]. There the local natives, probably the CocoMaricopa (see Seymour 2007b), told him that Alarc<U+00F3>n's sailors had buried supplies and left a note in a bottle. The supplies were retrieved and the note stated that Alarc<U+00F3>n's men had rowed up the river as far as they could, searching in vain for the Coronado expedition. They had given up and decided to return to their departure point because worms were eating holes in their ships. D<U+00ED>az named the river the "Firebrand (Tison) River" because the natives used firebrands to keep their body warm in the winter. D<U+00ED>az died on the trip back to the camp in the valley of the Corazones. Don Garcia Lopez de Cardenas saw the Colorado River from the rim of the South Rim of the Grand Canyon while looking for a route that would connect them with Alarc<U+00F3>n's fleet.

==The Tiguex War==
[[Hernando de Alvarado]] was sent to the east, and found several villages around the [[Rio Grande]]. Coronado set up his winter quarters in one of them, [[Tiguex]], which is across the river from present-day [[Bernalillo]] near [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. During the winter of 1540-41, his army found themselves in conflicts with the Rio Grande natives, conflicts which led to the brutal [[Tiguex War]]. This war resulted in the destruction of the Tiguex pueblos and the death of hundreds of Native Americans.

==The Search for Quivira==

From an Indian the Spanish called "the Turk," Coronado heard of a wealthy civilization called [[Quivira]] far to the east. In spring 1541 he led his army and priests and Indian allies onto the [[Great Plains]] to search for Quivira. The Turk was probably either a [[Wichita]] or a [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and his intention seems to have been to lead Coronado astray and hope that he got lost in the wilderness.

[[Image:Francisco Coronado picture IMG 4884.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Coronado as depicted at the [[Deaf Smith County Historical Museum]] in [[Hereford, Texas|Hereford]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]]]]

With the Turk guiding him, Coronado and his army crossed the flat and featureless steppe called the [[Llano Estacado]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]], passing through the present-day communities of [[Hereford, Texas|Hereford]] and [[Canadian, Texas|Canadian]]. The Spanish were awed by the Llano. "The country they [the buffalo] traveled over was so smooth that if one looked at them the sky could be seen between their legs." Men and horses became lost in the featureless plain and Coronado felt like he had been swallowed up by the sea.<ref>Winship, George Parker (Ed. and Translator) ''The Journey of Coronado, 1540-1542, from the City of Mexico to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the Buffalo Plains of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, As Told by Himself and his Followers.'' New York: A.S. Barnes & Co, 1904, 142-215</ref>

On the Llano, Coronado encountered vast herds of [[bison]]--the American buffalo. <U+201C>I found such a quantity of cows...that it is impossible to number them, for while I was journeying through these plains...there was not a day that I lost sight of them.<U+201D><ref>Winship, 214</ref>

==The Querechos and the Teyas==

Coronado found a settlement of Indians he called [[Querechos]]. The Querechos were not awed or impressed by the Spanish, their weapons, and their "big dogs" (horses). "They did nothing unusual when they saw our army, except to come out of their tents to look at us, after which they came to talk to the advance guard, and asked who we were."<ref>Winship, 65</ref> As Coronado described them, the Querechos were nomads, following the buffalo herds on the plains. The Querechos were numerous. Chroniclers mentioned one settlement of two hundred tipis<U+2014>which implies a population of more than one thousand people living together for at least part of the year. Authorities agree that the Querechos (Becquerel's) were [[Apache]] Indians.<ref>Riley, Carroll L., ''Rio del Norte'', Salt Lake City: U of Utah Press, 1995, 190</ref> 

Coronado left the Querechos behind and continued southeast in the direction in which the Turk told him that Quivira was located. He and his army descended off the tabletop of the Llano Estacado into the [[Caprock Escarptment|caprock]] canyon country. He soon met with another group of Indians, the [[Teyas]], enemies of the Querechos.

The Teyas, like the Querechos, were numerous and buffalo hunters, although they had additional resources. The canyons they inhabited had trees and flowing streams and they grew or foraged for beans, but apparently not corn because one of the Coronado chroniclers would probably have mentioned it if the Teyas had grown corn. The Spanish, however noted the presence of mulberries, roses, grapes, walnuts, and plums.<ref>Winship, 70</ref>

An intriguing event was Coronado's meeting among the Teyas an old blind bearded man who said that he had met many years before "four others like us." He was probably talking about [[Cabeza de Vaca]] who with three shipmates made his way across southern Texas a decade before Coronado.<ref>Winship, 232</ref>

Scholars differ in their opinions as to which historical Indian group were the Teyas. A plurality believe they were [[Caddoan]] speakers and related to the Wichita.<ref>Flint, Richard. No Settlement, No Conquest, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 2008, 157. For a contrary view, see Riley, 191-192</ref> The place where Coronado found the Teyas has also been debated. The mystery may have been cleared up<U+2014>to the satisfaction of some<U+2014>by a discovery of a likely Coronado campsite. While Coronado was in the canyon country his army suffered one of the violent climatic events so common on the plains. <U+201D>A tempest came up one afternoon with a very high wind and hail...The hail broke many tents and tattered many helmets, and wounded many of the horses, and broke all the crockery of the army, and the gourds which was no small loss."<ref>Winship, 69-70</ref>

In 1993, Jimmy Owens found crossbow points in [[Blanco Canyon]] in [[Crosby County, Texas|Crosby County]], [[Texas]], near the town of [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]] in [[Floyd County, Texas|Floyd County]]. Archaeologists subsequently searched the site and found pottery sherds, more than forty crossbow points, and dozens of horseshoe nails of Spanish manufacture, plus a Mexican-style stone blade. These finds strengthens the evidence that Coronado found the Teyas in Blanco Canyon.<ref>Flint, Richard and Flint, Shirley Cushing, eds. ''The Coronado Expedition to Tierra Nueva''. Niwot, CO: U Press of CO, 1997, 372-375</ref>The first whites to settle in the Blanco Canyon area were Henry Clay Smith and his wife, the former Elizabeth Boyle.

==Quivira==
The Teyas told Coronado that he was going the wrong direction. Quivira lay to the north. By this time, Coronado seems to have lost his confidence that fortune awaited him. He sent most of his army back to New Mexico and continued with only forty Spanish soldiers and priests and an unknown number of Indian soldiers, servants, and guides. Coronado, thus, dedicated himself to a reconnaissance rather than a mission of conquest.

After more than thirty days journey, Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and the location he reached it was probably a few miles east of present day [[Dodge City, Kansas]]. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear, but calmed down when one of Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language.

Coronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling. He found Quivira "well settled....along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another" Coronado believed that there were 25 settlements in Quivira. The Quivirans were simple people. Both men and women were nearly naked. Coronado was impressed with the size of the Quivirans and all the other Indians he met. They were "large people of very good build."<ref>Winship, 113, 209, 215, 234-237</ref> Coronado spent twenty-five days among the Quivirans trying to learn of richer kingdoms just over the horizon. He found nothing but straw-thatched villages of up to two hundred houses and fields containing corn, beans, and squash. A copper bell was the only evidence of wealth he discovered. The Quivirans were almost certainly the ancestors of the Wichita people.<ref>Bolton, 293 and many subsequent scholars</ref>

Coronado was escorted to the further edge of Quivira, called Tabas, where the neighboring land of Harahey began. He summoned the "Lord of Harahey" and he with two hundred followers came to meet with the Spanish. He was disappointed. The Harahey Indians were "all naked -- with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered."<ref>Winship, 235</ref> They were not the wealthy people Coronado sought. Disappointed, he returned to New Mexico. Before leaving Quivira Coronado ordered the Turk garroted.

==Where were Quivira, Tabas, and Harahey?==
Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that Quivira was in central [[Kansas]] with the western-most village near the small town of [[Lyons, Kansas|Lyons]] on Cow Creek, extending twenty miles east to the [[Little Arkansas River]], and north another twenty miles to the town of [[Lindsborg, Kansas|Lindsborg]] on a tributary of the [[Smoky Hill River]]. Tabas was likely on the Smoky Hill River. Archaeologists have found numerous 16th century sites in these areas that probably include some of the settlements visited by Coronado.

At Harahey "was a river, with more water and more inhabitants than the other." This sounds as if Coronado may have reached the Smoky Hill River near [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]] or [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. It is a larger river than either Cow Creek or the Little Arkansas and is located at roughly the 25 league distance from Lyons that Coronado said he traveled in Quivira. The people of Harahey seem Caddoan, because "it was the same sort of a place, with settlements like these, and of about the same size" as Quivira. They were probably the ancestors of the Pawnee.<ref>Winship, 235; Wedel, Waldo R., "Archeological Remains in Central Kansas and their Possible Bearing on the Location of Quivira." ''Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections'', Vol. 101, No. 7, 1942, 1-24. Wedel lays the foundation for the location of Quivira, built on by many subsequent investigators.</ref>

==End of the expedition==
Coronado returned to New Mexico from Quivira and was badly injured in a fall from his horse on December 27, 1541 and his soldiers persuaded him to return home. Coronado and his army departed New Mexico in April 1542, leaving behind a few priests and friars.<ref>Bolton, Herbert E. ''Coronado: Knight of Pueblo and Plains'', Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1949, 330-334</ref> His expedition had been a failure. Although he remained governor of [[Nueva Galicia]] until 1544, the expedition forced him into bankruptcy. Coronado retired to [[Mexico City]], where he died on July 21, 1554.<ref>Bolton, 406</ref>

Coronado undoubtedly caused a large loss of life among the Pueblos both from the battles he fought with them and even more from the demands for food that he levied on their fragile economies. However, 40 years later when the Spanish again visited the Southwestern United States they found little evidence that Coronado had any lasting cultural influences on the Indians. See: [[The Chamuscado and Rodriguez Expedition]] and [[Antonio de Espejo]].

==Legacy==
:''Also see'' [[Coronado (disambiguation)]]

In 1952, the United States established [[Coronado National Memorial]] near [[Sierra Vista, Arizona]] to commemorate his expedition.

''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' references a Cross of Coronado. According to the film, this gold cross, discovered in a Utah cave system, was given to Coronado by [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] in 1521. It is unclear any such item ever existed. In addition, when Indy captures the cross from robbers aboard a ship off the coast of Portugal, the ship can be seen to be named the "Coronado."

In 1992, underground found footage filmmaker Craig Baldwin made the film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105037/ "O No Coronado!"] detailing the expedition of Coronado through the use of recycled images from Westerns, Conquest films and The Lone Ranger television series.

There is also a small "island" (it is really a peninsula) near [[San Diego]] named [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. Most visitors cross the [[Coronado Bridge]] to get there.

The song ''Coronado And The Turk'' from the singer-songwriter [[Steve Tilston]]'s 1992 album ''Of Moor And Mesa'' is based on the story of Coronado's expedition.

There is a large hill just northwest of Lindsborg, Kansas that is called [[Coronado Heights]]. The former owner of the land built a small castle atop the hill to commemorate Coronado's 1541 visit to the area. The castle and the area around it is now a public camping and recreation area. The soft sandstone rocks at the peak of the hill are covered in the names of past visitors to the area.
