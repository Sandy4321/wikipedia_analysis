'''Shelby Corcoran''' is a [[Recurring character|recurring]] [[fictional character]] from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] musical comedy-drama series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. Portrayed by actress [[Idina Menzel]], Shelby was introduced in the [[Hell-O (Glee)|fourteenth episode]] of the show as the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Fans had lobbied for Menzel to be cast as [[Rachel Berry]]'s ([[Lea Michele]]) biological mother, due to the strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Michele. After it is revealed that Shelby is, in fact, Rachel's biological mother, Shelby discloses that she had signed a contract that stated that she could not seek out her daughter until she was eighteen. She tells Rachel that instead of trying to act like mother and daughter, they should just be grateful that they have met, and maintain their distance.

In the [[Journey to Regionals|season one finale]], Shelby adopts [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] and [[Noah Puckerman|Puck]]'s newborn daughter, Beth. She leaves Vocal Adrenaline before the beginning of the next school year. Shelby returns in the second episode of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]], having been recruited to lead a second glee club at McKinley High by [[Sugar Motta]]'s father when Sugar is refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. Struggling at being a mother, she forms a romantic bond with Puck, but ultimately tells him that their relationship is a mistake and resigns from McKinley in the eighth episode. While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.
