'''"International Burn a Koran Day"''' is an event planned for [[September 11]], [[2010]] by [[Dove World Outreach Center]] to protest [[militant Islam]] aggression by [[book burning|burning copies]] of the [[Qur'an]]. The event was announced in July 2010 by pastor Terry Jones of the [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] [[charismatic Christianity|charismatic Christian]] church in [[Gainesville]], [[Florida]] to coincide with the ninth anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and the event has been widely condemned by politicians and religious groups.

The announcement has elicited comparisons of the church's actions with those of [[Nazi Germany]], which engaged in [[Nazi book burnings|burnings of books written by Jews, communists and others]] who did not conform to Nazi ideology, as well as the European Middle Ages/Renaissance-era [[Roman Catholic Church]], which participated in the [[Inquisition]] against persons and works which did not conform with the church's teachings.<ref>Andrea Stone, "[http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/analysis-pastor-terry-jones-plan-to-burn-quran-latest-in-long-line-of-religious-fire-starters/19623998 Plan to Burn Qurans Latest Religious Fire-Starter]", AOL News, September 7, 2010.

===Week prior to the event===

[[Indonesia]]ns took to the streets to protest the event on September 4, with thousands, mostly muslims, taking part in events across the country. Rokhmat Labib, chairman of the Islamic group [[Hizbut Tahrir]] that organized the protests, called the planned book burning a provocation and predicted that muslims would fight back should it take place. Lahib said that Muslims must not stay silent when their faith is threatened.<ref>{{Cite news|author= Schonhardt, Sara |title= Indonesian Muslims Protest Plans to Burn Koran on September 11 |url= http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Indonesian-Muslims-Protest-Plans-to-Burn-Koran-on-September-11-102250384.html |work= [[Voice of America News]] |date= September 5, 2010 |accessdate= September 7, 2010}}</ref>

General [[David Petraeus]] said "it is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems. Not just here, but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the Islamic community." On the same day hundreds of Afghans had protested in [[Kabul]] against the planned Qur'an burning event, chanting "death to America" and throwing rocks at a passing military convoy. Military officials also expressed fears that the protests would spread to other cities. Military officers at the [[the Pentagon|Pentagon]] consequently said they hoped the rare incursion into politics by a military commander would convince pastor Jones to cancel his plans. The pastor responded to Petraeus' statement that, "We understand the General's concerns. We are sure that his concerns are legitimate. [Nonetheless] [w]e must send a clear message to the radical element of Islam. We will no longer be controlled and dominated by their fears and threats."<ref>{{Cite news|author= Barnes, Julian E.; Rosenberg, Matthew; Fields, Gary |title= Petraeus Condemns U.S. Church's Plan to Burn Qurans |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703713504575475500753093116.html |work= [[Wall Street Journal]] |date= September 7, 2010 |accessdate= September 6, 2010}}</ref>
