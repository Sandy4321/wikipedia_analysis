'''Casimir IV''' [[Order of the Garter|KG]] ({{lang-pl|Kazimierz IV Jagiello<U+0144>czyk}} {{IPA-pol|ka<U+02C8><U+0291>imi<U+032F><U+025B><U+0292> ja<U+0261>i<U+032F><U+025B>l<U+02C8>l<U+0254><U+0272>t<U+0361><U+0283><U+0268>k||Pl-Kazimierz_Jagiello<U+0144>czyk.ogg}}; {{lang-lt|Kazimieras IV Jogailaitis}}; 30 November 1427 <U+2013> 7 June 1492) of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|House of Jagiellon]] was [[List of Lithuanian rulers|Grand Duke of Lithuania]] from 1440, and [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] from 1447, until his death. He was one of the most active Polish rulers, under whom Poland, by defeating the [[Teutonic Knights]] in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454<U+2013>66)|Thirteen Years' War]] recovered [[Pomerania]], and the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] became one of the leading royal houses in Europe. He was a strong opponent of aristocracy, and helped to strengthen the importance of Parliament and the Senate.<ref>[[:pl:Kazimierz IV Jagiello<U+0144>czyk]]</ref>

The great triumph of his reign was the effective and final destruction of the Teutonic Order, which brought [[Prussia]] under Polish rule.<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/casimir%20iv</ref>

Casimir was the second son of King [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II Jagie<U+0142><U+0142>o]], and the younger brother of King [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III of Varna]].

==Youth==

Casimir was the second son of King [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw II Jagie<U+0142><U+0142>o]] and his fourth wife, [[Sophia of Halshany]]. His father was already over 75 at Casimir<U+2019>s birth, and his brother [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III]], three years his senior, was expected to become king before his majority. Casimir was thus the second in succession to the throne, and, after W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw had succeeded his father in 1434, he became the legal heir. Strangely, little was done for his education; he was never taught [[Latin]], nor was he trained for the responsibilities of office, despite the fact he was the only brother of the rightful sovereign.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97968/Casimir-IV</ref>

==Grand Duke of Lithuania==

The sudden death of [[Sigismund K<U+0119>stutaitis]] left the office of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] empty. The [[Voivode of Trakai]], [[Jonas Go<U+0161>tautas]], and other magnates of Lithuania, supported Casimir as a candidate to the throne. However many Polish noblemen hoped that the thirteen-year-old boy would become a [[Vicegerent|Vice-regent]] for the Polish King in Lithuania.<ref name=Kiau>J.

Elektronin<U+0117>s leidybos namai: Vilnius.</ref> Casimir was invited by the Lithuanian magnates to Lithuania, and when he arrived in [[Vilnius]] in 1440, he was proclaimed as the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] on 29 June 1440 by the [[Council of Lords]], contrary to the wishes of the Polish noble lords<U+2014>an act supported and coordinated by Jonas Go<U+0161>tautas.<ref name=Kiau/> When the news arrived in the Kingdom of Poland concerning the proclamation of Casimir as the Grand Duke of Lithuania, it was met with hostility, even to the point of military threats against Lithuania.<ref name=Kiau/> Since the young Grand Duke was underage, the supreme control over the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was in the hands of the Council of Lords, presided by Jonas Go<U+0161>tautas. Casimir had been taught [[Lithuanian language]] and the customs of Lithuania by appointed court officials.<ref>[http://ualgiman.dtiltas.lt/vid..html#Hermanas_Vartbergietis_ Lietuvi<U+0173> kalba ir literat<U+016B>ros istorija<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During Casimir's rule the rights of the Lithuanian nobility<U+2014>dukes, magnates and [[boyar]]s (lesser nobles), irrespective of their religion and ethnicity<U+2014>were put on an equal footing to those of the Polish [[szlachta]]. Additionally, Casimir promised to protect the Grand Duchy's borders and not to appoint persons from the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385<U+2013>1569)|Polish Kingdom]] to the offices of the Grand Duchy. He accepted that decisions on matters concerning the Grand Duchy would not be made without the Council of Lords' consent. He also granted the subject region of [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitia]] the right to elect its own [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]. Casimir was the first ruler of Lithuania baptised at birth, becoming the first native Roman Catholic Grand Duke.

==King of Poland==
Casimir succeeded his brother [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III]] (killed at the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444) as King of Poland after a three-year interregnum on 25 June 1447. In 1454, he married [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of the late [[King of the Romans]] [[Albert II of Habsburg]] by his late wife [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1409<U+2013>1442)|Elisabeth of Bohemia]]. Her distant relative [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick of Habsburg]] became Holy Roman Emperor and reigned as Frederick III until after Casimir's own death. The marriage strengthened the ties between the house of Jagiellon and the sovereigns of Hungary-Bohemia and put Casimir at odds with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] through internal Habsburg rivalry.

That same year, Casimir was approached by the [[Prussian Confederation]] for aid against the [[Teutonic Order]], which he promised, by making the separatist [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] regions a protectorate of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385<U+2013>1569)|Polish Kingdom]]. However, when the insurgent cities rebelled against the Order, it resisted and the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454<U+2013>66)|Thirteen Years' War]] (1454<U+2013>1466) ensued. Casimir and the Prussian Confederation defeated the [[Teutonic Order]], taking over its capital at Marienburg ([[Malbork Castle]]). In the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]], the Order recognized Polish sovereignty over the seceded western Prussian regions, [[Royal Prussia]], and the Polish crown's overlordship over the remaining [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Monastic State]], transformed in 1525 into a duchy, [[Duchy of Prussia|Ducal Prussia]].

Elisabeth's only brother [[Ladislas the Posthumous|Ladislas, king of Bohemia and Hungary]], died in 1457, and after that Casimir and Elisabeth's dynastic interests were directed also towards her brother's former kingdoms.

King Casimir IV died on 7 June, 1492 in the [[Old Hrodna Castle]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was in a [[Union of Krewo|personal union]] with [[Poland]].

==Foreign policies==

The intervention of the [[Curia]], which hitherto had been hostile to Casimir because of his steady and patriotic resistance to papal aggression, was due to the permutations of [[European politics]]. The pope was anxious to get rid of the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, George Podebrad, as the first step towards the formation of a league against the Turk. Casimir was to be a leading factor in this combination, and he took advantage of it to procure the election of his son [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]] as King of Bohemia. But he would not commit himself too far, and his ulterior plans were frustrated by the rivalry of [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary, who even went so far as to stimulate the [[Teutonic Order]] to rise against Casimir. The death of Matthias in 1490 was a great relief to Poland, and Casimir employed the two remaining years of his reign in consolidating his position still further.

==Legacy and opinion of reign==

In domestic affairs Casimir was relatively passive but anxious to preserve the prerogatives of the crown, notably his right to nominate bishops. In the question of territories in dispute between his two states ([[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]]) he favoured Lithuania. During the war against the [[Teutonic Order]] he was forced to grant the [[Polish nobility]] substantial concessions by the Privilege (statute) of [[Nieszawa]] (November 1454); these, however, became important only after his death, and royal power was not greatly diminished during his lifetime. The feature of Casimir's character which most impressed his contemporaries was his extraordinary simplicity and [[sobriety]]. He, one of the greatest monarchs in Europe, habitually wore plain cloth from [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], drank nothing but water, and kept the most austere of tables. His one passion was the chase. Yet his liberality to his ministers and servants was proverbial, and his vanquished enemies he always treated with magnificent generosity.<ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/275/000095987/</ref>

Casimir was neither a splendid ruler nor a good and wise administrator, but a mistrusting, cautious, and sober head of a large family who regarded Lithuania as his personal estate, however his reign was remembered as being both successful and the most peaceful in the history of Poland.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97968/Casimir-IV</ref>
