This '''Watcher in the Water''' is a colossal [[tentacle]]d [[monster]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] [[Tolkien's legendarium|fantasy writings]], about whom little is discussed. It makes it's one and only appearance in the ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the second volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as originally printed.<ref name = "fotr">{{ME-ref|fotr|"A Journey in the Dark"}}</ref>

Building upon the scarce descriptions in the book, people have compared it to [[squid]]s,<ref name="ARDA#1">http://www.glyphweb.com/Arda/w/watcherinthewater.html Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref> the legendary [[Kraken]],<ref name="ATB">{{cite book |title= A Tolkien Bestiary |last= Day |first= David |authorlink= David Day (Canadian writer)|year= 1995 |publisher= Gramercy |isbn= 0517120771}}</ref> and even to Tolkien's [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]].<ref name="ATTC">{{cite book |title= The Complete Tolkien Companion |last= Tyler |first= J.

==Literature==

The origins of the creature are not described in Tolkien's work. It is said to have lurked in a lake and appeared after the damming of the river [[Sirannon]], beneath the western walls of the Dwarf-realm [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].<ref name = "fotr" />

The Watcher attacked [[Frodo Baggins]] as the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] was about to enter the mines of Moria through the [[Doors of Durin]]. Frodo and [[Boromir]] had disturbed the water. The creature grasped Frodo with a long, pale green, luminous tentacle. [[Samwise Gamgee]] drove the tentacle off with his sword. However, twenty other tentacles emerged from the water. The company escaped into Moria. The tentacles hurled the enormous stone doors shut and uprooted the trees that grew to either side, barring the doors and trapping them in the mines. The Fellowship had no other alternative but to go through the mines and reach the other side. Gandalf and others noted that the Watcher had grabbed Frodo out of all of them. Frodo and Gandalf were not sure whether it was one creature or more.<ref name = "fotr" />

After some journeying, the Fellowship found the [[Book of Mazarbul]], a record of the Dwarf [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s failed expedition<ref name = "fotr" /><ref name = "fotr2">{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Bridge of Khazad-d<U+00FB>m"}}</ref> to reclaim Moria and it's eventual downfall.  In this fictional manuscript, Tolkien relates: 


{{quote|<blockquote>''We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. [[Fr<U+00E1>r]] and [[L<U+00F3>ni]] and [[N<U+00E1>li]] fell there... went five days ago... the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. '''The Watcher in the Water took [[<U+00D3>in, son of Gr<U+00F3>in|<U+00D3>in]]'''. We cannot get out. The end comes... drums, drums in the deep... they are coming.''<ref name = "fotr2" /><blockquote>|Book of Mazarbul, Lord of the RingsThe Fellowship of the Ring Volume II - A Journey in the Dark}}
{{-}}
This is the only name Tolkien ever gave to the creature in the book and indeed in all of his writings.<ref name = "fotr2" /><ref name="Foster">{{cite book |title= [[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] |last= Foster |first= Robert |edition= Revised Edition |year= 2001 |publisher= Del Rey |isbn= 0345449762}}</ref> [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]] and [[<U+00D3>in, son of Gr<U+00F3>in|<U+00D3>in]] are both characters from Tolkien's earlier novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref>{{ME-ref|hobbit}}</ref>

==Concept and creation== 
''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'', part of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, shows the Watcher had already appeared in early drafts. The sequence made it to the final version of the book which left it relatively unchanged.<ref>{{ME-ref|RotS|"The Mines of Moria"}}</ref>

==Speculations==

Since Tolkien never explicitly stated what the creature was, others have freely speculated on its identity and origins.

The creature is speculated to have been a creation of [[Morgoth]] during the [[First Age]]. Another is that the creature is a [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] similar to the demonic-inspired [[Balrog]]s.<ref name="TG"/> Especially after the [[War of Wrath]] it can also be speculated that the Watcher in the Water may have hidden away and settled near Moria afterwards.<ref name="TG">http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Watcher_in_the_Water Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref> Although how it arrived in Moria Tolkien never stated.  Another speculation is that from Gandalf, to which he speculates the origins of the creature may have been due the fact that the mountain held other places where water was fertile and vast, one such river beneath the Bridge of Khazad-d<U+00FB>m may have deep enough for other creatures of it's kind to breed:<ref name="AofArda"/>

{{quote|''"Something has crept or been driven out of the dark water under the mountains.  There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world."''<ref name="AofArda">http://www.annalsofarda.dk/annals-of-arda/Others-index-tables/Others.htm</ref>|Gandalf, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Volume II - A Journey in the Dark}}

It is not clear whether the power and [[One Ring#Fate of Ringbearers|influence of the Ring]] affected the Watcher's decision in attacking Frodo<ref name="TUCK">http://www.tuckborough.net/creatures.html Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref><ref name="PSLOTR">http://www.patriotresource.com/lotr/characters/moria.html Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref> near the Doors of Durin or if it was just a random attempt to grab a victim.

The writer [[David Day (Canadian writer)|David Day]], in ''A Tolkien Bestiary''<ref name="ATB" /> calls the Watcher a [[Kraken]] and implies that there are some differences between the Kraken of Scandinavian folklore and the Watcher in the Water. However, ''Tolkien'' never called the Watcher a Kraken<ref name="ARDA#1" /> nor described the presence of Krakens in Middle-earth.<ref name="ARDA#1"/> In the ''"Dragon"'' entry of ''The Complete Tolkien Companion'' by [[J. E. A. Tyler]]<ref name="ATTC" /> it reads: ''"Cold-Drakes...these dragons rely on their strength and speed alone (the creature that attacked the Ring-Bearer near the Lake of Moria may have been one of these)."'' Like David Day's account, this is only conjecture.

The age of the creature is not known either.  Although if it were created by Morgoth during the [[First Age]] it may be thousands of years old.  Again this is only speculation.  Even though Tolkien scarcely wrote about other sea dwelling creatures the Watcher has had the most attention paid to it by the author.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[Image:WITWLOTR.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The Watcher in the Water in Peter Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.]]
The Watcher in the Water is mentioned in both the film adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'':

[[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978)  follows the sequence in the book relatively faithfully, with only the Watcher's tentacles seen. After Sam frees Frodo from its clutches, Boromir rushes forward and hacks at its tentacles for a few seconds. It is implied the Watcher kills [[Bill the Pony|Bill the pony]] (who escapes in the book).

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), the Watcher is portrayed as one creature, a black, colossal, [[giant squid]]-like monster with a gaping mouth and rows of sharp teeth.  It too grabs Frodo with its tentacles as described in the book and reaches out for the rest of the Fellowship after his rescue.

[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]] by [[Games Workshop]], based on Peter Jackson's film, calls the Watcher in the Water the ''Guardian of the Doors of Durin''.<ref name="GWWITW">http://uk.games-workshop.com/heraldsofdarkness/making-watcher/1/ Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref>

The Watcher in the Water has appeared in a car advertisement for the Japanese corporate giant [[Toyota]].<ref>http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2005/08/16/2476-watcher-in-the-water-a-toyota-fan/ Retrieved on [[22]]-[[03]]-[[2008]]</ref>
