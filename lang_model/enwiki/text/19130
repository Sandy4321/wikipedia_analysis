In the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]], '''Interstate 81''' ('''I-81''') crosses the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]] region, linking Virginia to Maryland. The [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]], completed in 1966, spans {{convert|26.00|mi}} through [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]], paralleling [[U.S. Route 11 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 11]] (US&nbsp;11) for its entire length. I-81 enters the state near [[Ridgeway, West Virginia|Ridgeway]] and travels northeast, bypassing the city of [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], and leaves the state at the [[Potomac River]], which serves as the state line. The first solicitations for the construction of I-81 were published in 1959, with the first {{convert|6|mi}} of freeway being opened in 1963, and the full length was completed by 1966. On average between 45 and 60&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;vehicles use the freeway though the panhandle per day.

==Route description==
I-81 enters the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia just west of [[Ridgeway, West Virginia|Ridgeway]], paralleling US&nbsp;11 (also known as the [[Valley Pike]]).<ref name="Clauson-Wicker2006">{{cite book|last=Clauson-Wicker|first=Su|title=Off the Beaten Path: West Virginia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SQWqrt2lsDkC&pg=PA15|accessdate=February 7, 2011|date=December 1, 2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=9780762742189|page=15}}</ref> The highway passes through some light farmland before entering a wooded area, north of Ridgeway. A [[welcome center]] for northbound travelers is passed before the woodlands give way to a light urban setting. As the highway approaches the community of [[Inwood, West Virginia|Inwood]], a [[diamond interchange]] with [[West Virginia Route 51]] (WV&nbsp;51) provides access to the community, as well as [[Gerrardstown, West Virginia|Gerrardstown]] to the west of the freeway, and [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] to the east. A small business park is passed by before I-81 intersects County Route 32, providing access to [[Arden, Berkeley County, West Virginia|Arden]], the [[Eastern WV Regional Airport]] and [[Tablers Station, West Virginia|Tablers Station]]. The freeway turns more towards the north as it approaches Martinsburg, intersecting [[West Virginia Route 45|WV&nbsp;45]], County Route 15 and Dry Run Road while in the city limits. I-81 bypasses downtown, running along the western border of town while US&nbsp;11 continues through the town.<ref name="gmaps" />

Just northeast of Martinsburg the freeway passes over a [[CSX Transportation]] rail line while a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[West Virginia Route 9|WV&nbsp;9]] provides access back to Martinsburg and to [[Hedgesville, West Virginia|Hedgesville]].<ref name="county map sheet 1">{{cite map|publisher=West Virginia Department of Transportation|title=General Highway Map - Berkeley County, West Virginia|url=http://gis.wvdot.com/gti/08_County_Maps/Berkeley_1_of_2.pdf|accessdate=February 5, 2011|date=January 1, 2008|{{nowrap|scale{{=}}1 in{{=}}1 mi}}|section=E3|format=PDF}}</ref> As the freeway curves back east, it intersects [[West Virginia Route 901|WV&nbsp;901]] between [[Hainesville, Berkeley County, West Virginia|Hainesville]] and [[Falling Waters, West Virginia|Falling Waters]]. WV&nbsp;901 is a short connector route back to US&nbsp;11. North of Falling Waters and south of [[Marlowe, West Virginia|Marlowe]], US&nbsp;11 intersects the freeway and continues north while I-81 turns east towards the Maryland state line at the Potomac River. Just south of the river is a welcome center intended for southbound travelers from Maryland.<ref name="gmaps" />

Out of the six states that I-81 passes through, the segment in West Virginia is the second shortest, only longer than the Maryland segment.<ref name="fhwa log">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/table1.cfm|title=Table 1: Main Routes of the Dwight D.

In 2009, WVDOT calculated that as few as 45,000&nbsp;vehicles traveled along the highway at the Virginia state line, and as many as 62,500&nbsp;vehicles used the freeway between County Routes 15 and 13 in Martinsburg.<ref name="aadt09">{{cite map|url=http://www.transportation.wv.gov/highways/programplanning/preliminary_engineering/traffic_analysis/trafficvolume/interstatecounts/Documents/I81_to_MD_09.pdf|publisher=West Virginia Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 5, 2011|year=2009|format=PDF|title=I81 - Virginia to Maryland}}</ref> As part of the [[Interstate Highway System]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Rodney E.|date=Spring 1996|title=The National Highway System: A Commitment to America's Future|journal=Public Roads|volume=59|issue=4|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref> the entire route is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.<ref name="fhwa map">{{cite map|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|title=National Highway System: West Virginia|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/wv/wv_WestVirginia.pdf|accessdate=January 23, 2011|date=March 2005|format=PDF}}</ref>
