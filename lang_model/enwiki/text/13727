The '''''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise''''' ({{IPA-fr|aksj<U+0254><U+0303> f<U+0281><U+0251><U+0303>s<U+025B>z}}, ''French Action''), founded in 1898, is a French [[Monarchist]] ([[Orl<U+00E9>anist]]) [[counter-revolutionary]] movement and periodical founded by [[Maurice Pujo]] and [[Henri Vaugeois]] and whose principal ideologist was [[Charles Maurras]]. Although it supported the Orleanist branch, according to historian [[Ren<U+00E9> R<U+00E9>mond]]'s categorization of French [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] families, it would be closer to the [[legitimist]] branch, characterized by rejection of the 1789 [[French Revolution]]'s ideals (while the Orleanist branch is, according to R<U+00E9>mond, a movement which supports [[economic liberalism]]).

It was founded during the [[Dreyfus affair]], partly in reaction to the left-wing revitalization that materialized in defense of the army captain, famously launched by [[Emile Zola]]'s [[J'accuse (letter)|''J'accuse'']]. Originally a [[nationalism|nationalist]] organization that attracted figures such as [[Maurice Barr<U+00E8>s]], it became monarchist under the influence of Charles Maurras, who followed the counter-revolutionary theorist, [[Joseph de Maistre]]. Until its dissolution at the end of the Second World War, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' was a prominent proponent of [[far right|far-right]] [[integralism|integral nationalism]], which regarded the nation as an organic entity, a wedding of [[blood and soil]].

==Ideology==
The ideology of the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' was dominated by the thought of [[Charles Maurras]], following his adherence and his conversion of the movement's founders to [[monarchism]]. The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' supported a restoration of the monarchy and, after the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], the restoration of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, even though Maurras was an [[agnostic]] himself. It should not be considered that the movement intended to restore real power to the king, merely to set him up as a rallying point in distinction to the [[Third Republic of France]] which was considered corrupt and unworkable by many of its opponents, whom they hoped to come to their banner.

The movement advocated decentralization (a "federal monarchy"), with the restoration of pre-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] "liberties" to the ancient provinces of France (replaced during the Revolution by the [[d<U+00E9>partement in France|departmental system]]). It aimed to achieve a restoration by means of a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'', probably involving a transitional authoritarian government.

The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' was not focused on denouncing one social or political group as the conspiratorial source of ills befalling France. Different groups of the French far right had especial animus against either the [[Jew]]s, [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Protestant]]s), or [[Freemasons]]. To these Maurras added unspecific foreigners residing in France, who had been outside of French law under the [[ancien regime]], and to whom he invented a slur name derived from ancient Greek history: ''[[Metic|m<U+00E9>t<U+00E8>ques]]''. These four groups of "internal foreigners" Maurras called ''les quatre <U+00E9>tats conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>s'' and were all considered to be part of "Anti-France". Of course he was also opposed to [[socialism]], and, after the 1917 [[October Revolution]], to [[communists]], but antagonism against them did not have to be constructed or marshalled (although the Protestants and the Freemasons were traditional supporters of the Republic, pejoratively called ''la gueuse'' (the slut) by the AF, and were thus in general [[left-wing]]).

==1898&ndash;1926==
The AF movement published a review, the ''Bulletin de l'Action fran<U+00E7>aise'', which subsequently became the ''Revue de l'Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' and then, in 1908, a daily paper ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' (first edition on 21 March 1908). It gained a large number of readers outside the movement, with a circulation of 30 000 copies, and made Maurras a significant figure in French politics, his influence extending far beyond the extreme right. The daily was edited by [[L<U+00E9>on Daudet]], son of the writer [[Alphonse Daudet]], and other contributors included the historian [[Jacques Bainville]], the critic [[Jules Lema<U+00EE>tre]] and the economist [[Georges Valois]], who later left the movement to found the [[fascism|fascist]] ''[[Faisceau]]''.

The ''[[Camelots du Roy]]'' were recruited in 1908 to sell the paper, but they also served as the movement's youth paramilitary wing, regularly engaging in street violence with political opponents. In this period, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' became a significant actor in French politics, in particular among the students of the [[Latin Quarter]]. However, its rise caused some concern among the Roman Catholic hierarchy.

==Papal condemnation and decline==
In spite of the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'''s support for Roman Catholicism as state religion and the fact that the vast majority of its members were practising Catholics (indeed, they included significant numbers of clergy), some Catholics regarded it with distrust.

Much of this was due to the influence of Maurras, an agnostic whose advocacy of Catholicism was due to his belief that it was a factor of social cohesion and stability and to its importance in French history. This rather utilitarian view of religion disturbed people who were often in agreement with many of Maurras's ideas. Its influence on young Catholics was also considered problematic. Thus, on 29 December 1926, [[Pope Pius XI]] condemned the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise''.

Several of Maurras's writings, including the newspaper
were placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] at the same time, on January 9, 1927, with ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' being the first newspaper ever placed on the Roman Catholic Church's list of banned books <ref>"Holy See Bans French Paper", ''Salt Lake Tribune'', January 10, 1927, p. 1</ref> This was a devastating blow to the movement. On 8 March 1927 the AF members were prohibited from receiving the [[sacraments]]. Many of its members left (two Catholics who were forced to look for a different path in politics and life were writers [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mauriac]] and [[Georges Bernanos]]); and it entered a period of decline.

In 1939, following the [[Spanish Civil War]] and a revival of [[anti-communism]] in the Catholic Church, [[Pope Pius XII]] decided to end the condemnation. Thereafter, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' claimed that the condemnation was decided for political purposes.

==Interwar revival==
Despite the 1926 Papal condemnation, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' remained popular during the interwar period, being one of the most important far right leagues, along with the ''[[Croix-de-Feu]]'' and others. As increasing numbers of people in France (as in Europe as a whole) turned to authoritarian political movements, many turned to the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise''. It thus continued to recruit members from the new generations, such as [[Robert Brasillach]] (who would become an infamous [[collaborationism|collaborationist]]), [[Thierry Maulnier]], [[Lucien Rebatet]], etc. It was marginally represented for a time in the [[Chamber of Deputies]], notably by L<U+00E9>on Daudet, elected in the right-wing ''[[Chambre bleue horizon]]'' (1919<U+2013>1924).

However, with the rise of fascism and the creation of seemingly fascist leagues, added to the 1926 Papal condemnation, the royalist movement was also struck by various dissidence: [[Georges Valois]] would create the fascist ''[[Faisceau]]'', [[Louis Dimier]] would split apart, while other members ([[Eug<U+00E8>ne Deloncle]], [[Gabriel Jeantet]], etc.) created the [[terrorist]] ''[[La Cagoule]]'' group.

The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' spearheaded the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des gauches]]'' and to the replacement of [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] [[<U+00C9>douard Daladier]] by conservative [[Gaston Doumergue]]. In foreign policy, Maurras and Bainville supported [[Pierre Laval]]'s double alliance with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Fascist Italy]] and with the United Kingdom in the [[Stresa Front]] (1935) on one side, and with the Soviet Union on the other side, against the common enemy [[Nazi Germany]]. The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' greeted [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s appearance with delight, and supported the self-proclaimed ''[[Caudillo]]'' during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936<U+2013>39). But the extra-parliamentary agitation brought by the various [[far-right leagues]], including the AF, led [[Pierre Laval]]'s government to outlaw militias and paramilitary leagues, leading to the dissolution of the AF on 13 February 1936 <ref name=Decour>[http://cercle.jacques-decour.over-blog.com/categorie-1085012.html Cercle Jacques Decour (Chronology)] {{fr icon}}</ref> &mdash; the others leagues were dissolved only in June 1936 by the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]].

Marshal [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]]'s proclamation of the [[Vichy regime]] and of the ''[[R<U+00E9>volution nationale]]'' after the failure of the [[Battle of France]] was acclaimed by Maurras as a "divine surprise", and he rallied the [[collaborationist]] regime. Royalist members hoped that P<U+00E9>tain would restore the monarchy, and the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'''s headquarters were moved from Paris to [[Vichy]]. However, the AF members were split between supporting the counter-revolutionary regime and their [[nationalism]]: after 1942, and in particular in 1943, some members, such as [[Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie]], [[Pierre Guillain de B<U+00E9>nouville]] or [[Honor<U+00E9> d'Estienne d'Orves]] joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] or escaped to join the [[Free French Forces]]. Others actively collaborated, while Maurras supported the Vichy government, but theoretically opposed P<U+00E9>tain's collaboration with the Germans. After the [[French Liberation|Liberation]], he was condemned to life imprisonment in 1944, though he was reprieved in 1952. The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' was dissolved in 1944.

==Since World War II==
The ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' reformed itself in 1947, under the influence of [[Maurice Pujo]] who created the newspaper ''{{lang|fr|Aspects de la France}}'' (AF) and the counter-revolutionary movement, "{{lang|fr|la Restauration Nationale}}" ("National Restoration"). After Maurras's death in 1952, two rival newspapers, ''{{lang|fr|Aspects de la France}}'' and [[Pierre Boutang]]'s ''{{lang|fr|La Nation Fran<U+00E7>aise}}'' revived the Maurassian legacy, until the demise of ''{{lang|fr|La Nation Fran<U+00E7>aise}}'' in 1967.

In 1971, a breakaway movement, the "{{lang|fr|Nouvelle Action Fran<U+00E7>aise}}" was formed by [[Bertrand Renouvin]], [[Georges-Paul Wagner]] and others. It subsequently became the ''[[Nouvelle Action Royaliste]]'' (NAR), which supported the Orleanist heir (although in his 1968 reprinting of his study on the three French right-wing families, [[Ren<U+00E9> R<U+00E9>mond]] still classified it in the [[legitimist]] movement because of its counter-revolutionary ideology). The movement called to support [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]] in the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]], instead of supporting [[Jacques Chirac]]'s "neo-Gaullism" movement (the [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] are classed by Ren<U+00E9> R<U+00E9>mond as [[Bonapartist]]s) or [[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s "[[Orleanist]]" movement (because of his support of [[economic liberalism]]).

In the beginning of the 1980s, various AF figures, such as [[Georges-Paul Wagner]] or [[Philippe Colombani]] joined the ranks of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN). Until the 1999 breakaway of the [[National Republican Movement]] (MNR) led by [[Bruno M<U+00E9>gret]], Jean-Marie Le Pen's success was partly explained by his unification of the various far right families (such as [[Traditionalist Catholics]], royalists, [[neofascists]], etc.) which share few ideals apart from a distrust of [[liberal democracy]] and a staunch [[anti-communism]].

The AF movement still exists as the monarchist and anti-[[European Union]] "{{lang|fr|Centre royaliste d'Action Fran<U+00E7>aise}}" and publishes a magazine called ''{{lang|fr|Action Fran<U+00E7>aise 2000}}''. Its leader was [[Pierre Pujo]] (Maurice Pujo's son), who died in Paris on 10 November 2007.<ref>[http://fr.novopress.info/?p=9628] (French)</ref> The student movement, called ''{{lang|fr|Action Fran<U+00E7>aise Etudiante}}'', has approximately 15 local delegations (in places such as Paris, Normandy, Rennes, Bordeaux, and Forez) and a newspaper, ''{{lang|fr|Insurrection}}''. Its President is Oliver Perceval.

The AF movement is member of the [[International Monarchist Conference]].

==Judgment of political scientists==
In the 1960s, political scientist [[Ernst Nolte]] considered the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' to be the first fascist party, and the most manipulative and duplicitous of fascist parties. But his view-point is generally considered extreme, and the movement is not considered as historically important as the fascist groups which gained power, while many others argue that AF was in fact a reactionary movement.

More recently, Israeli historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has cited the group, along with its predecessor [[Georges Boulanger|Boulangism]] and [[Georges Valois]]' [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', as a major, direct intellectual influence on fascism.

According to historian [[Ren<U+00E9> R<U+00E9>mond]]'s famous classification of French [[right-wing]] families, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' belongs to the [[legitimist]] [[counterrevolutionary]] movement, which rejects all deformations in the French political regime since the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.

==Fictional accounts==
In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[American Empire (Harry Turtledove)|American Empire]]'' alternative history books, the ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' becomes a popular movement in France following the nation's defeat in the Great War. By the early 1930s, it has placed France under the rule of King Charles XI, and spends the decade re-arming for a rematch with Germany. After [[Kaiser Wilhelm]]'s death in 1941, ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' declares war on Germany, but its offensive by early 1942 has stalled at the Rhine and outside Hamburg. In 1944 Paris is then destroyed by a German nuclear weapon. It's unclear what happened to the organisation after this.
