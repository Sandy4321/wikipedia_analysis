'''Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park''' is a [[state park]] located in [[Shasta County, California]].  Brilliant aqua bays and tree studded islets only a few yards long dot the shoreline of [[Ja-She Creek]], [[Crystal Springs]] and [[Horr Pond]]. Of the park's 6000 acres (24 km<U+00B2>), over two thirds of the area is covered by recent (three to five thousand years) [[lava]] flows including vast areas of jagged black [[basalt]].  The park is a wilderness area and most of it is extremely rugged lava rock.

==More about the Park==
"Where the waters come together" is a translation of the word ''Ahjumawi'', which is also the self describing word used by the band of [[Pit River]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who inhabit the area. The waters which come together are [[Big Lake]], [[Tule River]], Ja-She Creek, [[Lava Creek]], and [[Fall River (California)|Fall River]]. Together they form one of the largest systems of fresh water springs in the country.

Preserved within the Park are lava flows broken by great faults and deep cracks, [[lava tube]]s and craters. Freshwater spring flowing from the lava are prominent along the shoreline. 

[[Oak]], [[pine]] and [[juniper]] forests and slopes of [[rabbit brush]] and [[sagebrush]] are part of the great variety of vegetation in the area. Abundant wildlife populations are evident all seasons. A great variety of birds including, [[bald eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, and [[great blue heron]]s nest or travel through the park. Herds of [[mule deer]] forage through much of the park.
