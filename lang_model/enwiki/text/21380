'''Thorvald Simeon Niss''' (1842<U+2013>1905) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] landscape painter who became interested in [[marine art]] after becoming a member of the [[Skagen Painters]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Assens]], he was the son of Niels Frederik Niss, a house painter, and his wife Barbara Kirstine. When he was 18, he became a painter's apprentice in Copenhagen where he tried to develop his artistic talents in the evenings. From 1861, he attended evening school at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Danish Academy]] and from 1863 worked as a decorator at the [[Royal Copenhagen]] porcelain factory. In the late 1870s, he came into contact with [[Otto Bache]] who invited him to work in his studio where he became acquainted with the latest trends in French painting. By the beginning of the 1880s, he had become a modern landscape artist, comparable to [[Christian Zacho]] and [[Godfred Christensen]].<ref name=dbl>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Thorvald_Niss "Thorvald Niss"], ''Dansk Biograpfisk Leksikon''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 15 October 2013.</ref>

The broad strokes and strong colours he applied to his autumn and winter landscapes brought him wide recognition. In 1882, his ''Septemberdag i J<U+00E6>gersborg dyrehave'' won a prize in Vienna and the following year a winter landscape of the [[Folehaven]] woods was bought by [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], the Danish national gallery. Thanks to a travel grant, in 1885 he went to Italy and Greece, and in 1889 to Paris. In 1887, he visited [[Skagen]] where he became a member of artists' colony known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. There he painted the sea, adopting a new approach to [[marine art]] with his ''Morgengry'' (Daybreak) in 1888 and ''Strandparti. Grenen'' in 1889. He went on to paint marine scenes elsewhere, especially of the Mediterranean.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Thorvald_Niss "Thorvald Niss"], ''Den Store Dansle''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 15 October 2013.</ref> In the 1890s, he increasingly used etching for his marine scenes, some with symbolic undertones.<ref name=dbl/>

After suffering for a number of years from a nervous breakdown, he died in Frederiksberg in 1905.<ref name=dbl/>
