The '''Crocodilia''' (or '''Crocodylia''') are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of large, predatory, [[semi-aquatic]] [[reptile]]s. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late [[Cretaceous]] period ([[Campanian]] stage) and are the closest living relatives of [[birds]], as the two groups are the only known survivors of the [[Archosaur]]ia. Members of the crocodilian [[Crown group#Pan-group|total group]], the [[clade]] [[Pseudosuchia]], appeared about 250 million years ago in the [[Early Triassic]] period, and diversified during the [[Mesozoic]] era. The order Crocodilia includes the [[crocodile|true crocodiles]] (family [[Crocodylidae]]), the [[alligator]]s and [[caiman]]s (family [[Alligatoridae]]), and the [[gharial]]s (family [[Gavialidae]]). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is 'crocodilians'.

Crocodilians are large, solidly built, lizard-like reptiles with long flattened snouts, laterally compressed tails, and eyes, ears, and nostrils at the top of the head. They swim well and can move on land in a "high walk" and a "low walk". Their skin is thick and covered in non-overlapping scales. They have conical, peg-like teeth and a powerful bite. Like birds, they have a [[Heart chamber|four-chambered]] heart and a unidirectional system of airflow around the lungs, but like other reptiles they are [[ectotherms]].

Crocodilians are found mainly in lowlands in the [[tropics]], but alligators also live in the southeastern United States and the [[Yangtze River]] in China. They are largely [[carnivorous]], the various species feeding on animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the [[saltwater crocodile]] have generalised diets.

Eight species of crocodilians have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks come from the [[Nile crocodile]]. Humans are the largest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Crocodilians appear in folklore and literature from around the world since the time of [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]]. The story that crocodiles [[crocodile tears|weep for their victims]] has been current since the 9th century and was spread by Sir [[John Mandeville]] in 1400 and then by [[William Shakespeare]].

==Spelling and etymology==
The group is often spelled 'Crocodylia' for consistency with the genus ''[[Crocodylus]]'' ([[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti|Laurenti]], 1768). The original name as published by [[Richard Owen]] in 1842 had the -i- spelling, more accurately [[Latin]]izing the [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''crocodeilos''), which means both 'lizard' and 'Nile crocodile'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dkroko%2Fdeilos | title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon | publisher=Tufts University | year=1901 | accessdate=22 October 2013 | author=Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert}}</ref> The Greek name in turn is assumed<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Crocodile | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary | publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica | editor=Gove, Philip B. | year=1986}}</ref> to derive from <U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03B5> (''kroke''), shingle or pebble, and <U+03B4><U+03C1><U+00EE><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2> or <U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+00EE><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''dr(e)ilos''), worm.

===Locomotion===
Crocodilians are excellent swimmers. During [[aquatic locomotion]], the muscular tail undulates from side to side to drive the animal through the water while the limbs are held close to the body to reduce drag.<ref name=Firefly/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fish, F. E. |year=1984 |title=Kinematics of undulatory swimming in the American alligator |journal=Copeia |pages=839<U+2013>843 |url=http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/1984CopeiaKinematics.pdf |doi=10.2307/1445326 |volume=1984 |issue=4}}</ref> When the animal needs to stop, steer, or manoeuvre in a different direction, the limbs are splayed out.<ref name=Firefly/> Crocodilians generally cruise slowly on the surface or underwater with gentle sinuous movements of the tail, but when pursued or when chasing prey they can move rapidly, and can lunge out of the water in a manner reminiscent of [[dolphin]]s.<ref name=Ross46>Mazzotti, pp. 43<U+2013>46.</ref> Crocodilians are less well-adapted for moving on land, and are unusual among vertebrates in having two different means of terrestrial locomotion: the "high walk" and the "low walk".<ref name=Kelly70/> Their ankle joints flex in a different way from those of other reptiles, a feature they share with some early [[archosaur]]s. One of the upper row of ankle bones, the [[Talus bone|astragalus]], moves with the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]]. The other, the [[calcaneum]], is functionally part of the foot, and has a socket into which a peg from the astragalus fits. The result is that the legs can be held almost vertically beneath the body when on land, and the foot can swivel during locomotion with a twisting movement at the ankle.<ref name=Ross21>Sues, p. 21.</ref>

[[File:Alligator02 Asit.jpg|thumb|left|Crocodilians, like this [[American alligator]], can "high walk" with the limbs held almost vertically, unlike other [[reptile]]s.]] 
The high walk of crocodilians, with the belly and most of the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It somewhat resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind.<ref name="Ross46" /> The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and is quite different from the sprawling walk of [[salamander]]s and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the normal means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Reilly, S. M.; Elias, J. A. |year=1998 |title=Locomotion in ''Alligator mississippiensis'': kinematic effects of speed and posture and their relevance to the sprawling-to-erect paradigm |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=201 |pages=2559<U+2013>2574 |pmid=9716509 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/18/2559.full.pdf|issue=18}}</ref>

Though typically slow on land, crocodilians can produce short bursts of speed, and some can run at  {{convert|12|to|14|km/h|abbr=on}} for short distances.<ref>Kelly, pp. 81<U+2013>82.</ref> A fast entry into water from a muddy riverbank can be effected by plunging to the ground, twisting the body from side to side and splaying out the limbs.<ref name="Ross46" /> In some small species such as the [[freshwater crocodile]], a running gait can progress to a bounding gallop. This involves the hind limbs launching the body forward and the fore limbs subsequently taking the weight. Next, the hind limbs swing forward as the spine flexes [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]], and this sequence of movements is repeated.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Renous, S.; Gasc, J.-P.; Bels, V.

===Jaws and teeth===
[[File:Gharial skull.jpg|thumb|right|upright|250px|Skull of gharial]]
The snout shape of crocodilians varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while alligators and caimans have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them,<ref name=Grigg/> and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open.<ref>Kelly, p. 69.</ref> The powerful closing muscles attach at the bottom of the skull, allowing the top of the head to retain a flat profile. The jaw hinge attaches to the [[atlanto-occipital joint]], allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.<ref name=biology/> Crocodilians have one of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom. In a study published in 2003, an American alligator's bite force was measured at up to {{convert|2,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The ontogeny of bite-force performance in American alligator (''Alligator mississippiensis'')|journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=260 |issue=3 |pages=317<U+2013>327 |url=http://www.alligatorfarm.us/images/Research/Erickson%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0952836903003819 |year=2003 |last1=Erickson |first1=Gregory M. |last2=Lappin |first2=A.

This study also found no correlation between bite force and snout shape. Nevertheless, the gharial's extremely slender jaws are relatively weak.<ref name=bite>{{cite journal|author=Erickson, G.

Crocodilian teeth vary from blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like.<ref name=bite/> Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform.

===Skin and scales===
{{main|Crocodilian armor}}
[[File:Crocodylus niloticus (skin).jpg|thumb|right|Skin of a juvenile [[Nile crocodile]]]]

The skin of crocodilians is thick and [[cornified]], and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as [[scute]]s, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by [[cell division]] in the underlying layer of the epidermis, the [[stratum germinativum]], and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid [[beta-keratin]] while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable [[alpha-keratin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument/33059/Reptiles |title=Integument: Reptiles |author=Ebling, F. John G. |work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>

Many of the scutes are strengthened by bony plates known as [[osteoderm]]s, which are the same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin.<ref name=Grigg/> Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull.<ref name=biology>Huchzermeyer, pp. 7<U+2013>10.</ref> The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows.<ref name=Grigg/><ref>{{cite book |author=Scott, C. |year=2004 |title=Endangered and Threatened Animals of Florida and Their Habitats |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=213 |isbn=978-0-292-70529-6}}</ref> The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during [[thermoregulation]].<ref name=Grigg/> Some scutes contain a single pore known as an integumentary sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have then on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that they may be [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] organs,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jackson, K.; Butler, D. G.; Youson, J. H. |year=1996 |title=Morphology and ultrastructure of possible integumentary sense organs in the estuarine crocodile (''Crocodylus porosus'') |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=229 |issue=3 |pages=315<U+2013>324 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199609)229:3<315::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-X |url=http://www.web.pdx.edu/~zelickr/sensory-physiology/articles/2013-articles/for-2013-04-24/jackson-et-al-iso-morphology.pdf }}</ref> or they may have a function similar to the [[lateral line]] organ of fish. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete [[pheromone]]s used in courtship or nesting.<ref name=Grigg/> The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]], and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.<ref>Kelly, p. 85.</ref>

===Circulation===
The crocodilian has perhaps the most complex vertebrate [[circulatory system]]. It has a four-chambered [[heart]] and two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], an unusual trait among extant reptiles,<ref name=Grigg/> and both a left and right [[aorta]] which are connected by a hole called the [[Foramen of Panizza]]. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have [[heart valve]]s that flip open when pressured by surges of blood and shut closely when the pressure subsides. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta and away from the lungs, and then back around the body.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Franklin, C. E.; Axelsson, M. |year=2000 |title=Physiology: An actively controlled heart valve |journal=Nature |volume=406 |pages=847<U+2013>848|doi=10.1038/35022652 |issue=6798 |pmid=10972278}}</ref> This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Axelsson, M.; Franklin, C.

Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the [[pancreas]], [[spleen]], [[small intestine]], and [[liver]] also function more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Farmer, C.

When submerged, a crocodilian's heart rate slows down to one or two beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood.<ref>Kelly, p. 78.</ref> Unlike many [[marine mammal]]s, crocodilians have little [[myoglobin]] to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied oxygen when an increasing concentration of [[bicarbonate]] ions forces [[haemoglobin]] in the blood to release oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Komiyama, N.

===Respiration===

Crocodilians were traditionally thought to breathe like mammals, with airflow moving in and out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe like birds. The studies found that when a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary [[Bronchus|bronchi]], or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move though these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out, completing a unidirectional loop around the lungs. It is not understood how they can breathe this way with a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] instead of [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|air sacs]].<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Farmer, C.

The lungs of the crocodilian are attached to the liver and the pelvis by the diaphragm. During breathing, the lungs are stretched and compressed. When inhaling, the [[intercostal muscles]] expand the ribs, allowing the animal to take in more air, while the [[ischiopubic ramus|ischiopubis]] muscle causes the hips to swing downwards and push the belly outward, and the diaphragm pulls the liver back. When exhaling, the intercostal muscles push the ribs inward, while the [[rectus abdominis]] pulls the hips and liver forwards and the belly inward.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Claessens, L.; O'Connor, P.; Unwin, D.|year=2009|title=Respiratory evolution facilitated the origin of pterosaur flight and aerial gigantism|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e4497|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004497|pmid=19223979|pmc=2637988|editor1-last=Sereno|editor1-first=Paul}}</ref><ref name=Grigg/><ref name=Urinona/> Crocodilians can also move their lungs back and forth to control their buoyancy in the water.

===Digestion===
Crocodilian teeth are adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is swallowed unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat is a fairly simple substance to break down and digest. The stomach is divided into two parts: a muscular [[gizzard]] which grinds food, and a digestive chamber where [[Digestive enzyme|enzymes]] work on it.<ref name=Ross54>Mazzotti, p. 54.</ref> The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for [[gastrolith]]s, which play a role in the mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures.<ref name=Firefly/> Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on [[Adipose tissue|stored fat]] between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time.<ref name=Garnett/> An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a [[lion]] of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.<ref name=Garnett>{{cite journal |author=Garnett, S. T. |year=1986 |title=Metabolism and survival of fasting estuarine crocodiles |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=208 |issue=4 |pages=493<U+2013>502 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb01518.x }}</ref>

===Thermoregulation===
[[File:Gharial.jpg|thumb|right|Captive Indian gharial basking]]
Crocodilians are [[ectotherm]]s, producing relatively little heat internally and relying on external sources to raise their body temperatures. Solar radiation is the main means of warming for any crocodilian, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction, or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural. For example, an alligator in temperate regions may start the day by basking in the sun on land. Bulky animals warm up slowly, but at some time later in the day it moves into the water, still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun. At night it remains submerged, and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer. For crocodiles in the tropics, avoiding overheating is generally the main problem. They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade, remaining there for the rest of the day, or submerge themselves in water to keep cool. Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by [[evaporation]] from the mouth lining.<ref name=Ross51>Mazzotti, pp. 48<U+2013>51.</ref> By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is maintained between about {{convert|25|and|35|<U+00B0>C}}, and mainly stays in the range {{convert|30|to|33|<U+00B0>C}}.<ref name=Grigg/>

The ranges of the [[American alligator|American]] and [[Chinese alligator]] extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls as the temperature drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. In very cold weather when ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, and there have been occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around {{convert|5|<U+00B0>C}}, but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill-effects when the weather warms up.<ref name="Ross51" />

===Osmoregulation===
[[File:Darwin 6261.jpg|thumb|left|Saltwater crocodile resting on beach]]
No species of crocodilian can be considered truly marine; although the [[saltwater crocodile]] and the American crocodile are able to swim out to sea, their normal habitat is river mouths, estuaries, mangrove swamps, and [[hypersaline lake]]s. All crocodilians need to maintain the concentration of salt in body fluids at suitable levels. [[Osmoregulation]] is related to the quantity of salts and water exchanged with the environment. Intake of water and salts takes place through the skin, across the lining of the mouth, when water is drunk, incidentally while feeding, and when present in foods. Salts and water are lost from the body in the urine and faeces, during respiration, through the skin, and via [[Salt gland|salt excreting glands]] on the tongue, though these are only present in crocodiles and gharials.<ref name=Ross55>Mazzotti, pp. 52<U+2013>55.</ref><ref>Kelly, p. 68.</ref> Gaping causes water loss by evaporation, but the skin is a largely effective barrier to both water and ions.<ref name=Ross55/> Large animals are better able to maintain [[homeostasis]] at times of osmotic stress than smaller ones.<ref name=Grigg/> Newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles, presumably because they have a higher surface to volume ratio.<ref name=Ross55/>

The kidneys and excretory system are much the same as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a [[bladder]]. In fresh water, the concentration of ions in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] is much higher than it is in the surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is clear, copious, and dilute, with excess nitrogen being excreted as [[ammonium bicarbonate]]. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The concentration of ions in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water and this is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble [[uric acid]].<ref name=Grigg/><ref name=Ross55/>

==Distribution and habitat==
<!--[[File:Crocodylidae Distribution.png|550px|right|thumb|Ranges of Crocodylidae]] excluding Alligators, Caimans-->
[[File:Spectacled Caimans on river bank.jpg|thumb|right|Spectacled caimans on river bank]]
Crocodilians are amphibious reptiles, spending part of their time in water and part on land. Typically they are creatures of the [[tropics]]; the main exceptions are the American and Chinese alligators, whose ranges extend as far north as the south-eastern United States and the [[Yangtze River]], respectively. Most crocodilians live in the lowlands, and few are found above {{convert|1000|m}}, where the temperatures are typically about 5<U+00B0>C (9<U+00B0>F) lower than at the coast. None of them permanently reside in the sea, though some can venture into it, and several species can tolerate the [[brackish water]] of estuaries, mangrove swamps, and hypersaline lakes.<ref name=Ross139>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, pp. 136<U+2013>139.</ref> The saltwater crocodile has the widest distribution of any crocodilian, with a range extending from eastern India to New Guinea and northern Australia. Much of its success is due to its ability to swim out to sea and colonise new locations, but it is not restricted to the marine environment and spends much time in estuaries, rivers, and large lakes.<ref name=Ross68>Ross, p. 68.</ref>

Various types of aquatic habitats are used by different species of crocodilian. Some prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask in the sun and where there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others prefer the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries, which also have a rich flora and plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's [[floodplain]]s. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water.<ref name="Ross139" /> Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Venezuelan llanos]] is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain.<ref name=Ross141>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, p. 141.</ref>
[[File:Gharial lurking.jpg|thumb|right|Gharial accidentally camouflaged with floating weed]]

Dry land is also important to crocodilians as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Several species make use of shallow burrows on land, and muddy pools provide opportunity for wallowing.<ref name=Ross146>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, pp. 144<U+2013>146.</ref> The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared to make way for agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.<ref name=Ross152>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, pp. 148<U+2013>152.</ref>

===Ecological role===
In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as a result of overhunting in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important [[arapaima]] (''Arapaima gigas''), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and it was hypothesised that the urine and faeces of the caimans were an important source of nutrients which increased [[primary production]]. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fittkau, E.-J. |year=1970 |title=Role of caimans in the nutrient regime of mouth-lakes of Amazon affluents (an hypothesis) |journal=Biotropica |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=138<U+2013>142 |jstor=2989771 |doi=10.2307/2989771 }}</ref> Whether or not this theory was correct, the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.<ref name=Ross148>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, pp. 146<U+2013>148.</ref> The nest mounds built by some species of crocodilian are used by other creatures for their own purposes. American alligator mounds are used by turtles and snakes, both for basking and for laying their own [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. The [[Florida red-bellied turtle]] specialises in this, and alligator mounds may have several clutches of turtle eggs developing alongside the owner's eggs.<ref name=Ross145>Alcala & Dy-Liacco, p. 145.</ref> Alligators modify some wetland habitats in flat areas such as the Everglades by constructing small ponds known as "alligator holes". These create wetter or drier habitats for other organisms, such as plants, fish, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. In the limestone depressions of [[Taxodium|cypress]] swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep. Those in [[Everglades National Park#Freshwater sloughs and marl prairies|marl prairies]] and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in [[peat]] depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable. Man-made holes do not appear to have as large an effect.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Campell, Mark R.; Mazzotti, Frank J.|year=2004|title=Characterization of natural and artificial alligator holes|journal=Southeastern Naturalist|volume=3|issue=4|pages=583<U+2013>94|url=http://www.briarcliff.edu/departments/biol/BIOL%2052IR/i1528-7092-3-4-583.pdf|doi=10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0583:CONAAA]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

==Behaviour and life history==
Adult crocodilians are typically territorial and solitary. Individuals may defend basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male saltwater crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. Some species are occasionally [[Gregarious behaviour|gregarious]], particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. In addition, some species are also known to share basking sites at certain times of the day.<ref name="Firefly"/>

===Feeding===
[[File:Crocodile attack during Mara River crossing - frame 1 - Flickr - Lip Kee.jpg|thumb|left|Nile crocodile ambushing [[Animal migration|migrating]] [[wildebeest]] crossing the [[Mara River]]]]
Crocodilians are largely [[carnivorous]], and the diets of different species can vary with snout shape and tooth sharpness. Species with sharp teeth and long slender snouts, like the Indian gharial and Australian freshwater crocodile, are specialised for feeding on fish, insects, and crustaceans, while extremely broad-snouted species with blunt teeth, like the Chinese alligator and broad-snouted caiman, specialise in eating hard-shelled molluscs. Species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate between these two forms, such as the saltwater crocodile and American alligator, have generalised diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates, fish, snakes, turtles, birds, and mammals.<ref name=bite/>

In general, crocodilians are stalk-and-ambush predators,<ref name=bite/> though hunting strategies vary depending on the individual species and the prey being hunted.<ref name=Firefly/> Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned.<ref name=Grigg/><ref name=Firefly/> Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish.<ref name=Ross80>Pooley, pp. 76<U+2013>80.</ref> Small animals can be killed by [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] as the predator shakes its head.<ref name=Grigg/> Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water.<ref name=Firefly/> They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates,<ref name=Kelly70/> and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land.<ref name=bite/> Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively,<ref name=Firefly/> and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic [[scavenger]]s.<ref name=Kelly70/>

Crocodilians are unable to chew and need to swallow food whole, so prey that is too large to swallow is torn into pieces. They may be unable to deal with a large animal with a thick hide, and may wait until it becomes putrid and comes apart more easily.<ref name=Ross80/> To tear a chunk of tissue from a large carcase, a crocodilian spins its body continuously while holding on with its jaws, a manoeuvre known as the "death roll".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fish, F. E.; Bostic, S. A.; Nicastro, A. J.; Beneski, J. T.|year=2007 |title=Death roll of the alligator: mechanics of twist feeding in water|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=210 |pages=2811<U+2013>2818 |doi=10.1242/<U+200B>jeb.004267 |url=http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/2007JEBDedathRoll.pdf|issue=16}}</ref> During cooperative feeding, some individuals may hold onto the prey, while others perform the roll. The animals do not fight, and each retires with a piece of flesh and awaits its next feeding turn.<ref name=Ross91>Pooley, pp. 88<U+2013>91.</ref> Food is typically consumed by crocodilians with their heads above water. The food is held with the tips of the jaws, tossed towards the back of the mouth by an upward jerk of the head and then gulped down.<ref name=Grigg/> Nile crocodiles may store carcasses underwater for later consumption.<ref name=Kelly70/> Though mostly carnivorous, several species of crocodilian have been observed to consume fruit, and this may play a role in [[seed dispersal]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Platt, S.

===Reproduction and parenting===
[[File:Nile crocodile eggs.jpg|thumb|right|Nile crocodile eggs]]
Crocodilians are generally [[polygynous]], and individual males try to mate with as many females as they can. Dominant males patrol and defend territories which contain several females. During courtship, males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Males of some species, like the American alligator, have elaborate [[courtship display]]s. Male alligators try to attract females with loud bellows and vibrate along the length of their bodies. Copulation for crocodilians typically occurs in the water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail submerge. The male rubs across the female's neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs, placing his tail underneath her so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Mating can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously submerge and surface.<ref name=Kelly86>Kelly, pp. 86<U+2013>88.</ref> While [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] males usually monopolise reproductive females, multiple paternity is known to exist in American alligators, where as many as three different males may sire offspring in a single [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]]. Within a month of mating, the female crocodilian begins to make a [[nest]].<ref name=Firefly/>
[[File:Crocnest.JPG|thumb|left|Mother American alligator with nest and young]]

Depending on the species, female crocodilians may construct either holes or [[mound]]s as nests. These are typically found near dens or caves. Nests made by different females are sometimes close to each other, particularly in hole-nesting species. The number of eggs laid in a single clutch ranges from ten to fifty. As in all [[amniote]]s, crocodilian eggs are protected by hard shells. The [[Egg incubation|incubation period]] is two to three months.<ref name=Firefly/> [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|The temperature at which the eggs incubate determines the sex of the hatchlings]]. Constant nest temperatures above {{convert|32|C|F|abbr=on}} produce males, while those below {{convert|31|C|F|abbr=on}} produce females. However, sex in crocodilians may be determined in a short interval, and nests are subject to changes in temperature. Most natural nests produce hatchlings of both sexes, though single-sex clutches do occur.<ref name=Grigg/>

The young may all hatch in a single night.<ref name=Ross109>Lang, p. 109.</ref> Crocodilians are unusual among reptiles in the amount of parental care provided after the young hatch.<ref name=Firefly/> The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother.<ref>Kelly, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref> For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or [[Cr<U+00E8>che (zoology)|cr<U+00E8>ches]], and one of the mothers guards them.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thorbjarnarson, J. B. |year=1994 |title=Reproductive ecology of the spectacled caiman (''Caiman crocodilus'') in the Venezuelan Llanos|journal=Copeia|volume=4|pages=907<U+2013>919|jstor=1446713|doi=10.2307/1446713|issue=4}}</ref> Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed.<ref name="Ross109" /> The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.<ref name=Firefly/>

}}
The social life of a crocodilian begins while it is still in the egg, because the young start communicating with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.<ref name=Ross109>Lang, pp. 104<U+2013>109.</ref>

Vocalisations are frequent as the juveniles disperse, and again as they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters to the presence of food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodiles species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses.<ref name=Ross109/>

Another form of acoustic communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an animal in the water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, but it seems to be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship.<ref name=Ross109/> Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will summit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.<ref name=Firefly/>

===Growth and mortality===
[[File:Young saltwater crocodiles at Crocosaurus Cove, Darwin, Australia, 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Young saltwater crocodiles in captivity]]
Mortality is high for eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators.<ref name=Firefly/> Flooding is a major cause of failure of crocodilians to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away.<ref name=Ross152/> One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the [[raccoon]], which is attracted by olfactory clues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The [[Florida black bear]] also raids alligator eggs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunt, R. Howard; Ogden, Jacqueline J. |year=1991 |title=Selected aspects of the nesting ecology of American alligators in the Okefenokee Swamp |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=448<U+2013>453 |jstor=1564768 |doi=10.2307/1564768 }}</ref> In Africa, [[mongoose]]s, [[honey badger]]s, [[baboon]]s, [[otter]]s, [[warthog]]s, [[bushpig]]s, and [[spotted hyena]]s are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the [[monitor lizard]] is thought to be the most important nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include [[civet]]s, mongooses, [[rat]]s, [[sloth bear]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[dog]]s.<ref name=Ross97>Pooley & Ross, pp. 94<U+2013>97.</ref>

Despite the maternal care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall prey to fish, birds, mammals, and other reptiles.<ref name=Kelly91>Kelly, p. 91.</ref> While the female is transporting some to the nursery area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings are a source of food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by [[turtle]]s, fish, and [[snake]]s. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive.<ref name=Ross97/> In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadult and adult crocodilians, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes.<ref name=Kelly91/> The [[jaguar]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silveira, R. D.; Ramalho, E. E.; Thorbjarnarson, J. B.; Magnusson, W. E. |year=2010 |title=Depredation by jaguars on caimans and importance of reptiles in the diet of jaguar |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=418<U+2013>424 |doi=10.1670/08-340.1}}</ref> and the [[giant otter]]<ref>Wylie, p. 22.</ref> may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, [[elephant]]s and [[hippopotamus]]es may kill crocodiles defensively.<ref name=Firefly/> Authorities differs as to whether much [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]] takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.<ref name=Ross97/>

Growth in hatchlings and young crocodilians depends on the food supply, and sexual maturity is linked with length rather than age. Female saltwater crocodiles reach maturity at {{convert|2.2|<U+2013>|2.5|m|abbr=on}}, while males mature at {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}}. Australian freshwater crocodiles take ten years to reach maturity at {{convert|1.4|m|abbr=on}}. The common caiman matures earlier, reaching its mature length of {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}} in four to seven years.<ref name=Kelly86/> Crocodilians continue to grow throughout most of their lives.

==Evolution and classification==

===Evolution===
[[Diapsid]]s are tetrapods characterised by having two openings (temporal fenestrae) on either side of the [[skull]] behind the eye. Living diapsids include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, [[tuatara]]s, and [[bird]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/diapsida.php |title=Those diverse diapsids |author=Polly, P. David; Guralnick, Rob P.; Collins, Alan G.; Hutchinson, John R.; Speer, Brian R. |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> The feature that distinguishes [[archosaur]]s from other diapsid reptiles is an extra pair of openings in the skull (antorbital fenestrae) in front of the eye sockets. Archosauria is defined as the group that includes the common ancestor of crocodiles and birds and all of its descendants. It comprises the [[Pseudosuchia]], the "false crocodiles", and the [[Avemetatarsalia|Ornithosuchia]], which in turn comprises the [[dinosaur]]s and their relatives, the [[pterosaur]]s, and the birds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/archosauria.php |title=Archosauria |author=Hutchinson, John R.; Speer, Brian R.; Wedel, Matt |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> Pseudosuchia is defined as living crocodilians and all archosaurs more closely related to crocodilians than to birds.  Modern crocodilians have lost the antorbital fenestrae, but they were present in most of their fossil ancestors as small openings.<ref name="Ross37">Buffetaut, pp. 26<U+2013>37.</ref>

[[File:Protosuchus BW.jpg|thumb|right|Restoration of early crocodylomorph ''[[Protosuchus]]'']]
The crocodylomorphs are the only pseudosuchians to have survived the [[Triassic<U+2013>Jurassic extinction event]], 201.3 million years ago. During the early [[Jurassic]] period, the dinosaurs became dominant on land, and the crocodylomorphs underwent major [[Adaptive radiation|adaptive diversications]] to fill [[ecological niche]]s vacated by recently extinguished groups. Unfolding fossil evidence shows that [[Mesozoic]] crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians. Some became small fast-moving [[insectivore]]s, others specialist [[Piscivore|fish-eaters]], still others marine and terrestrial [[carnivore]]s, and a few became [[herbivore]]s.<ref name="Stubbs2013">{{cite journal |author=Stubbs, Thomas L.; Pierce, Stephanie E.; Rayfield, Emily J.; Anderson, Philip S.

They were followed by the [[mesosuchia]]ns, which diversified widely during the Jurassic and the Tertiary. Another group, the [[eusuchia]]ns, appeared in the late Cretaceous 80 million years ago and includes all the crocodilians living today.<ref name="Ross37"/>

Protosuchians were small, mostly terrestrial animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor in the form of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the [[palatine bone]]s to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the [[pterygoid bone]]s. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a [[Ball and socket joint|ball and socket type joint]] between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength.<ref name="Ross37" /> The oldest known eusuchian is ''[[Hylaeochampsa vectiana]]'' from the lower Cretaceous of the [[Isle of Wight]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Martin">{{cite journal |author=Martin, Jeremy E.; Benton, Michael J. |year=2008 |title=Crown Clades in Vertebrate Nomenclature: Correcting the Definition of Crocodylia |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=173<U+2013>181 |doi=10.1080/10635150801910469 |pmid=18300130 }}</ref>

The three primary branches of Crocodylia had diverged by the end of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the [[Campanian]] (around 83.6&ndash;72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the [[Maastrichtian]] (around 72.1&ndash;66.0 million years ago), that lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event.<ref name="Brochu2003">{{cite journal |author=Brochu, C.A. |year=2003 |title=Phylogenetic approaches toward crocodylian history |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Science |volume=31 |pages=357<U+2013>397 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141308 }}</ref>

The success of the crocodilians has been due to their complete dominance of the predatory water-edge niche, a position they have occupied for more than 85 million years. The musculo-skeletal adaptations they developed can generate a higher bite-force and tooth pressure than that of any other living animal. Since the bony structure and musculature was modified in this way it has remained essentially unchanged, and modern crocodilians vary little from their ancestors in this respect. In 2012, Erickson et al. measured the [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] properties of their jaws and combined the findings with a phylogeny formed from [[DNA sequencing]] to give a maximum likelihood cladogram of the extant crocodilians (excluding the [[Yacare caiman]] for which no DNA evidence was available).

==Interactions with humans==

===Farming and ranching===
{{Main|Alligator farm}}
[[File:Crocodile Farm.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of a crocodile farm in Cambodia]]
Alligators and crocodiles were first farmed in the early 20th century, but the facilities involved were [[zoo]]-like and their main source of income was from [[tourist attraction|tourism]]. By the early 1960s, the feasibility of farming these reptiles on a commercial scale was investigated in response to the decline of many crocodilian species around the world. Farming involves breeding and rearing captive stock on a self-contained basis, whereas ranching means the use of eggs, juveniles, or adults taken each year from the wild. Commercial organisations must satisfy the criteria of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES) by demonstrating that, in the area concerned, they do not adversely impact the wild population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.american-alligator.com/Crocodiles-and-Alligator-Farms.html |work=Americana Alligator |title=Crocodiles and Alligator Farms |accessdate= 7 November 2013}}</ref>

Alligator and crocodile farming began because of demand for their hides, but now nearly all parts of the animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, the gall bladders are valued in the Far East, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/30/us/anahuac-journal-alligator-farmer-feeds-demand-for-all-the-parts.html |title=Anahuac Journal; Alligator Farmer Feeds Demand for All the Parts |work=The New York Times |date=30 November 1998 |last=Lyman |first=Rick |accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref> In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], alligator meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ten Threatened and Endangered Species Used in Traditional Medicine: Chinese Alligator |author=Stromberg, Joseph; Zielinski, Sarah |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Ten-Threatened-and-Endangered-Species-Used-in-Traditional-Medicine.html |newspaper=Smithsonian |date=19 October 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}</ref>

===Attacks===
{{main|Crocodile attack}}
{{see also|Alligator wrestling}}
Crocodilians are opportunistic predators that are at their most dangerous in water and at the edge of water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the [[black caiman]], the [[Morelet's crocodile]], the [[mugger crocodile]], the [[American crocodile]], the [[gharial]], and the freshwater crocodile.<ref name=IUCN-CSG>{{cite web|title=Crocodilian Attacks|url=http://www.iucncsg.org/pages/Crocodilian-Attacks.html|publisher=IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Alligator warning.jpg|thumb|right|Sign in Florida warning of alligators]]

The Nile crocodile has a reputation as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and [[Crypsis|cryptically]] coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young.<ref name=Ross177>Pooley, Hines & Shield, pp. 174<U+2013>177.</ref> Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal.<ref name=IUCN-CSG/> Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.<ref name=AusCrocAttack>{{cite journal | author=Caldicott, David G.

American alligators are recorded as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten of these were in the water and two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year.<ref name=IUCN-CSG/> Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile,<ref name=Kelly61>Kelly, pp. 61<U+2013>62.</ref> but the increase in density of the human population in the [[Everglades]] has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks.<ref name=IUCN-CSG/><ref name=Kelly61/>

===As pets===
Several species of crocodilian are traded as [[exotic pet]]s. They are appealing when young, and pet-store owners can easily sell them, but crocodilians do not make good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.<ref>Kelly, pp. 108<U+2013>111.</ref>

==Conservation==
[[File:Bristol.zoo.crocshoes.arp.jpg|thumb|Crocodile skins can be used to make items such as these shoes on display at a conservation exhibit at [[Bristol Zoo]], England.]]
The main threat to crocodilians around the world is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the skins of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was legal to hunt them. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted skins. In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.<ref name=Adams>{{cite book | title=Against Extinction: The Story of Conservation | publisher=Earthscan | author=William M.

The gharial has undergone a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the [[IUCN]] to list the species as [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]]. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96<U+2013>98%, reduced to a small number of widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for [[indigenous medicine]]. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of [[gill net]]s and the loss of riverine habitat.<ref name=IUCN>{{IUCN |assessors=Choudhury, B. C.; Singh, L. A.

The American Alligator has also suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it was listed as an endangered species, but the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and state wildlife agencies in the [[Southern United States]] stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it was removed from the endangered species list.<ref name=ufws>{{cite web|title=American Alligator ''Alligator mississippiensis''|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|date=1 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2012 |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/alligator.pdf}}</ref> Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the [[Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge]], a large area of marshland in the state of [[Louisiana]].

Ancient historians have described crocodilians from the earliest historical records, though often their descriptions contain as much legend as fact.

:"In that country [of [[Prester John]]] and by all Ind [India] be great plenty of cockodrills, that is a manner of a long serpent, as I have said before. And in the night they dwell in the water, and on the day upon the land, in rocks and in caves. And they eat no meat in all the winter, but they lie as in a dream, as do the serpents. These serpents slay men, and they eat them weeping; and when they eat they move the over jaw, and not the nether jaw, and they have no tongue."<ref name=Mandeville/>

[[William Shakespeare]] refers to crocodile tears in ''[[Othello]]'' (Act IV, Scene i), ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'' (Act III, Scene i), and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (Act II, Scene vii).

Crocodilians, especially the crocodile, have been recurring characters in stories for children throughout the modern era. [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) contains the poem ''[[How Doth the Little Crocodile]]'',<ref>{{cite book | title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland | publisher=Macmillan | author=Carroll, Lewis | year=1865 | chapter=2}}</ref> a [[parody]] of a moralising poem by [[Isaac Watts]], ''[[wikisource:Against Idleness and Mischief|Against Idleness and Mischief]]''.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XJ8FllQp5goC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7 | title=Parody | publisher=Routledge | author=Dentith, Simon | year=2002 | page=7 | isbn=9780203451335}}</ref>
In [[J. M. Barrie]]'s novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' (1911), the character [[Captain Hook]] has lost his arm to the crocodile. Hook fears the crocodile, but is warned of its approach by the ticking of a clock which it has swallowed.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26654/26654-h/26654-h.htm | title=Peter and Wendy | publisher=Hodder & Stoughton (UK); Charles Scribner's Sons (USA) | author=Barrie, J.

In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'' (1902), the Elephant's Child acquires his trunk by having his nose pulled very hard by the Crocodile "on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy [[Limpopo]] river". The newly elongated nose allows him to pick fruit instead of waiting for it to fall, and to do many other useful things.<ref>{{cite book | title=Just So Stories | publisher=Macmillan | author=Kipling, Rudyard | year=1962 (first published 1902) | pages=45<U+2013>56}}</ref> [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[The Enormous Crocodile]]'' (1978), illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]], tells how a crocodile wanders the jungle looking for children to eat, trying one trick after another.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Enormous Crocodile | publisher=Jonathan Cape | author=Dahl, Roald | year=1978}}</ref>

===In sports and media===
Crocodilians are sometimes used [[mascot]]s for sports teams. The [[Canton Crocodiles]] were a [[baseball]] team in the [[Frontier League]],<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=cyOkL_arQMwC&pg=PA8&dq=baseball+crocodiles | title=Akron-Canton Baseball Heritage | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2007 | author=Maroon, Thomas; Maroon, Margaret; Holbert, Craig | page=8 | isbn=9780738551135}}</ref> for example, and the Southern Districts [[association football|football]] team in the Australian [[Northern Territory Football League]] uses the crocodile as its emblem.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Full Points Footy Encyclopedia of Australian Football Clubs, Volume 1 | publisher=Lulu.com | year=2008 | author=Devaney, John | page=492}}</ref> The [[University of Florida]] sport teams are known as the [[Florida Gators]], in reference to the American alligator, and their mascots are [[Albert and Alberta Gator]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GatorSports homepage|url=http://www.gatorsports.com/|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> In film and television, crocodilians are represented as dangerous obstacles in lakes and rivers, as in the 1986 Australian comedy film ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title= Film: 'Crocodile Dundee' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 September 1986 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/movies/film-crocodile-dundee.html |accessdate=11 November 2013 | author=Darnton, Nina}}</ref> or as monstrous [[man-eater]]s in horror films like ''[[Eaten Alive]]'' (1977), ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]'' (1980), ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]'' (1999), ''[[Primeval (film)|Primeval]]'' (2007), and ''[[Black Water (film)|Black Water]]'' (2007).<ref>Wylie p. 183.</ref> Some media have attempted to portray these reptiles in more positive or educational light, such as [[Steve Irwin]]'s [[wildlife documentary]] series ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''.<ref>Kelly. p. 228.</ref> Crocodilians in [[animation]] include the [[Hanna-Barbera]] character [[Wally Gator]], and Ben Ali Gator from the ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'' segment of [[Disney]]'s 1940 film ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.
