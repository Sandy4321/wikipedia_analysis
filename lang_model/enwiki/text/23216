'''Nicole Raczynski'''<ref name=owow>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/nikki-roxx.html|title=Nikki Roxx's profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> (born April 19, 1979)<ref name=owow/> is an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] under the ring name '''Roxxi'''. She currently works for [[Shimmer Women Athletes]] and various other independent promotions under the ring name '''Nikki Roxx'''.

==Professional wrestling career==
Growing up, Raczynski attended professional wrestling events at the [[Boston Garden]] with her parents. She trained as a wrestler under [[Walter Kowalski|Killer Kowalski]] at the urging of [[April Hunter]] who was already training there. As noted in an interview by Tommy Fierro from the Who's Slamming Who wrestling podcasts, Raczynski was allowed to train at the school for free, according to her, because of Kowalski's "soft spot for the women that were trying to get into the business" (other women, such as [[Chyna]], are known to have paid, possibly because one of Kowalski's own students urged her to train). She debuted in March 2002 under the ring name '''Nikki Roxx''' and later formed a tag team with Hunter called '''The Killer Babes'''. Raczynski wrestled in numerous North American independent promotions such as [[Shimmer Women Athletes]], Squared Circle Wrestling, [[Women's Extreme Wrestling]] (WEW), [[Professional Girl Wrestling Association]], [[New England Championship Wrestling]], Defiant Pro Wrestling, [[MXW Pro Wrestling]], [[World Women's Wrestling]], [[Chaotic Wrestling]] and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH). She has also wrestled in [[Mexico]] for promotions such as [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Lucha Libre Femenil and [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] (AAA).

===Shimmer Women Athletes (2005<U+2013>present)===
On November 6, 2005, Raczynski made her [[Shimmer Women Athletes]] debut under the name Nikki Roxx at the promotions first ever tapings. On Volume 1 she teamed up with [[Cindy Rogers]] in a losing effort against [[Kristin Eubanks|Krissy Vaine]] and [[Amber O'Neal]] and on Volume 2, taped that same night, she defeated [[Lexie Fyfe]].<ref name=owow/> She returned to the promotion on February 12, 2006, for the tapings of Volumes 3 and 4, during which she lost to [[Bonnie Maxon|Rain]] and defeated Amber O'Neal in singles matches.<ref name=owow/> On May 21 at the tapings of Volume 5, she had a breakout performance in a losing effort against [[Kia Stevens|Amazing Kong]].<ref name=owow/> After a series of victories over [[Lorelei Lee]], [[Lacey (wrestler)|Lacey]], [[Malia Hosaka]] and [[Tiana Ringer]] on the following four Volumes, Roxx had worked her way from opening matches to main eventing her first Shimmer event, Volume 10, which was taped on April 7, 2007.<ref name=owow/> At the event Roxx was defeated by [[Sara Del Rey]].<ref name=owow/> In June Roxx took part in the tournament to determinate the first ever [[Shimmer Championship|Shimmer Champion]]. She defeated Rain to advance to the second round, where she was defeated by Lacey.<ref name=owow/> On Volume 12 she won a four corner survival match against [[Ana Rocha|Ariel]], [[Portia Perez]] and [[Eden Black]].<ref name=owow/> In the main event of Volume 13 she teamed up with Sara Del Rey in a tag team match, where they defeated the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew of Lacey and Rain.<ref name=owow/> On July 1, 2007, at the tapings of Volume 14 Roxx had a rematch with Amazing Kong, but was once again defeated.<ref name=owow/> This would mark Roxx's final Shimmer appearance in over a year, as after the event she signed a contract with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and was forced to leave the promotion.<ref name=owow/>

On July 5, 2008, at the tapings of Volume 19 Roxx made her return and defeated [[Nicole Matthews]] in a singles match.<ref name=owow/> Later that same night on Volume 20, she was defeated by Ariel.<ref name=owow/> At the October 19 tapings of Volumes 21 and 22 Roxx defeated [[Danyah Rivietz|Danyah]] and lost to [[Jetta (wrestler)|Jetta]].<ref name=owow/> The next four Volumes were taped in May 2009, during which she defeated [[Catherine Power|Cat Power]] and [[Melanie Cruise (wrestler)|Melanie Cruise]] in singles matches and formed the tag team ''Pretty Bitchin''' with Ariel and lost to [[The International Home Wrecking Crew]] (Rain and Jetta) and defeated ''The Experience'' (Lexi Fyfe and Malia Hosaka) in tag team matches.<ref name=owow/> On November 8 at the tapings of Volume 27 Roxx competed in her biggest match in Shimmer Women Athletes, unsuccessfully challenging [[MsChif]] for the Shimmer Championship.<ref name=shim2728>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/121486/SHIMMER-Vol.-27-and-28-DVD-Taping-Results-%28SPOILERS%29.htm|title=SHIMMER Vol. 27 and 28 DVD Taping Results|date=2009-11-09|first=Larry|last=Csonka|accessdate=2010-02-27|publisher=411Mania}}</ref> On Volume 28, taped that same night, Roxx bounced back by defeating [[Wesna|Wesna Busic]].<ref name=shim2728/> On April 10, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 29, Roxx and Ariel defeated the team of Melanie Cruise and [[Annie Social]] to earn a match for the [[Shimmer Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=Shimmer2932>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/135648/411s-Live-SHIMMER-Report:-April-10th-and-11th.htm|title=411<U+2019>s Live SHIMMER Report: April 10th and 11th|publisher=411Mania|last=Byers|first=Ryan|date=2010-04-12|accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref> On Volume 30, taped that same day, Roxx was defeated by [[Ayumi Kurihara]] in a singles match.<ref name=Shimmer2932/> The following day, on Volume 31, Roxx and Ariel received their shot at the Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by the defending champions, the Canadian NINJAs (Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez).<ref name=Shimmer2932/>

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007<U+2013>2009)===
According to an interview, thanks to a push made for her by [[Chris Parks|Abyss]] (who she met on a 2CW show in [[Syracuse, New York]]), [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] contacted her and signed Raczynski to a contract in the summer of 2007.

====Voodoo Kin Mafia====
[[Image:Roxxi.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The "Voodoo Queen" Roxxi Laveaux at the [[TNA Impact! Zone]].]]
Raczynski debuted in TNA on July 15, 2007 at the [[TNA Victory Road#2007|Victory Road]] [[pay-per-view]]. Identified as "The Voodoo Queen" Roxxi Laveaux, she was introduced as the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] of the [[New Age Outlaws|Voodoo Kin Mafia]]. Following a match between the Voodoo Kin Mafia and [[Basham Brothers|Basham and Damaja]], Roxxi brawled with [[Christy Hemme]], the valet of Basham and Damaja. On the September 27, 2007 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'', Roxxi defeated Hemme, [[Gail Kim]], [[Jacqueline Moore|Jackie Moore]] and [[Tracy Brookshaw|Ms. Brooks]] in a [[Bound for Glory (2007)|Bound for Glory]] preview match to claim the 10th and final spot in the TNA Women's Championship Gauntlet. Roxxi made it to the final two, although Kim ultimately won to become the first [[TNA Women's Knockout Championship|TNA Women's Knockout Champion]]. On the following pay-per-view, [[TNA Genesis#2007|Genesis]], Roxxi competed in a four-way match between herself, Kim, [[Jessica Kresa|ODB]], and [[Angelina Love|Angel Williams]] for the TNA Women's Championship. Roxxi had the advantage when she spit [[Asian mist]] into ODB's face, but Kim her took down long enough to pin ODB and retain her title.

Roxxi competed in a tag team match at [[TNA Turning Point#2007|Turning Point]], teaming up with ODB to take on Angelina Love (Angel Williams) and [[Velvet Sky]]. However, Roxxi and ODB lost the match, with Roxxi being pinned after the double-team [[Professional wrestling throws#Russian legsweep|Russian legsweep]] from Sky and a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]] from Love. On the January 3, 2008 edition of ''Impact!'', Roxxi participated in a Gauntlet match that would help determine the 2008 rankings of the TNA Knockouts division. She made it to the final two, facing off against ODB, but was pinned. She was fired from the Voodoo Kin Mafia by [[Monty Sopp|Kip James]] on the January 31, 2008 edition of ''Impact!'', because she accidentally threw white powder in the eyes of Kip and cost him the match against [[Shawn Hernandez|Hernandez]].

====The Hardcore Knockout====
On the March 6 edition of ''Impact!'' Roxxi was shown in a backstage promo with Angelina Love and Velvet Sky who insisted on giving her a makeover the next week, so they could make her into one of the "[[The Beautiful People (professional wrestling)|beautiful people]]". On the following episode of ''Impact!'', Roxxi became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] when she resisted their attempts to change her, and in response the duo attacked her and called her a freak, sparking a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between them. She defeated Love on the April 10, 2008 edition of ''Impact!'' by debuting her new finisher, the Voodoo Drop. She then went on to win the first-ever [[TNA Knockout#Queen of the Cage|Queen of the Cage]] match at [[Lockdown (2008)|Lockdown]], ultimately pinning Love after a Voodoo Drop, and as a result of winning, she was granted a Knockouts Title match. The title match occurred on the following ''Impact!'', where she was pinned by then-champion [[Kia Stevens|Awesome Kong]].

[[File:Spike and Roxxi.jpg|thumb|right|Roxxi with [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] at a [[Top Rope Promotions]] event.]]
On May 11, 2008 at [[Sacrifice (2008)|Sacrifice]], Roxxi competed in a [[TNA Knockout]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Makeover Battle Royal]], a two part match where the first part was contested under normal battle royal rules. The last two women in the ring would then compete in a [[ladder match]] where the winner would become the new #1 contender while the loser would have to have her [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|head shaved bald]]. Roxxi survived the battle royal part of the match, but was defeated in the ladder match by Gail Kim after Angelina Love and Velvet Sky interfered in the match (Kim had won an immunity match in a previous episode of ''Impact!'', which meant that had Roxxi won the ladder match, Love would have been the one to have her head shaved). Roxxi was shaved bald on the spot with the other Knockouts watching. She received a standing ovation from the face Knockouts and fans after the shaving.<ref name=Sacrifice2008>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25556.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Sacrifice PPV report 5/11: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of live PPV|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2008-05-11|accessdate=2010-01-19|publisher=PWTorch}}</ref> On the following ''Impact!'', the "Laveaux" portion of her name was dropped and she was now being billed as simply Roxxi. At [[Slammiversary (2008)|Slammiversary]], she teamed with ODB and Kim to defeat [[The Beautiful People (professional wrestling)|The Beautiful People]] and [[Mickie Knuckles|Moose]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Six Woman Tag Team match]].

From August Roxxi began to phase into a new [[gimmick]]: that of a Hardcore Knockout as emphasized by a series of TNA Rough Cut segments. She later participated in several hardcore matches, often getting bloodied during them. She also developed a [[punk subculture|punk]] like attitude during interviews, often swearing excessively. On September 25, 2008, she disguised herself as [[Cheerleader Melissa|Raisha Saeed]], the manager of Awesome Kong, when Kong was facing [[Alexxis Nevaeh|Mercedes Steele]]. After the match, Roxxi removed her disguise and attacked Kong with a steel chair. Because of this stunt, she was granted a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|three-way dance]] match between herself, [[Shantelle Malawski|Taylor Wilde]], and Awesome Kong at [[Bound for Glory IV]] for the Knockouts Championship, which Wilde won. Roxxi and Wilde attacked Kong and Saeed on the October 30 episode of ''Impact!'', continuing their feud. At [[Turning Point (2008)|Turning Point]], Roxxi and Wilde teamed up and defeated Kong and Saeed. Roxxi and Wilde teamed up again, this time with ODB, and defeated the Beautiful People and [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]] at [[Final Resolution (December 2008)|Final Resolution]]. Roxxi and Wilde eventually moved into a regular tag team and feud with the Beautiful People, even hiring a [[Daffney|Sarah Palin impersonator]] to embarrass them. Her last match was at [[Destination X (2009)|Destination X]] where she teamed with Wilde and the Governor to defeat the Beautiful People and [[Ashley Lane|Madison Rayne]]. On April 30, 2009, Roxxi was released from her TNA contract while serving a 60-day suspension following a backstage altercation with [[Trenesha Biggers|Rhaka Khan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_31763.shtml |title=TNA News: TNA Knockout leaving the company, wishes them well in future endeavors |work=PWTorch |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=38402&p=1 |title=TNA Releases Top Knockout |work=PWInsider |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref>

===Independent wrestling===
Once again as Nikki Roxx, she became the fourth woman to hold the [[Women Superstars Uncensored]] (WSU) Championship defeating then champion [[Tammy Lynn Sytch]] and [[Alexa Thatcher]] in a three-way match. This match took place on March 21, 2008 in [[Bergenfield, New Jersey]]. Roxx pinned Thatcher to capture the title as Sytch was distracted by [[Becky Bayless]]. On May 31, in [[Rahway, New Jersey]], Roxx lost the title to [[Angel Orsini]] in a [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] event. As Roxxi, she became the first Eastern Pro Wrestling Women's Champion at an event in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] on August 1, 2008. She is also a regular competitor for Squared Circle Wrestling (2CW) based out of Upstate New York.
