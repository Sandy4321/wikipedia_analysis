"'''Reverse Cowgirl'''" is the first episode of the [[South Park (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[South Park]]'', and the 224th episode of the series overall. It premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 14, 2012. In the episode, a nationwide catastrophe occurs after [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s mother is killed because Clyde forgot to put the [[toilet seat]] down. 

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA|TV-MA L]] in the United States. It parodies both the gender-divided social etiquette regarding toilet seats, and the [[post-9/11]] airport security measures imposed by the [[Transportation Security Administration]].

==Plot==
[[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] unintentionally leaves the [[toilet seat]] up, causing his mother, Betsy, to punish him in front of [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. This embarrasses Clyde, who asks the guys not to tell anyone. Cartman nonetheless tells the entire class the next day, while [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] is dumbfounded to learn that everyone sits on the toilet facing away from the tank, as he has been sitting facing it in order to use the tank as a shelf for reading material and drinks. Betsy then appears and again excoriates Clyde for leaving the toilet seat up, and takes him home. Later that night, after Clyde, yet again, forgot to put the toilet seat down, Betsy falls into the toilet, causing a [[Disembowelment#Transanal evisceration|suction that rips out her organs]], killing her.

Betsy's death spurs the Toilet Safety Administration to implement new safety regulations for people's toilets, including requiring all toilets to be outfitted with safety harnesses and security cameras, conducting surprise inspections in people's homes as they relieve themselves, and creating checkpoints in both private and public bathrooms that create huge lines. Cartman and the rest of the town is outraged, and speak out against these measures, though a schism develops between the women, who insist men should simply put the seat down, and the men, who opine that women should simply check to see if the seat is down before sitting on the toilet. Meanwhile, Stan, Kyle, Clyde and [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] seek legal recourse with an unscrupulous lawyer who says he specializes in suing dead people, and decides to conduct a "[[s<U+00E9>ance|sue-ance]]" that will contact the spirit of [[John Harington (writer)|John Harington]], the inventor of the [[flush toilet]], in order to sue him. However, the lawyer's attempts fail to contact Harington, and after each attempt, he extorts more money from the boys.

A TSA employee who masturbates while monitoring bathroom security cameras sees that Cartman, armed with a gun, has taken a TSA checkpoint inspector and a baby hostage in his bathroom, before disabling his camera. [[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy]] leads the public in speaking out against the TSA and the fact that it allowed a terrorist with a gun and a baby past a security checkpoint. Randy also announces that they are all determined to contact Harington with a public sueance. At the public sueance, Betsy's ghost appears, and tells Clyde that the lawyer is a fraud, and that her death is Clyde's fault for not putting their toilet seat down. The real ghost of Harington then appears and angrily announces that it is nobody's fault, saying that everyone is using his invention the wrong way. He announces that his toilet design requires people to sit facing the tank, and not outward, much to the surprise of everyone in the courtroom (except Butters, who has always been using it like that). When Randy states that doing so would require a person to have to remove their pants to use it this way, Harington responds that he indeed ''intended'' for users to remove their pants and, pointing to the [[Glory hole (sexual slang)|hole on one of the walls]] of the prop bathroom, indicates that this was why he designed toilets with a laundry hole. Clyde eventually begins using the toilet in the manner shown by Harington, but defiantly places the seat up, looks up, and [[finger (gesture)|gives the finger]] to his dead mother.

==Reception==
Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] gave the episode a "Good" score of 7.5 out of 10, noting the "double whammy" of the tackling both the social etiquette of toilet seats and the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. Nicholson opined that while the former topic was not necessarily hilarious, it was nonetheless funny, and that Cartman was well-used to pace what would have otherwise been a difficult joke to mine for an entire episode. Nicholson also felt that while mocking the TSA was somewhat dated, there was still potential for humor in that topic to be exploited, in particular the masturbating TSA security camera monitor. Less funny, Nicholson felt, were the "sueance" scenes that harbored moments that were clever but not outstanding, and felt like padding, though he lauded the convergence of the two storylines by the episode's climax.<ref>Nicholson, Max (March 15, 2012).

Jacob Kleinman of ''[[International Business Times]]'' felt the funniest jokes of the episode were those featuring Cartman and Randy,<ref name=IntBizTimes>Kleinman, Jacob (March 15, 2012).

Geeks of Doom.</ref>

Ryan McGee of [[The A.V. Club]] gave the episode an "[[Academic grading in the United States|A-]]", having enjoyed its satire of government encroachment onto American civil liberties, and the replacement of personal responsibility on the part of some Americans with superfluous litigation. While McGee felt that the "sueance" scenes dragged somewhat, he felt that Cartman's reaction to the TSA was a worthwhile payoff, and that the show's use of "[[Carnivalesque|non-sequitur weirdness]]" provided strong final moments.<ref>McGee, Ryan.

Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, finding its gags at the expense of the TSA "hilarious", and the "sueance" scenes "clever", remarking that lawyer jokes never get old. Hochberger singled out the convergence of the two storylines in the episode's climax as his favorite part, and enjoying the fact that Butters' ideas for using the toilet turned out to be correct.<ref>Hochberger, Eric (March 14, 2012).
