{{nihongo|'''Claydol'''|<U+30CD><U+30F3><U+30C9><U+30FC><U+30EB>|Nend<U+014D>ru|'''Nendoll''' in original [[Japanese language]] versions}} is a fictional entity from the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'' franchise. Claydol's design is similar to the <U+906E><U+5149><U+5668><U+571F><U+5076> (''shak<U+014D>kidog<U+016B>''), a "spaceman" [[dogu|clay figurine]] from the [[Jomon|J<U+014D>mon period]] of [[Japan]]ese history.

''Claydol'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''clay'' and ''doll'' (or ''idol''). Its Japanese name, ''Nendoll'', is a [[portmanteau]] of the word {{nihongo|''nendo''|<U+7C98><U+571F>|[[clay]]}} and the English word ''doll''. The ''nen'' portion of its name could be a pun on the word <U+5FF5> (''nen''), thought, often in other words relating to human [[conciousness]].

==Characteristics==
Claydol is a moderately large, animated figurine possessed by an unexplained [[sentience]] of its own. Its enigmatic nature is accentuated by its equally imposing appearance, complete with stylized markings on its body and a disc-shaped head lined on the rim with no less than eight pink, possibly sightless eyes.

Claydol acts like a normal Pok<U+00E9>mon when instructed to take action in Pok<U+00E9>mon battles, but its tendencies in the wild are intriguing. It is imbued with a high degree of telekinetic power. It is always using telekinesis to keep itself afloat above the surface of the ground, whether it is traveling, standing still, or even sleeping. Its screw-shaped arms are separate objects that are connected to its body through telekinesis, and they float around Claydol<U+2019>s body on Claydol<U+2019>s accord. In battle, it positions its arms out in front and shoots lateral beams at its targets.

The generally agreed-upon theory about the Claydol species<U+2019> existence is that it was a doll or a statue made of mud and clay by primitive humans, of an ancient civilization dating back around 20,000 years, and then was brought to life by exposure under a mysterious ray.

== In the video games ==
In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'']], and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald|Emerald]]'',Claydol can  be evolved from [[Baltoy]].The Pokemon League Champion '''Steven Stone''' uses a Level 56 claydol to battle the player. After winning the League the player can access the Sky Pillar, an ancient, crumbling tower that houses many high-level Pok<U+00E9>mon including the legendary [[Rayquaza]].Wild Claydol can be found in the Pillar's first floor.

Claydol makes for an interesting opponent to hand. Its unique type blend of Ground and Psychic elements gives it a host of resistances (including its Levitate ability) as well as weaknesses, namely against Water, Ice, Bug, Grass, and Dark-type moves. Statistically, it is oriented toward defense, with very high Special Defense and nearly as high Defense, and both can be bolstered by Claydol<U+2019>s Cosmic Power move at the same time. Claydol<U+2019>s other stats are all below average, which is unfortunate as they have the ability to learn a wide array of exceptionnally strong physical and elemental attacks, including Psychic, Ancientpower, Ice Beam, Hyper Beam, Solarbeam, Earthquake, Shadow Ball, and Explosion.

== Anime appearances ==
{{spoiler}}

In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]] Episode 381, "Claydol, Big and Tall", [[Team Rocket]] releases an abnormally large Claydol from its necessarily large [[Pokeball]] in an attempt to steal it. The Pok<U+00E9>mon goes on a destructive rampage, and Team Rocket ends up working with [[Ash Ketchum]] and his friends to return the Claydol to another giant Pok<U+00E9> Ball and restore peace.

For the Grand Festival Saga (AG121-123), all 3 major rivals to May had new Pok<U+00E9>mon, Drew had a Flygon, Harley had a Banette, and Robert had a Claydol. The Claydol appeared in the final episode "Rhapsody In Drew". Robert ended up winning the Grand Festival. Spencer of the [[Battle Palace]], owns a Claydol. In the English version, the voice of Spencer's Claydol is from the Japanese version, considering that it can be heard saying "Nen!" (the first part of its Japanese name "Nendoll") multiple times during battle, sounding nothing like the giant Claydol from Episode 381.
