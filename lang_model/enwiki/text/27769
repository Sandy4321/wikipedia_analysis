{{Campaignbox 2011 Libyan civil war}}

The '''Battle of Sirte''' was the final battle of the [[Libyan civil war]], beginning when the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Army]] attacked forces loyal to ousted leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in his hometown and designated capital of [[Sirte]], on the [[Gulf of Sidra]].<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO BE CURRENT. Historical perspective means that we start from the beginning of the battle. Thus, from September not October.

==Background==
{{main|Second Gulf of Sidra offensive}}
[[Anti-Gaddafi forces]] made a three-pronged advance toward Sirte over the course of several weeks, pushing forward from [[Misrata]] in the west, [[Brega]] in the east, and desert positions in the south, but met fierce resistance and suffered heavy casualties in their effort to reach the city.

On 16 September, [[Al Jazeera]] claimed that Sirte's [[Gardabya Airport|airport]], 10 kilometers south of the city, was under NTC control.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7KG14F20110916|location=Tunis|agency=Reuters|work=Reuters Africa|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=Libyan NTC fighters seize Sirte airport - TV}}</ref> It was also confirmed that opposition forces had to retreat from the city itself the previous night, after entering it briefly, due to encountering heavy resistance. On 16 September, NTC forces launched a larger offensive into the city and heavy fighting ensued on Sirte's main boulevard, 1 September St.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkish-pm-erdogan-arrives-libyan-capital-14533415|work=ABC|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=Libyan Fighters Press Into Gadhafi Strongholds}}</ref>

According to a man claiming to be a spokesman for opposition fighters from inside Sirte, opposition forces controlled much of the city already, and it had been under siege by pro-Gaddafi forces for several months. The man's identity and his claims could not be independently confirmed.<ref>[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-16-2011-1314 Fri, 16 Sep 2011, 11:14 GMT+3 - Libya]</ref>

By the evening, opposition forces pulled back from the city after a day of chaotic, fierce street fighting, contradicting the earlier report by the claimed opposition spokesman from Sirte. The support the opposition expected from Sirte's residents did not materialize and loyalists showed more fierce resistance than what was anticipated by the opposition.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

On 17 September, anti-Gaddafi fighters renewed their offensive. Sirte's interim representative in the NTC said he had information that "there is no full control over Sirte" for either side, with parts of the city remaining under loyalist control and other parts of the city being taken by opposition fighters. At least three anti-Gaddafi fighters were killed in the fighting, and many wounded were evacuated to a field hospital set up at a gas station on the outskirts of Sirte.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/17/libya-sirte-bani-walid_n_967474.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=17 September 2011|accessdate=17 September 2011|title=Libya: Rebels Advance In Sirte, Pull Back From Bani Walid|location=Sirte|first1=Ryan|last2=Lucas|first2=Hadeel|last2=Al-Shalchi|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

On the eastern front, [[Al Jazeera]] reported anti-Gaddafi forces were still struggling to advance. A correspondent in [[Ra's Lanuf]] said many villages that anti-Gaddafi fighters had entered were found to be deserted, suggesting that their inhabitants had been persuaded to flee by pro-Gaddafi elements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-17-2011-1318|work=Al Jazeera|date=17 September 2011|accessdate=17 September 2011|title=Sat, 17 Sep 2011, 11:18 GMT+3 - Libya}}</ref>

Dr. Eman Mohammed, a civilian doctor who worked at the city's central Ibn Sina Hospital before fleeing the fighting to NTC-held territory, reported that most civilian deaths and injuries appear to have been caused by NTC shelling,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/world/africa/fighters-enter-qaddafi-stronghold-of-surt-libya-as-toll-rises.html |title=Fighters Enter Qaddafi Stronghold City as Toll Rises|first=Kareem|last=Fahim|location=Tripoli|work=New York Times |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> causing vengeful relatives to join the pro-Gaddafi forces as armed volunteers.<ref>{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/09/26/libya-sirte-nato-gadhafi.html |title=Civilians flee Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte |work=Canadian Broadcasting Company |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the main NTC eastern assault body fought their way to 10 kilometers east of the town<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7KQ1XT20110926|title=WRAPUP 2-Libyan tanks strike Sirte loyalists|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first1=Alexander|last1=Dziadosz|first2=Sherine|last2=El Madany}}</ref> and then entered city itself few hours later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7KQ35120110926|title=Libyan forces enter Gaddafi home town from east|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte}}</ref>

On 27 September, an NTC senior military commander in Tripoli announced that their forces managed to secure the port and were battling for control of the city center where snipers were halting their progress.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/27/world/africa/libya-war/ Libyan anti-Gadhafi forces take over port in Sirte]</ref> Opposition troops advancing from the west were still in the city's outskirts while those advancing from the east were pinned down by the snipers at a roundabout approximately 2 kilometers from the city center, at the eastern edge of the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/09/27/idINIndia-59562320110927|title=Snipers hold up push into Gaddafi stronghold of Sirte|work=Reuters India|agency=Reuters|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first1=Alexander|last1=Dziadosz|first2=Sherine|last2=El Madany}}</ref> Later during the day, a NTC fighter came from the roundabout to the opposition lines outside the city and, panicky, requested more reinforcements for those still left behind. The NTC forces that managed to get to the roundabout could not move due to the heavy sniper activity and were constantly hit with accurate artillery and rocket fire, sustaining heavy casualties. However, the reinforcements could not go in because of the heavy artillery barrage between them and the cut-off troops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7KR3BG20110927|title=Loyalists make stand in Gaddafi's home town|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first=Sherine|last=El Madany}}</ref> Heavy face-to-face fighting was also raging at the Mahari hotel.<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/1244240/-/13487yq/-/ Anti-Gaddafi fighters pounded in fight for Sirte]</ref>

On 28 September, the NTC offensive continued with the west and east opposition forces attempting to link up south of the city by capturing the airport, which they had already claimed on several occasions to have seized in the past.<ref name="khaleejtimes1"/> However, at least on the eastern side, there were almost no advances by the opposition. NTC fighters were still pinned down, for a third day, at the roundabout, and not even the arrival of five tanks managed to break the stalemate since they quickly came under accurate loyalist rocket fire, missing them by only a few yards.<ref>[http://www.sharenet.co.za/news/Libyas_NTC_thinks_Gaddafi_hiding_near_Algeria/a7de29d4b95faec6fbf371d79396e2e7 Libya's NTC thinks Gaddafi hiding near Algeria]</ref>

Later during the evening, the opposition forces on the eastern edge of the city were finally pushed back three kilometers outside the city after a series of ferocious attacks by loyalist fighters.<ref name="vancouversun1"/>

===NTC forces link up, cease-fire===

During the morning of 29 September, the NTC forces pushing from both west and east once again captured the city's airport,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7KT2XL20110929|title=Libyan interim gov't forces capture Sirte airport|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|location=Sirte|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> but were still facing rocket fire from the other side of the runway.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15110440 Libyan forces take Sirte airport]</ref>

On 30 September, there was no major activity on the frontline except the constant shelling. Also, the NTC force at the roundabout was still pinned down for a fifth straight day and had temporarily run out of ammunition the day before.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/libya-idUSL5E7KU39W20110930|title=WRAPUP 1-Civilians flee Sirte battle, fighting hampers aid -UN|agency=Reuters|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|first1=Joseph|last1=Logan|first2=Rania|last2=El Gamal|location=Sirte}}</ref> At this time, a two-day cease-fire was declared by the NTC so to give a chance to civilians to flee the city and also for the Red Cross officials to inspect a hospital close to the city center.<ref name="india1">[http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/libyan-children-killed-as-sirte-exodus-grows_734532.html Libyan children killed as Sirte exodus grows]</ref>

On 1 October, a force of about 100 NTC vehicles entered the city from south and encircled the Ouagadougou Conference Center. Despite the declared cease-fire, NTC shelling of the city center continued near the hospital (west of the conference center) that the humanitarian workers were visiting.<ref name="india1"/>

On 2 October, an NTC source claimed that they had taken 95 percent of the town of [[Qasr Abu Hadi]], just opposite of the airport south of the city,<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15148491 Libya conflict: New offensive on Sirte]</ref> which was home to many pro-Gaddafi loyalists and also a small military base.<ref>[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-oct-2-2011-1408 Al Jazeera Live Blog]</ref> It was also the birthplace of Muammar Gaddafi himself.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/fighters-overrun-gaddafi-birthplace-20111004-1l5st.html|title=Fighters overrun Gaddafi birthplace|work=Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|first=Jay|last=Deshmukh}}</ref> However, another opposition source stated that they were concentrating on the town and still targeting it after they found out from a captured loyalist that [[Moatassem Gaddafi]] was possibly holed up in that area. Red Cross officials who had pulled back from the hospital near the city center described a dire situation with patients dying from the lack of medical supplies and power shortages. They and the fleeing civilians also stated that civilian areas were being hit by indiscriminate fire from both the loyalists, opposition fighters and NATO.<ref>[http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/shortages-killing-patients-in-libya-siege-hospital Shortages "killing patients" in Libya siege hospital]</ref> During the evening, NTC forces had pulled out of the town where Colonel Gaddafi was born claiming they were ordered to by NATO so they would conduct air-strikes in the area.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15141177 Libya conflict: Hundreds of residents flee Sirte]</ref> Later, it was reported that at this time Moatassem Gaddafi managed to slip out of Sirte and headed south into the Libyan desert.<ref>[http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/gaddafis-son-mutassim-flees-hometown-of-sirte--tv/ Gaddafi's son Mutassim flees hometown of Sirte -TV]</ref>

===Fourth opposition attack===

On 4 October, opposition forces moved forward toward the conference centre in Sirte, which was being used as a base by the loyalists. But, soon after, heavy and accurate pro-Gaddafi fire hit the NTC column sending it into a retreat.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/opposition-forces-close-in-on-gaddafi-stronghold-2365188.html Opposition forces close in on Gaddafi stronghold]</ref>

On 5 October, NTC forces claimed to had made a push into the center of Sirte, while their commander announced that they had taken control of half of the city and were expecting it to fall within two days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7L448320111005|title=WRAPUP 4-Libyan government forces push into centre of Sirte|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first1=Rania|last1=El Gamal|first2=Tim|last2=Gaynor}}</ref> Both claims were later found to be untrue. According to NTC forces, the only people left in the city were mercenaries, pro-Gaddafi die-hard fighters, and perhaps Mutassim Gaddafi, while several local citizens said there were almost no loyalist troops left in the city, and resistance was coming mostly from civilian volunteers who were afraid of being massacred by NTC forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/us-libya-sirte-anger-idUSTRE7941C020111005|title=Sirte residents turn anger on Libya's new rulers|agency=Reuters|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first=Rania|last=El Gamal}}</ref> During the assault, for the first time during the war, a loyalist suicide bomber blew himself up among opposition fighters, killing and wounding several, after he managed to infiltrate them.<ref>[http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/international/7404.html Gaddafi uses, for the first time, a suicide bomber against combatants]</ref>

On 6 October, the opposition push into Sirte had once again stalled with loyalist snipers blocking their advance. The only solid gains the NTC made in the previous 24 hours was the taking of a luxurious hotel on the northeastern edge of the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/06/us-libya-idUSL5E7KT4YC20111006|title=Sniper fire holds up push into Gaddafi's|agency=Reuters|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Sirte|first1=Rania|last1=El Gamal|first2=Tim|last2=Gaynor}}</ref> During the night, loyalists advanced several hundred meters under the cover of darkness and took up positions closer to the NTC frontline. Heavy fighting raged during the day on the road leading from the hotel.

On 7 October, NTC forces launched a coordinated attack from three sides, dubbed as the "final assaut", attacking Ouagadougou conference center, the Mauritanian Quarter and the city's university. By the early evening, 15 NTC fighters were killed and 193 wounded.

;13 October<U+2013>19 October
On 13 October, loyalist forces counter-attacked, pushing back NTC troops for 2 kilometres back to the police headquarters they had captured two days before.<ref name=google1/> As dusk fell, the opposition launched a new two-pronged assault in an attempt to re-take the territory they had lost.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8825372/Fall-of-Sirte-very-close-and-will-end-Libyan-conflict-Liam-Fox-declares.html Fall of Sirte 'very close' and will end Libyan conflict, Liam Fox declares]</ref> By midnight, loyalist fighters were cornered to only one small area.

On 14 October, NTC forces started, once again, an advance from the police headquarters into the Al Dollar neighbourhood and district 2, in an effort to re-take the territory they lost the day before. A 100-strong force advanced 2 kilometres and captured a school on the edge of Al Dollar. From there, they started a heavy bombardment of loyalist positions, which their scouting teams had previously identified. The opposition used Grad rockets and several artillery shells. The loyalists responded with heavy fire and by the evening the NTC fighters had pulled back to their positions at the police station.<ref>[http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/10/ntc-pounds-kadhafi-fighters-in-sirte-clashes-in-tripoli/ NTC pounds Kadhafi fighters in Sirte, clashes in Tripoli]</ref> An Al Jazeera

On 15 October, loyalists once again pushed back the opposition troops from the edge of the two hold-outs in the direction of the police station. The NTC forces stated that they would not launch any more direct attacks on the neighbourhoods because of the high possibility they would suffer heavy casualties. Instead, they decided they would bombard that part of the city with rockets and artillery until the loyalist forces surrender.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/gaddafi-loyalists-mount-fierce-fightback-20111016-1lr4d.html|title=Gaddafi loyalists mount fierce fightback|work=Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|first1=Jay|last1=Deshmukh|first2=Daphne|last2=Benoit}}</ref> Meanwhile, opposition fighters found another 11 dumped bodies of people who were, according to them, executed by the loyalists.<ref>[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/15/171974.html More Bodies Found in Sirte]</ref>

On 18 October, after two days of shelling, NTC fighters launched another offensive from the east with approximately 1,000 troops surging into the remaining two neighbourhoods in Sirte under loyalist control, Al Dollar and district Two. This move came a day after NTC forces took control of [[Bani Walid]], thus making pockets in Sirte the only significant remaining area under pro-Gaddafi control in Libya.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Libyan-forces-seize-most-of-Bani-Walid-2222137.php|title=Libyan forces searching Gadhafi stronghold|work=Seattle Post-Intellegencer|first1=Matthew|last1=Lee|first2=Rami|last2=Al-Shaheibi|agency=Associated Press|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Bani Walid}}</ref> The attackers took heavy casualties.

The opposition tried to regroup at the center, but became pinned down as a volley of 22&nbsp;mm rounds hit their positions. The loyalist breakthrough led to NTC positions being shelled by mortar fire on the southern outskirts of the city, which had previously been declared secured, and sniper fire hitting opposition fighters at the Seven Hundred district in the suburbs.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44944679/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/#.Tp5A3N7XpXk Clinton in Libya to offer new aid package]</ref> During this time, an Australian Muslim cleric, who was supporting the NTC, was shot and killed in Sirte, while he was delivering medical aid into the city.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-19/reports-sydney-muslim-leader-killed-in-libya/3579514?section=nsw Reports Sydney Muslim leader killed in Libya]</ref>

On 19 October, field commander [[Essam Baghhar]], succeeding the late Bin Dardef in leading the Zintan Brigade, said the transitional government's fighters had counterattacked and pushed the loyalists back into the Number Two neighbourhood, taking control of Al Dollar, overnight. He said the loyalist-controlled area of Number Two was less than a square kilometre in size. The claim could not be immediately confirmed, though it was reported by [[Al Jazeera]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/liveblog/libya-oct-19-2011-1301|work=Al Jazeera|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=19 October 2011|title=Wed, 19 Oct 2011, 11:01 GMT+3 - Libya}}</ref> Misrata fighters also improvised and brought to the battle a steel armoured bulldozer, armed with four heavy machine guns and a tank gun, for use in breaking through roadblocks.<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/libyan_rebels_unveil_latest_diy_weapon_1_1919235 Libyan rebels unveil latest DIY weapon]</ref>

===Final assault===
{{See also|Death of Muammar Gaddafi}}

On 20 October, the transitional government's fighters started their final assault on the last loyalists' positions at 08:00 local time. Just before the attack, dozens of carloads of loyalists tried to [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] of the enclave down the coastal highway. However about 20 loyalists were killed after the rebel forces attacked them. The last neighbourhood was captured after a battle of 90 minutes; about 16 loyalists were captured.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/10/20/libyan-fighters-capture-qaddafi-hometown/ |title=Libyan Fighters Capture Qaddafi Hometown |work=Fox News |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

In the hours that followed, NTC officials claimed that Muammar Gaddafi had been captured by rebels after being shot in the legs whilst trying to escape Sirte and had been taken away in an ambulance, although the reports were, at least for the immediate time following the announcement, unconfirmed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/home/article/16092905 |title=Colonel Gaddafi Killed, Claim National Transitional Council Officials|work=Sky News|date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/world/libya-s-gaddafi-captured-and-wounded-ntc-2011-10-20-1.424541 |title=Muammar Gaddafi is dead |work=Emirates 24/7 |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> About half an hour later the NTC confirmed that Gaddafi had succumbed to his wounds and died while in custody, and that Gaddafi's defence minister [[Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr]] had also been killed in a firefight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html |title=Muammar Gaddafi killed as Sirte falls|work=Al Jazeera |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> At least three Gaddafi loyalists were also killed in the firefight, according to a photo posted by the Washington Post.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/sirte-fall-rumors-swirl-of-gaddafi-capture-but-all-unconfirmed/2011/10/20/gIQA5wM7zL_blog.html | title=Video Said to Show a Wounded Gaddafi After Capture | work=Washington Post | date=20 October 2011}}</ref>  95 other people were killed when the convoy was bombed by French jets, and during the following firefight.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gaynor|first1=Tim|last2=Zargoun|first2=Taha|location=Sirte|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/21/us-libya-gaddafi-finalhours-idUSTRE79K43S20111021|title=Gaddafi caught like "rat" in a drain, humiliated and shot|agency=Reuters|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref>

Several days later, new camera phone videos that emerged suggested that Gaddafi was captured, taunted, sodomized with a bayonet and then shot in the head. His dead body may have been dragged behind a moving vehicle. These details remain to be independently elaborated and fully confirmed. A full investigation into the final minutes of Gaddafi's life has been promised by the NTC.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/24/gaddafi-sodomized-video_n_1028970.html Gaddafi Sodomized?

On 22 October, NTC forces began mop up operations to finish off the last loyalist elements in Sirte, although there did not appear to be any actual clashes taking place, and the fighters were more occupied clearing up the dead bodies of both sides as well as unexploded ordinance. Also, according to journalists on the scene, Sirte was mostly deserted apart from the NTC garrison.<ref>http://dunyanews.tv/index.php?key=Q2F0SUQ9MyNOaWQ9NDYwNTk%3D&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter</ref><ref>

===NTC massacre of Sirte loyalists===
Within a week after the fall of the city, evidence emerged of mass killings of loyalist prisoners of war and other civilian supporters of Gaddafi's government. The victims killed included men, women, and children, while there were also reports of the rebels harassing and stealing from the locals. According to one resident, "The rebels are worse than rats. Nato is the same as [[Osama bin Laden]]." According to another local woman, "We lived in democracy under Muammer Gaddafi, he was not a dictator. I lived in freedom, Libyan women had full human rights. It isn't that we need Muammar Gaddafi again, but we want to live just as we did before." A local elderly woman stated "They are killing our children. Why are they doing this? For what? Life was good before!"<ref name="telegraph_sirte">{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|title=Gaddafi loyalists stranded as battle for Sirte rages|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8802302/Gaddafi-loyalists-stranded-as-battle-for-Sirte-rages.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 October 2011|location=London}}</ref>

On 24 October, Human Rights Watch reported that 53 pro-Gaddafi fighters were seemingly executed by NTC fighters after they had discovered the remains of the 53 men at the Mahari hotel in Sirte that had been under control of the rebel fighters. Peter Bouckaert, the rights group<U+2019>s emergencies director, said the badly decomposed bodies were found by local residents three days before on 21 October.
