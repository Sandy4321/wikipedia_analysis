Their name was at first, like "[[Nazarenes]]," a common name for all [[early Christians]], was given due to their [[Poverty#Religious_poverty|religious poverty]], which was especially characteristic of the early [[Jerusalem Church]]. Subsequently its application was limited to Jewish Christians. Then, the name was used exclusively for a faction which seperated from the Jewish Christian community. Later in the 4th century, the name was used for a separate party within the Jewish Christian community distinct from the Nazarenes.
 
Without authenticated [[Ebionites#Archaeology|archaeological evidence]] for the existence of the Ebionites, their [[Ebionites#Views and practices|views and practices]] can only be reconstructed from textual references.

==Patristic sources==
{{Jewish Christianity}}
The Ebionites are mentioned or referred to by various [[Fathers of the Church]]:
*The earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the Ebionites appears in [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (c. 140). Justin distinguishes between [[Jewish Christians]] who observe the [[Law of Moses]] but do not require its observance of others, and those who believe the Mosaic Law to be obligatory on all, whom he considers heretics.<ref name="Justin">Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/01282.htm ch. 47].</ref> 
*[[Irenaeus]] (c. 180) was the first to use the term "Ebionites" to describe a heretical judaizing sect, which he regarded as [[Legalism (theology)|stubbornly clinging to the Law]].<ref name="Irenaeus">Irenaeus of Lyon,
''Adversus Haereses'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm I, 26]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103321.htm II,21].</ref> 
*[[Origen]] in c. 212 remarks that the name derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "evyon," meaning "poor."<ref>Origen, ''De Principiis'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm IV, 22].</ref>
*[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the 4th century gives the most complete but also questionable account in his [[heresiology]] called ''[[Panarion]]'', denouncing eighty heretical sects, among them the Ebionites.<ref name="Epiphanius30">Epiphanius of Salamis, ''[[Panarion]] 30.</ref><ref name="Koch 1976">{{cite book| author = Koch, Glenn Alan| title = A Critical Investigation of Epiphanius' Knowledge of the Ebionites: A Translation and Critical Discussion of 'Panarion' 30| publisher = University of Pennsylvania| year = 1976}}</ref> Epiphanius mostly gives general descriptions of their religious beliefs and includes quotations from their [[Ebionites#Writings|gospel]]s, which have not survived. 

The Church Fathers distinguished the Ebionites from the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]], the [[Cerinthus|Cerinthians]], the [[Elcesaites]], the [[Nasoraean]]s, the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s, the [[Nazoraean]]s, and the [[Sampsaeans]], most of whom were early sects of Jewish disciples of Jesus who held traditional or [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|gnostic]] [[Christian views of Jesus|Christian views]] rejected by the Ebionites. [[Eusebius]], however, mentions that a minority of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name.<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea, ''History of the Church'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm III, 27]</ref>

==History==
Several established academics and fringe researchers, some of whom are engaged in the [[Quest for the historical Jesus#The Third Quest|third quest for the historical Jesus]], have sought to reconstruct the history of the Ebionites. They critically reexamine the few historical facts which exist, with an eye towards rewriting history with newly discovered information. Their assumption is that the history of [[Jewish Christian]] sects as it has been traditionally told by the [[Christian Church]] is neither fair nor accurate. However, their methodologies and conclusions are often at variance with mainstream scholarship.

Some argue that the first self-identified Ebionites were poor Jewish [[peasant]]s who began to follow [[John the Baptist]] as an alternative to what they perceived to be the culture of corruption surrounding the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. After the death of John, many of them joined the "[[kingdom of God]]" movement started by Jesus, who they believed was the prophetic [[Messiah]]. The movement organized itself into communities in several cities overseen from Jerusalem by Jesus' brother, [[James the Just]], after his death.<ref name="Tabor 2006"/> It was during this time that [[Paul of Tarsus]] joined the movement. This eventually led to a dispute with regard to the [[Brit milah|circumcision]] of [[gentile]] converts, which Paul maintained was unnecessary. The book of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] records the compromise that James allegedly brokered during the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ''c''. 49, which did not require that gentile converts circumcise.<ref>Acts of the Apostles 15</ref> However, in 58, Paul complains, in his [[second epistle to the Corinthians]], that some of the Jesus' [[Twelve Apostles|twelve apostles]] were questioning his honesty and continuing to counter his mission with their "[[Judaizers#Judaizing Teachers|judaizing teachings]]".<ref>Second Epistle to the Corinthians 11:4-5, 11:13-15, 12:11</ref> After the [[James the Just#Death|death of James]] in 62, [[Simeon of Jerusalem]], another of [[Desposyni|Jesus' relatives]], was chosen as the new leader. Although it is a matter of debate whether or not the movement fled across the [[Jordan River]] to [[Pella, Jordan]] before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 70, after the end of the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], the importance of the [[Jerusalem church]] began to fade and [[Jewish Christianity]] dispersed itself throughout the [[Jewish diaspora]] in [[Southwest Asia]]; it was slowly eclipsed by [[Pauline Christianity]], which had previously been struggling to survive against the disapproval of Jerusalem but now could spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] without impediment.<ref name="Brandon 1968">{{cite book| author = Brandon, S.

This defeat was due to marginalization and [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of Christians by Christians|persecution]] by both Jews and Christians.<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/>

[[Image:Hijaz.png|thumb|120px|left|Map showing the region of Hejaz outlined in red]]

==Legacy==

The legacy of the Ebionites is debated.  Some scholars argue that the primary influence of the Ebionites was on the [[nontrinitarian]] origins of [[Islam]] due to their exchanges with the first Muslims.{{citationneeded}} In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several small yet competing [[new religious movement]]s, such as the [[Ebionite Jewish Community]], have emerged claiming to be revivalists of the views and practices of early Ebionites,<ref name="Self Help Guide 2006">{{cite paper|author = Self Help Guide| title = Jesus Christ| date = 2006 | url = http://selfhelp-guide.com/heros4u/jesus_christ.htm| accessdate = 2006-02-21}}</ref> although their idiosyncratic claims to authenticity cannot be verified.  The [[counter-missionary]] group [[Jews for Judaism]] favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that "[[Messianic Judaism]]", as promoted by missionary groups such as [[Jews for Jesus]], is [[Pauline Christianity]] misrepresenting itself as Judaism.<ref name="Kravitz 2001">{{cite book| author = Kravitz, Bentzion| title = The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Counter-Missionary Handbook | publisher = [[Jews for Judaism]] International | year = 2001}}</ref>  Some Messianic groups have expressed concern over leaders in Israel that deny Jesus' divinity and the possible collapse of the Messianic movement due to a resurgence of Ebionitism.<ref name="Messianic Leaders Deny Yeshua">{{cite paper| author = Koniuchowsky, Moshe| title = "Messianic" Leaders Deny Yeshua in Record Numbers| date = 2007 | url = http://yourarmstoisrael.org/Editorials/?page=MESSIANIC_LEADERS_DENY&type=2| accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref><ref name="New Galations">{{cite paper|author = Prasch, James| title = You Foolish Galatians, Who Bewitched You?

==Views and practices==
===Judaism===
Most [[patristic]] sources portray the Ebionites as traditional yet [[asceticism|ascetic]] Jews, who zealously followed the [[Law of Moses]], revered [[Jerusalem]] as the holiest city,<ref name="Irenaeus"/> and restricted [[Kashrut#Maintenance of a separate culture|table fellowship]] only to gentiles who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].<ref name="Justin"/> They celebrated a commemorative meal annually, on or around [[Passover]], with [[unleavened bread]] and water only, in contrast to the Christian practice of performing a [[Eucharist|mystical meal]] in commemoration of Jesus through the daily use of bread containing leaven and wine mixed with water.<ref>{{cite paper| author = Exarch Aneed, Anthony J.| title = Syrian Christians, A Brief History of the Catholic Church of St. George in Milwaukee, Wis. And a Sketch of the Eastern Church| date = 1919| url = http://www.melkite.org/HolyCommunion.html| accessdate = 2007-04-28}}</ref><ref name="Irenaeus5">Irenaeus of Lyon, ''Against Heresies'' 
[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103501.htm V, 1].</ref><ref name="Epiphanius30"/>

===Jewish or Gnostic Christianity?===

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] is the only Church Father who describes some Ebionites as departing from traditional [[Jewish principles of faith]] and [[Orthopraxis|practice]]; specifically by engaging in excessive [[Mikvah|ritual bathing]],<ref>Epiphanius of Salamis, ''Panarion'', 19,28-30.</ref> possessing an [[angelology]] which claimed that the [[arianism|Christ is a great archangel]] who was incarnated in Jesus when he was [[adoptionism|adopted as the son of God]],<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 30.14.5, 30.16.4</ref> opposing [[Korban|animal sacrifice]]<ref name="Epiphanius30"/>, [[antinomianism|rejecting doctrines and traditions]] believed to have been added to the [[Law of Moses]], including scribal alterations of the texts of scripture<ref name="Epiphanius30"/>, and practicing [[Vegetarianism and religion#Judaism|religious vegetarianism]]<ref name="Epiphanius30"/>.

The reliability of Epiphanius' account of the Ebionites is questioned by some scholars.<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973"/><ref name=" Van Voorst 1989">{{cite book| author = Van Voorst, Robert E.| title = The Ascents of James: History and Theology of a Jewish-Christian Community| publisher = Society of Biblical Literature| year = 1989| id = ISBN 1555402941}}</ref> [[Shlomo Pines]], for example, argues that the [[heterodox]] views and practices he ascribes to some Ebionites originated in [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] rather than [[Jewish Christianity]], and are characteristics of the [[Elcesaites|Elcesaite]] sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites.<ref name="Pines 1966"/>

===Essenism===

Although many theories linking the [[Essenes]], [[Qumran]] and the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] to the [[early Christians]] have been discredited or remain controversial,<ref name="Jesus Seminar 1993">{{cite book| author = [[Jesus Seminar]] | title = The Five Gospels: The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus| publisher = Polebridge Press | year = 1993| id = ISBN 0-02-541949-8}}</ref> many biblical scholars accept some Essene influence on the nascent [[Jewish Christian]] church in some organizational, administrative and cultic respects.<ref name="Vermes 1992">{{cite paper| author = [[G<U+00E9>za Vermes]]| title = Brother James' Heirs? the community at Qumran and its relations to the first Christians| date = 1992 | url = http://priory-of-sion.com/psp/eisenman.html| accessdate = 2007-07-23}}</ref>

Regarding the Ebionites specifically, [[Robert Eisenman]], [[James Tabor]], [[Martin A. Larson]], and [[Keith Akers]] argue that they were a [[messianism|messianic]] Essene sect within Judaism. In this view, the Ebionites drew much of their original inspiration from [[Essene#Rules.2C customs.2C theology and beliefs|rules, customs, theology, beliefs]], and even their name from Essenes through the founding influence of [[John the Baptist]]. The fact that both the Qumran community and the early [[Jerusalem church]] under [[James the Just]] referred to themselves by many epithets, including "the poor"; the [[Vegetarianism and religion#Judaism|religious vegetarianism]] of the Qumran community (based on archaeology) and of John the Baptist (as portrayed in the Gospel of the Ebionites); and the [[Mikvah|ritual bathing]] of the Ebionites and of the Qumran community; are all cited as evidence for this view.<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/><ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989">{{cite book| author = [[Martin A.

===Jesus===
The majority of [[Church Fathers]] agree that the Ebionites rejected many of the central [[Christian views of Jesus]] such as the [[pre-existence]], [[divinity of Jesus|divinity]], [[virgin birth]], [[atonement|atoning]] [[death of Jesus|death]], and [[vision hypothesis|physical resurrection of Jesus]].<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973"/> The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the [[unitarianism|oneness of God]] and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of both [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who by virtue of his [[Tzadik|righteousness]], was [[Chosen people|chosen]] by God to be the [[messiah|messianic]] "[[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh .28Hebrew Bible.29|prophet]] like [[Moses]]" (foretold in ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:14-22) when he was [[Anointing|anointed]] with the [[Shekhinah|holy spirit]] at his baptism.<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/>
<ref name="Tabor 1998">

Of the books of the [[New Testament]], the Ebionites are said to have accepted only a Hebrew version of the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'', referred to as the ''[[Gospel of the Hebrews]]'', as additional [[scripture]] to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This version of ''Matthew'', [[Irenaeus]] reports, omitted the first two chapters (on the [[nativity of Jesus]]), and started with the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist|John]].<ref name="Irenaeus"/>

The Ebionites believed Jesus invited his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to live according to an [[Tikkun olam|ethic of social justice]] that would be standard in the future [[kingdom of God]]. Since Jesus [[revelation|revealed]] what the ethic of the [[Messianic Age]] would be, his disciples were to immediately adjust their lives to this ethic in this age.<ref name="Shand 2006">{{cite paper| author = Shand, Richard| title = The Ministry of Jesus| date = 2006 | url = http://www.mystae.com/restricted/reflections/messiah/ministry.html | accessdate = 2006-12-19}}</ref> The Ebionites, however, interpreted these teachings to mean that all Jews and gentiles must observe the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] in the Law of Moses,<ref name="Justin"/> in order to become [[Tzadik|righteous]] and seek [[Devekut|communion with God]];<ref>Hippolytus</ref> but that these commandments must be understood in the light of Jesus' [[expounding of the Law]],<ref name="Tabor 1998"/> revealed during his [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on the mount]].<ref name="Viljoen 2006">{{cite paper| author = Viljoen, Francois P.| title = Jesus' Teaching on the Torah in the Sermon on the Mount| date = 2006 | url = http://www.geocities.com/neotestamentica/archive/401/401gviljoen-sample.pdf | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> The Ebionites may have held a form of "[[inaugurated eschatology]]" positing that the [[ministry of Jesus]] had ushered in the Messianic Age so that the kingdom of God might be understood as present in an incipient fashion, while at the same time awaiting consummation in the [[world to come|future age]].<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/><ref name="Tabor 1998"/>

===John the Baptist===
In one excerpt from the ''[[Gospel of the Ebionites]]'' quoted by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], [[John the Baptist]] is portrayed as a [[Vegetarianism and religion|vegetarian]] [[Nazirite]] teacher and a prophetic forerunner to Jesus.<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/><ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989"/>

===James the Just===
Although he is not mentioned in [[patristic]] descriptions of the Ebionites, some scholars argue that the Ebionites may have claimed unique legitimacy in terms of [[apostolic succession]] from [[James the Just]], the first [[patriarch of Jerusalem|bishop of Jerusalem]], whom they believed the rightful leader of the Church due to a [[agnatic seniority|patrilineal succession]] of [[Desposyni|relatives of Jesus]]. Futhermore, they argue that Ebionites viewed James as the legitimate [[Kohen Gadol|high priest of Israel]], by virtue of his [[Tzadik|righteousness]], in opposition to the officially recognized high priest.<ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989"/>

===Paul of Tarsus===
Patristic sources report Ebionites as denouncing [[Paul of Tarsus]] as an [[apostasy|apostate]] from the Law<ref name="Irenaeus"/>. Epiphanius relates that some Ebionites alleged that Paul was a Greek who converted to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of a [[Kohen Gadol|high priest of Israel]] but apostasized when she rejected him.<ref>Epiphanius of Salamis, ''Panarion'', 16, 9.</ref> [[Hyam Maccoby]] argued that Paul was an apostate and developed the early Christian church as a [[Gnosticism and the New Testament#The Pauline Epistles|Gnostic Jewish mystery religion]].<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/>

==Writings==
Few writings of the Ebionites have survived, and these are in uncertain form. The [[Clementine literature|''Recognitions of Clement'' and the ''Clementine Homilies'']], two [[3rd century]] Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely [[Jewish Christians|Jewish Christian]] in origin and reflect Jewish Christian beliefs. The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but Epiphanius's description of some Ebionites bears striking similarity to the ideas in the ''Recognitions'' and ''Homilies''. Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the ''Homilies'' as a source document.<ref name="Koch 1976"/>

The 1908 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] mentions four classes of Ebionite writings:<ref name="Arendzen 1909">{{cite encyclopedia| title =[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05242c.htm Ebionites]| encyclopedia = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]| volume = V| pages| publisher =  Robert Appleton Company| date = 1909|    accessdate = 2007-03-13}}</ref>
* ''[[Gospel of the Ebionites]]''. According to [[Irenaeus]], the Ebionites used only the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]''. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (''Historia Ecclesiae'' IV, xxi, 8) mentions a ''[[Gospel of the Hebrews]]'', often identified as the Aramaic original of Matthew, written with Hebrew letters. Such a work was known to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] (according to Eusebius, ''Historia Eccl''., ), [[Origen]] (according to [[Jerome's De Viris Illustribus|Jerome's De viris illustribus ii]], and to [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Strom.'', II, ix, 45). [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] attributes this gospel to [[Nazarenes]], and claims that Ebionites only possessed an incomplete, falsified, and truncated copy. (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', xxix, 9). The question remains whether or not Epiphanius was able to make a genuine distinction between Nazarenes and Ebionites.
* [[New Testament apocrypha]]: The ''Circuits of Peter'' and ''Acts of the Apostles'', including the work usually titled the ''Ascents of James''. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement's ''Compendium of Peter's itinerary sermons'', and also in the ''Recognitions'' attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, i.e. the primacy of [[James the Just]], their connection with the [[Holy See|episcopal see of Rome]], and their antagonism to [[Simon Magus]], as well as [[gnosticism|gnostic]] doctrines. Scholar Robert Van Voorst opines of the ''Ascents of James'' (R 1.33-71), "There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain".<ref name=" Van Voorst 1989"/> Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin. 
* The Works of [[Symmachus the Ebionite]], i.e. his [[Koine Greek]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], used by Jerome, fragments of which exist, and his lost ''[[Hypomnemata]]'', written to counter the canonical Gospel of Matthew. The latter work, which is totally lost (Eusebius, ''Hist. Eccl.'', VI, xvii; Jerome, ''De vir.'' ill., liv), is probably identical with ''De distinctione pr<U+00E6>ceptorum'', mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, ''Bibl. Or.'', III, 1).
* The ''Book of Elchesai'' (Elxai), or of "The Hidden power", claimed to have been written about 100 AD and brought to Rome in c. 217 AD by Alcibiades of Apamea. Ebionites who accepted its gnostic doctrines were judged to be [[apostate]]s and called [[Elcesaites]]. (Hipp., ''Philos.'', IX, xiv-xvii; Epiphanius., ''Adv. Haer.'', xix, 1; liii, 1.)

It is also speculated that the core of the ''[[Gospel of Barnabas]]'', beneath a polemical medieval [[Islam|Muslim]] overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document.<ref name="Toland 1718">[[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]], ''Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile and Mahometan Christianity'', 1718.</ref> The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars.<ref name=" Blackhirst 2000">{{cite paper| author = Blackhirst, R.| title = Barnabas and the Gospels: Was There an Early Gospel of Barnabas?, J.

==Archaeology==
In his 2004 book ''Buried Angels'', biblical scholar Jacob Rabinowitz suggests that artifacts discovered by Franciscan [[biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologists]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]] and [[Nazareth]] may have belonged to the first Ebionites. The artifacts, which include [[ossuary|ossuaries]], figurines and ritual objects, incorporate [[Christian cross|the cross]] as a decorative motif combined with other biblical symbols. The Franciscans believe they are the work of a late 3rd or 4th century heretical judaizing sect. <ref name=" Rabinowitz 2004">{{cite book| author = Rabinowitz, Jacob | title = [http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Angels.pdf Buried Angels]| publisher = Invisible Books | year = 2004}}</ref>
