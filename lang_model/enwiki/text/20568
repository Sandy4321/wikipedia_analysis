"'''Glassheart'''" is a song recorded by British [[singer-songwriter]] [[Leona Lewis]] for her third studio album of [[Glassheart|the same name]] (2012). The song was conceptualised by Lewis and frequent collaborator [[Ryan Tedder]] at his family home in [[Denver, Colorado]]. As she was experiencing a stressful time in her life, Lewis wanted to create an uptempo dance track with Tedder as she felt a ballad would make her more upset. It was co-written by Lewis and Tedder alongside [[Brent Kutzle]], Noel Zancanella, Justin Franks, Fis Shkreli and [[Peter Svensson]]. Production of the song was handled by Tedder and Franks, with the latter credited under his production alias [[DJ Frank E]]. It was co-produced by Zancanella, Kutzle and Shkreli. 

"Glassheart" is an up-tempo [[Dance music|dance]] song that incorporates elements of [[dubstep]], [[Grime music|grime]] and [[house music]]. Lyrically, it is about a woman's fear that her boyfriend will leave her and thus she protects her emotions and her heart from breaking. The song received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised the musical direction and its grimy, dubstep breakdown. Upon the release of ''Glassheart'', the song debuted at number 27 on the [[UK Dance Chart]] due to strong [[Music download|digital download]] sales. Lewis has performed the song at London nightclub [[G-A-Y]] and for UK newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s Biz Sessions.

== Inspiration and development ==
According to Lewis, the song was conceptualised when the singer was experiencing a stressful time in her personal life when she visited her friend and co-writer of the song, [[Ryan Tedder]] in [[Denver, Colorado]].<ref name="Concept Behind Glassheart song">{{cite web|last=Love|first=Ryan|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/interviews/a338818/leona-lewis-interview-i-want-to-give-people-the-best-of-me.html |title=Leona Lewis interview: 'I want to give people the best of me' <U+2013> Music Interview |publisher=Digital Spy (Hearst Magazines UK)|date=6 September 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref> The aim of the trip was to visit Tedder and his family, as well as conceive ideas and themes for material to be included on ''Glassheart''.<ref name="Concept Behind Glassheart song"/> Lewis stated that she did not want to sing a ballad which would made her "more sad", therefore they decided to work on an upbeat dance song instead.<ref name="Concept Behind Glassheart song"/> She asked Tedder: "Can you give me a song where I can just dance and jump around?", to which he replied "What about this?" as he played a beat which Lewis found "hypnotic."<ref name="Concept Behind Glassheart song"/> Despite being in a raw form, Lewis was impressed with the song's beat, and said "Yes!
