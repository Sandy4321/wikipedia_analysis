:''Main article: [[Jarlabanke Runestones]]''
The '''Hargs bro runic inscriptions''', or '''U 309''', '''U 310''' and '''U 311''', are 11th century [[Younger Futhark]] inscriptions in [[Old Norse]] on bedrock in Sk<U+00E5>nela Parish, [[Uppland]], [[Sweden]]. 

[[#U 309|U 309]] and [[#U 310|U 310]] constitute a twin monument in the [[style Pr4]] and they are thus dated to the period 1060-1100. They belong to a group of c. 20 [[runestone]]s called the [[Jarlabanke Runestones]] that are connected to the local strongman Jarlabanke and his [[Norse clans|clan]]. Together with the [[Broby bro Runestones]] and the [[Uppland Rune Inscriptions 101, 143 and 147]] these particular runestones, however, treat the female matriarch of the clan called [[Estrid]].

U 310 tells that Estrid had a husband named Ingvar, and he had a son prior to marrying Estrid, named [[Ragnvald Ingvarsson|Ragnvald]] who died. Estrid constructed a bridge, apparently a tradition in her family.

U 309 mentions Sigvid, Ingvar and Jarlabanke in a way that suggests that they are Estrid's sons. This Jarlabanke is not the same one as the Jarlabanke who raised the runestones in [[T<U+00E4>by]], because he was the son of an Ingefast and a Jorun. 

These runestones show a peculiarity to this family: the sons often have the same name as their fathers.

Estrid is the same person as the Estrid who is mentioned on a number of runestones in [[T<U+00E4>by]] and other locations (the [[Broby bro Runestones]] and [[Uppland Rune Inscriptions 101, 143 and 147]]). This Estrid was the maternal ancestor of a great clan called the Jarlabanke clan, and she was the maternal grandmother of the powerful Jarlabanke who claimed to own all of T<U+00E4>by. 

The carver of the [[Snottsta and Vreta stones|Snottsta runestone]] called [[Snottsta and Vreta stones#U 329|U 329]], where an Estrid and her brother Ragnfast are mentioned, is believed to be the [[runemaster]] named [[Fot]] who also made the runestones for the Jarlabanke clan. This strongly suggests that Estrid was born in Snottsta (also spelled Sn<U+00E5>ttsta), married <U+00D6>sten of T<U+00E4>by and married for the second time in Harg near Snottsta.
 
==U 309==
[[Image:U 309, Hargs bro.JPG|thumb|130px|right|Like the other inscriptions at the location, U 309 was painted too long ago for any colour to remain.]]
This runic inscription is in the [[style Pr4]] (second half of the 11th century) and it was made by Jarlabanke Ingvarsson and his brothers Sigvi<U+00F0>r and Ingvarr in memory of their father Ingvarr and their brother [[Ragnvald Ingvarsson|Ragnvaldr]].

===Translation in English===
:Sigvi<U+00F0>r and Ingvarr and Jarlabanki had the runes carved in memory of Ingvarr, their father, and in memory of Ragnvaldr, their brother.

==U 310==
[[Image:U 310, Hargs bro.JPG|thumb|250px|right|U 310.]]
Like the previous runic inscription, this inscription is in the [[style Pr4]] (second half of the 11th century) and it was made in memory of Ingvarr and [[Ragnvald Ingvarsson|Ragnvaldr]]. However, this one was made on the orders of Estrid (<U+00C1>str<U+00ED><U+00F0>r), Ingvar's wife who was not Ragnvald's mother.

===Translation in English===
:<U+00C1>str<U+00ED><U+00F0>r had the bridge made in memory of Ingvarr, her husbandman, and in memory of Ragnvaldr, his son.

==U 311==
[[Image:U 311, Hargs bro.JPG|thumb|150px|right|U 311.]]
This inscription was made later, and it is in the [[style Pr5]] which dates it to the late 11th century or the early 12th century. It is not known how the people mentioned in it are related to those mentioned in the previous two inscriptions.
===Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters=== 
:'''inkri<U+00FE> ' lit ' kiara ' bro ' ifti<small>R</small> * inkikiari ' totur ' sin inkihualtr ' inkimar ' karl ' litu ' at ' systur s'i[n]'''

===Translation in English===
:Ingr<U+00ED><U+00F0>r had the bridge made in memory of Ingiger<U+00F0>r, her daughter. Ingivaldr (and) Ingimarr (and) Karl had (it made) in memory of their sister.
