'''Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation''' ({{SSE|600019}}) ({{zh-cp|c=<U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+5B9D><U+94A2><U+96C6><U+56E2><U+516C><U+53F8>|p=Sh<U+00E0>ngh<U+01CE>i B<U+01CE>og<U+0101>ng J<U+00ED>tu<U+00E1>n G<U+014D>ngs<U+012B>}}), commonly referred to as '''Baosteel''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5B9D><U+94A2>|p=B<U+01CE>og<U+0101>ng}}) is the largest [[China|Chinese]] [[iron]] and [[steel]] conglomerate. It is a [[state-owned enterprise]], headquartered in [[Shanghai]]. 

Baosteel is the sixth-largest steel producer in the world, ranked by sales (see [[list of steel producers]]). It employs 112,000 employees, revenues of $21.5 billion and a mix of high-quality products.<ref>Sirkin, Harold L.; James W. Hemerling; and Arindam K. Bhattacharya (2008-06-11). [http://www.bcg.com/globality ''GLOBALITY: Competing with Everyone from Everywhere for Everything.''] New York: Business Plus, 304. ISBN 0446178292.</ref> Baosteel is the largest steel producer in China, with a crude steel production capacity of about 20 million tons. China's total steel production for 2006 was 381.5 million tons.

Baosteel's IPO on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] in 2000 was the largest in China up to that time, raising CNY 7.7 billion despite being limited to domestic investors only.

==History==
In the 1979s, the Chinese government began to institute economic reforms. Plans called for a large integrated steel production facility to be located near the port of [[Shanghai]]. The [[Baoshan District]], a suburb of Shanghai, was chosen as the site and Japanese assistance was enlisted in constructing one of the most modern steel plants of the time. As the government's flagship steel company, '''Baoshan Iron and Steel''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5B9D><U+5C71><U+94A2><U+94C1><U+FF08><U+96C6><U+56E2><U+FF09><U+516C><U+53F8>|p=B<U+01CE>osh<U+0101>n G<U+0101>ngti<U+011B> (J<U+00ED>tu<U+00E1>n) G<U+014D>ngs<U+012B>}}) as it was originally called, benefitted from acquiring the best engineers and managers, access to cutting edge technology, and receiving hefty government contracts.

Baoshan Iron and Steel also benefitted from the breakneck pace of Chinese economic expansion which ravenously consumed all the steel available. However, with the continuing liberalization of the Chinese economy, Baoshan found itself in competition with new rivals, both foreign and domestic. The company decided to add an export trade marketing component to remain competitive; it scored notable success in [[South Korea]]. Although hurt by the [[Asian financial crisis]], Baoshan pushed through with a merger of other money losing state owned enterprises, though it had managed to remain profitable itself. On [[November 17]], [[1998]], the former '''Baoshan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation''' absorbed the '''Shanghai Metallurgical Holding Group Corporation''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+51B6><U+91D1><U+63A7><U+80A1><U+FF08><U+96C6><U+56E2><U+FF09><U+516C><U+53F8>|p=Sh<U+00E0>ngh<U+01CE>i Y<U+011B>j<U+012B>n K<U+00F2>ngg<U+01D4> (J<U+00ED>tu<U+00E1>n) G<U+014D>ngs<U+012B>}}) and the '''Shanghai Meishan Group Co.''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+6885><U+5C71><U+FF08><U+96C6><U+56E2><U+FF09><U+516C><U+53F8>|p=Sh<U+00E0>ngh<U+01CE>i M<U+00E9>ish<U+0101>n (J<U+00ED>tu<U+00E1>n) G<U+014D>ngs<U+012B>}}) to form '''Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation'''. The new conglomerate was the largest steel producer in the country with annual steel production of nearly 20 million tons.

Baosteel also found partnerships with former domestic rivals in the '''Shougang Group''' and '''Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Corporation''', entering into an alliance in 2001. In the same year Baosteel signed an agreement with [[ThyssenKrupp]] of [[Germany]].

The company has ambitious plans for expansion, currently constructing a state-of-the-art facility in [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]], at the cost of $10 billion; it is expected to come into production by the end of the decade. Baosteel also intends on launching an [[IPO]], likely in [[Hong Kong]], on top of its current listing on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]].
