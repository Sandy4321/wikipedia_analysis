'''HMS ''Indomitable'' ''' was an {{sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser}} of the British [[Royal Navy]]. She was built before [[World War I]] and had an active career during the war. She tried to hunt down the German ships ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' in the Mediterranean when war broke out and bombarded Turkish fortifications protecting the [[Dardanelles]] even before the British declared war on Turkey. She helped to sink the German armored cruiser ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' during the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and towed the damaged British battlecruiser ''Lion'' to safety after the battle. She damaged the German battlecruisers ''Seydlitz'' and ''Derfflinger'' during the Battle of Jutland and watched her sister ''Invincible'' explode. She was deemed obsolete after the war and was sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design==
===General characteristics===
The ''Invincible'' class ships were formally known as armored cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911. Unofficially a number of designations were used until then, including cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser and battle-cruiser.<ref>Roberts, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>

''Indomitable'' was significantly larger than her armored cruiser predecessors of the {{sclass|Minotaur|cruiser (1906)|4}}. She had an [[length overall|overall]] length of {{convert|567|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|78|ft|7.75|in|m|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|30|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|17250|LT|MT}} at load and {{convert|20420|LT|MT}} at deep load, nearly {{convert|3000|LT|MT|-2}} more than the earlier ships.<ref>Roberts, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Indomitable'' had two Parsons turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room and drove two shafts. The wing shaft was coupled to the high-pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. A cruising turbine was also coupled to the inner shaft, although these were not used often and were eventually disconnected. Her three-bladed propellers were {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m}} in diameter on the inner shafts while the outer propellers were {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by thirty-one [[Babcock and Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s in four boiler rooms.<ref>Roberts, pp. 70<U+2013>75</ref> The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|41000|ihp}}, but reached nearly {{convert|48000|ihp|lk=in|abbr=on}} during trials in 1908. She was designed for {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}}, but reached {{convert|26.1|kn|km/h|0}} during trials.<ref>Roberts, pp. 76, 80</ref> She maintained an average speed of {{convert|25.3|kn|km/h|0}} for three days during a passage of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] in August 1908.<ref>Roberts, p. 75</ref>

''Indomitable'' carried {{convert|3083|LT|MT}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|713|LT|MT}} of [[fuel oil]] that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate.<ref>Roberts, p. 76</ref> At full fuel capacity, she could steam for {{convert|3090|nmi|km}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=c24>Gardiner and Gray, p. 24</ref>

===Armament===
''Indomitable'' mounted eight [[BL 12 inch Mk X naval gun|BL {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=4}} Mk X guns]] in four twin hydraulically powered [[turret]]s. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen [[QF 4 inch naval gun Mk I - III|{{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} QF Mk III guns]]. During 1915 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in [[casemate]]s and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.<ref>Roberts, pp. 96<U+2013>97</ref> The QF Mk III guns were replaced by twelve [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|4-inch BL MK VII]] guns on PVI mountings during 1917.<ref name=r3>Roberts, p. 83</ref>

Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of a single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] AA gun on a high-angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915. A 3-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun]] on a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60<U+00B0> was also mounted in November 1914 and used until August 1917. A 4-inch BL MK VII on a HA MkII mount was added in April 1917. Five [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (450-mm)]] submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were fitted on the ''Invincible''s, two on each side and one in the stern<ref name=c24/>. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.<ref name=r3/>

===Armor===
The armour protection given to the ''Invincible''s was heavier than that of the ''Minotaur''s<U+2014>their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] measured {{convert|6|in|mm|0}} amidships in contrast to the {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} belt of their predecessors. The belt was 6 inches thick roughly between the fore and aft 12-inch gun turrets, but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow, but did not extend aft of the rear turret. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by {{convert|7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of armour, except for the turret roofs which used {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The thickness of the main [[Deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|1|-|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and the lower deck armour was {{convert|1.5|-|2.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Carbon steel#Mild and low carbon steel|Mild steel]] [[torpedo bulkhead]]s of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and shell rooms.<ref>Roberts, pp. 109, 112</ref>

After the [[Battle of Jutland]] revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire, additional armor was added in the area of the magazines and to the turret roofs. The exact thickness is not known, but it was unlikely to be thick as the total amount was less than {{convert|100|LT|0}}.<ref>Burt, p. 48</ref>

== Construction ==
She was built by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. Ltd]], at [[Govan]]. She was laid down on 1 March 1906 and launched on 26 June 1907.<ref>Roberts, p. 41</ref> She was commissioned on 20 June 1908 before she was fully complete to carry the [[Prince of Wales]] to Canada.<ref name=c25/> 

== Early career ==
Immediately after commissioning, ''Indomitable'' embarked the Prince of Wales (soon to be [[King George V]]) for the [[Royal tours of Canada (18th-20th centuries)|City of Quebec Tercentenary]] celebration. She returned on 10 August and was immediately returned to her builders for final completion. She was assigned to the Nore Division of the [[Home Fleet]] on 28 October and assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS) in March 1909. She became the flagship of Rear-Admiral S. Colville, commanding the 1st CS, on 26 July. She was refitted several times between 1910 and 1913 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean on 27 August 1913 to form the [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] (BCS) with her sister ship ''Invincible''. She was slightly damaged in a collision in [[Stokes Bay]] with the minelayer ''C4'' on 17 March 1913. She was refitting in [[Malta]] in July 1914 when the deepening [[July Crisis|crisis]] forced her to cut short her refit.<ref>Burt, p. 57</ref>

==World War I==
===Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau===
{{main|Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau}}
''Indomitable'', accompanied by {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}}, under the command of [[Admiral]] [[Archibald Berkeley Milne|Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne]] encountered the German battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||2}} and the light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||2}} on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of [[Philippeville, Algeria|Philippeville]], but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to [[Messina]] to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the [[Strait of Messina]] where they could observe the port directly. Therefore Milne stationed ''Inflexible'' and ''Indefatigable'' at the northern exit of the Strait of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports, the light cruiser {{HMS|Gloucester|1909|2}} at the southern exit and sent ''Indomitable'' to recoal at [[Bizerte]] where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.<ref>Massie, p. 39</ref>

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards [[Constantinople]], trailed by ''Gloucester''. Milne, still expecting [[Rear Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Souchon]] to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail for [[Cape Matapan]] at a leisurely {{convert|12|kn|km/h|0}}, where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier. At 2:30 p.m. he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria &mdash; war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt, rather than seek ''Goeben''. Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to "chase ''Goeben'' which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east." Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], unaware that the ''Goeben'' did not intend to come out.<ref>Massie, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> ''Indomitable'' remained in the Mediterranean to blockade the [[Dardanelles]], but ''Inflexible'' was ordered home on 18 August.<ref name=c25>Gardiner and Gray, p. 25</ref>

On 3 November 1914, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by ''Indomitable'' and ''Indefatigable'', as well as the French [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s [[French battleship Suffren|''Suffren'']] and [[French battleship V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9> (1907)|''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'']].<ref name=m50>Massie, p. 50</ref> The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at [[Sedd el Bahr]] at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field.<ref>Carlyon p. 47</ref> This attack actually took place before a formal [[declaration of war]] had been made by Britain against the [[Ottoman Empire]] which didn't happen until the 5th.<ref name=m50/> ''Indomitable'' was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd BCS.<ref name=r22>Roberts, p. 122</ref>

===Battle of Dogger Bank===
{{main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}
On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] sortied to clear the [[Dogger Bank]] of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty, which included ''Indomitable''. Contact was initiated at 7:20 AM on the 24th when the British light cruiser [[HMS Arethusa (1913)|''Arethusa'']] spotted the German light cruiser {{SMS|Kolberg}}. By 7:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}}, believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increased speed to {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}}'s maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}} if they were British battlecruisers.<ref>Massie, pp. 376<U+2013>384</ref>

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. ''Indomitable'' managed to exceed {{convert|26|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}} and Beatty recognized her performance with a signal at 8:55 "Well done, ''Indomitable''"<ref>Massie, p. 385</ref> Despite this achievement ''Indomitable'' was the slowest of Beatty's ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers. By 10:48 ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers and her speed had dropped to {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}} and her steering gear had been jammed; Beatty ordered ''Indomitable'' to attack her. But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty's flag lieutenant in signaling and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal [[halyard]]s so that Beatty couldn't communicate with his ships caused the rest of the battlecruisers to turn away from Hipper's main body and engage ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''.<ref>Massie, pp. 385<U+2013>406</ref> ''Indomitable'' fired 134 shells at ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' before she capsized and sank at 12:07 PM.<ref name=c25/> After the end of the battle ''Indomitable'' was ordered to tow ''Lion'' back to port as one of her engines had been knocked out, the other was failing and she'd been hulled a number of times beneath the waterline. It took over a day and a half at speeds of {{convert|7|-|10|kn|km/h}}.<ref>Massie, p. 410<U+2013>412</ref>

She was transferred to the [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] (BCS) in February 1915 although she was being repaired after an electrical fire at the time.<ref name=r22/> [[Rear Admiral H.L.A. Hood]] took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915.<ref>Tarrant, p. 84</ref> The 1st and 3rd BCS sortied in response to the German [[bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]] on 24<U+2013>25 April 1916, but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref>

===Battle of Jutland===
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
At the end of May 1916, the 3rd BCS was temporarily assigned to the [[Grand Fleet]] for gunnery practice. On 30 May, the entire Grand Fleet, along with Admiral Beatty's battlecruisers, was ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German [[High Seas Fleet]]. In order to support Beatty, Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet. At about 2:30 PM ''Invincible'' intercepted a radio message from the British light cruiser {{HMS|Galatea|1914|2}}, attached to Beatty's Battlecruiser Force, reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers. This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north. Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the [[Skagerrak]] and ordered an increase in speed to {{convert|22|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} at 3:11 and steered East-Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships. Twenty minutes later ''Invincible'' intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south-easterly course. At 4:06 Hood ordered full speed and a course of south-southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty. At 4:56, with no British ships in sight, Hood requested Beatty's course, position and speed, but never received a reply.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref>

Hood continued on course until 5:40 when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser {{HMS|Chester|1915|2}} had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. ''Chester'' encountered four light cruisers of Hipper's 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away from ''Chester''. At 5:53 ''Invincible'' opened fire on {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} and the other two ''Invincible''s followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedos at 6:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. As they turned ''Invincible'' hit ''Wiesbaden'' in the engine room and knocked out her engines while ''Inflexible'' hit {{SMS|Pillau||2}} once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser {{SMS|Regensburg||2}} and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood's remaining light cruiser {{HMS|Canterbury|1915|2}} and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer {{HMS|Shark|1912|2}} with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty's ships, the ''Invincible''s were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but ''Invincible'' turned north, while ''Inflexible'' and ''Indomitable'' turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed, although one passed underneath ''Inflexible'' without detonating. As ''Invincible'' turned north, her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 103<U+2013>05</ref>

At 6:21, with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him, Hood turned south to lead Beatty's battlecruisers. Hipper's battlecruisers were {{convert|9000|yd|km}} away and the ''Invincible''s almost immediately opened fire on Hipper's flagship {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}} and {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}}. ''Indomitable'' hit ''Derfflinger'' three times and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} once,<ref>Campbell, pp. 185<U+2013>87</ref> while the ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' quickly took 10 hits from {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}}, ''Inflexible'' and ''Invincible'', including two hits below the waterline forward by ''Invincible'' that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship.<ref>Campbell, p. 183</ref> But at 6:30 ''Invincible'' abruptly appeared as a clear target before ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and ''Derfflinger''. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at ''Invincible'', and sank her in 90 seconds. A 305&nbsp;mm (12-inch) shell from the third salvo struck the roof of ''Invincible''{{'}}s midships 'Q' turret, flash detonated the magazines below, and the ship blew up and broke in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood.<ref>Campbell, p. 159</ref>

''Inflexible'' and ''Indomitable'' remained in company with Beatty for the rest of the battle. They encountered Hipper's battlecruisers only {{convert|10000|yd|km}} away as the sun was setting about 8:19 and opened fire. ''Seydlitz'' was hit five times before the German battlecruisers were rescued by the appearance of the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of Rear Admiral Mauve and the British shifted fire to the new threat. Three of the predreadnoughts were hit before they too were able to turn into the gloom.<ref>Campbell, pp. 252<U+2013>54, 272</ref>
[[Image:Indomitable.jpg|left|thumb|''Indomitable'' in 1918. Note the aircraft carried on the midships turrets.]]

The loss of three battlecruisers at Jutland (the others were {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}} and {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}) led to the force being reorganised into two squadrons, with ''Inflexible'' and ''Indomitable'' in the 2nd BCS. However, after Jutland there was little significant naval activity for the ''Invincible''s, other than routine patrolling, thanks to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm II|Kaiser's]] order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory. She was refitted in August 1916, where she received additional armor over her magazine and turret roofs.<ref>Burt, p. 58</ref> ''Indomitable'' was fitted with two flying off ramps fitted above her midships turrets in early 1918.<ref name=r22/>

The end of the war saw the end for many of the older vessels, not least the two remaining ''Invincible'' class ships. Both were sent to the Reserve Fleet in 1919, and were [[paid off]] in March 1920, before being sold for scrap on 1 December 1921.<ref name=r22/>
