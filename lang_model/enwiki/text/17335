'''Roborovski hamsters''' (''Phodopus roborovskii''; formerly ''Cricetulus bedfordiae'') also known as '''desert hamsters''' or '''Robos'''  are the smallest of three species of hamster in the [[genus]] ''[[Phodopus]]'', averaging under 2&nbsp;cm (1 inch) at birth and between 4.5<U+2013>5&nbsp;cm (2 inches) and 20-25 g (1&nbsp;oz) during adulthood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carol|first=Heather|title=Roborovski Hamster|url=http://www.southernhamsterclub.co.uk/new/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=45&Itemid=56|publisher=Southern Hamster Club|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are eyebrow-like white spots and the lack of any dorsal stripe (found on the other members of the ''Phodopus'' genus). The average lifespan for the Roborovski hamster is three years, though this is dependent on living conditions (extremes being four years in captivity and two in the wild).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Roborovskis are known for their speed and have been said to run an equivalent of four human marathons each night on average.<ref>{{cite video|people=Maxwell, Gavin (Director), Hill, Bernard (Narrator)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884762/|title=Wild China|medium=Television production|publisher=BBC Natural History|location=UK|year=2008}}</ref> It is one of three species in the [[genus]] ''Phodopus''.

==Habitat and diet==
[[File:Phodopus roborovskii distribution.jpg|thumb|left|Distribution of ''Phodopus roborovskii'']]
Roborovski hamsters are found in desert regions, such as the basin of the [[lake Zaysan]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and regions of [[Tuva]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Xinjiang]] in [[China]].<ref name="Ma et al.">{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Y|author2=Wang F |author3=Jin S |author4=Li S. |title=Glires (rodents and lagomorphs) of northern Xinjiang and their zoogeographical distribution|year=1987|pages=274|accessdate=25 January 2014|publisher=Science Press of Academia Sinica|language=Chinese}}</ref> The hamsters inhabit areas of loose sand and sparse vegetation and are rarely found in areas of dense vegetation and solid clay substrates.<ref name=Flint /> They live at elevations of around {{convert|1200|m}}&ndash;{{convert|1450|m}} and although research has been carried out, no fossil record exists for this species.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Oldfield|first=Thomas|title=The Duke of Bedford's Zoological Exploration in Eastern Asia. - XI.

They dig and live in burrows with steep tunnels as deep as six feet underground. In the wild, Roborovski hamsters are [[crepuscular]], being most active at dawn and dusk.

The Roborovski hamster has been found to be more common in the southern area of its distribution range, in areas such as [[Yulin, Shaanxi]], China. It has been reported as a common sighting by locals in this city and in the sand dunes of the [[Ordos desert]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sowerby|first1=Arthur de Clare|title=Fur and feather in North China|date=1914|publisher=Tientsin Press|location=University of California Libraries|page=68|url=https://archive.org/details/furfeatherinnort00sowerich|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>

They are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]; they primarily eat grains, vegetables, fruit, and plants, but they will also eat meat and insects in small quantities. Roborovski hamsters remain underground in winter and survive in that season by stockpiling some food in warmer weather and storing it in special food chambers within their burrow system.

==History of human contact==
Lt. Vsevolod Roborovski [Russian expeditioner] first made note of these hamsters, discovering them on an expedition in July 1894, though they were not studied scientifically for the best part of another decade, until Konstantin A. Satunin made observations in 1903.<ref>DwarfHamsters- Judith Lissenberg p.22-23</ref> The [[London Zoo]] imported them into the UK in the 1960s, but the first Roborovski hamsters studied in Britain were imported in the 1970s from [[Moscow Zoo]]. (None of them, however, bore offspring.)<ref>Konijnen en Knaagdieren Encyclopedie - Esther Verhoeff-Verhallen p.130-131</ref><ref name="Petwebsite.com">[http://www.petwebsite.com/hamsters/roborovski_hamsters.htm Petwebsite.com]</ref> Continental European countries had more success in breeding some Roborovskis, however, and those currently in the UK are descendants of a batch imported from the Netherlands in 1990. They were imported to the USA in 1998,<ref name="roborovski.net"/> though they are now commonly found in pet shops in several countries. In South Korea, they are almost as common as the winter-white [[Russian dwarf hamster]].

==Variation==
The Roborovski hamster is distinguished from the [[Djungarian hamster]] (''Phodopus sungorus'') and [[Campbell's dwarf hamster]] (''Phodopus campbelli'') due to its smaller size, sandy coloration of fur and its lack of a [[dorsal stripe]].<ref name="Argyropulo">{{cite journal|last1=Argyropulo|first1=A.I|title=Die Gattungen und Arten der Hamster (Cricetinae Murray, 1866) der Pal<U+00E4>arctic.|journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r S<U+00E4>ugetierkunde|date=1933|volume=20|pages=129-149|accessdate=28 February 2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Vorontsov 1960">{{cite journal|last1=Vorontsov|first1=N.N|title=Species of Palaearctic hamsters (Cricetinae, Rodentia) in statu nascendi|journal=Doklady Biological Sciences Sections|date=1960|volume=132|pages=491-493|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> When observed from behind, the [[neurocranium]] is rounded and does not appear to be as rectangular as ''Phodopus campbelli'' and ''Phodopus sungorus''. The [[Cusp (anatomy)|cusp]]s of the lower [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s are directly opposite and not alternate, as seen in other members of the genus, and the [[incisive foramen]] of the Roborovski hamster is greater than {{convert|4|mm}} in length and is shorter than the length of the upper tooth row, which is uncharacteristic of the other two members of the genus.<ref name="Argyropulo" />

Currently,  10 variations of Roborovski hamsters are confirmed.<ref name="oakfarmrabbitsandrodents.co.uk">[http://www.oakfarmrabbitsandrodents.co.uk/robo/breeding.html#colours Oak Farm Roborovskis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="madabouthamsters.com">[http://www.madabouthamsters.com/showthread.php/16239-My-New-Robos-Head-Spot-and-Pure-White My New Robos - 'Head Spot' and 'Pure White'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*agouti &mdash; a natural grayish-brown with white underside and "eyebrows" (white over eyes)
*"white face" &mdash; a dominant mutation producing an agouti-coloured hamster with a white face
*"husky" &mdash; a recessive mutation producing a white-faced hamster with a paler, more orangey coat than the agouti colour
*"mottled" or "pied" &mdash; both dominant and recessive mutations have been identified, these hamsters have the agouti colouring with irregular patches of white over their heads, bodies and sometimes their faces
*"platinum" &mdash; a combination of the dominant white face gene and the husky gene that produces a hamster that looks similar to a white-faced when young, but fades with age to nearly white
*"head spot" &mdash; a combination of the dominant and recessive pied genes that creates a pure white animal with one patch of colour on the head
*"white-from-white-faced" or "dark-eared white" &mdash; a combination of the dominant white-faced gene and the husky gene that produces a white hamster that retains a greyish undercoat and ears
*"white-from-pied" or "pure white" &mdash; a combination of the two pied genes that produces a pure white  hamster
*"red-eyed" &mdash; a recessive mutation that produces a caramel-coloured  hamster with a chocolate undercoat, dark brown (red) eyes, and pale ears

Breeding in captivity has also produced a darker dilution of the naturally sandy-coloured agouti fur.

==Breeding==
The gender of a Roborovski is determined visually; female openings are very close together and may even look like a single opening, while male openings are further apart. Males usually have a visible scent gland near the navel above the two openings, appearing as a yellow stain.

The breeding season for the Roborovski hamster is between April and September. The gestation period is between 20 and 22 days, producing three to four litters. The litter size is between three and nine, with an average of six.<ref name=Flint>{{cite book|last1=Flint|first1=Vladimir|title=Die Zwerghamster der pal<U+00E4>arktischen Fauna.|date=1966|publisher=Wittenberg/Lutherstadt, Ziemsen|page=97|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/zwerghamster-der-palaarktischen-fauna/oclc/9704187|accessdate=28 February 2015|language=German}}</ref>

==As pets==

Roborovski hamsters, being incredibly fast, agile, and naturally timid or shy, are generally recommended as "look but don't touch" pets. Loud noises can agitate them, and they are extremely skittish. As they rarely bite, Roborovski hamsters may make good pets for owners who enjoy interactive play (in which the hamster explores its owner). This may also provide time for taming them.  As light may sometimes disturb them, red lights are recommended to allow an owner to view the hamsters without disturbing them; Roborovski hamsters are unable to see red light.

Roborovski hamsters are great climbers, like other hamsters. They also like to tunnel and run, so it's vital that their cage has either a flying saucer or wheel. Roborovski hamsters are known to sleep in their [[Hamster wheel|wheels]], especially in wheels with banked edges.

Robos like to be in pairs, so it is easier to breed them. Many roborovski hamsters can be seen sleeping next to each other. They are also a common dwarf hamster sold at pet stores.

Although claimed to be hypoallergenic, Roborovski hamsters have been associated with the development of asthma in previously asymptomatic owners.<ref>Niitsuma et al., J. Invest. Allergol. Clin. Immunol. 2004; 14(3):221-224</ref>

Roborovski hamsters do not particularly take to eating the pellets found in most common retail hamster foods, preferring seeds (including Millet) where possible.<ref name="roborovski.net">[http://www.roborovski.net Website specifically about Roborovski hamsters]</ref><ref name="Roborovskihamsters.webs.com">[http://roborovskihamsters.webs.com/ Home - Roborovski Hamsters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="petcentreonline.co.uk">[http://www.petcentreonline.co.uk/ecommerce/Scripts/default~idPage~9.htm Harry's Guide to Hamsters @ www.petcentreonline.co.uk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
