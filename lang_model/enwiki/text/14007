The '''Dovecot At Blackford Farm''' in [[Selworthy]] on [[Exmoor]] within the English county of [[Somerset]] was probably built in the 11th century. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]],<ref name=nhlelb>{{cite web|title=Dovecot at Blackford Farm|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1345406|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> and [[scheduled monument]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dovecote at Little Blackford|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=34626|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=nhlesched>{{cite web|title=Dovecote at Little Blackford|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1020774|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref>

The cylindrical stone [[dovecote]] has a cone shaped roof. It contains over 300 nest boxes. The pigeons would have been domesticated for food, possibly by [[Montacute Priory]] or by the local [[lord of the manor]]. It is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and used as a store for the neighbouring farm.

==History==
The earliest written record of the [[Dovecote]] was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known.<ref name=everythingex>{{cite web|title=Blackford Dovecote on the Holnicote Estate and the Exmoor National Park|url=http://www.everythingexmoor.org.uk/encyclopedia_detail.php?ENCid=147|publisher=Everything Exmoor|accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref> It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dovecote, Blackford Farm|url=http://www.exmoorher.co.uk/hbsmr-web/record.aspx?UID=MSO8017-Dovecote-Blackford-Farm&pageid=16&mid=9|work=Exmoor Historic Environment Record|publisher=Exmoor National Park|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> The manor previously belonged to [[Montacute Priory]], a [[Cluniac]] priory of the [[Benedictine]] order, founded between 1078 and 1102 although it is not known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=193145|title=Montacute Priory|work=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=12 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="sher">{{cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=54294|title=Montacute Priory|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=12 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=mccann/> Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), and dung.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pigeoncote.com/dovecote/dovecote.html |title=Pigeoncote.com |publisher=Pigeoncote.com |date= |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Geoffrey N.|title=Abbeys and Priories|year=2004|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|isbn=978-0747805892|page=33|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lWAYvsIPbMwC&pg=PA5&dq=Bruton+Dovecote#v=onepage&q=Bruton%20&f=false}}</ref>

The dovecote which forms part of the property of the [[Holnicote Estate]], was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by [[Richard Acland|Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet]] in 1944.<ref name=everythingex/> It was scheduled as an [[ancient monument]] in 1949 and designated as a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1969.<ref name=nhlelb/><ref name=nhlesched/> Repairs were undertaken to the dovecote in 1993.<ref name=mccann/> The building is used as a store by the neighbouring farmer.<ref name=mccann/>

==Architecture==
The building is cylindrical with an external diameter of {{convert|23|ft|6|in}} and is {{convert|15|ft}} high to the eaves. The walls, which are {{convert|4|ft}} thick, are built of [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]].<ref name=mccann>{{cite book|last1=McCann|first1=John|last2=McCann|first2=Pamela|title=The Dovecotes of Historical Somerset|date=2003|publisher=Somerset Vernacular Building Group|isbn=978-0952382430|pages=75-77}}</ref> The doorway was widened to its current height of {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} high and {{convert|3|ft|6|in}} wide in the 19th century replacing a much smaller door which would have been present when it was used as a dovecote.<ref name=mccann/>

It contains over 300 nest holes.<ref name=everythingex/> These are arranged into 11 tiers with an irregular pattern. Each of the boxes is approximately {{convert|11|in}} wide and {{convert|20|in}} wide but the opening is smaller than the interior of the box. The lowest boxes are about {{convert|2|ft|6|in}} above the earth floor which kept them above the damp and away from [[brown rat]]s which became common in the area in the 18th century.<ref name=mccann/>

The original hole in the roof for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry.<ref name=byford>{{cite book|last=Byford|first=Enid|title=Somerset Curiosities|date=1987|publisher=Dovecote Press|isbn=0946159483|page=84}}</ref> The interior of the roof has [[putlog hole]]s rather than nesting boxes but may also have been used by pigeons.<ref name=mccann/>
