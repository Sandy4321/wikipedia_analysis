'''Bangor University''' ({{lang-cy|Prifysgol Bangor}}) is a university based in the city of [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] in the [[County#United Kingdom|county]] of [[Gwynedd]] in [[North Wales|North]] [[Wales]].

It was officially known for most of its history as the '''University College of North Wales''' ("UCNW", ''Coleg Prifysgol Gogledd Cymru'' in [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]). From 1995 until 31 August 2007 the University was known as '''University of Wales, Bangor''' ("UWB") and '''Prifysgol Cymru, Bangor''' ("PCB").

==History==
The University was founded as the "University College of North Wales" (UCNW) on 18 October 1884 with an inaugural address by [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis|the Earl of Powis]], the College's first President, in Penrhyn Hall.<ref name = Roberts>David Roberts (2009) ''Bangor University 1884-2009'' , University of Wales Press ISBN 978-0-7083-2226-0</ref> There was then a procession to the college with 3,000 quarryman (quarrymen from [[Penrhyn Quarry]] and other quarries had subscribed over <U+00A3>1200 to the university).<ref>The Times, Monday, Oct 20, 1884; pg. 7; Issue 31269; col F</ref> The result of a campaign for better [[higher education]] provision in [[Wales]],and following some rivalry between North Wales towns as to which was to be the base of the new college, it was incorporated by [[Royal Charter|charter]] a year later.<ref name = Roberts />

Its students received degrees from the [[University of London]] until 1893 when UCNW became a founding constituent institution of the federal [[University of Wales]]. 

During the [[Second World War]], paintings from national arts galleries were located at the Prichard-Jones Hall to protect them from enemy bombing; they were later moved to slate mines at [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]].<ref name = Roberts /> Students from [[University College, London]] were evacuated to continue their studies in a safer environment at Bangor.<ref name = Roberts />

During the 1960s, the University shared in the general expansion of Higher Education in the UK following the [[Robbins Report]], with a number of new departments being created and new buildings built.<ref name = Roberts /> On 22 November 1965, during construction of the extension to the Department of Electronic Engineering in Dean Street, a crane collapsed on the building.  The three ton counterweight hit the second floor lecture theatre of the original building about thirty minutes before it would have been occupied by about 80 first year students.  The counterweight went through to the ground floor.<ref>Publication: Guardian 1821-1975;   Date: Nov 23, 1965;   Section: None;   Page: 6</ref>

In 1967, the [[Bangor Normal College]], now part of the University, was the venue for the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s lectures in [[Transcendental Meditation]], at which [[The Beatles]] learnt of the death of their manager, [[Brian Epstein]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Higher browsing: The third degree|work=Guardian [London, England]|date=27 August 2002}}</ref>

Student protest in the 1970s focused mainly on the role of the [[Welsh language]] at the University, with many calling for Welsh-medium teaching and a more thorough approach to bilingualism at the institution.<ref name = Roberts /> Around this time, too consideration began of mergers with two Bangor colleges of education - St. Mary's College, a college for women student-teachers and the larger and older [[Bangor Normal College|Normal College/Coleg Normal]]. The merger of St. Mary's was concluded in 1977, but the Coleg Normal merger fell through. Ultimately, Coleg Normal merged with the University in 1996.

The change of name to Bangor University or ''Prifysgol Bangor'' was instigated by the University following the decision of the [[University of Wales]] to change from a [[federalism|federal]] university to a [[confederal]], non-membership organisation, and the granting of degree awarding powers to Bangor University itself. The University has decided to take advantage of these powers, and every student starting 2009 will have a degree from Bangor University, whereas any student who started prior to 2009 has the option to choose Bangor University or University of Wales Bangor to have on their final graduation certificate.<ref>[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/ar/ro/important_announce/namechange_jan07.php University Moves Towards University Title & Change Of Name ]</ref>

==Campus and Buildings==

The University occupies a substantial proportion of the city and also has some departments in [[Wrexham]]. One of the University's key selling-points is its location between [[Snowdonia]] and the island of [[Anglesey]].

===Arts Building===
The University was originally based in an old coaching inn called the [[Penrhyn Arms Hotel]] (which housed its 58 students and 12 teaching staff), but in 1911 it moved to a much larger new building which is now the old part of the Main Arts Building. This building, designed by [[Henry Hare]], had its foundation stone laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] on 9 July 1907, and was formally opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1911. This iconic building in a visible position overlooking the city, gave the college its Welsh nickname ''Y Coleg ar y Bryn'' ("The College on the Hill"). The building included the large Prichard-Jones Hall, named after [[John Prichard-Jones|Sir John Prichard-Jones]] a local man who became a partner of London department store [[Dickins & Jones]] and who had been a substantial benefactor of the building.<ref name= Roberts />

The building became a Grade 1 [[listed building]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bangorcivicsociety.org.uk/pages/listedindex/1%20%2816%29.htm | author = Bangor Civic Society | title = Main Arts Building | accessdate  = 19 November 2010 }}</ref>

A modern extension, completing a quadrangle on the College Road side of the building, was completed in 1969.

This is now known as the Main Arts Building.

===Halls of Residence===
====Development====
The story of the halls of residence is complicated by the changes of name associated with particular buildings. 

The red-brick 'University Hall', built in a Queen Anne style, was the first substantial block, opened in 1897.<ref name = Clarke>M L Clarke (1966) ''Architectural History and Guide'' , University College of North Wales [http://www.bangorcivicsociety.org.uk/pages/hisso/ah.htm Online at Bangor Civic Society]</ref> This building was to become the [[Welsh language]] hall 'Neuadd John Morris-Jones' in 1974 (named after professor [[John Morris Jones]]<ref name =Roberts/> and is the current Neuadd Rathbone.

Neuadd Reichel, built on the Ffriddoedd farm site, designed in a neo-Georgian style by architect [[Percy Thomas]], was opened in 1942 as a hostel for men students.<ref name = Roberts/><ref name = Clarke/>

Expansion in the 1960s led to the development of Plas Gwyn in 1963/64 and Neuadd Emrys Evans in 1965, both on the Ffriddoedd site, and Neuadd Rathbone at the top of Love Lane in 1965.<ref name = Roberts /> Neuadd Rathbone, designed by [[Colwyn Foulkes]] and named after the second President of the college, was originally for women students only.<ref name = Clarke /> The names of Neuadd Rathbone and Neuadd John Morris-Jones were later exchanged with each other. The building originally opened as Neuadd Rathbone is now known as Neuadd Garth.

Plas Gwyn and Neuadd Emrys Evans were demolished in 2008-2009 to make way for the present halls.

====Current provision====
Accommodation is guaranteed for all single, undergraduate first year students at Bangor. There are over 2,000 rooms available in [[halls of residence]], and all of the accommodation is within walking distance of the University.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

All the sites are managed directly from the Halls Office. Support is available during the daytime from the Halls Office, University Security Staff and Student Services and out of hours and at weekend from the resident Senior Wardens. The University also employs a team of Student Wardens to live in every hall of residence. 

There are four residential sites in current use:

=====Ffriddoedd Site=====
[[Image:Ffriddoedd site bangor university.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Entrance to the Ffriddoedd halls of residence site]]

The largest accommodation site is the Friddoedd Site in [[Upper Bangor]] about 10 minutes walk from Top College, the Science Site and city centre. This site has 11 new en-suite Halls completed in 2009, 6 other en-suite halls built in the 1990s and Neuadd Reichel built in the 1940s, and includes a coffee shop, launderettes, convenience shop, Bar Uno and Maes Glas Sports Hall.

Two of the en-suite Halls, Bryn Dinas and Tegfan, now incorporate the new Neuadd John Morris Jones which started its life in 1974 in College road and has, along with its equivalent Neuadd Pantycelyn in Aberystwyth, became a hub of Welsh identity. It is also the main focal point of Welsh language activities of the University and is an integral part of UMCB, which is the Welsh Students' Union, part of the main Students' Union body. The hall itself is affectionately known as 'JMJ' to all its students and alumni. 

The Halls on "Ffridd" (pron. frith) site include: Cefn y Coed, Y Glyder, Y Borth, Elidir, JMJ Bryn Dinas and JMJ Tegfan, all of which were built in the early 1990s, Adda, Alaw, Braint, Crafnant, Enlli, Peris, Glaslyn, Llanddwyn, Ffraw, Idwal and Gwynant, which were all built in the late 2000s and the newly refurbished Neuadd Reichel, built in the 1940s. 

"Ffridd" is the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for mountain pasture or sheep path; "ffriddoedd" is its plural form.

=====Normal Site=====
The '''Normal Site''' is situated on the shores of the [[Menai Strait]] next to the School of Education and School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences and the closest residences to the School of Ocean Sciences in Menai Bridge. The site has two self-catered halls: Neuadd Seiriol and Neuadd Arfon.

The site is named after the former [[Bangor Normal College]], which has since been incorporated into the University (see History above), and was established for the training of teachers (see [[Normal School]]).

=====Bryn Eithin=====
Bryn Eithin overlooks the centre of Bangor and is close to the Science Departments and School of Informatics. This is a Postgraduate site and has three blocks accommodating ninety six students.

In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], "Bryn" means "hill," and "Eithin" means "gorse."

=====College Road=====
College Road has one hall situated there, Neuadd Garth (formerly Neuadd John Morris Jones, before that Neuadd Rathbone), this is the only catered hall. The site is located a stone's throw from the Main Arts building in Upper Bangor, and departments such as Psychology, Music and the College of Business, Social Sciences and Law. Neuadd Rathbone (formerly Neuadd John Morris Jones, before that University Hall) which is located on the site, was previously a Hall of Residence but will be remodeled during the academic year 2011-2012, to accommodate Student Services and will no longer be occupied by students as a Hall of Residence.

====Private halls====

A private hall of residence called 'Neuadd Willis' (named after a well-liked and respected architect) has been built (2006), incorporating the old listed British Hotel with a new build extension to the rear and a further Hall on the site of the old Plaza cinema. This is not a University owned or managed hall.

===Former Refectory and Student Union Buildings===
[[Image:Uwb students union.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Former Students' Union Building from Deiniol Road]]
The Students' Union building until 2010 was situated on Deiniol Road at one end of College Park below the Main Arts building. The Refectory and Curved Lounge were built in 1963<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.bangorcivicsociety.org.uk/pages/hisso/canlife/index.htm | publisher = Bangor Civic Society | title = 'Caernarvonshire Life' May 1964| accessdate = 31 January 2010}}</ref> and the main administrative building was added in 1969. The building was known as ''Steve Biko House'' in the 1970s to early 1990s,<ref name = Roberts /><ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.seren.bangor.ac.uk/archive/pdf/1990/059-JUN11-1990.pdf | publisher = Seren | title = 'Seren' published at Steve Biko House| accessdate = 8 August 2009}}</ref> named after student activist [[Steve Biko]] who had been killed in [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] protests in [[South Africa]]. The buildings were renovated in 1997 to create an 1100-capacity nightclub, Amser/Time, where the previous refectory space was. In 2004, the student-only venue located in the main admin building, Main Bar, was renovated to become the 700-capacity Academi. The overall complex also consisted of two catering venues, Student Services department and the Students' Union offices. Demolition of the  Union buildings and Theatr Gwynedd began in July 2010 to make room for the proposed [http://www.pontio.co.uk/en/home.php Pontio Arts and Innovation Centre].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.theonlinemail.co.uk/bangor-and-anglesey-news/local-bangor-and-anglesey-news/2010/07/28/demolition-work-starts-on-the-old-theatr-gwynedd-66580-26939516/ | publisher = Holyhead and Anglesey Mail | title = Demolition work starts on the old Theatr Gwynedd | accessdate = 11 August 2010}}</ref> The Centre will include a theatre with a capacity of between 450-550 seats, cinema space, a studio theatre, and an outdoor amphitheatre, all accompanied by new social facilities including bars, dining and park areas in a family-friendly environment.

More than half of the academic departments at Bangor received an "Excellent" rating for the quality of teaching, and several departments scored very highly in the 2007 [[National Student Survey]], with the School of Music occupying the top slot in the UK.<ref>[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/full.php?Id=312 Bangor's Students Record their Satisfaction. - News and Events at Bangor University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The University recently doubled its number of research contracts won, bringing Bangor's research contract income to <U+00A3>20M.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Following a reshuffle in August 2006, the University is divided into six Colleges. These are then broken down into Schools and Research Institutes. One of the departments that closed as a result of the reorganisation was Mathematics. ''[[The Guardian]]'' league table placed Bangor fifth in the UK for maths despite the University no longer admitting students.<ref>[http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/news/manews.html http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/public/mathematics/news/manews.html]</ref>

'''Storm FM''' is the official [[student radio]] station for Bangor University and is one of only three student radio stations in the UK to have a long term [[FM broadcasting|FM]] license.  The station is broadcast on 87.7FM from a low powered FM transmitter based on the [[#Ffriddoedd Site|Ffriddoedd Site]].  Storm is run on a voluntary basis by around 90 students at the university. Unfortunately, the FM licence only allows for broadcast to a very small area of Bangor - namely the Ffriddoed Road Halls of Residence. On March 1, 2009, Storm FM officially went online, with the service being available to anyone who accesses the Storm website [http://www.stormfm.com].

====History====
Bangor Rag Radio Stereo FM started in 1972 by a number of Dean Street (Electronics Engineering) students, initially just for Rag Week. This was a pirate radio station, possibly the first University stereo FM station in the UK. The FM transmitter was moved around Bangor to avoid capture by the GPO, often with a microwave link line-of-sight from the Student's Union building roof to provide live studio radio programmes.Its predecessor was on Medium Wave only, and was started shortly after World War II. Rag Radio later spawned BRBS the Bangor Rag Broadcasting System, which ran until 1991.

Storm FM was set up in October 2001 by the then president of the [[Students' Union]], Niall Duffy. The first show was broadcast at 13:00 on March 19, 2003.

In 2005, two presenters received nominations at the [[Student Radio Awards]]; Emma Gascoigne for ''Best Female'', and Spencer George for ''Best Newcomer''. The station was also nominated for ''Best Station Sound'' at the [[Student Radio Awards]] 2004.

Following considerable time off-air, the 2006/07 academic year saw a totally re-branded Storm FM relocate to a new studio in the Students' Union building, directly under the control of the Students' Union. Until that point, broadcasts were made from the University's Media Centre in upper Bangor.

In October 2007, Storm FM received two nominations at the [[Student Radio Awards]] for ''Best Marketing & Branding'' and ''Best Live Event/Outside Broadcast'', the latter receiving a Bronze Award at the 2007 SRA ceremony for its local coverage of the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007]].[http://www.studentradio.org.uk/awards/2007/winners.html]
