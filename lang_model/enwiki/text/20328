'''Peter Kramer (physicist)''' (* [[1933]] in [[Quedlinburg]]) is a German [[physicist]].

== Personal Life ==
 
Kramer studied physics in [[M<U+00FC>nster]], [[T<U+00FC>bingen]], [[Bristol]] und [[Marburg]]. He obtained his PhD in 1964 in Marburg and his Habilitation in 1968
in T<U+00FC>bingen. He was a postdoc at the [[UNAM]] in [[Mexico City]], where he collaborated with [[Marcos Moshinsky]].
Since 1970 he is Professor at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in T<U+00FC>bingen. He served as a Dean and a Vice President at his university.
Since 1998 he is retired. Kramer is married since 1962 and has two sons.

== Scientific work ==

Kramer's work is concerned with applications of [[Group Theory|groups]] und [[Representation Theory|representations]] in [[mathematical physics]]. 
His early work is in [[nuclear physics]]. In the early eighties he and his student Roberto Neri discovered the mathematical model for [[Quasi-crystal|quasiperiodic tesselations]]
of the three-dimensional space. <ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108767384001203|title=On periodic and non-periodic space fillings of E<sup>m</sup> obtained by projection|year=1984|last1=Kramer|first1=P.|last2=Neri|first2=R.|journal=Acta Crystallographica|volume=A40|page=580|issue=5}}</ref>
Their article appeared shortly before [[Dan Shechtman]]'s article,  where quasi-crystals were for the first time described experimentally.

During the last years, Kramer became interested in [[cosmology]] and three-dimensional [[Space_form|space forms]]. His scientific <U+0153>vre contains more than
200 publikations. <ref>http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/peter.kramer/</ref>
