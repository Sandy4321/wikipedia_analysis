'''Sigismund II Augustus''' ({{lang-pl|Zygmunt II August}}, {{lang-lt|<U+017D>ygimantas III Augustas}}; [[1 August]] [[1520]] <U+2014> [[7 July]] [[1572]]) was the only son of [[Sigismund I the Old]], King of [[Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], whom Sigismund II succeeded in [[1548]].

== Royal titles ==

* Royal titles, in [[Latin]]: "''Sigismundus Augustus Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, nec non terrarum Cracoviae, Sandomiriae, Siradiae, Lanciciae, Cuiaviae, Kijoviae, Russiae, Woliniae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Podlachiae, Culmensis, Elbingensis, Pomeraniae, Samogitiae, Livoniae etc. dominus et haeres''."

* English translation: "Sigismund Augustus,  by the Grace of God, King of [[Poland]], Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]], of the Lands of [[Cracow]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Sieradz]], [[<U+0141><U+0119>czyca]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Kiev]], Hereditary Lord of [[Ruthenia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Ducal Prussia]], [[Masovia]], [[Podlachia]], [[Culmer Land]], [[Elbing]], [[Pomerania]], [[Samogitia]], [[Livonia]] etc."

== Biography ==
From the outset of his reign, Sigismund came into collision with the country's ''[[szlachta]]'' ([[gentry]]), who had already begun curtailing the power of the great families. The ostensible cause of the szlachta's animosity to the King was his second marriage, secretly contracted before his accession to the throne, with the beautiful [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] [[Calvinist]], [[Barbara Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]], daughter of [[Hetman]] [[Jerzy Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]]. 

But the real forces behind the movement seem to have been the [[Austria|Austrian]] court and Sigismund's own mother, [[Bona Sforza]], and so violent was the agitation at Sigismund's first ''[[sejm]]'' ([[October 31]], [[1548]]) that the [[deputy|deputies]] threatened to renounce their allegiance unless the King repudiated his wife Barbara. He refused, and his moral courage and political dexterity won the day. 

By [[1550]], when Sigismund summoned his second ''[[sejm]]'', a reaction had begun in his favor, and the ''[[szlachta]]'' was rebuked by [[Piotr Kmita]], Marshal of the ''[[Sejm]]'', who accused them of attempting to unduly diminish the legislative prerogatives of the crown. 

The death of Queen Barbara, five days after her coronation ([[December 7]], [[1550]]), under  distressing circumstances which led to a suspicion that she had been poisoned by [[Bona Sforza]], compelled Sigismund to contract a third, purely political union with his first cousin, the Austrian archduchess [[Catherine of Austria|Catherine]], also the sister of his first wife, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1526<U+2013>1545)|Elisabeth]], who had died within a year of her marriage to him, while he was still only crown prince. 

The third bride was sickly and unsympathetic, and Sigismund soon lost all hope of children by her <U+2014> to his despair, for as he was the last male Jagiellon in the direct line, the dynasty was threatened with extinction. He sought to remedy this by liaisons with two of the most beautiful of his countrywomen, [[Barbara Gi<U+017C>anka]] and [[Anna Zaj<U+0105>czkowska]]. The [[sejm]] was willing to legitimatize, and acknowledge as Sigismund's successor, any male heir who might be born to him; however, the King was to die childless.

The King's marriage was a matter of great political import to [[Protestants]] and [[Catholics]] alike. Had Sigismund not been so good a Catholic, he might have imitated [[Henry VIII of England]] by pleading that his detested third wife was the sister of his first wife, and that  consequently the union was uncanonical. The Polish [[Protestantism|Protestants]] hoped that he would do so and thus bring about a breach with Rome at the very crisis of the religious  struggle in Poland; while the [[Habsburgs]], who coveted the Polish throne, raised every obstacle to the childless King's remarriage. 

Not till [[Catherine of Austria | Queen Catherine]]'s death ([[February 28]], [[1572]]) was Sigismund set free, but less than six months later he would follow her to the grave.  

Sigismund's reign was a period of internal turmoil and external expansion.

He saw the invasion of Poland by the [[Reformation]], and the democratic upheaval that placed all political power in the hands of the ''[[szlachta]]''; he saw the collapse of the [[Knights of the Sword]] in the north (which led to the Republic's acquisition of [[Livonia]]) and the consolidation of [[Turkey]]'s power in the south. Throughout this perilous transitional period, Sigismund successfully steered the ship of state amid the whirlpools that constantly threatened to engulf it. A less imposing figure than his father, the elegant and refined Sigismund II Augustus was nevertheless an even greater statesman than the stern and majestic [[Sigismund I the Old]].

Sigismund II possessed to a high degree the tenacity and patience that seem to have characterized all the [[Jagiellon Dynasty|Jagiellons]], and he added to these qualities a  dexterity and diplomatic finesse which he may have inherited from his [[Italy|Italian]] mother. No other Polish king seems to have so thoroughly understood the nature of the Polish ''[[sejm]]''. Both the Austrian ambassadors and the papal legates testify to the care with which he controlled his nation. Everything went as he wished, they said, because he seemed to know everything in advance. He managed to get more money than his father ever could, and at one of his ''[[sejm]]''s he won the hearts of the assembly by unexpectedly appearing before them in the simple grey coat of a [[Masovia]]n squire. Like his father, a pro-Austrian by conviction, he contrived even in this respect to carry with him the nation, always distrustful of the [[Germany|Germans]], and thus avoided serious complications with the dangerous Turks. 

Sigismund II mediated for twenty years between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestantism|Protestants]] without alienating the sympathies of either. His most striking memorial, however, may have been the [[Union of Lublin]], which finally made of Poland and Lithuania one body politic, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] <U+2014> the "Republic of the Two Nations" ({{lang-pl|Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod<U+00F3>w}}, {{lang-lt|Abiej<U+0173> Taut<U+0173> Respublika}}). This achievement might well have been impossible without Sigismund.

Sigismund died at his beloved [[Knyszyn]] on July 6, 1572, aged 52. In 1573, [[Henry III of France|Henry III of Valois]] was elected as King of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth for a few months, but then returned to France where he was coronated as King Henry III of France. Shortly thereafter, Sigismund's sister [[Anna of Poland]] married [[Stefan Batory]], and they ruled as King and Queen of Poland.

== Marriages and children ==

He married three times:
*On [[May 5]], [[1543]], Sigismund married his first wife [[Elisabeth of Austria (1526<U+2013>1545)|Elisabeth of Austria]] (July 9, 1526 - June 15, 1545), eldest daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]]. 
*Between [[July 28]] and [[August 6]], [[1547]], Sigismund married his second wife [[Barbara Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] ([[December 6]], [[1520]] - [[May 8]], [[1551]]).
*In the summer of [[1553]], Sigismund married [[Catherine of Austria]] ([[September 15]], [[1533]] - [[February 28]], [[1572]]), a younger sister of his first wife.

He had no legitimate children. He reportedly had an illegitimate daughter by his mistress [[Barbara Gi<U+017C>ycka]]. She was also named Barbara and married Jakub Zawadzki.
