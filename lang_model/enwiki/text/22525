{{otherplaces3|Pedra Branca}}
'''Pedra Branca''' (formerly referred to by [[Malaysia]] as Pulau Batu Puteh and now as Batu Puteh) is an outlying island of Singapore. The name means "white rock" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and refers to whitish [[guano]] (bird droppings) deposited on the rock. The island consists of a small [[outcrop]] of [[granite]] rocks with an area of about {{convert|8560|m2|sqft}}. During the low water [[tide#tidal range variation: springs and neaps|spring tide]] it measures, at its longest, {{convert|137|m|ft}} and has an average width of {{convert|60|m|ft}}. It is situated at 1<U+00B0> 19<U+2032> 48<U+2033> N and 104<U+00B0> 24<U+2032> 27<U+2033> E, where the [[Singapore Strait]] meets the [[South China Sea]]. There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca. [[Middle Rocks]], under the sovereignty of Malaysia, consists of two clusters of small rocks about {{convert|250|m|ft}} apart situated {{convert|0.6|nmi|km mi|1}} south of Pedra Branca. South Ledge, which is {{convert|2.2|nmi|km mi}} to the [[boxing the compass|south-south-west]] of Pedra Branca, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide.

Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. It was originally within the territory of the [[Johor Sultanate]] which was founded in 1528, and remained under the new Sultanate of Johor under the British [[sphere of influence]] following the signing of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo&ndash;Dutch Treaty of 1824]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. Between 1850 and 1851, the British built [[Horsburgh Lighthouse]] on the island without informing the Johor authorities of their decision to do so or seeking consent for its erection. From that time, the island was administered by the United Kingdom and its successor, [[Singapore]]. On 21 September 1953, the Acting State Secretary of Johor, responding to a query from the [[Colonial Secretary]] of Singapore about the status of the island, stated that "the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca".

On 21 December 1979 Malaysia published a map which showed the island to be within its [[territorial waters]]. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together with the issue of sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of [[Middle Rocks]] and South Ledge, was presented to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the [[Johor Sultanate]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Singapore]] had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions which demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.

There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca. [[Middle Rocks]], which is under the sovereignty of Malaysia, consists of two clusters of small rocks about {{convert|250|m|ft}} apart situated {{convert|0.6|nmi|km mi|1}} south of the island. They stand {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} to {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} permanently above water. South Ledge, on the other hand, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide.

Rock samples from Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge show they are all composed of a light, coarse-grained [[biotite]] [[granite]].

==History==
===Up to the 1840s===
[[Image:LongYaMen-20060813.jpg|thumb|A replica of [[Long Ya Men]] at the [[Labrador Nature Reserve]], put up in 2005 as part of the Singapore [[Zheng He]]'s 600th Anniversary Celebrations]]

Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. Part of the Chinese sailing instructions for the [[South China Sea]] based on information compiled by Admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371<U+2013>1433) advised a navigator that after departing [[Long Ya Men]] ([[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] for "Dragon's Teeth Gate"), a rocky outcrop at the gateway to what is now [[Keppel Harbour]] in Singapore, he should steer a course of between 75<U+00BA> to 90<U+00BA> for five [[watch system|watches]] until his vessel reached ''Baijiao''.<ref name=Davison/> Pedra Branca was also mentioned in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] voyager [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]'s ''Itinerario'' (''Itinerary''),<ref>{{citation|author=[[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]|title=Itinerario.

Pedra Branca was originally within the territory of the [[Johor Sultanate]],<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 68.</ref> which was founded in 1528 by [[Sultan]] [[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Alauddin Riayat Shah II]], the son of Sultan [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. In the mid 17th century, the Dutch Governor of Malacca wrote to the [[Dutch East India Company]], asking it to send two boats to the [[Singapore Strait|Straits of Singapore]] to "cruise to the south of Singapore Straits under the Hook of Barbukit and in the vicinity of Pedra Branca" to stop Chinese traders from entering [[Johor River]]. The plan was put into force, and two Chinese [[junk (ship)|junks]] were captured in the Straits and diverted to Malacca. However, this action provoked a protest from the [[Sultan of Johor]], which showed that the Sultan regarded the junks' seizure as an infringement of his sovereignty in the area. Three letters written in 1824 to the [[British Raj|Government of India]] by the British [[resident (title)|Resident]] in Singapore, [[John Crawfurd]], also confirm it was his understanding that all the islands in the region of the Straits of Singapore came under the Johor Sultanate.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 54<U+2013>56.</ref>

[[Image:PedraBranca-Daniell-c1820-detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Daniell|Thomas]] and [[William Daniell]]'s etching of Pedra Branca before the building of [[Horsburgh Lighthouse]], ''c.'' 1820]]

In addition, other 19th century documents evidence that the Sultan of Johor exercised authority over the ''Orang Laut'' ("sea people") who inhabited the maritime areas of the Straits of Singapore and visited Pedra Branca. One of these was a letter of November 1850 by [[John Turnbull Thomson]], the Government Surveyor of Singapore, which reported on the need to exclude the ''Orang Laut'' from Pedra Branca where [[Horsburgh Lighthouse]] was being built. Calling them a "half fishing half piratical sect", Thomson noted that they "frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them ... In the straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people."<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 71, 74<U+2013>75.</ref>

On 17 March 1824, the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo&ndash;Dutch Treaty of 1824]]. It divided the old Johor Sultanate into two new Sultanates: the new Sultanate of Johor, which would be under the British [[sphere of influence]], and the Sultanate of [[Riau Archipelago|Riau]]<U+2013>[[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] under Dutch influence.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 98.</ref> Under Article XII of the Treaty, Britain agreed that "no British Establishment shall be made on the [[Karimun Jawa|Carimon Isles]], or on the Island of [[Batam|Bantam]], [[Bintan|Bintang]], [[Lingga Island|Lingin]], or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore ..." The islands and [[islet]]s within the Straits fell within the British sphere of influence. This included Pedra Branca, which thus remained part of the territorial domain of the new Johor Sultanate.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 100.</ref>

Captain [[James Horsburgh]],<ref>{{citation|title=Significant Scots: James Horsburgh|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/horsburgh_james.htm|publisher=Electric Scotland|accessdate=2007-11-07}}.</ref> a Scottish [[hydrographer]] to the [[Honourable East India Company|British East India Company]] who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the [[Indies|East Indies]], China, [[Dutch West India Company|New Holland]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and other intermediate ports,<ref>{{citation|author=[[James Horsburgh]]|title=Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China, New Holland, Cape of Good Hope, and the Interjacent Ports|location=London|publisher=Printed for the author|year=1809<U+2013>1811}}.</ref> died in May 1836. Merchants and mariners felt that the building of one or more [[lighthouse]]s would be a fitting tribute to him, and in as early as November 1836 Pedra Branca was proposed as one of the preferred sites.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 126; Davison, p. 89.</ref> By 1844, preference had been expressed for Romania Outer Island, or Peak Rock.<ref name="Pedra Branca 128">''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 128.</ref> Some time in November 1844, the [[Governor of the Straits Settlements|Governor]] of the [[Straits Settlements]], William John Butterworth, wrote to the Sultan and the [[Temenggung]] of Johor regarding the matter. His letters have not been found, but English translations of the replies, dated 25 November 1844, indicate that the Sultan and Temenggung favoured the proposal. In particular, the Temenggung wrote that "the [East India] company are at full liberty to put up a Light House there, or any spot deemed eligible".<ref name="Pedra Branca 128"/> Three days later, on 28 November, the Governor wrote to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the lighthouse be sited on Peak Rock. Among other things, he said that "[t]his Rock is part of the Territories of the Rajah of Johore, who with the Tamongong ... have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company", and enclosed the replies received from the Sultan and Temenggung.<ref name="Pedra Branca 128"/> Although this was apparently the Governor's understanding of the situation, he did not communicate it to the Sultan and Temenggung.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 136.</ref> It is unclear whether the correspondence was limited to Peak Rock or extended to other potential sites for the lighthouse such as Pedra Branca, and whether the sovereignty of Johor over any place chosen for the lighthouse was ceded to the British Government or only a permission to build, maintain and operate a lighthouse was granted.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 131 and 145.</ref>

On 22 August 1845, Governor Butterworth wrote again to the Government of India, indicating he trusted that construction of the lighthouse on Peak Rock would begin soon "as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance".<ref name="Pedra Branca 146">''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 146.</ref> Between 1824 and 1851, at least 16 sizeable vessels were wrecked in the vicinity of Pedra Branca and Point Romania (on the Johor coast).<ref name="Pedra Branca 146"/><ref>{{citation|author=Vernon Cornelius-Takahama|title=Pedra Branca|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_722_2005-01-20.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]]|date=27 January 2000|accessdate=2008-09-01}}; {{citation|author=Harold Stephens|title=Light Houses of Asia|url=http://www.wolfendenpublishing.com/haroldstephens/travellermag_magazinearticle.htm|magazine=Traveller Magazine (reproduced on the Wolfenden Publishing website)|accessdate=2008-08-31}}.</ref> However, in April 1846, the [[Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty|Lords of the Admiralty]] in London informed the Court of Directors of the East India Company they were inclined to think that Pedra Branca was the best point for the lighthouse. John Thomson and Captain S. Congalton, commander of the East India Company's [[steamboat|steamer]] called the ''Hooghly'', carried out surveys in May and August. In a report dated 25 August, they said they were "decidedly of opinion that Pedra Branca is the only proper position for a Light to be placed ... for the safety of Shipping whether entering or departing for the Straits of Singapore ..." The following day, Governor Butterworth wrote to the Government of India stating that the Government "will at once perceive that Pedra Branca is the only true position" for the lighthouse. On 30 October 1846 the President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca as the site for the lighthouse. The East India Company gave its approval on 24 February 1847, and on 10 May of that year the Government of India asked Governor Butterworth to take measures for the construction of the lighthouse.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 147.</ref> There is no evidence that the authorities in Singapore thought it necessary or desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent for its erection.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 148.</ref>

Although the private subscribers wishing to commemorate Horsburgh had raised a sum which, with [[compound interest]], came up to more than 7,400 [[Spanish dollar]]s when it was paid over to the Singapore authorities,<ref>Davison, p. 90.</ref> there was still a shortfall of funds for the building works. Thus, the Government of India, in agreement with the East India Company, authorized Governor Butterworth to prepare a law imposing a [[duty (economics)|duty]] on vessels entering Singapore and asked him to take immediate measures to begin constructing the lighthouse.<ref name="Pedra Branca 151">''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 151.</ref> The Light Dues Act 1852 was duly enacted by the [[Governor-General of India]] in Council on 30 January 1852.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 153.</ref> Thomson, appointed by the Governor as architect for the project, took charge of planning and supervising the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse.<ref name="Pedra Branca 151"/> Construction work began in late March or early April 1850.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 152.</ref> On [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s birthday, 24 May 1850, the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid at a ceremony conducted by members of the newly-founded [[Masonic Lodge]] Zetland in the East No. 749 and attended by the Governor, the commander of the Singapore garrison, a [[rear admiral]] and several foreign [[consul (representative)|consuls]].<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 154; Davison, p. 92.</ref> The construction of the lighthouse then continued till 21 October, and resumed after the [[monsoon]] in April 1851. Up to 50 workmen were involved, including Chinese carpenters and stonemasons and their Malay assistants, Indian quarrymen and convict labourers, a cook and his assistant, and six [[lascar]]s to defend the island from attack by pirates. The pirates of the South China Sea were notorious <U+2013> during the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse nine Chinese labourers were killed in pirate raids.<ref name="Davison 93"/> Building materials and supplies were brought by the ''Hooghly'', supported by two [[gunboat]]s and two [[lighter (barge)|lighters]]. Unless he was required elsewhere, Thomson stayed on the island to supervise the works.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 152 and 159.</ref> The ceremonial first lighting of the lamp was arranged for 27 September 1851, again attended by the Governor, [[Freemasonry|Masons]] of the Zetland Lodge, foreign dignitaries, senior residents of Singapore and other notables; the ''Singapore Free Press'' reported: "A simultaneous rising [of the guests from the dinner table] announced that the process of illumination had commenced. Three hearty cheers welcomed the light, the [[meteoroid|meteor]]-like brilliancy of which will probably serve to guide the midnight path of the mariner for a thousand years to come."<ref name="Davison 94">Davison, p. 94.</ref> On 15 October the lighthouse was permanently turned on, and Thomson finally departed Pedra Branca for Singapore on the ''Hooghly'' on 18 November 1851.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 159.</ref>

===1852 to the present===
In 1867, the Straits Settlements, of which Singapore was a part, became a [[British overseas territories|Crown Colony]]. In 1946, following [[World War II]], Singapore became a separate Crown Colony. The other Straits Settlements, [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]], joined the [[Malay states]] (including Johor) to form the [[Malayan Union]]. The latter became the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948, and the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] in 1957 when it gained independence from Britain.

On 17 June 1953, the [[Colonial Secretary]] of Singapore wrote to the British Adviser to the Sultan of Johor to clarify the status of Pedra Branca. He noted that the rock was outside the limits ceded by [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan Hussein Shah]] and the Temenggung with the island of Singapore under the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 2 August 1824 they had entered into with the East India Company.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 102.</ref> However, the Colonial Government had been maintaining the lighthouse built on it, and "[t]his by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on the Colony". He therefore asked if "there is any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been ceded by the Government of the State of Johore or in any other way disposed of".<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 192.</ref> The Acting State Secretary of Johor replied on 21 September that "the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca".<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 196.</ref> This correspondence indicated that as of 1953 Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, which had therefore vested in the United Kingdom.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 223.</ref>

The Colony of Singapore became a self-governing state in 1959, and left the [[British Empire]] to join the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Two years later, in 1965, Singapore became a fully independent republic. In 1959, in an official publication regarding [[meteorology|meteorological]] information collected on Pedra Branca, Malaya listed Horsburgh Lighthouse as a "Singapore" station together with the [[Sultan Shoal Lighthouse|Sultan Shoal]] and [[Raffles Lighthouse]]s. The lighthouse on Pedra Branca was described in the same way in a joint Malaysian and Singaporean publication in 1966, the year after Singapore left the Federation. In 1967, when the two countries began reporting meteorological information separately, Malaysia ceased referring to Horsburgh Lighthouse.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 265.</ref> In maps published by the Malayan and Malaysian Surveyor General and Director of General Mapping in 1962, 1965, 1970, 1974 and 1975, the island was indicated with the word "(SINGAPORE)" or "(SINGAPURA)" under it.

==Territorial dispute==
{{main|Pedra Branca dispute}}
===International Court of Justice case===
[[Image:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], the seat of the [[International Court of Justice]]]]

On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled ''Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia'' showing Pedra Branca to be within its [[territorial waters]]. Singapore rejected this "claim" in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected. The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In the first round of talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 30 and 31.</ref> The case was heard at the [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]] between 6 and 23 November 2007.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, para. 12.</ref>

The ICJ delivered its judgment on 23 May 2008. It held that although Pedra Branca had originally been under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors ''<U+00E0> titre de souverain'' (with the title of a sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents in the vicinity of the island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore's express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognized Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 274<U+2013>277.

Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor held the original ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any rights as a sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 289 and 290.</ref> As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated to draw the line of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.<ref>''Pedra Branca'' case, paras. 297<U+2013>299.</ref>

===Reactions to ICJ decision===
Although both Malaysia and Singapore had agreed to respect and accept the ICJ's decision,<ref>{{citation|title=Malaysia, Singapore to accept ICJ's ruling on island|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/18/courts/20991877&sec=courts|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=18 April 2008|accessdate=2008-06-04}}; {{citation|title=ICJ's ruling on Pedra Branca to be delivered on May 23|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/344623/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=2008-09-01}}.</ref> Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that the rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced.<ref>{{citation|title=Malaysia not giving up hope on Batu Puteh yet|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/6/1/nation/21421939&sec=nation|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=1 June 2008}}. Article 61(1) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] states: "An application for revision of a judgment may be made only when it is based upon the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also to the party claiming revision, always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence." The application for revision must be made at latest within six months of the discovery of the new fact, and no application for revision may be made after the lapse of ten years from the date of the judgment: Articles 61(4) and (5).

Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.<ref>{{citation|title=S'pore will wait to see what new evidence M'sia can produce over Pedra Branca|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/351895/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=4 June 2008|accessdate=2008-06-04}}.</ref>

A week after the delivery of the ICJ's judgment, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word ''Pulau'' ("Island") for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as "Batu Puteh" or "Pedra Branca".<ref>{{citation|author=Lydia Lim|title=Rough seas or calm ahead?|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=31 May 2008}}.</ref> On 21 July 2008, in response to questions from Singapore [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] about Pedra Branca, the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs [[Balaji Sadasivan]] stated that the maritime territory around the island included a territorial sea of up to {{convert|12|nmi|km mi}} and an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. This was condemned by Malaysia's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as "against the spirit of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Asean]] and the legal structure" as the claim was "unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law".<ref>{{citation|title=KL's warning on Pedra Branca|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_269415.html?vgnmr=1|publisher=[[The Straits Times|Straitstimes.com]]|date=July 2008|accessdate=2008-09-01}}.

At the National Day Awards in August 2008, Singapore conferred awards on a number of people for their special contributions towards the Pedra Branca case. [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]]; [[Tommy Koh]], [[Ambassador at Large|Ambassador-at-Large]]; and Justice [[Chao Hick Tin]], then Attorney-General of Singapore, who appeared as counsel and advocates for Singapore, were respectively awarded the ''[[Darjah Utama Temasek]]'' (Order of Temasek) (Second Class), the ''[[Darjah Utama Nila Utama]]'' (Order of Nila Utama) (First Class), and the ''[[Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang]]'' (Distinguished Service Order). The ''[[Pingat Jasa Gemilang]]'' (Meritorius Service Medal) was conferred on Sivakant Tiwari s/o Thakurprasad Tiwari, Special Consultant to the International Affairs Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers.

===Resolution of outstanding issues===
Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.<ref name="CNA 20080523"/> Its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works is finalizing technical preparations for a [[hydrographic survey]] that will provide data for future delimitation discussions. A Sub-Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries was also formed, and following a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond {{convert|0.5|nmi|km mi|1}} off Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.<ref>{{citation|author=Goh Chin Lian|title=Pedra Branca: New joint panel formed|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=2 September 2008|page=B2}}; {{citation|title=Traditional fishing can go on|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/274217.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=2 September 2008|page=8}} (archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5bFBAAsQy).</ref>
