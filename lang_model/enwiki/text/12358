'''John Thomas North''' (30 January 1842 <U+2013> 5 May 1896) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] investor and businessman.  North was born in [[Leeds]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of a coal merchant and a churchwarden.  At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a [[mechanic]].  He moved to [[Chile]] in [[South America]] where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in [[Huasco, Chile|Huasco]].  He later moved to the [[Peru]]vian town of [[Iquique]] where he worked as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.  The [[War of the Pacific]] (1879&ndash;1883) provided North with an opportunity to purchase large numbers of bonds in the Peruvian [[Sodium nitrate|nitrate]] industry.  When Chile annexed Iquique and the surrounding province of [[Tarapac<U+00E1>]] the Chilean government transferred ownership of the nitrate fields to the bondholders.  North was thus able to take a monopoly share of the lucrative Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment, becoming known as "The King of Nitrates".

North built upon his nitrates business by expanding into further monopolies in waterworks and freight railways, but also owned several iron and coal fields.  North maintained his monopolies by employing lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean National Congress]].  This was allowed by Chilean president [[Domingo Santa Mar<U+00ED>a]], but Mar<U+00ED>a's successor, [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Balmaceda]], became concerned that Tarapac<U+00E1> was starting to resemble a "state within a state" and resolved to break North's monopoly.  Balmaceda had to force competition reforms through against opposition in congress, amongst a series of disputes which would eventually escalate into the [[Chilean Civil War]] of 1891 between the president and the congress.

North also had investments in the [[Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] which operated a [[Concession (territory)|concession]] in the [[Congo Free State]].  This company was involved in the extraction and export of rubber from the state, another highly profitable business, but would later become involved in abuses of human rights against those under its power.  However North's finances were eventually depleted and when he died his business empire had collapsed.

Here North established what would later become a large business empire, working as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.<ref name="rector103">{{Harvnb|Rector|2003|p=103}}.</ref>  

Territorial disputes between Chile, Peru and [[Bolivia]] triggered the [[War of the Pacific]] in 1879 with Chile invading and occupying Peruvian and Bolivian land.  In the course of the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk.<ref name="rector103"/>  However he also befriended the Chilean [[Admiral]] [[Patricio Lynch]] who later supported him in his business ventures.<ref name="rector103"/>  During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpetre]]) industry, and John Dawson, a banker.  North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war.<ref name="bethell506">{{Harvnb|Bethell|1986|p=506}}.</ref>  After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapac<U+00E1> and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends.<ref name="rector103"/>  North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds.<ref name="bethell506"/><ref name="collier152">{{Harvnb|Collier|Sater|1996|p=152}}.</ref>  The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that it would have cost them [[Pound sterling|GBP<U+00A3>]]4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators.  By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates.<ref name="collier144">{{Harvnb|Collier|Sater|1996|p=144}}.</ref>

North left Chile and returned to the United Kingdom in order to raise credit to provide for machinery, transport and employment costs.  It was there, in February 1883<U+2014>still eight months before Peru officially ceded the nitrate fields to Chile<U+2014>that he established the Liverpool Nitrate Company.<ref name="rector103"/>  North dispatched Robert Harvey to Chile with equipment and engineers to begin construction of the mines whilst North remained in Britain to manage the financial side of the enterprise.  The mines were operation by 1884 and producing 3,000 [[Short ton|short tons]] of nitrates per month.  The company turned large profits and was able to pay dividends in excess of 20% each year until 1886 when it was liquidated by North and his partners in order to found other companies.<ref name="rector103"/>  As a result of his fantastic profits North became known as "The King Of Nitrates" and was a well known public figure in England.<ref name="bethell506"/><ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news | last = Buckley| first = Martin| author-link=  | title = Chile: Notes from a nomad | date = 5 February 2001 | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/chile/721073/Chile-Notes-from-a-nomad.html| accessdate = 2009-03-01| work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

Nitrates were an important source of income for the Chilean government and an increase in export duty from [[Chilean peso|CLP]] 
4 pesos per ton in 1878 to CLP 22 in 1882 resulted in revenue from nitrates increasing from CLP 6 to 25 million.<ref name="rector104">{{Harvnb|Rector|2003|p=104}}.</ref>  This allowed the government to make cuts in both income and land tax.  The reliance of Chile upon its nitrate income caused conflict between the government and the nitrate production cartel.  The cartel wanted to maximise the price of nitrates by cutting production whilst the government wanted to maximise their duty income by maximising exports.  The nature of the trade meant that the Chilean economy was also totally dependent on imports and exports to and from Britain.<ref name="leonard1483">{{Harvnb|Leonard|2006|p=1483}}.</ref>  The periodic downturns in nitrate revenue caused by the cartel cutting production eventually forced the Chilean government to print more money, causing inflation to increase and the peso to devalue.<ref name="rector104"/>

== North's monopolies ==

In the meantime North continued to invest in Chile and founded the Nitrate Railway Company which held a monopoly on nitrate rail transport in Tarapac<U+00E1> and also held a monopoly on the water supply in [[Iquique]].  He also owned several coal and iron fields along the [[Biob<U+00ED>o River]], a colliery in [[South Wales]] and a [[gasworks]] at Iquique.<ref name="NYT2"/><ref name="NYT"/>  In addition, his nitrate business was the primary cause of the development of the towns of Iquique and [[Pisagua, Chile|Pisagua]].<ref name="NYT"/>  To maintain his monopolies, North employed lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean National Congress]].<ref name="rector103"/>  Under president [[Domingo Santa Mar<U+00ED>a]], North's monopolies went unchallenged, and Mar<U+00ED>a's successor in 1886, [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Balmaceda]], initially allowed the situation to continue.  However, Balmaceda became concerned that the situation in Tarapac<U+00E1> was starting to resemble a "state within a state" and decided to break North's monopoly.<ref name="collier152"/>  Congress was not supportive and Balmaceda had to force through reforms to restore competition in the province.<ref name="rector103"/>  Increasing disputes between Balmaceda and Congress resulted in the outbreak of the [[Chilean Civil War]] in 1891.

In the meantime North enjoyed the status of a famous [[upper class|high society]] gentleman in Britain and was worth [[United states dollar|US$]]10 million in 1889.<ref name="telegraph"/>  He was a friend of the [[Prince of Wales]], later to become [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], and was described, by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a "lion" of the London social season.<ref name="NYT"/>  He was the owner of a 600 acre estate with extensive stables and a mansion, Avery Hill, near to [[Eltham]] in [[Kent]].<ref name="NYT2"/>  North owned several racing horses and won several British racing trophies.<ref name="NYT2"/>  North visited the [[United States]] in July 1889 where he was described as a member of the [[nouveau riche]] and a "Chilean [[Count of Monte Cristo|Monte Cristo]]" because of his recent rise to fame and fortune.<ref name="NYT"/>  He became known as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] North as he was appointed [[Colonel of the Regiment|Honorary Colonel]] of the [[Tower Hamlets Regiment of Volunteer Engineers]] on 25 March 1885.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=25454 |startpage=1315|date=24 March 1885|accessdate=2009-3-3}}</ref>  He regularly allowed the regiment of 250 men to camp in the gardens of his estate for three days at a time.  During this time he would hold festivals for the men and the local villagers and at one of these events he challenged the [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] to a footrace and won.<ref name="NYT2"/>

== Decline ==

North was approached by [[King Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]] at a horse racing event to provide funds to establish a [[Concession (territory)|concession company]] to extract rubber from the [[Congo Free State]].<ref name="harms128">{{Harvnb|Harms|1983|p=128}}.</ref>  North agreed and provided [[Pound sterling|GBP<U+00A3>]]40,000 of the [[Belgian franc|BEF]]250,000 initial investment to set up the [[Anglo-British India Rubber Company]] (ABIR) at [[Antwerp]] on 6 August 1892.<ref name="ewans170">{{Harvnb|Ewans|2002|p=170}}.</ref><ref name="harms78">{{Harvnb|Harms|1975|p=78}}.</ref>  ABIR had exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and had [[police powers]] within the limits of the concession to enforce the collection of rubber as a tax.<ref name="harms78"/>  The company was initially very successful but by 1898, two years after North's death, his heirs had sold his shares in the company.<ref name="harms131">{{Harvnb|Harms|1983|p=131}}.</ref>  The company later became infamous for human rights abuses of the inhabitants of its concession and fell into financial troubles.<ref name="harms83">{{Harvnb|Harms|1975|p=83}}.</ref>

Despite his varied investments across the world North's finances eventually dwindled, his decline was accelerated by the Chilean Civil War.<ref name="rector103"/>  By the time he died on 5 May 1896 his business empire had collapsed.<ref name="telegraph"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=27247 |startpage=7063|date= 16 November 1900|accessdate=2009-3-3}}</ref>  His death occurred within half an hour of eating some [[oyster]]s and the shells were sent for analysis but it was suspected that heart problems were the cause of death.<ref name="NYT2"/>  In his will he donated his house, [[Kirkstall Abbey]], to the city of Leeds and made donations to [[Leeds Infirmary]] and the Yorkshire College of Science, which later became the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name="NYT2"/>
