Garcia was elected to the [[Chicago City Council]] in 1986, and in 1992 became the first [[Mexican-American]] member of the [[Illinois State Senate]].

==Early and personal life==
Garc<U+00ED>a was born in Mexico in the state of [[Durango]].  His father was a farm laborer under the U.S. government's World War II-era [[bracero program]]. Chuy moved to Chicago in 1965 with [[permanent resident]] status to the [[Pilsen]]/[[Little Village]] neighborhood where he still lives. Garcia worked at the Legal Assistance Foundation from 1977 to 1980 as he worked towards a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref name="Fremon 1988">{{cite book |last=Fremon |first=David |title=Chicago Politics, Ward by Ward |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1988 |pages=146<U+2013>151}}</ref> He then became Assistant Director of the [[South Lawndale, Chicago|Little Village]] Neighborhood Housing Service, where he worked until 1984.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> In 2002, he returned to school to earn a Master's from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].

==Political career==

===Chicago City Council===
In 1983, Garc<U+00ED>a was the campaign manager for labor organizer [[Rudy Lozano]], who challenged longtime alderman Frank Stemberk of the 22nd Ward.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> In the February 1983 election, Lozano came 17 votes short of forcing a runoff, which his supporters contended was due to voters with Spanish surnames being purged from the rolls, denying him the votes to force a runoff.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Lozano was murdered in June 1983, shot to death in his home. A reputed gang member was convicted for Lozano's murder, but his supporters still contend that he was assassinated for his labor and political activities.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

In 1984, Garc<U+00ED>a challenged Stemberk for his place as a [[Committeemen and Committeewomen (Cook County, Illinois)|Committeeman]] in the [[Cook County Democratic Party]]. Supporters of Lozano rallied around him and he received the endorsement of Mayor [[Harold Washington]].<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Stemberk was a supporter of alderman [[Edward Vrdolyak]] of the 10th Ward, who controlled the City Council and opposed Washington's administration. This divide within city government was dubbed the "[[Council Wars]]" by the Chicago media. With Lozano supporters taking to the race with a "religious fervour" and Washington campaigning heavily on Garc<U+00ED>a's behalf, he defeated Stemberk by 2,811 votes (40.62%) to 2,752 (39.77%), with activist and former labor union leader August Sallas taking 1,357 (19.61%).<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Unlike other committeemen and women, Garc<U+00ED>a used his office to provide constituent services, which helped him maintain his high profile.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Garc<U+00ED>a was also appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Water by Washington, a post he held from 1984 to 1986.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

Meanwhile, Washington's allies had sued the city in federal court, claiming that the ward map drawn up after the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] had unfairly dispersed black and Hispanic voters. At that time, whites were about 40% of the city's population, blacks were also about 40%, and Hispanics were about 15%, but there were 33 white aldermen, only 16 blacks and just 1 Hispanic. In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, judge [[Charles Ronald Norgle, Sr.]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] ordered a special election for March 18, 1986 in seven wards, including the 22nd.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> The special elections gave Washington the opportunity to wrest control of the city council from Vrdolyak.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Stemberk chose not to run for re-election and Garc<U+00ED>a declared his candidacy.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> In the nonpartisan election, Garc<U+00ED>a faced supermarket owner and Stemberk ally Guadalupe Martinez and beauty supply store owner Fred Yanez.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Yanez emphasised his military service and Martinez called Garc<U+00ED>a "100 percent Communist" and criticised him for selling garbage cans, which Martinez gave away for free.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> The result was not close, Garc<U+00ED>a winning by 3,293 votes (54.58%) to Martinez' 2,013 (33.37%) and Yanez' 727 (12.05%),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=512119|title=Chicago Ward 22 - Special Election 1986|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> carrying 26 of the 27 precincts.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Garc<U+00ED>a was also re-elected Committeeman with 53.98% of the vote, carrying 24 of the 27 precincts.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> His election and the victory of two other Washington supporters meant that Vrdolyak's supporters had a one-seat majority. Six weeks later, Washington ally [[Luis Guti<U+00E9>rrez]] won a runoff in the 26th Ward and the council was thus evenly split between Washington and Vrdolyak supporters. Washington had the ability to cast tie-breaking votes, Vrdolyak was stripped of his powers and the Council Wars ended.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

Garc<U+00ED>a was re-elected with 3,998 votes (53.59%) in 1987<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=512112|title=Chicago Ward 22 1987|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and with 2,707 votes (52.36%) in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-28/news/9101190283_1_primary-elections-election-tables-james-e-williams|title=Aldermanic Results|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=February 28, 1991|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> On the council, he served on the Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, Municipal Code Revision and Ethics; Economic Development; Education; Finance; License; Ports, Wharves, and Bridges; Streets and Alleys; Traffic Control and Safety committees and chaired the Aviation committee.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

===Illinois Senate===
In 1992, Garc<U+00ED>a ran for the [[Illinois Senate]], winning the Democratic primary with 8,604 votes (52.06%) to Donald C. Smith's 6,159 (37.26%) and Gilbert G. Jimenez's 1,765 (10.68%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368711|title=IL State Senate 01-D Primary 1992|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> The primary was [[tantamount to election]] in the heavily Democratic 1st District and in the general election, he defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee Esequiel "Zeke" Iracheta by 21,314 votes (81.74%) to 4,762 (18.26%). He succeeded Democratic State Senator Howard W. "Howie" Carroll, who was redistricted to the 8th District, and became the first State Senator of Mexican descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368710|title=IL State Senate 01 1992|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Garc<U+00ED>a resigned from the City Council and was succeeded by his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[Ricardo Mu<U+00F1>oz]].

In the 1996 Democratic primary, he was challenged by Alderman Juan Soliz of the 25th Ward. Soliz, who had also been elected in the March 1986 special elections, had been supported by Vrdolyak, earning him the ire of Chicago Hispanics. When Soliz was elected, he called for unity among Hispanic aldermen, a plea which they ignored.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Soliz and Garc<U+00ED>a even celebrated their inaugurations by hiring separate [[Mariachi]] bands to play outside the council chambers.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> After Soliz was replaced as Chairman of the Aviation Committee by Garc<U+00ED>a, he derided it as a "racist move", though they were both Mexican-Americans.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Garc<U+00ED>a defeated Soliz by 6,839 votes (59.34%) to 4,686 (40.66%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368709|title=IL State Senate 01-D Primary 1996|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Garc<U+00ED>a was re-elected unopposed in the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368708|title=IL State Senate 01 1996|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

In office, Garc<U+00ED>a helped shepherd "immigrant-friendly" health care and education reforms through the legislature.<ref name=beating/>

Garc<U+00ED>a was defeated in the 1998 Democratic primary election by [[Antonio Munoz (politician)|Antonio Munoz]], who was backed by the [[Hispanic Democratic Organization]], Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]]'s campaign group and [[political machine]]. Munoz defeated Garc<U+00ED>a by 6,924 votes (53.72%) to 5,964 (46.28%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368707|title=IL State Senate 01-D Primary 1998|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Alderman [[Ricardo Mu<U+00F1>oz]] (no relation to Antonio Munoz), talking in 2010 about his mentor's defeat, said: "Part of the rationale that I think Chuy lost in '98 was that we got sloppy and they [Munoz and the HDO] got lucky. It rained all day, and we didn't have raincoats for our guys until 11 o'clock. By that time, they were frozen stiff. So we lost the field game."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/HDO-Theyre-still-out-there-90356154.html|title=HDO: "They're Still Out There"|work=NBC Chicago|author=Edward McClelland|date=April 9, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

===Political interregnum===
After his defeat, Garc<U+00ED>a left office in January 1999, founded and became Executive Director of the Little Village Community Development Corporation. He helped grow what is now known as Enlace to 27 full-time employees, 120 part-time employees and an annual budget of $5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cct.org/content/enlace-chicago|title=Enlace Chicago|work=The Chicago Community Trust|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> In June 2005, he helped found the Latino Action Research Network, a PAC to help better represent the city's Latino population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensatoledo.com/Stories/2005/June%2022%202005/Chuy%20Garcia%20helps%20form%20new%20Latino%20PAC.htm|title=Chuy Garc<U+00ED>a helps form new Latino PAC|work=La Prensa|date=June 2005|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

On Mother's Day 2001, Garcia and members of the group demanded construction of a high school promised to the community, but unfunded. 14 parents and grandparents organized a hunger strike. While Paul Vallas, the CEO of [[Chicago Public Schools]], initially refused to meet with the hunger strikers, by the end of the first week, he visited their tent to negotiate terms.<ref name="Friedman">{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Joanie|title=Contested Space|url=http://areachicago.org/contested-space/|work=Critical Planning|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> The hunger strike lasted 19 days and increased public pressure on the school district to fund the project. In August 2001, the newly appointed CEO of Chicago Public Schools, [[Arne Duncan]], reallocated funds to begin construction on the school.<ref name="Friedman"/> Community members continued to advocate for participation in designing the new school, and door-to-door parent surveys contributed to the curricular focus of each school on the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvlhs.org/our_campus.jsp|title=Little Village Lawndale High School Campus|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>

===Cook County Board of Commissioners===
In 2010, Garc<U+00ED>a ran for the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]], challenging 7th District member and HDO candidate [[Joseph Mario Moreno]] in the Democratic primary. Garc<U+00ED>a defeated him by 9,602 votes (54.74%) to 7,939 (45.26%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624097|title=Cook County Commissioner 07 - D Primary 2010|work=OurCampaigns|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> In the general election, he faced [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominee Paloma M.

Garc<U+00ED>a was re-elected unopposed to a second term on the Board of Commissioners in the 2014 elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/elections/2014elections/Pages/110414Candidates.aspx|title=Candidates - November 04, 2014 Gubernatorial General Election|work=Cook County Clerk|author=David Orr|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

===2015 mayoral election===
