==History==
===Beginnings and ''Half Hour of Power'' (1996-2000)===
[[Image:DeryckWhibley.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Deryck Whibley during a show]]
They formed on July 31, 1996 or 41 days into the summer, which is the origin of their name. The band was originally a [[NOFX]] cover band and named Kaspir, and changed their name to Sum 41 for a [[Supernova (band)|Supernova]] show on September 28, 1996.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Answers.com Topic: Sum 41 | date= | publisher=Answers.com | url =http://www.answers.com/topic/sum-41 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Artists- Sum 41 | date= | publisher=100xr.com | url =http://www.100xr.com/100_XR/Artists/S/Sum_41.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>

In 1998 the band recorded a [[1998 demo tape|demo tape]] on cassette which they sent to various record companies in the hope of getting a recording contract. These [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] are rare and are the only recordings known with the original bassist [[Twitch (musician)|Richard "Twitch" Roy]].

The band carried a video camera with them to film their crazy antics including robbing a pizza place with water guns and performing a dance to "[[Makes No Difference]]" in front of a theater, both of which can be seen on both ''[[Introduction to Destruction]]'' and on the bonus DVD, called ''[[Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's]]'' from ''[[Does This Look Infected?]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Cross Your T's and Gouge Your I's <U+2014> Youtube | date= | publisher=Youtube | url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrMdPALrxmU | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>

Sum 41 released the EP ''[[Half Hour of Power]]'' on June 27, 2000. The first single released by the band was "[[Makes No Difference]]", which had two different videos. The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the record label and the second showed the band performing at a house party.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Bio | date=2007 | publisher=Vh1.com | url =http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/sum_41/bio.jhtml | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>

Sum 41's first full-length album, ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', was released on May 8, 2001. The first single released was "[[Fat Lip]]", which became a huge hit during the summer, becoming the #1 rock song in the U.S. as well as many other countries around the world.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Billboard.com -Artist Chart History- Sum 41 | date= | publisher=Billboard.com | url =http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=401778&model.vnuAlbumId=476041 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> Two other singles were released, they were: "[[In Too Deep (Sum 41)|In Too Deep]]", which had a comedy video of the band in a diving competition, and "[[Motivation (song)|Motivation]]", a simplistic video of the band playing in a classic garage band theme. The band toured for much of the year, playing 300 shows in 2001, including opening for [[Blink-182]] on tour before returning to the studio to record another album. They took the last week of the tour off; due to September 11th terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite news | first=Darren | last= Davis | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 News on Yahoo! music | date=2001-09-20 | publisher=Yahoo!

On November 26, 2002, Sum 41 released their second full-length album, ''[[Does This Look Infected?]]''. It was accompanied by a DVD with video footage that was not to be sold to those under the legal age. "We don't want to make another record that sounds like the last record," declared Whibley. "I hate when bands repeat albums."<ref>{{cite book | last = Edwards | first = Gavin | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Canadian Teenage Rock and Roll Machine. | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = 2001-10-11 | location = | pages = 50 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> The first single released was "[[Still Waiting (Sum 41 song)|Still Waiting]]". The band followed up the release of "Still Waiting", with "[[The Hell Song]]", a unique video of which had the band using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Pamela Anderson]]. Their next single,"[[Over My Head (Better Off Dead)]]", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on their website, featuring live shots of the band. The video was also on their live DVD, ''[[Sake Bombs And Happy Endings]]'' (2003), as a bonus feature.

===''Chuck'' and the Congo (2004-2006)===
{{rquote|right|One bomb came too close, hit the hotel and the hotel just started shaking. Everyone dove and was lying on the ground. Things were falling off the walls, mirrors were breaking. That's when we all kind of realized that this was really going bad, and we're probably not going to make it out.|Deryck Whibley}}

In late May 2004, the band traveled to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] along with [[War Child (charity)|War Child Canada]], a branch of the British charity organization, to document the [[Second Congo War|civil war]] occurring in the country.<ref name="MTV">{{cite news | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Plan Trip To War-Torn Congo | date=2004-03-22 | publisher= | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485897/03222004/sum_41.jhtml | work =MTV.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> Days after arriving, fighting broke out near the hotel the band was staying at in [[Bukavu]].<ref name="MTV news">{{cite news | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo | coauthors= Adam Hootnick | title=Sum 41 Caught in Violent Outbreak in Congo | date=2004-06-03 | publisher= | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488128/06032004/sum_41.jhtml | work =MTV.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> The band waited for the firing to die down, but it never did. A U.N. peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armored carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety. The band named their next album ''Chuck'' in honor of Pelletier for taking them to safety. The documentary was made into a film called ''ROCKED: Sum 41 in Congo'', and was later aired on [[MTV]]. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada.

Sum 41's album, ''Chuck'', was released on October 12, 2004.  The first single from the album was "[[We're All To Blame]]". The band followed up with "[[Pieces (song)|Pieces]]", a relatively soft song which reached the top of the charts in Canada, and "[[Some Say]]", released as a single only in Canada and Japan. The last single off the record was "[[No Reason]]", released at the same time as "Some Say", but with no video and only in Europe and the USA, where it reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Billboard.com -Artist Chart History- Sum 41 | date= | publisher=Billboard.com | url =http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=401778&model.vnuAlbumId=476041 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>

Sum 41 released a live CD, ''[[Happy Live Surprise]]'', in Japan on December 21, 2005. The CD contains a full concert recorded live from [[London, Ontario]] and was produced by Deryck. The same CD was released March 7, 2006, in Canada under the name ''[[Go Chuck Yourself]]''. This version was released under [[Aquarius Records (record label)|Aquarius Records]] instead of [[EMI]], the band's former label in Canada. The reason for this was the band had an issue with their producer and their management company, [[Greig Nori]] and [[Bunk Rock Music]]; since their management company had a contract with EMI, after the band left the company and dropped the producer, the contract was broken.

===Dave's departure and  ''Underclass Hero'' (2006 - Present)===
[[Image:Stevosingin.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Drummer Steve Jocz singing during the song "Pain for Pleasure"]] 
On, May 11, 2006, [[Dave Baksh]] announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, [[Brown Brigade]]. Baksh's departure from the band was said to have been due to his desire to play music with a more classical metal sound.<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Montgomery | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Guitarist Quits to Focus on New Band | date=2006-05-12 | publisher= | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1531654/05122006/sum_41.jhtml | work =MTV.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>
The very next day, Deryck made the first official comment on the subject in an official message board post addressing Dave's departure.<ref name="official website 2">{{cite news | first=Deryck | last=Whibley | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Board Message | date=2006-05-12 | publisher=Island Records | url =http://www6.islandrecords.com/sum41/www2/bbs/bbs1_7/thread.php?site_num=11&thread_num=14386018&folder_num=23&id=443188337988%20http://www6.islandrecords.com/sum41/www2/bbs/bbs1_7/...read_num=14386018&folder_num=23&id=443188337988 | work =Sum 41 Forums | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> Deryck confirmed Dave's departure and announced that the band would only be replacing Dave with a touring guitarist, who wouldn't be in videos, photo shoots, albums, or have any decision-making power in the band.

Recording of the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Underclass Hero (album)|Underclass Hero]]'', began on November 8, 2006 and was finished on March 14, 2007. The album, backed by the first single and title track, "[[Underclass Hero (song)|Underclass Hero]]", was released on July 24, 2007.

On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on [[iTunes]] called "[[March of the Dogs]]". Although not a single, the band released it early because, according to Deryck, "the record won't be out until the summer." Deryck Whibley was threatened with deportation for the song, because he metaphorically 'kills the president' in it.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41-Whibley Threatened with Deportation | date=2007-07-22 | publisher= | url =http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/whibley%20threatened%20with%20deportation_1038245 | work =Contactmusic.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Deryck Whibley Claims He Was Nearly Deported, Lily Allen Aims at Courtney Love, R.

The music video for the song aired on MTV2 on August 20th. The third and final single was "[[With Me (song)|With Me]]." The video was first seen on the band's MySpace page on February 28, 2008.

The band began touring for the month of October 2007 with fellow Canadians, [[Finger Eleven]] across Canada. [[Die Mannequin]] would  be opening, then Finger Eleven, then Sum 41 would close each show. A press release stated that Deryck Whibley had sustained a [[herniated disk]], causing them to cancel the rest of their shows on the Strength In Numbers Tour with Finger Eleven.<ref>{{cite news | first=Michelle | last=Singerman | coauthors= | title=Deryck Whibley's Weak Back Ends Strength In Numbers Tour Early | date=2007-10-23 | publisher= | url =http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2007/10/2302.cfm | work =chartattack.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>
After Deryck recovered from his injury, the band recommenced the "Underclass Hero" tour in March 2008.

On August 7, 2008, Cone announced in a journal entry on the band's official site that the band currently takes a time off from ''Sum 41'' by doing other things, before they'll start working on the next album. Cone is working on the second album by his side-project [[The Operation M.D.]], Steve will be touring as a drummer for [[The Vandals]] during the summer, and Deryck is currently touring with his wife, [[Avril Lavigne]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.islandrecords.com/site/artist_newsinfo.php?uf_item_id=2-1712623&uf_system_id=0&artist_id=25 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-22 | language = }}</ref>

==Other Projects==
===Internet Videos===
[[Image:ConeMcaslin.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cone during a show]]
Touring in support of ''Chuck'', Sum 41 played videos before their set which were deemed "unsuitable for children". Controversy arose over some of the videos, due to the violent nature of them.<ref name="MTV news 2">{{cite news | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Video Skit Deemed Unsuitable For Children <U+2014> Band Says, 'Good!' | date=2004-11-19 | publisher= | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493978/11192004/sum_41.jhtml | work =MTV.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> They have made several other videos, including ''Basketball Butcher'' and ''1-800-Justice'', which were originally available exclusively on Sum 41's now defunct fan club, the Goon Platoon.

Sum 41's most recent internet video endeavor is a "weekly"<ref>(The band originally stated it was a weekly series; but it was often months between the release of each video.)</ref> series entitled ''SUM 41 - Road to Ruin''. The trailer was posted on January 8, 2007 on the Sum 41 web-page. The first episode debuted on January 21, following their exploits on their Singapore 2003 tour. Since then, their episodes have included footage of drunkenness in New Orleans, setting off a fire alarm in a hotel, and a feature about their first ever tour manager, amongst other things. So far, they have released 9 episodes. They also did a series of cartoons based on superhero 'Stickman moss' who saved the world from anti punk figures, as they put the world of punk rock in danger.

===Side Projects and Collaborations===
Shortly after touring for "Does This Look Infected?", [[Iggy Pop]] recruited the band for his new album, ''[[Skull Ring]]''. Deryck co-wrote the first single from the album, "[[Little Know It All]]", and joined Iggy on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to promote the song. Iggy said he chose Sum 41 because "they have balls."<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Artists Bio | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.melodic.net/artistsOne.asp?artistId=8101 | work =Melodic.net | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> Following their September 11, 2005 show in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], the band went on a touring hiatus, although on April 17, 2006, Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop, joining Iggy on stage for "Little Know It All" and "Lust For Life".

During the band's touring hiatus, Deryck focused on his producing career, writing and producing two songs for [[Avril Lavigne]]'s album, ''[[The Best Damn Thing]]''. Stevo recorded his first video as director for a Canadian band called [[The Midway State]], and Cone started a side project with [[Todd Morse]] of [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and [[Juliette and the Licks]]. The two-person band, named [[The Operation M.D.]], released their debut album, ''[[We Have an Emergency]]'', in early 2007. As well as playing bass, keyboards, and acoustic guitar, Cone contributed backing vocals as well as leading vocals on three songs. The Operation album was co-produced and mixed by Deryck Whibley. Their first single video, "Sayonara", was directed by Stevo.

In December of 2007, Cone did an artist on artist interview with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] of [[Velvet Revolver]]. They talked about Slash's experiences while in [[Guns N' Roses]] and his life now in [[Velvet Revolver]]. This was done as part of a [[MySpace]] project, and the interview was posted on MySpace in 3 parts.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Cone & Slash | date=2007-12-03 | publisher= | url =http://theresnosolution.com/en/index.php?action=fullnews&showcomments=1&id=135 | work =Theresnosolution.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref>

==Music style and influences==
Early influence on their music included the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[NOFX]], especially in their ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'' [[rap rock]] music found in the "[[Fat Lip]]" and "[[What We're All About]]" singles. Their later music in the album ''[[Does This Look Infected?]]'' had heavy influence from [[The Offspring]], as the band itself commented. Also, some metal influence coming from bands like [[Iron Maiden]] is noted.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41: Rolling Stone | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sum41 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | language = }}</ref> In the song "[[Fat Lip]]", the quote "Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised" refers to [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fat Lip Lyrics| date= | publisher= | url =http://www.metrolyrics.com/fat-lip-lyrics-sum-41.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-20 | language = }}</ref> Their album ''[[Chuck (album)|Chuck]]'' features a series of songs that can be compared with [[thrash metal]] or [[Alternative metal]], and they have named [[Metallica]] as one of the main influences on their metal music.

The band's early musical style is often compared to [[Blink-182]] and [[Green Day]], owing to the catchy melodies and humor present in the work of both bands.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Lamb | coauthors= | title=Top 10 Punk Pop Albums | date= | publisher= | url =http://top40.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/punkpop.htm | work =About.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | language = }}</ref> The genre of Sum 41's music has been disputed among fans because of the complex combination of different musical styles and much more mature, serious and heavy sound in later albums. Most fans and critics agree that ''Half Hour of Power'' through ''All Killer No Filler'' was purely pop punk, but ''Does This Look Infected?'' started moving toward a heavier, alternative rock and alternative metal, with ''Chuck'' being mostly alternative metal, and ''Underclass Hero'' a revival of the pop punk/punk rock style.<ref>{{cite news | first=Vik | last=Bansal | coauthors= | title=Sum 41 Album reviews | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.musicomh.com/albums/sum-41.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | language = }}</ref> The argument is centralized around the [[punk rock|punk]] streak of the band, and they have been labeled as [[pop punk]], [[punk rock]], [[alternative rock]], and [[alternative metal]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Sum 41: Underclass Hero (2007) Review | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/sum41/underclasshero | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Mikael | last=Wood | coauthors= | title=Underclass Hero: Music Review | date=2007-07-20 | publisher= | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047311,00.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Johnny | last=Loftus | coauthors= | title=Allmusic: Sum 41 Overview | date= | publisher= | url =http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fzfuxqrkldhe | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | language = }}</ref> The band is known for its often politically-social music found in songs like "[[Fat Lip]]", "[[Over My Head (Better Off Dead)]]", "[[Still Waiting (Sum 41 song)|Still Waiting]]", "[[No Reason]]", "[[We're All To Blame]]", and "[[March of the Dogs]]".<ref>{{cite news | first=Christian | last=Hoard | coauthors= | title=Underclass Hero Review | date=2007-8-23 | publisher= | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sum41/albums/album/15502568/review/15807523/underclass_hero | work =Rolling Stone | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | language = }}</ref>
