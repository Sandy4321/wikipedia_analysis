'''''Songs of Experience''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American composer and producer [[David Axelrod (musician)|David Axelrod]], released in October 1969 by [[Capitol Records]]. It was composed, arranged, and produced by Axelrod, who worked with session musicians such as guitarist [[Al Casey (rock & roll guitarist)|Al Casey]], drummer [[Earl Palmer]], and conductor [[Don Randi]]. As with his 1968 debut album ''[[Song of Innocence]]'', Axelrod composed musical interpretations of English poet [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', an 18th-century illustrated collection of poems.

A [[jazz fusion]] album, ''Songs of Experience'' explores darker sounds than its predecessor, as the poems Axelrod drew on for inspiration dealt with the darker side of humanity. Its music was partly inspired by composer [[Gunther Schuller]]'s [[Third Stream]] concept. Axelrod composed [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestrations with [[rock music|rock]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music]] elements.

''Songs of Experience'' received retrospective acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]], who found Axelrod's compositions musically varied and innovative. Contemporary musicians praised it as a source for [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop production]]. In 2000, the album was reissued by [[EMI]].

A [[jazz fusion]] album,<ref name="Cotner">{{cite journal|last=Cotner|first=David|year=2006|title=David Cotner scopes out 7" records, 3" CDs and other odds & ends|journal=Signal to Noise|location=Burlington|issue=41|page=53}}</ref> ''Songs of Experience'' was partly inspired by [[Gunther Schuller]]'s [[Third Stream]] concept, which fused American [[jazz]] with European [[classical music]]. Axelrod supported his [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestrations on the album with rhythms and melodies from [[rock music|rock]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[pop music]].<ref name="Murph"/> The album's [[suite (music)|suite]] is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than ''Song of Innocence''. Its [[symphony]] is embellished with percussive sounds, [[British folk music|British]] and [[Irish folk song]] elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger [[Gerald Wilson]].<ref name="Jurek"/>

With ''Songs of Experience'', Axelrod explored darker sounds,<ref name="Jurek"/> as the poems he had chosen dealt with the darker side of humanity.<ref name="Sonksen"/> For "The Human Abstract", he used ascending piano, bass, and percussion instruments to evoke the ghost described in Blake's poem.<ref name="Sonksen"/> It is a bass-driven, funky song that juxtaposes [[augmented seventh]]s strummed on an electric guitar against an acoustic piano and muted horns.<ref name="Jurek"/> According to music critic Thom Jurek, "The Divine Image" and "A Little Girl Lost" elicit feelings of majesty and "pastoral sadness", respectively.<ref name="Jurek"/> "London" was recorded by Axelrod as a [[tone poem]] to reflect Blake's opening stanza about the spiritual climate of London at the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]: "I wander thro' each charted'd street / Near where the chart'd [[River Thames|Thames]] does flow / And mark in every face I meet / Marks of weakness, marks of woe."<ref name="Sonksen"/>

''Songs of Experience'' was released in October 1969 by [[Capitol Records]] on [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] [[LP record|LP]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schwann|first=William|journal=[[Schwann catalog|Schwann Monthly Guide to Stereo Records]]|year=1970|volume=22|issue=1<U+2013>3|location=Cambridge|quote=Songs of Experience (10-69) Cap. SKAO-338}}</ref> In a retrospective review, [[AllMusic]]'s Thom Jurek gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and said that Axelrod "succeeded in spades" in his search for a sound that "best exemplified not only his feelings but also the heady text he sought to sonically illustrate." Jurek felt that his compositions were diverse, lush, and able to resemble literature by "using as much space as they do sound for dramatic and dynamic effect", and that Axelrod created original palettes for rock instrumentation through his complex use of the horn section's "various colors".<ref name="Jurek"/> Lynell George of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a "prescient, genre-defying" solo project,<ref>{{cite news|last=George|first=Lynell|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/03/magazine/tm-axelrod22|title=Replay|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EV6CauCo|archivedate=February 17, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> and ''[[NME]]'' viewed it as a "landmark" album.<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 17, 2000|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/david-axelrod/2269|title=Songs of Innocence/ Songs of Experience|journal=[[NME]]|location=London|accessdate=February 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ETWfWxMM|archivedate=February 16, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' cited the album, along with ''Song of Innocence'', as Axelrod's artistic peak and particularly praised "The Human Abstract" as "beautiful and blank", evoking "the view from [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]'s castle of an endless pale blue sky and the vast deathly city beneath it."<ref name="Mojo">{{cite journal|title=Reissues|journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|location=London|issue=146|page=136|date=January 2006}}</ref> ''Songs of Experience'' was [[reissue]]d on [[Compact Disc|CD]] in 2000 by [[EMI]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=High Fidelity News and Record Review|page=93|title=Rock Reissues|location=London|last=Kessler|first=Ken|issue=7<U+2013>12|volume=45}}</ref>

== Influence ==
Songs from the album have been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] frequently by hip hop producers and artists, including [[Black Moon (group)|Black Moon]], who sampled "A Divine Image", and [[DJ Shadow]], who sampled the luminous piano line from "The Human Abstract" on his 1996 song "[[Midnight in a Perfect World]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=September 15, 2005|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/392-the-edge-david-axelrod-at-capitol-1966-1970/|title=David Axelrod: The Edge: David Axelrod At Capitol 1966<U+2013>1970|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=February 22, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EcEgHXol|archivedate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> English hip hop producer Metabeats called ''Songs of Experience'' one of his favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for ''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'': "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself <U+2013> the quality is amazing."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Douieb|first=Corin|page=40|title=My Melody|journal=[[Hip Hop Connection]]|location=London|date=December 2007|issue=219}}</ref> American musician [[John McEntire]] ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=USoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=April 15, 2013|page=5|issue=122|year=2004|location=New York|title=5 Spot|journal=[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]|issn=1074-6978}}</ref> In a 2000 interview for ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', rapper and producer [[Mike Ladd]] viewed the song "London" as "crazy stuff" that deviates from the one-dimensional rhythm [[loop (music)|loops]] of contemporary [[hip hop production]] and stated, "This is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I should listen to [Axelrod]. This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|location=London|page=24|title=Oral Pleasure|last=Shapiro|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Shapiro (journalist)|volume=197|year=2000}}</ref>
