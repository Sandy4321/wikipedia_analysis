The '''Vallejo Gantner Hut''' is located at Macalister Springs near [[Mount Howitt]]. The hut was built in 1971 as a memorial following the death of a young man called Vallejo Gantner.

Vallejo Gantner was born in America and moved with his family to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] at the age of 12.  He was a student at [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and was involved in outdoor activities throughout his student life.  His life was tragically cut short at the age of 19 when his rifle accidentally discharged when he attempted to cross a wire fence while hunting rabbits. 

His mother Neilma Gantner asked the Victorian State Government permission to construct the hut as a memorial to her son.  The hut was built with considerable difficulty due to poor access and adverse weather conditions over a two year period from 1970-1971 with the help of students from [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and Box Hill High School.

The hut is an unusual design composed of many [[triangles]] that readily sheds snow in Winter.

The hut is a popular destination for [[bushwalkers]] in Summer and for [[cross country skiing|cross country skiers]] in Winter and is known colloquially as 'Gantner's'.

A relatively recent addition to the site was the construction of a naturally composting pit toilet with a magnificent view across the tops of nearby snowgums and vallies.
