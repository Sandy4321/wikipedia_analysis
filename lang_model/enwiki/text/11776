'''Ni<U+0161>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041D><U+0438><U+0448>, {{IPA-sh|ni<U+02D0><U+0283>|pron|Nish.ogg}}) is the largest city in southern [[Serbia]] and the third-largest city in the country (after [[Belgrade]] and [[Novi Sad]]). According to the data from May 2009, Ni<U+0161> has 253,077 inhabitants. The city covers an area of about 597 square kilometres, including the urban area, the [[Ni<U+0161>ka Banja]] spa and 68 suburbs. Ni<U+0161> is the administrative center of the [[Ni<U+0161>ava District]].

It is one of the oldest cities in the Balkans, and has from ancient times been considered a gateway between the [[Eastern world|East]] and the [[Western world|West]].<ref>http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20070515-082637-6667r</ref> The [[Paleo-Balkan]] [[Thracians]] were formed in the [[Iron Age]], of which the [[Triballians]] dwelled in this region with a [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Celtic invasion]] in 279 BC that resulted in the forming of the [[Scordisci]] tribe. Naissus was among the cities taken in the Roman conquest in 75 BC. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' in the 1st century, with Naissus being one of the key towns. Ni<U+0161> is also notable as the birthplace of [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian [[Roman Emperor]] and the founder of [[Constantinople]],<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04295c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Constantine the Great<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as well as two other Roman emperors, [[Constantius III]] and [[Justin I]]. It is home to one of Serbia's oldest [[Christian church]]es dating to the 4th century in the suburb of [[Mediana]].

There are about 30,000 university students at the [[University of Ni<U+0161>]], which comprises 13 faculties. Ni<U+0161> is also one of the most important industrial centres in Serbia, a center of electronics industry (see [[Elektronska Industrija Ni<U+0161>]]), industry of mechanical engineering, textile industry and tobacco industry. [[Ni<U+0161> Constantine the Great Airport]] is its international airport. In 2013 the city will host the [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical Assembly of Christian Churches]], in honour to 1700 years of Constantine<U+00B4>s [[Edict of Milan]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=50174 |title=Moderate Patriarch Sets New Course for Serb Church| publisher= IPS News| date=2010-02-01}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Nis stone mallet.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Stone mallet found in [[Ni<U+0161>ava River]]]]

===Etymology===
The city's early name under the [[Roman Empire]] remained '''Naissus''', which is the [[Latin language|Latin]] name derived from its original name '''Naissos'''.

The etymology of the original name Naissos ("city of the nymphs") was derived from a mythical creature of [[Greek mythology]] - [[Naiad]] (from the Greek <U+03BD><U+03AC><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>, "to flow," and <U+03BD><U+1F03><U+03BC><U+03B1>, "running water") which was the nymph of freshwater streams rivers and lakes. Ni<U+0161> is a possible location of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]], a mythical place in Greek mythology where the young god [[Dionysus]] was raised.

'''Navissos''' was the name during the [[Scordisci]] [[Celt]]ic settlement in the 3rd century BC.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415944/Nis Nis,Britanica]</ref>

===Prehistoric and ancient times===

Archaeological evidence shows neolithic settlements in the city and area dating from 5,000 to 2,000 BCE, notable archeological site is [[Humska <U+010C>uka]].<ref>http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002763.html</ref>

The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Thracians]] started in the [[Iron Age]], the [[Triballians|Triballian tribe]] dwelled in this region. 

The [[Scordisci]] tribe was formed after the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans]] in 279 BC.

===Roman times===

At the time of the conquest of the [[Balkans]] by Rome in 168-75 BC, Naissos was used as a base for operations. Naissus was first mentioned in Roman documents near the beginning of 2nd century CE, and was considered a place worthy of note in the ''Geography'' of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy of Alexandria]].

The Romans occupied the town in the period of the "[[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]]n War" (75-73 BC), and set up a legionary camp.<ref name=RB>[http://books.google.com/books?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&pg=PA207 The provincial at Rome: and, Rome and the Balkans 80BC-AD14]</ref> The city (called ''refugia'' and ''vici'' in pre-Roman relation), because of its strategic position (Thracians were based to the south<ref name=RB/>) developed as an important [[garrison]] and market town of the province of [[Moesia|Moesia Superior]].<ref name=BVIII2006>http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/balcanica/Balcanica%20XXXVII%20(2006).pdf</ref>

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' in the early 1st century, with Naissus being one of the key towns. Five roads met at Naissus, from [[Lissus]], [[Serdica]], [[Singidunum]], [[Ratiaria]] and [[Thessalonica]] (through [[Scupi]]).<ref name=RB/>

A tombstone of a Cretan soldier under either [[Claudius]] (41-54) or [[Nero]] (54-68) stands in Naissus, pointing that auxiliary units were stationed here at that time. Legia IIII Scythica and [[VII Claudia]] may have briefly been stationed here. An auxiliary fort was based to the north, at present-day [[Ravna]], called [[Timacum minus]]. [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161<U+2013>180) promoted the city to ''municipia''. Overall, several family tombstones point that this was an important military region and by the 3rd century a social class of peasants and soldiers emerged.<ref name=PUM>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51 Pannonia and Upper Moesia: a history of the middle Danube provinces]</ref> 

Cohort [[I Aurelia Dardanorum]] was based in the city.<ref name=BVIII2006/>

At the latest, a ''praetorium'' (road-station) was established under [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211) for Imperial officials business traveling, administered by ''stratores'' of [[Upper Moesia]].<ref name=PUM/>

In AD 268, during the "[[Crisis of the third century]]" when the Empire almost collapsed, the greatest [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion seen to date came pouring into the Balkans. The Goths' seaborne allies, the [[Heruli]], supplied a fleet, carrying vast armies down the coast of the [[Black Sea]] where they ravaged coastal territories in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. Other huge forces crossed the [[Danube]] in [[Moesia]]. An invasion of Goths into the province of [[Pannonia]] was leading to disaster. In 268, Emperor [[Gallienus]] won some important initial victories at land and sea, but it was his successor [[Claudius II]] who finally defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in 268, one of the bloodiest battles of the 3rd century. Invaders allegedly left thirty to fifty thousand dead on the field.

Four years later in 272, the son of military commander [[Constantius Chlorus]] and an innkeeper's daughter called [[Helena of Constantinople|Flavia Iulia Helena]] was born in Naissus and destined to rule as Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. 

Constantine created the ''Dacia mediterranea'' province of which [[Serdica]] was capital, which also had Naissus and Remesiana of the Via militaris and the towns of Pautalia and Germania. He lived at Naissus in short periods from 316-322.<ref name=PUM/>

Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] (360-363) resided in Naissus briefly in 361, prior to becoming the sole ''Augustus''.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=tScWQpJ6j0kC Julian the Apostate]</ref>

A ''fabricae'' that produced [[ingots]] ([[Gold bars]]) was active in Naissus at the time of [[Theodosius I]] (378-395) as findings with the marking of ''NAISI'' at the order of the Emperor have been found in [[Romania]], dating to 379.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=2ms5CWtIQ5oC&pg=PA50</ref> 

The remains of the 4th century Imperial villa at [[Mediana]] are an important archaeological site located close to Ni<U+0161>. Mosaic floors and other traces of luxury are preserved in the archaeological museum on the site. Other aristocratic suburban villas are clustered nearby.
Here in Mediana, in 364 a.d. emperors Valentinian and Valens divided the Roman empire and ruled as co-emperors.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/gibbon/02/daf02049.htm</ref>

<blockquote>
In the castle, or palace, of Mediana, only three miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire. Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the East, from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia; whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike praefectures of Illyricum, Italy, and Gaul, from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart, and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas.
''(Edward Gibbon, "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" , Vol. 2,Chapter XXV)''
</blockquote>

The 4th century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[basilica]] in Ni<U+0161> is one of the oldest Christian monuments. The Roman Emperor [[Constantius III]] (421) who was the power behind the throne during much of the 410's was born in Naissus.

Though the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] strengthened the walls, the very prosperity of Naissus made it a target and it was destroyed by [[Attila]] in 443. Attila the Hun conquered Naissus with battering rams and rolling towers<U+2014>military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory. After the [[Huns]] captured the city of Naissus they [[wiktionary:massacre|massacred]] the inhabitants of the city. Years later, river banks outside the city were still covered with human bones as a reminder of the devastation the Huns had inflicted. The founder of the [[Justinian Dynasty]], [[Justin I]], was born in Naissus in 450, and his nephew [[Justinian I]] did his best to restore the city, but Naissus never recovered its 4th century urbanity. The Roman fort at Balajnac with a well-preserved cistern produced coins to Justinian I.<ref>http://books.google.se/books?id=mnSq1VNloGsC</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Early Byzantine, Ni<U+0161>.JPG|thumb|Early Byzantine tomb with frescoes, [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Exceptional Importance]]]]
The latter half of the 6th century CE saw the first major [[Human migration|migration]]s of [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]]. During the 6th and 7th century CE, Slavic tribes made eight attempts to take Ni<U+0161>. In 551, the Slavs crossed Ni<U+0161> initially headed for Thessalonica, but ended up in Dalmatia.<ref>BG III 40</ref><ref>http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/delo/13047</ref> During the final attack in 615 CE the invaders took the city, and most of the Roman and Romanized [[Daco-Thracian]] population fled, perished, or became assimilated into the local Serb and Vlach populations.

In the 9th century, the [[Bulgaria]]ns became masters of Naissus, followed by the [[Hungary|Hungarians]] in the 11th century, during which the town's militia fought a successful battle against the [[People's Crusade]] on 3 July 1096. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] reconquered it once more in 1173{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, and towards the end of the 12th century the town was in the hands of the Serbian prince [[Stefan Nemanja|Stephen Nemanja]], who received hospitably the German emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] and his crusaders.

In 1375, the [[Ottoman Turks]] captured Naissus for the first time from the Serbians. After a 25-day long siege, the city fell to the Turks. The fall of the Serbian state decided the fate of Ni<U+0161> as well. After the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, even though Serbia existed much weakened as a semi-independent state for another 70 years, the Constantinople-Vienna road grew deserted.

In 1443, Ni<U+0161> fell into the hands of Ludanjin. The town itself was given back to the Serbs, while Brankovi<U+0107> gave it over to <U+0110>or<U+0111>e Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>. In the so-called Long Campaign, [[Christian]] armies, led by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] military leader [[Janos Hunyadi]] (known as Sibinjanin Janko in Serbian folk poetry) together with Serbian Despot [[<U+0110>ura<U+0111> Brankovi<U+0107>]], defeated the Turks and repelled them to Sofia. An important [[Battle of Nish|battle]] was fought near Ni<U+0161>, which remained a free city for a whole year after that. It was during this battle that an Ottoman commander named [[Skanderbeg|Gjerg Kastrioti]], aka Skanderbeg, deserted the Ottoman ranks with a strong following. Escaping to [[Albania]], he mounted a semi-successful [[guerilla war]] against the Ottomans that lasted his remaining lifetime.

===Early Modern and Modern periods===
[[Image:Tvrdjava grad nis.jpg|290px|thumb|left| [[Ni<U+0161> Fortress]] ]]
Ni<U+0161> succumbed to Turkish rule again in 1448 and remained thus for the following 245 years. In the period of Turkish rule, Ni<U+0161> was one of the seats of Turkish military and civil administration. [[Ni<U+0161> Fortress]], built in that period, still represents one of the most beautiful and best preserved edifices in the Balkans. <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tvrdjava1.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The Ni<U+0161> Fortress|{{puic|1=Image:Tvrdjava1.jpg|log=2008 March 10}}]] -->
The extant fortification is of Turkish origin, dating from the first decades of the 18th century (1719<U+2013>1723). It is well-known as one of the most significant and best preserved monuments of this kind in the Mid-Balkans. The Fortress was erected on the site of earlier [[fortifications]] - the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and later yet Medieval forts. The Fortress has a polygonal ground plan, eight bastion terraces and four massive gates. It stretches over 22 ha of land. The rampart walls are 2,100 m long, 8 m high and 3 m thick on the average. The building stone, brought from the nearby quarries, was hewn into rather evenly-shaped blocks. The inside of the rampart wall was additionally fortified by a wooden construction, 'santra<U+010D>', and an additional bulwark, 'trpanac'. On the outside, the Fortress was surrounded by a wide moat, whose northern part has been preserved to our days. Beside the massive stone rampart walls, the southern Stambol [[gate]] and the western Belgrade gate are pretty well preserved. Partly preserved are the water gates, while the northern [[Vidin]] gate and the south-east [[Jagodina]] gate are preserved only in remains. With a complete reconstruction of all the gates, Ni<U+0161> Fortress would once again become, architecturally and functionally, a closed fortification system. In 1737, Ni<U+0161> was seized by the [[Austria]]n army, in their [[Military campaign|campaign]] against the Turks. The war ended in 1739.

[[Image:nis-at-night.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Liberators monument, by [http://www.juznevesti.com Ju<U+017E>ne vesti]]]
At the beginning of the 19th century the crucial thing for the renewal of the Serbian state was the liberation of Ni<U+0161> from the Turks. The Serbian leader [[Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>e]], in his talks with the representatives of Russia, as well as in his talks with [[Napoleon]] and the Turks, pointed out that Ni<U+0161> had to belong to Serbia. The Serbian insurrection army headed towards Ni<U+0161> in order to take it and go ahead towards Old Serbia and Kosovo. Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>e's suggestion was to use the whole army to liberate Ni<U+0161>, while the rest of the commanders demanded to attack Ni<U+0161> from four different points. The latter was accepted. On April 27, 1809, the Serbian insurrection army with its 16,000 soldiers approached the villages of Kamenica, Gornji and Donji Matejevac, near the town of Ni<U+0161> with [[Miloje Petrovi<U+0107>]] as Commander-in-chief. The Serbian soldiers made six trenches. The first and biggest was on <U+010C>egar Hill with [[voivoda]] [[Stevan Sin<U+0111>eli<U+0107>]] at the head. The second one was in the village Gornji Matejevac (near the newly rebuilt [[Latin Church]]) with [[Petar Dobrnjac]] as the commander. The third trench was north-east to Kamenica, with voivoda Ilija Barjaktarevi<U+0107>. The fourth trench was in Kamenica with Miloje Petrovi<U+0107> as the chief commander. The fifth trench was in the mountain above Kamenica and under the control of voivoda Pauljo Mateji<U+0107>, while the sixth one was made in Donji Matejevac. Miloje Petrovi<U+0107>'s request to attack Ni<U+0161> directly was not accepted. The demand was to wait and to [[besiege]] the town.

[[Image:Chele-kula.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Outer wall of [[Skull Tower]]]]
Meanwhile, the Turkish army was reinforced with 20,000 soldiers from [[Adrianople]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Vranje]] and [[Leskovac]]. The Turks attacked the trench of [[Petar Dobrnjac]] on 30 May The following day, on May 31, 1809, the most prominent trench on <U+010C>egar Hill, under the command of Stevan Sin<U+0111>eli<U+0107>, was attacked. The battle lasted all day. As Milovan Kuki<U+0107> witnessed, "the Turks attacked five times, and the Serbs managed to repulse them five times. Each time their losses were great. Some of the Turks attacked, and some of them went ahead, and thus when they attacked for the sixth time they filled the trenches with their dead so that the alive went over their dead bodies and they began to fight against the Serbs with their rifles, cutting and sticking in their enemies with their sabers and knives. The Serbian soldiers from other trenches cried out to help Stevan. But there was no help," as Milovan Kuki<U+0107> said, "either because they could not help without their cavalry, or because Miloje Petrovi<U+0107> did not allow it.

When [[Stevan Sin<U+0111>eli<U+0107>]] saw that the Turks had taken over the trench, he ran to the powder cave, took out his gun and fired at the powder magazine. The explosion was so strong that all the surrounding was shaken, and the whole trench caught in a cloud of dense smoke. Stevan Sin<U+0111>eli<U+0107>, who up to that moment had reached everywhere, helping and encouraging everybody, went into the air." Three thousand Serbian soldiers and more than twice as many on the Turkish side were killed on <U+010C>egar Hill. An important monument from early 19th century Serbian uprisings against Turkish reign is the [[Skull Tower]] (<U+0106>ele kula), a tower which incorporates human skulls (those of dead Serbian "rebels") in its construction, a monument likely unique in its design.

The city was incorporated in Serbia as a consequence of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. Following the rout of the Serbian army by the Austrians, Bulgarians and Germans in [[World War I]], King [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] entertained the German [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] at Ni<U+0161> in January 1916. The Kaiser was greeted by the following dubious mock-Roman salutation: ''Ave Imperator, Caesar et Rex. Victor et gloriosus es. Nissa antiqua omnis Orientis populi te salutant redemptorem, ferentem oppressis prosperitatem atque salutem,'' which translates as: "Hail Emperor, Caesar and King: You are victor and glorious. In ancient Ni<U+0161> all the peoples of the east salute you, bringer of prosperity to the oppressed."

During the time of German occupation in [[World War II]], the first Nazi [[concentration camp]] in Yugoslavia was located near Ni<U+0161>. In 1942 an armed revolt led to an escape. The escapees were [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] from [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s movement who was captured by German forces during the [[Battle of Kozara]]. This escape is featured in Miomir Stamenkovi<U+0107>'s film ''[[Lager Ni<U+0161>]],'' 1987. The city was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1944 along with other cities in [[Nedi<U+0107>'s Serbia|Axis Serbia]].<ref>[http://www.danas.rs/20040417/vikend3.html Serbs were not specially chosen as targets], [[Danas]]</ref> In 1996, Ni<U+0161> was the first city in Serbia to stand against the government of [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]]. A coalition of democratic opposition parties called Zajedno (Together) won the local elections in Ni<U+0161> in 1996. The first democratic mayor of City of Ni<U+0161> was [[Zoran <U+017D>ivkovi<U+0107> (politician)|Zoran <U+017D>ivkovi<U+0107>]], who later became the Prime Minister of [[Serbia]] in 2003. On May 7, 1999 it was the site of the [[NATO]] [[Cluster bombing of Ni<U+0161>]] that resulted in many civilian casualties and no military losses. During the local elections held in September 2004, Smiljko Kostic of Nova Srbija won the mayor office. The democratic party provoked referendum to recall Kostic in November 2005. The majority voted against recall. In the local elections held in May 2008, the Democratic Party, G17+ and coalition assembled around the Socialist Party of Serbia won and Milos Simonovic from the Democratic party became elected mayor.

==Economy==
The city of Ni<U+0161> is the administrative, industrial, commercial, financial and cultural center of the south-eastern part of Republic of Serbia. The position of Ni<U+0161> is strategically important, located at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with [[Asia]]. Ni<U+0161> is easily accessible, having an airport - [[Ni<U+0161> Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. It is in Ni<U+0161> that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:
* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,
* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.

These roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni<U+0161> thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]].

Nis had always been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981 its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu<U+010D>ili<U+0161>na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi<U+0107> | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti<U+0107>}}</ref>
