'''Bryce Lawrence''' (born 23 December 1970)<ref name="Rugby referees from K to Z">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/laws_referees/refs/1080260.htm|title=Rugby referees from K to Z}}</ref> is a professional international [[rugby union]] referee, from the [[Bay of Plenty]], [[New Zealand]]. 
Originally a school headmaster, Bryce took up refereeing in [[1994]], following in footsteps of his father, [[Keith Lawrence]], who was a former international rugby union referee. Making his first class debut in [[1997]]<ref name="Rugby referees from K to Z"/>, Bryce took charge of his first [[Super rugby]] match in [[2005]], controlling a game between the [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]] and [[Chiefs (Super rugby franchise)|Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayofplentytimes.co.nz/localsport/storydisplay.cfm?thesection=localsport&storyid=3626550|title=Bryce ready for first Super Rugby match}}</ref> Some of his more notable matches in charge include the [[2008 Super 14]] [[semi final]] between the [[Waratahs (rugby)|Waratahs]] and the [[Sharks (Super rugby franchise)|Sharks]], the final of the [[2008 Air New Zealand Cup]] and 2 test matches involving [[Australian national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[South African national rugby union team|South Africa]], in the [[2008 Tri Nations]]. The test matches he controlled in the 2008 Tri Nations are of particular significance, as these were his debut Tri Nations matches. Bryce may have only been appointed to these matches because of his experiences in the 2008 Super 14, as it was decided that only [[SANZAR]] international [[referees]] who had refereed under the [[Experimental Law Variations|ELVs]]  being trialled in the 2008 Super 14, should take charge of that years Tri Nations matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2024544.html?cid=rssfeed&att=|title=2008 Tri Nations Appointments}}</ref>

Bryce refereed the 1st [[British & Irish Lions]] V South Africa Test in 2009, was an Assistant Referee in the 2nd test as well as refereeing the Six Nations France V England match in 2010. In all three matches he was widely accused of treating the non-British teams favourably and was criticised in particular by Bryan Moore in his Daily Telegraph column of the 22nd March 2010. He said of him "Of course, any point made in defeat is characterised as a whinge, but those who make that accusation should answer this <U+2013> can they name another elite official whose performance in three successive Test matches, as referee or as an assistant referee, have been a major talking point (the others being the first and second Lions Tests in 2009)?"
