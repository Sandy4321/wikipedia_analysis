''<blockquote>For the 1990s alternative rock group, see [[Veruca Salt (band)]]</blockquote>

'''Veruca Salt''' is a character from the book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', written by [[Roald Dahl]]. She appears in the two film adaptations, ''[[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971), and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005). In the 1971 adaptation, she is portrayed by [[Julie Dawn Cole]]; in the 2005 adaptation, she is portrayed by [[Julia Winter]]. Veruca is the only child of the wealthy couple, Henry Salt and Angina Salt (a geography teacher in the revised book only, and named Henrietta in the 1971 film), and is a terribly [[spoiled brat]].

In all three versions, [[Mr. Salt]], Veruca's father, is the CEO and proprietor of a [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] corporation. When Veruca announces that she wants (and must have) a [[Golden Ticket]], her father buys thousands of [[Wonka Bar]]s and makes his factory workers open them. As three days pass, Veruca spends all of them impatiently kicking her legs about, while she screams about how she wants her Golden Ticket. Finally, a staff member finds the ticket, and, as Veruca's father describes it in the book, she is "all smiles again". 

Veruca Salt represents one of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], [[greed]]. For example, she often begins most of her demands with "Daddy/Mummy, I want..." and when she isn't immediately given what she wants, she follows it up with a vicious "NOW!".

==Veruca in the book and films==
In each version, Veruca is portrayed as a spoiled brat, whose parents treat her as a [[princess]] and give her anything she wants, no matter how ridiculous the price or how outrageous the item is. In the book, she is described as "the daughter of rich parents". When Veruca is unable to get something she wants, she screams, shouts, kicks, stomps, jumps up and down, and takes extreme measures until she has her way. At the start, Veruca's parents seem to view her as a sweet, innocent young lady; however, after being ambushed and dirtied in the factory, these opinions shift more toward reality and they act more like parents than friends. Veruca, in each version, also wears a dress despite fashion coversions over time.

In the 1971 film adaptation, Veruca has slightly curly, brown hair, which comes down to her shoulders. She wears a red dress with black buttons and a white collar folded outward; light-colored tights; and black, heeled shoes. Played by 14-year-old [[Julie Dawn Cole]], she looks much older than she does in the book and other film and is starting to develop a womanly figure. She wanted to be the ''first'' ticket holder, and her father promised that she'd have it the very first day of the contest. Before entering the factory, Veruca wears a mink coat and a mink hat; she also says she has three other mink coats at her home in England. 

Veruca is shown to be demanding, loud, and aggressive, sometimes resorting to threats and (in some cases) physical violence. For example, she refuses to attend school until she gets her ticket, and she shoves, pushes, and hits her father. While she isn't particularly nasty to her mother, Veruca's "target" is her father, since he is easier to coerce. However, in one scene, she is very polite, especially to Mr. Wonka.  She seems to be more concerned for the welfare of others in this version as well, unlike in the book and 2005 film where she seems to not care at all.  She even says to her father after [[Augustus Gloop]] falls into the chocolate river, "How long is he going to stay down daddy?". Also, when [[Violet Beauregarde|Violet]]'s face turns blue and she begins to swell up into a blueberry, her eyes are wide and her mouth is agape.

In the 2005 film adaptation, Veruca is played by 12-year-old [[Julia Winter]], making Veruca herself a preteen. She appears very prim and neat, with brown hair pulled back with two fancy hair clips and styled in oversized [[ringlet (haircut)|ringlet]]s. With her typical mink coat, she wears a pink and white dress with white tights, and black [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]], carrying a little pink purse. She and her parents live in a [[mansion]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]]; surprisingly, it looks more like a [[palace|royal palace]] given its size and shape. Her personality is neither whiny nor aggressive in this version, but rather calm and straight-forward about what she desires. Despite her snooty and arrogant demeanor, she can also be very sweet and charming when she believes it will benefit her. However, while waiting for her ticket, Veruca stomps her foot with great impatience and ''demands'' that she be given what she wants. Only when she is denied something does Veruca completely lose her cool. As in the 1971 movie, Veruca isn't particularly nasty to her mum (though her mum does roll her eyes after her daughter's impatient outburst), and her target is her dad. Also, she is very impatient and disobedient, as shown in various scenes of the film. She also is very ungrateful for the things that she gets or has; when her father hands her the golden ticket that his workers toiled to find for her, she does not say "[[thank you]]". Instead, she tells her father that she wants another pony. On the matter of the things that she already has, she states that all she has at home is one pony, two dogs, four cats, six bunny rabbits, two parakeets, three canaries, a green parrot, a turtle, and a hamster, all of which are earlier gifts from her parents.

- 	Veruca and [[Violet Beauregarde]] pretend to become friends, but each is clearly unimpressed by the other. (The girls who played them, [[AnnaSophia Robb]] and [[Julia Winter]], became friends during filming of the movie. Coincidenly [[Julie Dawn Cole]] and [[Denise Nickerson]] who played the girls in the 1971 movie-although onscreen they disliked each other-actually became good friends). Later, when Scarlett Beauregarde wonders what she'll do with a blueberry for a daughter and how she's supposed to compete, Veruca says "You could put her in a county fair." Due to her relationship with Violet, it is implied that Veruca has no concern for the welfare of the other golden ticket winners, except for Charlie.

- 	While Veruca is portrayed as [[United Kingdom|British]] in the films, her nationality is never mentioned directly in the book (though she uses British words).

==Veruca's punishment==
In the book and 2005 film, Veruca's demise takes place in Wonka's nut-sorting room. After being denied a squirrel by [[Willy Wonka]] and her dad (her mum in the novel), Veruca brazenly attempts to take a squirrel for herself, only to be grabbed and knocked down by the creatures. The squirrels drag her across the ground, deem her a bad nut, and throw her into the garbage chute, with her parents quickly suffering the same fate afterwards. Her fate is similar in the 2005 film, but her mother isn't present (although the Oompa-Loompas throw a painting of Mrs Salt down the garbage chute to emphasize that she, along with her husband, spoiled Veruca rotten). In the film, Wonka says that the furnace is only lit on Tuesday. [[Mike Teavee]] then reminds him that the day of the factory tour ''is'' Tuesday. Fortunately, after Veruca's father falls down the chute, an [[Oompa Loompa]] tells Wonka that the incinerator is broken and there is three weeks' worth of rotten garbage to break the fall of Veruca and her father.   

In the 1971 movie, Veruca's exit is made in the Golden Egg sorting room. Willy Wonka denies her the goose that lays the golden eggs, after which she sings her musical solo "[[I Want It Now]]", describing the things she wants, and how she'll scream if she doesn't get them. (This makes her the only kid in the movie to get her own song, although technically, Charlie did a duet with Grandpa Joe in "(I've Got A) Golden Ticket".) After making a mess of the room, she stands atop the egg-sorting machine, which judges her a bad egg, and falls down the garbage chute. Her last word is "NNNNNOOOOOWWWWW". Willy Wonka explains that the garbage chute leads to the furnace, although she may have gotten stuck in the pipes along the way. Her father quickly jumps in after her. It is not stated what became of her and her dad after this event; after Veruca's father disappears, Willy Wonka says "There's going to be a lot of garbage today", although the day of the factory tour was not one of the days when the furnace was lit. At the end when Charles asks about the other children, Wonka remarks that they will be their normal nasty selves-but maybe a little wiser.

At the end of the book and the 2005 film, Veruca and her father are shown exiting the factory, covered in large amounts of garbage. Veruca remains bratty as ever. In the film, Veruca spots the glass elevator, and says "Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator." Her father then takes a more aggressive stand and sternly states that the only thing she'll get that day is a bath (and that's final), leaving her with an angry expression, returned by her father. Presumably, she won't be as spoiled now that her parents have been punished for not being responsible.

==Veruca's name==
While all the names in ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' are unusual for comic effect (a trend often shown in [[Roald Dahl]]'s children's novels), Veruca Salt probably has the strangest name, as usually only the characters' surnames, such as those of [[Charlie Bucket]] and [[Mike Teavee]], are strange.

The word ''verruca'' is [[Latin]] for "[[plantar wart]]" (This makes sense considering her father owns a nut company; Planter's is a popular nut company) and common in [[British English]]. As [[Willy Wonka]] points out in the novel and in the 2005 movie, a ''[[verruca]]'' is a "wart you get on the bottom of your foot". She is given the surname Salt because nuts are often [[Edible salt|salted]] to improve their taste.

*In the German dubbed version of the movie<!--when did it come out?-->, the play on words does not translate. Instead, Wonka says "I once named a wart on my foot 'Veruca'."

*The band [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] took its name from the character.

*A villainous female werewolf character in the television series ''[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]'' is named Veruca.

*Veruca is phonetically similar to the Arabic word for wig, baruka.

==Veruca Salt song==
This song was performed after Veruca is sent down the garbage chute.

In both the book's poem and the 2005 lyrics, the words are about what will become of Veruca as she falls down the garbage chute, as well as who is to blame for turning Veruca into a spoiled brat. The 1971 lyrics center around who is to blame for Veruca's spoiling, and what can be done to prevent children from being spoiled, a topic also of concern for the end of the lyrics in the book and 2005 movie.

In the book, the song is performed after Veruca and her parents are thrown down the garbage chute. In the 1971 film, it is after Veruca and her father are thrown down. In the 2005 film, the song is performed after Veruca is thrown down and as Mr. Salt prepares to look down into the chute (it ends as a squirrel kicks him in the behind, sending him down the chute).

The 2005 version is sung in a [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]]/[[soft rock]] style.

===Portion of lyrics===
====Book====
:But now, my dears, we think you might
:Be wondering<U+2014>is it really right
:That every single bit of blame
:And all the scolding and the shame
:Should fall upon Veruca Salt?
:Is she the only one at fault?
:For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,
:A girl can't spoil herself, you know.

====1971 film==== 
:Who do you blame when your kid is a brat,
:Pampered and spoiled like a Siamese cat.
:Blaming the kids is a lie and a shame.
:You know exactly who's to blame:
:The mother and the father.

====2005 film====
:Veruca Salt, the little brute,
:Has just gone down the garbage chute,
:And she will meet, as she descends,
:A rather different set of friends!
:A rather different set of friends!
:A rather different set of friends!

==Trivia==
*A [[continuity error]] in the 1971 movie is in the scene in which Veruca opens the candy pumpkin and dips her hand in the chocolate sauce. A few seconds later, her hand is clean.
*Veruca's mink coat in the 1971 film was made of real mink fur. The mink coat that she wore in the 2005 film was made of fake fur.
*In the video game, two levels have Veruca in them: The Nut Room and The Garbage Chute.
*In the [[2006]] edition of [[Big Brother (UK)|''Big Brother'' UK]], a contestant enters the Big Brother House with a similar name, [[Suzie Verrico]], after her husband has bought 60 crates of [[KitKat]]s and spent <U+00A3>4,000 to get the [[Golden Ticket]] that brought this contestant into the show.
*The band [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] is named after the character.
