'''''Road to Perdition''''' is a [[2002 in film|2002]] [[period piece|period]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Sam Mendes]].  The film is based on the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'', written by [[Max Allan Collins]] and illustrated by [[Richard Piers Rayner]], and takes place during the [[Great Depression]]. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Jude Law]], and [[Tyler Hoechlin]].  Hanks stars as an enforcer who is forced to flee with his son from the crime syndicate for whom he had worked, and to ensure that his son does not become like him.

Filming took place in Chicago, in the [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman neighborhood]].  Director Sam Mendes, having recently finished 1999's acclaimed ''[[American Beauty (film)|American Beauty]]'', pursued a film that had minimal dialogue and conveyed emotion in the imagery.  A "cold look" was created for the locations in ''Road to Perdition'' to emphasize the characters' emotional states.  Cinematographer [[Conrad L. Hall]] took advantage of the lighting and the environment to create symbolism for the film, for which he won several awards.  ''Road to Perdition'' explored the themes of violence's consequences and the relationship between father and son.

''Road to Perdition'' was released on [[July 12]], [[2002]], and received highly positive reviews.  ''Road to Perdition'''s cinematography, setting, and the performances of Paul Newman and Tom Hanks were well-received, though the film was criticized for not creating a strong emotional attachment to its audience.

==Plot==
Michael Sullivan, Sr. is an enforcer to John Rooney, an [[Irish American]] [[organized crime]] boss in Illinois during the Great Depression.  Sullivan, who was orphaned as a child and subsequently raised by Rooney, has worked for the crime boss most of his life.  Sullivan and Rooney's son, Connor, are sent by Rooney to dispatch Finn McGovern, an employee.  Sullivan's son, twelve-year-old Michael Sullivan, Jr., follows the enforcers and witnesses them murder McGovern.  The boy is caught by the enforcers, and the father swears his son to secrecy.  Connor, to preserve the secret, attempts to have Sullivan assassinated and personally murders Sullivan's wife Annie and younger son Peter.  Sullivan and his son Michael escape the attempt on their lives and flee to Chicago.

Sullivan requests assistance from [[Al Capone]]'s crime syndicate to seek revenge, but when he is rejected, Sullivan and his son plan a string of robberies to steal the syndicate's laundered money.  Sullivan hopes to coerce Capone into giving up Connor for the money, but Capone instead dispatches assassin Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan and his son.  Maguire finds Sullivan seeking assistance from Rooney's accountant, Alexander Rance, at a hotel, and assassinates the accountant.  Maguire is injured in the confrontation, but he manages to wound Sullivan with a gunshot.  Sullivan's son takes his father to a farm where a childless and elderly couple helps the former enforcer recover.  During his recuperation, Sullivan finds in ledgers taken from Rance that Connor had embezzled money from his father under the names of gang members that he had murdered.

When Sullivan recovers, he secretly meets with John Rooney during Mass and shares his discovery about Connor.  Rooney refuses to let his son be harmed.  Sullivan is forced to hunt down and kill members of Rooney's gang, including John Rooney himself.  With the crime boss dead, Capone finds no reason to protect Connor anymore, and Capone's lieutenant Frank Nitti gives Sullivan a tip to track Connor down and kill him.  Apparently free from pursuit, Sullivan and his son make their way to the town of Perdition, Kansas.  A disfigured Maguire tracks the Sullivans down to the summer house of Annie Sullivan's sister.  Maguire shoots Sullivan from behind, and the assassin finds himself held at gunpoint by Sullivan's son.  Maguire approaches the son as Sullivan discourages his son from firing to have blood on his hands.  Sullivan is able to shoot Maguire from behind instead, and Sullivan dies in his son's arms.  The son mourns his father's death and finds his way to the elderly couple that had helped him and his father, growing up with them.

==Cast and characters==
[[Image:Rooney and Sullivan.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Rooney ([[Paul Newman]]) and Sullivan ([[Tom Hanks]]) have a surrogate father-son relationship as part of the film's father-son theme<ref name="fathers" />]]
*'''[[Tom Hanks]]''' as '''Michael Sullivan, Sr.''': A hitman who works for John Rooney.  Hanks was sent a copy of the graphic novel ''Road to Perdition'' by Spielberg while he was filming ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000). Initially too busy to make sense of the story, he later received the David Self's adapted screenplay, to which he became attached.  Hanks, a father to four children, described Michael Sullivan's role, "I just got this guy.  If you're a man, and you've got offspring--emotionally, it's devastating." Hanks portrayed Michael Sullivan in the film as a man who spoke little dialogue, particularly to avoid breaking the sense of [[self-awareness]].<ref name="killer" />
*'''[[Tyler Hoechlin]]''' as '''Michael Sullivan, Jr.''': The oldest son of Michael Sullivan, Sr.  Hoechlin was chosen from over 2,000 candidates to portray Michael Sullivan's son.<ref name="killer" />  The actor was 13 years old at the time of filming.  For scenes in which Hoechlin's character assisted his father as a getaway driver, Hoechlin was trained to drive for several scenes by a driving instructor.<ref name="circa" />
*'''[[Paul Newman]]''' as '''John Rooney''': A crime boss who treats Sullivan as a surrogate son.  Newman was unanimously the first choice for the role.<ref name="power" />  The actor prepared for his role by requesting [[Frank McCourt]], the Irish-American author of ''[[Angela's Ashes]]'', to record a tape of himself speaking.<ref name="killer" />
*'''[[Jude Law]]''' as '''Harlen Maguire''': A crime scene photographer who moonlights as an assassin.  Screenwriter David Self, who created the character of Harlen Maguire that did not exist in the graphic novel, explained, "He gets so jaded from exposure to this world, he steps over the line from being the storyteller to being the story maker."<ref name="self">{{cite news | author=Anthony Teofilo | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/perdition/2.html | title=A Self Made Man | publisher=Movie Poop Shoot | date= | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>  To capture the "seedy countenance" of the character, Law was given a sallow skin tone and beat-up hands that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom.  Law's teeth also received a lower gumline and had the look of rotten teeth to mimic the ferret-like character.<ref name="circa" />  Law's character carried a camera that served as dual symbolism to his acts of murder.  The character's apartment also displayed a collection of favorite photographs, some of which were actual police stills from the 1930s to illustrate the historic and authentic nature of crime in the decade.<ref name="fathers" />
*'''[[Daniel Craig]]''' as '''Connor Rooney''': The son of John Rooney.  He is jealous of the surrogate relationship between his father and Michael Sullivan, Sr.
*'''[[Stanley Tucci]]''' as '''[[Frank Nitti]]''': A lieutenant under [[Al Capone]].  Tucci had previously avoided roles in gangster films, believing that Hollywood stereotyped all Italian-Americans as gangsters.  The actor, attracted to the prospect of working with Mendes and his crew, changed his mind and accepted the role of Nitti.<ref>{{cite news | author=Clint O'Connor | url= | title=Out of Season | publisher=[[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer]] | date=[[2002-07-07]] | accessdate= }}</ref>  
*'''[[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]''' as '''Annie Sullivan''': The wife of Michael Sullivan, Sr.  Leigh was a friend of Sam Mendes and portrayed the role as a favor to the director.  Leigh had more scenes as Annie Sullivan than the film showed, but due to time constraints, the scene were cut.  Scenes were her were subsequently placed on the film's DVD.<ref name="legend" />
*'''[[Liam Aiken]]''' as '''Peter Sullivan''': The youngest son of Michael Sullivan, Sr.
*'''[[Dylan Baker]]''' as '''Alexander Rance''': An accountant who holds the ledgers for the Rooney crime syndicate.
*'''[[Ciar<U+00E1>n Hinds]]''' as '''Finn McGovern''': The mark assigned by Sullivan and Connor Rooney, whose death is witnessed by Sullivan's son.
*'''[[Anthony LaPaglia]]''' as '''[[Al Capone]]''': The notorious crime boss.  The character was filmed in a scene, but the scene was omitted from the final cut,<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=12122 | title=Capone chats with Max Allan Collins about why he isn't in ROAD TO PERDITION!!!! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=[[2002-04-26]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref> and can be found in the DVD's deleted scenes.<ref>{{cite news | author=Tom Woodward | url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/road-to-perdition-dts-edition.html | title=Road to Perdition: DTS Edition | publisher=DVDActive.com | date= | accessdate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>  Actor [[Alfred Molina]] was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Frida]]'' (2002).

==Production==
When the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'' was written by [[Max Allan Collins]], his agent saw potential in the story as a film adaptation and showed it to a film agent.<ref name="facts">{{cite news | author=Arune Singh | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1240 | title=JUST THE FACTS MA'AM: MAX COLLINS TALKS 'ROAD TO PERDITION' | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=[[2002-06-16]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>  By 1999, the novel reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company of his father, producer [[Richard D. Zanuck]].  The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing ''[[Rules of Engagement (film)|Rules of Engagement]]'' (2000).  The Zanucks agreed on the story's prospect and sent it to director-producer [[Steven Spielberg]].  Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio [[DreamWorks]], though he did not pursue direction of the film due to his full slate.<ref name="killer">{{cite news | author=Jeff Jensen | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,320333,00.html | title=Killer Instinct | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[2002-07-19]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>

Director [[Sam Mendes]] sought a new project after completing ''[[American Beauty (film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999) and explored prospects including ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'', ''[[The Shipping News (film)|The Shipping News]]'',<ref name="power">{{cite news | author=Susan Wloszczyna | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-07-12-perdition.htm | title=Power trio hits the 'Road' | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=[[2002-07-12]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref> and ''[[The Lookout]]''.  DreamWorks sent Mendes ''Road to Perdition'' as a prospect.  Mendes was attracted to the story, considering it "narratively very simple, but thematically very complex".<ref name="killer" />  One theme that he saw in the story was of the parents' world that is inaccessible to their children.  Mendes considered the story's theme to be about how children deal with violence, and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves.  Mendes described the script to have "no moral absolutes", a factor that appealed to the director.<ref name="rumblings">{{cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/317/317759p1.html | title=Rumblings on ''The Road to Perdition'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2002-01-24]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>

===Writing===
When Spielberg set up ''Road to Perdition'' at DreamWorks, he contacted screenwriter [[David Self]] to adapt the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'' by [[Max Allan Collins]] into a feature film.<ref name="killer" />  Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue.  The screenplay was rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story.<ref name="facts" />  Director [[Sam Mendes]], who described the graphic novel as "much more pulpy", sought to reduce the graphic novel's background to its essence, seeking the "nonverbal simplicity" of films like ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984), ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973),<ref name="killer" /> and films by [[Akira Kurosawa]] that lacked dialogue.<ref name="legend">{{cite news | author=Anthony Teofilo | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/perdition/3.html | title=New Kid On The Block | publisher=Movie Poop Shoot | date= | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref> Duplicate language in characters' confrontations in ''Road to Perdition'' was trimmed to the absolute minimum.<ref name="paul">{{cite news | author=Rick Lyman | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,792264,00.html | title=So, as Paul said to Tom ... | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=[[2002-09-15]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>  Mendes described ''Road to Perdition'' as a "poetic, elegiac story, in which the pictures tell the story".<ref name="power" />  An unspoken scene in the film was the piano duet with Hanks and Newman's characters, intended to convey their relationship without words.<ref name="paul" />  In the final 20 minutes of ''Road to Perdition'', the script was written to have only six lines of dialogue.<ref name="power" />

Hanks and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]], who abhorred violence, requested to Mendes that violence in the film would be meaningful and not gratuitous.  The violence of early drafts was minimized as the script became more streamlined.<ref name="killer" />  Hanks's character, Michael Sullivan, was known as "The Angel" in the graphic novel and invoked fear in those around him, but his infamy is downplayed in the film.<ref name="rumblings" />  In the novel, he was also an alcoholic, an element which was removed in the adaptation.<ref name="killer" />  An addition made to the script was one of the film's antagonists, portrayed by [[Jude Law]], to provide a chase element to the Sullivans' departure from the old world.<ref name="facts" />

The author of ''Perdition'' graphic novel, Max Allan Collins, originally desired to write the adapted screenplay for the feature film, but was not given the opportunity.<ref name="facts" />  He chose to stay out of the scripting process in respect to the different style of writing for a different medium, though he served a consultant in the process.  Collins praised the addition of Jude Law's character and considered the minimalist use of dialogue to be appropriate.<ref name="future">{{cite news | author=Arune Singh | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1446 | title=COLLINS' 'ROAD' TO THE FUTURE | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=[[2002-08-07]] | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>  The author also applauded the film's version of Mr. Rooney as "more overtly a father figure" to Sullivan.<ref name="facts" />  The author opposed the reduction of profanity in the script, believing that the vulgar language was appropriate for the era.<ref name="future" />  He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film.  In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone.  Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film.  In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.<ref>{{cite news | author=Adam Duerson | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,321309~1~0~howroadtoperdition,00.html | title='Road' Warrior | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[2002-07-17]] | accessdate=2007-06-07 }}</ref>

===Filming===
Prior to filming, director Sam Mendes sought to produce a [[period film]] that would avoid clich<U+00E9>s in the gangster genre.  Mendes chose to film ''Road to Perdition'' on location in [[Chicago]] and the nearby town of [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]].  The Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission.  Sets were built inside the Armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion.  The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of [[scaffolding]]s.<ref name="triggers">{{cite news | author=Ray Zone | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/index.html | title=Emotional Triggers | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date=August 2002 | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | "Atmospherically, the landscape is a violent and magnificent canvas on which is told a mythic story of a father and son in the last period of lawlessness in American history."
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | <U+2014> Sam Mendes<ref name="triggers" />
|}
Mendes collaborated with costume designer Albert Wolsky, production designer Dennis Gassner, and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] to design the film's style.  Wolsky designed costumes that were "very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes".  Gassner built sets that could capture a cold look of the era.  Mendes sought a muted palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays.  Mendes filmed ''Road to Perdition'' using the [[Super 35 mm film|Super 35]] format.<ref name="triggers" />

The director filmed exterior scenes in Illinois in the winter and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes.  Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states.  Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film.<ref name="triggers" />  Filming concluded in June 2001.<ref name="killer" />

===Cinematography===
[[Image:Perdition cinematography.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall set up atmospheric lighting similar what is found in the paintings of Edward Hopper]]
To establish the lighting of scenes in ''Road to Perdition'', director [[Sam Mendes]] drew from the paintings of [[Edward Hopper]] as a source of inspiration, particularly Hopper's ''New York Movie'' (1939).  Mendes and cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for the film's scenes, applying a "less is more" mantra.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ray Zone | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar1.html | title=A Master of Mood | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date= | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>  Hall also shot wide open scenes that retained one point in the [[depth of field]] sharply focused.  Hall considered the technique to provide an emotional dimension to the scenes.  The cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects.  One of Hall's methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter the light enough to create an in-shade look.<ref name="triggers" />

Hall purposely distanced the camera from Hanks's character, Michael Sullivan, at the beginning of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan's son, who is unaware of his father's nature.<ref name="killer" />  Hanks's character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows.  A wide lense was used to maintain a distance from the character.<ref name="triggers" />

Shots in the film were drawn directly from panels in the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'', illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner.  An instance of the direct influence was the scene in which Michael Jr. looks up at the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass.<ref name="road">{{cite news | author=Anthony Teofilo | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/perdition/1.html | title=ON THE ROAD TO PERDITION | publisher=Movie Poop Shoot | date=[[2002-07-03]] | accessdate=2006-06-06 }}</ref>

A seamless 40-second driving scene in which Michael Sullivan and his son travel into Chicago from the countryside was aided by visual effects.  The live-action part of the scene was filmed at [[LaSalle Street]], and due to the lack of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Heuring | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug02/perdition/sidebar2.html | title= Effecting a Key Transition | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date= | accessdate=2007-06-06 }}</ref>

==Themes==
===Consequence of violence===
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "[What's] important, in this story, is what the violence does to the person who pulls the trigger, and what it has done to them over the years, how it has gradually corroded them. It has rotted their insides."
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | <U+2014> Sam Mendes<ref name="paul" />
|}
The film's title, ''Road to Perdition'', is both the destination town of Michael Sullivan ([[Tom Hanks]]) and his son and also an euphemism for [[Hell]], a road that Sullivan desires to keep his son from traveling.  The character Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate.  Asked director [[Sam Mendes]], "[Sullivan] is in a battle for the soul of his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?"<ref name="road">"Taking the Road."  Production notes.  ''Road to Perdition'' (2002).  Retrieved on [[2007-06-06]].</ref>  Hanks described his character as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, of which he had ignored the likely repercussions.  When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, "At the moment we're dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective."<ref name="fathers">"[http://www.roadtoperdition.com/home.html Fathers & Sons.]"  Production notes.  ''Road to Perdition'' (2002).  Retrieved on [[2007-06-06]].</ref>  To keep Hanks' character from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes left out scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining to his son about his background.<ref name="killer" />

In the film, most of the numerous acts of violence are committed off-screen.  The acts of violence were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed of violence in the real world.  The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the responsible person or witnesses to the act.<ref name="paul" />

===Fathers and sons===

''Road to Perdition'' also explores father-son relationships, not only between Michael Sullivan and his son, but between Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney.  Sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears Mr. Rooney, and Sullivan's son feels the same for his own father.  Mr. Rooney's son, Connor, is a malicious man in comparison to Sullivan, and Mr. Rooney is conflicted on whom to protect: his real son or his surrogate son.  Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Michael Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.<ref name="fathers" />

Because Sullivan shields his background from his son, his attempt to preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful.  Tragedy takes place to bring Sullivan and his son together.<ref name="american">{{cite news | author=J. Sperling Reich | url=http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=features/interviews/sammendes | title=American ''Perdition'' | date= | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>  Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds opportunity to establish a stronger relationship with his father than before.  [[Tyler Hoechlin]], who portrayed the boy when he was 13 years old, explained, "His dad starts to realize that Michael is all he has now and how much he's been missing. I think the journey is of a father and son getting to know each other, and also finding out who they themselves are."<ref name="fathers" />

===Water===

Water served as a major thematic element in the film.  The element was pursued after research for the wake at the beginning of the film informed the director that corpses were kept on ice to keep the body from decomposing.  The notion was interwoven into the film, with the presence of water being linked to death.<ref name="circa">"[http://www.roadtoperdition.com/home.html Circa 1931.]"  Production notes.

==Reception==
''Road to Perdition'' concluded filming in June 2001,<ref name="killer" /> and the studio intended to release the film in the [[United States]] the following Christmas, but by September 2001, director [[Sam Mendes]] requested more time to edit and score for the film.  The film was instead scheduled to be released on [[July 12]], [[2002]] in the United States, an unconventional move that placed the drama among the wide-audience summer films.<ref name="killer" />  The film earned $22,079,481 in 1,797 theaters over the opening weekend.  The film grossed $104,454,762 in the United States and $76,546,716 in other territories for a worldwide total of $181,001,478.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=roadtoperdition.htm | title=Road to Perdition (2002) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2007-05-20 }}</ref>

Eric Harrison of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' considered ''Road to Perdition'' "the most brilliant work in this [gangster] genre" since the uncut ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984).  Harrison enjoyed the film's complex characters and considered David Self's script "so finely honed that the story can change directions in a heartbeat".  Harrison also lent praise to the cinematography, considering the setup to accentuate the characters' emotional development.<ref>{{cite news | author=Eric Harrison | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1491161.html | title=Road to Perdition | date= | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>  Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' considered the performances of Hanks, Newman, and Daniel Craig to be appropriate, though he called Jude Law's performance "almost cartoonish".<ref>{{cite news | author=Kirk Honeycutt | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1530784 | title=Road to Perdition | publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=[[2002-07-01]] | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>  Peter Travers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also complimented the performances of Hanks and Newman, saying, "[They] act together with the confidence of titans, their talents in the service of character, never star ego."  Travers enjoyed the combination of Hall's "breathtaking" cinematography and composer Thomas Newman's "evocative" score in the film's scenes.<ref>{{cite news | author=Peter Travers | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947709/review/5947710/road_to_perdition | title=Road to Perdition: Review | date=[[2002-08-01]] | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>

Paul Clinton of [[CNN]] believed that ''Road to Perdition'' failed to flesh out its multitude of themes.  "While these deeply human issues are touched upon, they're never fully explored, and that undermines the sense of greatness to which this movie obviously aspires," Clinton said.  Clinton also failed to emotionally identify with the film's characters and considered Craig's character as "one-dimensional to the extreme".  He also believed that the cinematography was too overpowering for the film's weak storyline.<ref>{{cite news | author=Paul Clinton | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/11/ca.s02.review.perdition/index.html | title=Review: 'Road to Perdition' scenic trip nowhere | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=[[2002-07-11]] | accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>  J. Hoberman of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' considered ''Road to Perdition'' to be "grim yet soppy".

''Road to Perdition'' was released on DVD in [[February 25]], [[2003]] in both full screen and anamorphic widescreen versions.  The DVD's features included an audio commentary, deleted scenes, a [[HBO]] "Making of" documentary and a photo gallery.<ref>{{cite news | title = Road to Perdition - DVD Preview | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2002-11-27]] | url = http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/378/378861p1.html | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>  Work on the DVD began on the same day that the film's production began, and a collaborative effort among the director, the studio, and the DVD production crew shaped the DVD's content.  Due to a limit of space on the DVD, the film's deleted scenes were chosen over a [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] soundtrack.  Instead, the DVD included a [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/news/interview.asp?Index=7291 | title=Mark Rowen - DVD Producer of Road to Perdition | publisher=DVD Reviewer | date=[[2003-03-19]] | accessdate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>  A special edition DVD containing both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks was also released, excluding the "Making of" documentary to fit both soundtracks.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jeremy Conrad | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/387/387328p1.html | title=Road to Perdition - DVD Review | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2006-02-26]] | accessdate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The author of the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]'', [[Max Allan Collins]], was hired to write the novelization for the film adaptation.  Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at [[DreamWorks]] required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue.  Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task.<ref name="future" />
