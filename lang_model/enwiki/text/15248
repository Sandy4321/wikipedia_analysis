'''Keen Johnson''' (January 12, 1896{{spaced ndash}}February 7, 1970) was the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|45th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]], serving from 1939 to 1943; he is the only journalist to have held that office.<ref name=ogden178>Odgen, p. 178</ref> After serving in [[World War I]], Johnson purchased and edited the ''Elizabethtown Mirror'' newspaper. He revived the struggling paper, sold it to a competitor and used the profits to obtain his journalism degree from the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1922. After graduation, he became editor of ''[[The Anderson News]]'', and in 1925, he accepted an offer to co-publish and edit the ''[[Richmond Register|Richmond Daily Register]]''.

In 1935, Johnson was chosen as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]]. He was elected and served under Governor [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]] from 1935 to 1939. He had already secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1939 when Chandler resigned and elevated Johnson to governor so that Johnson could appoint Chandler to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat vacated by the death of [[M. M. Logan]]. He went on to win a full gubernatorial term in the general election, defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[King Swope]]. Johnson's desire to expand the state's social services was hampered by the financial strain imposed on the state by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Nevertheless, he ran a fiscally conservative administration and took the state from being $7&nbsp;million in debt to having a surplus of $10&nbsp;million by the end of his term.

Following his term as governor, Johnson joined [[Reynolds Metals]] as a special assistant to the president. He continued his employment with Reynolds until 1961. He took a year-long [[leave of absence]] in 1946 to accept President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s appointment as the first U.S. [[Undersecretary of Labor]], serving under [[Lewis B. Schwellenbach]]. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1960, losing to incumbent Republican [[John Sherman Cooper]]. He died February 7, 1970, and was buried in Richmond Cemetery in Richmond, Kentucky.

==Early life==
Keen Johnson was born in a two-room cabin at Brandon's Chapel in [[Lyon County, Kentucky]], on January 12, 1896.<ref name=powell96>Powell, p. 96</ref> He was the only son of Reverend Robert and Mattie (Holloway) Johnson.<ref name=harrison474>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 474</ref> His parents named him in honor of John S. Keen, a family friend from [[Adair County, Kentucky|Adair County]].<ref name=ogden177>Odgen, p. 177</ref> The Johnsons also had two daughters<U+2014>Catherine (Keturah) and Christine.<ref name=hay>Hay, "Guide to the Collection of Keen Johnson"</ref> Robert Johnson was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, and the family moved often as a result of his occupation.<ref name=powell96 />

After completing his elementary education in the public schools, Johnson attended Vanderbilt Preparatory School for Boys, a Methodist institution in [[Elkton, Kentucky]].<ref name=hay /><ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Keen Johnson". National Governors Association</ref> He finished his preparatory coursework in 1914 and matriculated to [[Central Methodist College]] in [[Fayette, Missouri]].<ref name=powell96 /> He had intended to continue his studies at the [[University of Missouri]] School of Journalism, but he interrupted his studies to enlist in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for service in World War I.<ref name=powell96 />

After [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]], Johnson entered [[officer training]] at [[Fort Riley]] on May 15, 1917.<ref name=powell96 /><ref name=hay /> In August 1917, he was appointed [[second lieutenant]] and assigned to the 354th Infantry, [[89th Division (United States)|89th Division]] of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] at [[Camp Funston]].<ref name=ogden177 /><ref name=hay /> He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on March 29, 1918, and on June 4, 1918, he was deployed to France, where he studied logistical communications at the Army School of the Line and Staff College.<ref name=hay /> He remained in Europe with the American Expeditionary Force until April 1919 and was [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the Army on October 31, 1919.<ref name=hay />

On June 23, 1917, while still completing his military training, Johnson married Eunice Nichols. Their only child, a daughter named Judith, was born May 19, 1927.<ref name=powell96 /> Upon his return from military service, Johnson purchased the ''[[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]] Mirror'' with financial assistance from his father.<ref name=powell96 /> He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up, and a competitor soon bought him out for a profit.<ref name=powell96 /> Johnson used the profit from the sale of the ''Mirror'' to continue his education at the [[University of Kentucky]].<ref name=powell96 /> While a student, he worked as a reporter for the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader|Lexington Herald]]''.<ref name=ogden177 /> He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922.<ref name=powell96 /> The university awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree in 1940.<ref name=hay />

After graduation, Johnson purchased half-ownership of ''[[The Anderson News]]'' and served as the paper's editor and publisher.<ref name=ogden177 /> In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson to partner with him in a joint venture to purchase the ''[[Richmond Register|Richmond Daily Register]]''.<ref name=powell96 /> Lured by the idea of publishing a daily paper, Johnson accepted.<ref name=powell96 /> As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932.<ref name=nga /> He continued to hold this position and publish the ''Register'' through 1939.<ref name=nga />

==Political career==
In 1935, Johnson was one of three contenders for the Democratic nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]]. In the [[primary election|primary]], he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a [[runoff election|runoff]] if no candidate received a [[majority]]. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.<ref name=hay />

In the gubernatorial primary, [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]] defeated [[Tom Rhea]], the candidate favored by sitting governor [[Ruby Laffoon]].<ref name=klotter304>Klotter, p. 304</ref> Johnson had also favored Rhea, and had backed Robert T. Crowe over [[J. C. W. Beckham]], Chandler's choice in the 1927 Democratic primary.<ref name=klotter317>Klotter, p. 317</ref> Nevertheless, the two put aside their differences and won the general election.<ref name=klotter306>Klotter, p. 306</ref> Chandler defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[King Swope]] by over 95,000 votes, and Johnson defeated [[J. J. Kavanaugh]] by over 100,000 votes.<ref name=harrison474 /><ref name=klotter306 />

===Governor of Kentucky===
The division between Chandler and Laffoon led to factionalism within the state Democratic Party. When no strong gubernatorial candidate emerged from the Chandler faction in 1939, Chandler threw his support behind Johnson. [[John Y. Brown, Sr.]] announced he would challenge Johnson in the primary. This solidified the Chandler faction's support, as Brown was an outspoken critic of the Chandler administration. Brown gained the support of Chandler critics, notably former governor Ruby Laffoon, Tom Rhea, [[Earle C. Clements]], and [[Alben Barkley]]. He further garnered the support of the [[United Mine Workers]] and labor boss [[John L. Lewis]]. It was to no avail, as Johnson defeated Brown in the primary by over 33,000 votes to secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.<ref name=klotter317>Klotter, p. 317</ref>

[[File:King Swope.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King Swope, Johnson's opponent in the 1939 gubernatorial election]]
The Republicans chose King Swope, the loser in the 1935 gubernatorial election, to oppose Johnson.<ref name=klotter318>Klotter, p. 318</ref> In the middle of the campaign, however, Johnson was elevated to governor.<ref name=harrison474 /> United States Senator [[M. M. Logan]] died in October 1939, and Governor Chandler resigned so that Johnson<U+2014>thus elevated to governor<U+2014>could appoint him to the vacant seat.<ref name=harrison474 /> In the general election on November 17, Johnson defeated Swope 460,834 to 354,704, securing a full term as governor.<ref name=harrison474 />

In his inaugural address, Johnson promised to be "a saving, thrifty, frugal governor".<ref name=ogden178 /> His policies helped him eliminate the state's debt of $7&nbsp;million and left the treasury with a surplus of $10&nbsp;million by the end of his term.<ref name=ogden178 /> It was the first time the state had had a surplus since the administration of J. C. W. Beckham in 1903.<ref name=ogden178 /> Johnson achieved the surplus without enacting any tax increases.<ref name=powell96 /> Not all in Johnson's party were happy with his approach to governing; one critic noted, "Old Keen frugaled here and frugaled there till he damn near frugaled us to death."<ref name=klotter318 />

''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' reporter Howard Henderson wrote several stories exposing corruption in Johnson's administration, including a significant one dealing with laundry contracts. Hubert Meredith, Johnson's politically ambitious [[Kentucky Attorney General|attorney general]], freely aired his concerns about the administration, gaining recognition for himself from the publicity generated. Historian [[James C. Klotter]] opined "It is doubtful whether Johnson's administration had any more political scandal than others, but the publicity made it seem that way."<ref name=klotter318 />

In the 1940 legislative session, Johnson successfully lobbied the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] to allocate money to a teacher retirement system that had previously been authorized but left unfunded. Despite his fiscally conservative nature, he increased funds to programs to assist the elderly by $1&nbsp;million per year. Other accomplishments of the session included the provision of pensions for justices on the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], creation of soil conservation districts in the state, and banning the sale of [[marijuana]].<ref>Klotter, pp. 318<U+2013>319</ref>

Johnson's primary interest lay in improving the state's mental and penal institutions.<ref name=ogden178 /> These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years by the end of his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.<ref name=ogden178 />

In the 1941 legislative session, Johnson vetoed a measure allowing the sale of alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales.<ref name=ogden179>Ogden, p. 179</ref> The bill was very popular, and was supported by many of the state's powerful special interests.<ref name=ogden179 /> It had passed the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] by a vote of 84<U+2013>0 and the [[Kentucky Senate]] by a vote of 31<U+2013>3.<ref name=ogden179 /> After Johnson's veto, the House reversed itself, voting 86<U+2013>3 to sustain the veto.<ref name=ogden179 />

In the 1942 legislative session, Johnson stressed the importance of allowing Kentucky cities to purchase and distribute power from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].<ref name=ogden179 /> In an address to the Assembly, Johnson declared, "I have never had a stronger conviction on a question of public policy... The principle involved is as correct as the [[Ten Commandments]]."<ref name=ogden179 /> The Assembly passed the necessary legislation as Johnson requested.<ref name=ogden179 />

A major accomplishment of the Johnson administration was the passage of a legislative redistricting bill.<ref name=ogden178 /> Despite the fact that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] requires redistricting after every [[United States Census|decennial census]], Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941.<ref name=ogden178 /> He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session for the sole purpose of considering a redistricting bill.<ref name=ogden179 /> The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.<ref name=ogden179 />

Johnson took an active part in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1943. Among the candidates were Ben Kilgore, [[Rodes K. Myers]], and [[J. Lyter Donaldson]]. Myers was Johnson's lieutenant governor, but he had turned on the administration. Johnson called him a [[carpetbagger]] from [[North Carolina]], "a political adventurer", and "a phony farmer".<ref name=klotter322>Klotter, p. 322</ref> He also ridiculed Kilgore, who had strong support from the ''Louisville Courier-Journal'', the Rural Electric Association, and the Farm Bureau, by calling him a "[[Casanova]]".<ref name=klotter322 /><ref name=nhok373>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 373</ref> Donaldson, Johnson's former campaign manager, secured his support and the Democratic nomination. He was defeated in the general election by Republican [[Simeon Willis]].<ref name=klotter322 />

==Later life and death==
Beginning in 1940, Johnson was a member of the State Democratic National Committee, serving until 1948.<ref name=nga /> On June 6, 1942, he was named to the board of regents of Eastern State College (now [[Eastern Kentucky University]]) a position he held for eight years.<ref name=hay /> On January 1, 1944, he was named a special assistant to the president of [[Reynolds Metals]], advising him on postwar unemployment problems.<ref name=hay /> He became vice-president of public relations for the company in 1945.<ref name=nga />

Johnson developed a strong rapport with union leaders and in 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] and Kentucky Senator Alben Barkley asked him to accept an appointment to the newly created post of [[United States Deputy Secretary of Labor|Undersecretary of Labor]].<ref name=hay /> In August 1946, Johnson took a [[leave of absence]] from Reynolds and accepted the appointment.<ref name=powell96 /> He frequently attended President Truman's cabinet meetings due to the illness of [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary]] [[Lewis B. Schwellenbach]].<ref name=hay />

In mid-1947, Johnson returned to Reynolds.<ref name=hay /> In 1950, he became a member of the company's board of directors.<ref name=hay /> In this capacity, he organized meetings of sales executives and traveled extensively to promote the company's aluminum products.<ref name=hay /> He retired from Reynolds in January 1961.<ref name=hay />

In 1960, Johnson sought a seat in the U.S. Senate.<ref name=hay /> He defeated John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary, but was unable to unseat Republican incumbent [[John Sherman Cooper]] in the general election.<ref name=hay /> In 1961 and 1964, he was appointed to the state board of education.<ref name=nga /> He served as a delegate to an assembly to revise the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]] in 1964.<ref name=hay /> In 1965, the University of Kentucky honored him with a Centennial Award and inducted him into its Hall of Distinguished Alumni.<ref name=hay /><ref name=ukaa>"University of Kentucky Alumni Association <U+2013> Keen Johnson"</ref> He died February 7, 1970 in Richmond, Kentucky, and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.<ref name=nga />
