The '''Seax of Beagnoth''' (also known as the '''Thames scramasax''') is a 10th-century [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[seax]] (single-edged [[knife]]).  It was found in the [[River Thames]] in 1857, and is now at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].  It is a prestige weapon, decorated with elaborate patterns of inlaid copper, bronze and silver wire.  On one side of the blade is the only known complete inscription of the twenty-eight letter [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon runic alphabet]], as well as the name "Beagnoth" in runic letters.  It is thought that the runic alphabet had a magical function, and that the name Beagnoth is that of either the owner of the weapon or the smith who forged it.  Although many Anglo-Saxon and [[Viking]] swords and knives have inscriptions in the [[Latin alphabet]] on their blades, or have runic inscriptions on the hilt or scabbard, the Seax of Beagnoth is one of only a handful of finds with a runic inscription on its blade.

==Discovery==

The seax was found in the River Thames near [[Battersea]] by Henry J. Briggs, a labourer, in early 1857.{{#tag:ref|Briggs sold many archaeological finds from the Thames [[Mudlark|mud]] to the British Museum between 1843 and 1866, including the [[Battersea Shield]].<ref>{{Cite web | title=Biographical details for Henry J Briggs | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=90436 | accessdate=2010-08-18 }}</ref>|group=note}}  Briggs sold it to the British Museum, and on 21 May 1857 it was exhibited at the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] (an antiquary who worked at the Antiquities Department of the British Museum), when it was described as "resembling the ''Scramasax'' of the Franks, of which examples are very rare in England; and bears a row of runic characters inlaid in gold".<ref>{{Citation | author1=London, Society of Antiquaries of | title=Notices for Thursday May 21st 1857 | journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London | volume=4 | issue=47 | pages=83 | year=1857 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mY5IAAAAYAAJ | postscript=. }}</ref>  Since then the weapon has usually been called the ''Thames scramasax''; but the term ''scramasax'' (from [[Old Frankish]] *''scr<U+00E2>masahs'') is only attested once, in the ''History of the Franks'' by [[Gregory of Tours]], and the meaning of the ''scrama-'' element is uncertain,<ref>{{Citation| title=Oxford English Dictionary | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1989 | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-861186-2 }}</ref> so recent scholarship prefers the term ''long seax'' or ''long sax'' for this type of weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Underwood|1999|p=68}}</ref><ref>Gale ''The Seax'' in Hawkes ''Weapons and Warfare in Anglo-Saxon England'' Oxford 1989 ISBN 0-947816-21-6</ref>

==Description==

[[File:Thames Scramasax.jpg|900px|center|alt=Iron seax]]
The seax is an iron knife with a single cutting edge and a long tapering point.  It is 72.1&nbsp;cm in length, of which the [[Tang (weaponry)|tang]] is 17.0&nbsp;cm and the blade is 55.1&nbsp;cm.<ref name="bm">{{Cite web | title=Search the collection database : seax | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=86215&partid=1 | accessdate=2010-06-14 }}</ref>  The tang would have been attached to a handle, which has not survived.

The blade is a prestige weapon,<ref name="page-1987-40">{{harvnb|Page|1987|p=40}}</ref> decorated on both faces with geometric patterns created by hammering strips of twisted copper, brass and silver wire into grooves cut into the blade, as well as with inlaid triangles and [[lozenge]]s of copper, brass and silver.<ref name="bm"/>  The technique of inlaying wire to create decorative patterns and inscriptions was widely used on Germanic and Anglo-Saxon seaxes and spear heads from the 9th and 10th centuries,<ref name="oakeshott-2006-35">{{harvnb|Oakeshott|2006|p=35}}</ref> and is also found on Viking swords from about the same period.<ref>{{harvnb|Oakeshott|1991|p=6}}</ref>

[[File:Thames Scramasax Decoration.jpg|350px||thumb|right|Detail of the Seax of Beagnoth, showing the inlaid wire decoration between the two inscriptions|alt=Middle section of a seax, showing inlaid wire decoration]]
On both sides of the seax is a deep median groove running the length of the blade, above which is a long rectangular panel bordered at the top and bottom with inlaid copper strips.  The panel on one side of the seax is filled with a lozenge pattern in silver and copper, which may have been meant to simulate [[pattern welding]].<ref name="oakeshott-2006-35"/>  The panel on the other side bears two runic inscriptions inlaid with brass and silver wire.  The inscription on the left comprises the twenty-eight letters of the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon runic alphabet]] or ''futhorc''.  The inscription on the right, separated from the other by a herringbone design in silver and brass, is the male personal name Beagno<U+00FE> or Beagnoth {{runic|<U+16D2><U+16E0><U+16B7><U+16BE><U+16A9><U+16A6>}}, which is assumed to be that of the maker or original owner of the blade.<ref name="page-1987-40"/><ref name="elliott-79">{{harvnb|Elliott|1980|p=79}}</ref>

There are a number of interesting features about this inscription.  Firstly, the order of the runes does not exactly match the traditional sequence of the earlier twenty-four letter runic alphabet or that of the twenty-eight letter Anglo-Saxon ''futhorc'' preserved in the [[Codex Vindobonensis 795|Vienna Codex]].  The first nineteen runes are in the correct order, but the next four (20<U+2013>23: {{runic|<U+16DD><U+16DE><U+16DA><U+16D7>}}) are in a confused sequence which does not match that found in any other source.  The last two runes (27<U+2013>28: {{runic|<U+16A3><U+16E0>}}) are swapped with regard to their order in the Vienna Codex, but as these are later additions to the original twenty-four letter runic alphabet their order may have been less stable, especially as the last letter {{runic|<U+16E0>}} is very rare in Anglo-Saxon inscriptions (elsewhere it occurs in the name J<U+0268>slheard {{runic|<U+16C4><U+16C7><U+16CB><U+16DA><U+16BB><U+16E0><U+16B1><U+16DE>}} on a stone found in [[Dover]]).<ref name="elliott-1980-36">{{harvnb|Elliott|1980|p=36}}</ref>

Secondly, the 16th rune ({{runic|<U+16CB>}}) is very small, and appears to have been squeezed in as an afterthought.<ref name="page-2006-80">{{harvnb|Page|2006|p=80}}</ref>

Thirdly, the letterforms of a number of the runes are unusual:

No.12 {{runic|<U+16C4>}} ''ger'' is written in an unusual form, with a single horizontal bar instead of the circle, lozenge or cross most commonly found in other epigraphic and manuscript examples.<ref>{{harvnb|Page|2006|pp=40, 46}}</ref>

No.16 {{runic|<U+16CB>}} is written in an unusual form, but one that is attested in a few other inscriptions (for example on the shrine of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]]).  Some scholars believe this runic letterform is borrowed from the [[<U+A784>|insular letter s]] <U+A785> used in Anglo-Saxon bookhand as it has a very similar shape (both have a vertical stem with a horizontal or diagonal branch to the right).<ref name="page-2006-40">{{harvnb|Page|2006|p=40}}</ref>  On the other hand, Elliot sees it as an evolution of the normal runic letter by straightening the left branching stroke and mirroring the letter.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|1980|p=80}}</ref>

No.21 {{runic|<U+16DE>}} is written in a unique form with the two diagonal crossbars forming a triangle rather than crossing in the middle.  This is probably an aberrant form.<ref name="page-2006-80"/>

No.24 {{runic|<U+16DF>}} is written in an unusual form with a single vertical stem instead of two diagonal legs as is normally the case.  This form occurs occasionally in runic inscriptions, and more often in manuscript texts.<ref name="page-2006-40"/> [[Ralph Warren Victor Elliott|Ralph Elliott]], former professor of English at the [[University of Adelaide]], suggests that it represents a simplified form of the standard rune.<ref name="elliott-1980-36"/>

No.27 {{runic|<U+16A3>}} is written in an unusual form with a cross in the centre rather than a vertical stroke.<ref name="page-2006-40"/>

These peculiarities may indicate that the artisan who designed the inscription was unfamiliar with runic writing,<ref name="thorsson">{{harvnb|Thorsson|1987|p=23}}</ref> although perhaps some of the unusual letterforms may have been errors occasioned by the difficulty of inlaying wire to form runes.<ref name="page-2006-40"/>

The inscription of the name Beagnoth is as follows:

[[File:Beagnoth Seax Name.jpg|alt=Drawing of a runic inscription of the name Beagnoth]]

There are no unusual features in the inscription of the name, but at the top right of the name are two strange designs that almost look like letters, which no-one has been able to explain.

==Date and provenance==

Finds of seaxes in Europe range from the 7th to the 11th century, and the earliest examples in England are from 7th-century graves.<ref name="bm"/>  Isolated finds of seaxes in England are believed to date from the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref name="page-2006-80"/><ref>{{harvnb|DeVries|2007|p=232}}</ref>  The Seax of Beagnoth has been dated to the 10th century.<ref>Findell, Martin (2014): ''Runes'', British Museum Press, ISBN 978-0-7141-8029-8, page 37.</ref>

Several seaxes of a similar kind are known from southern England (three from London, one from [[Suffolk]], one from the River Thames at Keen Edge Ferry in [[Berkshire]]), and one from Hurbuck in [[County Durham]] in the north of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Backhouse|1984|p=101}}</ref>  The Berkshire seax is so similar in construction and design to the Seax of Beagnoth that both may have come from the same workshop.<ref>{{harvnb|Backhouse|1984|p=102}}</ref>

Elliott suggests a southern, presumably [[Kingdom of Kent|Kentish]], origin for the seax because its inscription only comprises the original twenty-eight letters of the Anglo-Saxon ''futhorc'', and does not include any of the additional letters in use in [[Northumbria]]n runic inscriptions at that time.<ref name="elliott-79"/>

The name Beagnoth inscribed on the seax also supports a Kentish provenance, as the only two examples of this name in manuscript sources are Kentish.  One Beagnoth was a witness to a [[Anglo-Saxon charters|charter]] ([[Sawyer number|S30]]) by King [[Eardwulf of Kent]], granting pasture rights to the church of St Andrew at [[Rochester, Kent]], which is dated to 748<U+2013>760,<ref>{{Cite web | title=PASE Index of persons : Beagnoth 1 (Male) | publisher=Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England | url=http://www.pase.ac.uk/pdb?dosp=VIEW_RECORDS&st=PERSON_NAME&value=5196&level=1&lbl=Beagnoth | accessdate=2010-09-19 }}</ref> and another Beagnoth (also spelled Beahno<U+00FE>) was a monk from Kent who was present at the [[Councils of Clovesho|Synod of Clovesho]] in 803 and witnessed a charter by King [[<U+00C6>thelwulf of Wessex]] dated to 844.<ref>{{Cite web | title=PASE Index of persons : Beahnoth 1 (Male) | publisher=Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England | url=http://www.pase.ac.uk/pdb?dosp=VIEW_RECORDS&st=PERSON_NAME&value=6598&level=1&lbl=Beahnoth | accessdate=2010-09-19 }}</ref>  The name "Beagnoth" derives from the [[Old English]] words ''b<U+0113>ag'' or ''b<U+0113>ah'' meaning "ring, bracelet, torque or crown" and ''n<U+014D><U+00FE>'' meaning "boldness", and can be translated as "Ringbold".<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|1993|p=16}}</ref>

==Significance==

The Seax of Beagnoth is significant both as a rare example of a runic-inscribed Anglo-Saxon weapon, and specifically for its runic inscription, which is a unique epigraphical example of the complete twenty-eight letter Anglo-Saxon ''futhorc''.<ref name="page-1987-40"/>

===Runic inscribed blades===
{{further|blade inscription}}
There was a widespread tradition throughout Northern Europe of inscribing runes on weapons, particularly swords.  Thus, in Stanza 6 of the [[Poetic Edda|eddaic poem]] ''[[Sigrdr<U+00ED>fum<U+00E1>l]]'' the [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdr<U+00ED>fa]] teaches the hero [[Sigurd]] how to engrave runes on his sword to provide magical protection:

{|
|
:"Sigr<U+00FA>nar <U+00FE><U+00FA> skalt kunna,
:ef <U+00FE><U+00FA> vilt sigr hafa,
:ok r<U+00ED>sta <U+00E1> hialti hi<U+01EB>rs,
:sumar <U+00E1> v<U+00E9>ttrimum,
:sumar <U+00E1> valb<U+01EB>stum,
:ok nefna tysvar T<U+00FD>"<ref name="jansson">{{harvnb|Jansson|1987|p=15}}</ref>
|
:"Victory runes you must know
:if you will have victory,
:and carve the on the sword's hilt,
:some on the grasp
:and some on the inlay,
:and name [[Tyr]] twice."<ref name="jansson"/>
|
|}

This poem was not committed to writing until the late 13th century (in the [[Codex Regius]]), although it may preserve elements from a much earlier date.  However, a similar admonishment to carve runes on swords is found in lines 1694<U+2013>1698 of the Old English poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which is roughly contemporary with the Seax of Beagnoth:

{|
|
:"Sw<U+0101> w<U+00E6>s on <U+00F0><U+01E3>m scennum<U+2003><U+2003><U+2003>sc<U+012B>ran goldes

|
:"On clear gold labels let into the cross-piece
:it was rightly told in runic letters,
:set down and sealed, for whose sake it was
:that the sword was first forged, that finest of iron,
:spiral-hilted, serpent-bladed."<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=61}}</ref>
|
|}

This poem mentions the practice of carving the sword-owner's name in runes on the hilt.  This practice is confirmed by a 6th-century sword pommel from Kent, as well as a 6th-century silver scabbard mouth-piece from Chessell Down, [[Isle of Wight]], which both preserve fragmentary runic inscriptions. The latter is the only known example of an Anglo-Saxon runic inscription on a weapon from outside Kent.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1992|pp=120<U+2013>122}}</ref>  Several other Anglo-Saxon weapons have isolated runic letters on them.  For example a ''tiw'' rune {{runic|<U+16CF>}}, symbolizing the Anglo-Saxon war god [[T<U+00FD>r|Tiw]] (''Tyr'' in the earlier quotation from the ''Sigrdr<U+00ED>fum<U+00E1>l''), is found on two sword-pommels and a spear blade, all from Kent.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1992|pp=115<U+2013>117}}</ref>  Thus, although some Anglo-Saxon runic inscriptions on weapons are known, none are as extensive or as prominent as the runic inscription on the Seax of Beagnoth.  Furthermore, the Seax is Beagnoth is the only known Anglo-Saxon weapon with a runic inscription on its blade, and indeed, other than the [[Schretzheim sword]], which has a cryptic runic inscription on its blade comprising four runes in a cross formation, there are no other certain examples from anywhere in Europe of a sword or knife blade with a runic inscription.  In contrast, inscriptions in the Latin alphabet occur frequently on Viking swords.  For example, some one hundred swords with the maker's name "Ulfberht" inlaid into the blade are known from a period of about 300 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2009|p=124}}</ref>

On the basis of the ''Beowulf'' quotation it may be that "Beagnoth" was the Seax's original owner's name.  However, that is not certain, as Viking and Anglo-Saxon weapons often have the name of the weapon's maker engraved on them instead of, or as well as, the owner's (as on the Sittingbourne seax shown below).  [[Raymond Ian Page|Raymond Page]], former [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], considers four possibilities:<ref name="page-2006-165">{{harvnb|Page|2006|p=165}}</ref>

[[File:British Museum Sittingbourne Seax.jpg|400px||thumb|right|A "broken-back" seax from [[Sittingbourne]] in Kent, inscribed in [[Insular majuscule]]s ''<U+2629> BIORHTELM ME <U+00DE>ORTE'' ("Biorhtelm made me") and ''<U+2629> S[I]GEBEREHT ME AH'' ("S[i]gebereht owns me").|alt=Seax with sharply angled back and an inscription in Old English on the blade]]
1. That the name is that of the smith who forged the seax, as swords from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] often had their maker's name engraved on them.

2. That the name is that of the rune-master who wrote the ''futhorc''.  Page supposes that adding the rune-master's name would have added extra magical power to the weapon.

3. That the name is that of the original owner of the seax, for as he notes, "[t]he scramasax is an impressive piece of equipment, one that an owner would be proud to see his name on".<ref name="page-2006-165"/>

4. That the name is that of someone who gave the seax as a present to someone else, for it is "distinguished enough to make a fine gift bearing the giver's name".<ref name="page-2006-165"/>

Page concludes that we cannot know which possibility is correct.

===The inscribed futhorc===

[[File:British Museum Malton Pin.jpg|200px||thumb|right|Anglo-Saxon disc-headed pin from [[Malton, North Yorkshire]], engraved with the first seven or eight letters of the ''futhorc'',{{#tag:ref|According to {{harvnb|Page|1999}}, the eighth letter ''lagu'' {{runic|<U+16DA>}} may be an error for the similar-looking letter ''wynn'' {{runic|<U+16B9>}}, which is the eighth letter of the ''futhorc''.|group=note}} followed by the three vowel letters ({{runic|<U+16A0><U+16A2><U+16A6><U+16A9><U+16B1><U+16B3><U+16B7><U+16DA><U+16AA><U+16AB><U+16D6>}}).|alt=Pin with a large round head, on which eleven runic letters are carved in a circle around the edge]]
The runic inscription on the seax not only identifies the maker or owner of the seax, but also provides a rare example of the twenty-eight letter [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon runic alphabet]].  Examples of the earlier, twenty-four letter [[Elder Futhark]] and sixteen letter [[Younger Futhark]] alphabets are relatively common in continental and [[Scandinavia]]n runic inscriptions, but inscriptions of the historically later Anglo-Saxon ''futhorc'' are rare in England, with most examples of the Anglo-Saxon ''futhorc'' being known from manuscript sources.  This seax represents the only surviving epigraphic inscription of the basic twenty-eight letter Anglo-Saxon runic alphabet,<ref name="bm"/> although an incomplete inscription of the first sixteen letters of the ''futhorc'' occurs on the disc-shaped head of a Middle Saxon pin from [[Brandon, Suffolk]],<ref name="page-2006-80"/> and the first seven or eight letters of the ''futhorc'' are inscribed on the head of a pin from [[Malton, North Yorkshire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Page|1999}}</ref>

It is unclear what purpose the inscription of the ''futhorc'' served, but Page suggests it cannot be simply decorative, but must have had a [[Runic magic|magical significance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Page|2006|pp=114<U+2013>115}}</ref>  He notes that the carving of runic letters on swords as a form of magical protection was an ancient practice, but by the 9th century rune lore was probably on the decline in the [[Kingdom of Kent]], and the owner of the seax may have commissioned an archaic runic inscription for prestige purposes.  The fact that there are errors in the order and design of the runic letters suggests that the smith who made the seax was not used to adding such runic inscriptions to the weapons he made,<ref name="thorsson"/> and they may have been copied inaccurately from a manuscript text.<ref name="wilson-73">{{harvnb|Wilson|1964|p=73}}</ref>
