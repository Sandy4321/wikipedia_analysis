The '''Spey River''' is a river in the [[Tasman Mountains]] in the northwest of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].<ref>[http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/find-names/topographic-names-db/database/index.aspx?p=49605 Land Information New Zealand] Place Names Database.</ref>
The river drains [[Lake Aorere]] near the Aorere Saddle, and is fed by numerous small streams draining the [[Gouland Range]] on the west and part of the [[Domett Range]] (which the river bisects) on the east. It flows north then east before joining the upper reaches of the [[Aorere River]].<ref>New Zealand 1:50000 Topographic Map Series sheet BP23 <U+2013> Gouland Downs</ref>
