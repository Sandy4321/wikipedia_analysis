'''Ian Lancaster Fleming''' ([[May 28]], [[1908]] &ndash; [[August 12]], [[1964]]) was a [[British literature|British author]] and [[journalist]] as well as Second World War Naval Officer, best remembered for writing the series of [[novel]]s featuring the character [[James Bond]], as well as the children's story ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''. 

==Biography==
Ian Fleming was born in [[Mayfair]], [[London]], to [[Valentine Fleming]], a [[Member of Parliament]], and his wife [[Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming|Eve Fleming]] (''n<U+00E9>e'' Rose). Ian was the younger brother of travel writer [[Peter Fleming]] and the older brother of [[Michael Fleming|Michael]] and Richard Fleming (1910<U+2013>77). He also had an illegitimate half-sister, the cellist [[Amaryllis Fleming]]. He was the grandson of Scottish financier [[Robert Fleming]], who founded the Scottish American Investment Trust and merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]] (since 2000 part of [[JP Morgan Chase]]).  The actor [[Christopher Lee]] is his cousin, and actress Dame [[Celia Johnson]] is his sister-in-law (wife of his brother Peter).

Fleming was educated at [[The Old Malthouse|Durnford School]] in Dorset, [[Eton College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He won the [[Victor Ludorum]] at Eton two years running, something that had only been achieved once before him. He found Sandhurst to be uncongenial, and after an early departure from there, his mother sent him to study [[language]]s on the continent. He first went to a small private establishment in [[Kitzb<U+00FC>hel]], Austria run by the [[Adlerian]] disciples [[Ernan Forbes Dennis]] and his American wife, the novelist [[Phyllis Bottome]], to improve his German and prepare him for the [[Foreign Office]] exams, then to Munich University, and, finally, to the [[University of Geneva]] to improve his French. He was unsuccessful in his application to join the Foreign Office, and subsequently worked as a [[sub-editor]] and [[journalist]] for the [[Reuters]] news service, including time in 1933 in [[Moscow]], and then as a [[stockbroker]] with Rowe and Pitman, in [[Bishopsgate]]. He was a member of [[Boodle's]] the [[gentleman's club]] in [[St. James's Street]], from [[1944]] until his death in [[1964]]. 

His marriage in [[Jamaica]] in 1952 to [[Anne Charteris]], daughter of Lord [[Wemyss]] and former wife of [[Viscount Rothermere]], was witnessed by his friend, playwright [[Noel Coward]].

===World War II===
In 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], [[Rear Admiral]] John Godfrey, Director of [[British Department of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] of the Royal Navy, recruited Fleming (then a reserve [[Subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] in the [[Black Watch]]) as his personal assistant. He was commissioned first as a [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] [[lieutenant]],  and subsequently promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]], then [[Commander]].

In 1940 Fleming and Godfrey contacted [[Kenneth Mason]], Professor of Geography at Oxford University, about preparing reports devoted to the geography of countries engaged in military operations. These reports were the precursors of the [[Naval Intelligence Handbooks|''Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series'']] produced between 1941 and 1946.<ref>http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/27/2/153.pdf
</ref>
 
In Naval Intelligence, Fleming conceived of [[Operation Ruthless]], a plan &ndash; not executed &ndash; for capturing the German naval version of the Wehrmacht's [[Enigma machine|Enigma communications encoder]]. 

He also conceived of a plan to use British [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] to trick [[Rudolf Hess]] into attempting to contact a faux cell of anti-Churchill Englishmen in Britain, but this plan was not used because Rudolf Hess had flown to Scotland in an attempt to broker peace behind Hitler's back. Anthony Masters's book ''The Man Who Was M: The Life of Charles Henry Maxwell Knight'' asserts Fleming conceived the plan that lured Hess into flying to Scotland, in May 1941, to negotiate Anglo<U+2013>German peace with Churchill, and resulted in Hess's capture: this claim has no other source. 

Fleming also formulated [[Operation Goldeneye]], a plan to maintain communication with [[Gibraltar]] as well as a plan of defence in the unlikely event that [[Spain]] joined the [[Axis Powers]] and, together with Germany, invaded the Mediterranean colony.

In June 1941 [[William Joseph Donovan|General William Donovan]] requested that Fleming write a memorandum describing the structure and functions of a secret service organisation; for that, Fleming was rewarded with a .38 Police Positive Colt revolver pistol inscribed, "[[For Special Services]]." Parts of this memorandum were later used in the official charter for the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], which was dissolved in 1945 following the end of [[World War II]]; the OSS's successor, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], was created two years later.

In 1942 Fleming formed an [[Auxiliary Units|Auxiliary Unit]] known as 30AU or [[30th Assault Unit|30 Assault Unit]] that he nicknamed his own "Red Indians"; it was specifically trained in lock-picking, safe-cracking, forms of unarmed combat, and other techniques and skills for collecting intelligence. He meticulously planned all their raids, alongside [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]] (one of the [[Inspirations for James Bond]]), going so far as to memorize aerial photographs so that their missions could be planned in detail; because of their successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU was greatly enlarged and Fleming's direct control was increased before [[D-Day]]. 

Fleming even visited 30AU in the field during and after [[Operation Overlord]], especially after the [[Cherbourg]] attack, in which he felt that the unit had been incorrectly used as a frontline force rather than as an intelligence gathering unit, and from then on tactics were revised.

It is often reported, and perpetuated by Fleming, that he travelled to [[Whitby, Ontario]] to train at [[Camp X]], a top secret training school for [[Allied]] forces. However, this is most likely untrue, as no evidence of Fleming having been at Camp X has ever been uncovered, nor do any of the staff recall Fleming ever having been there.<ref>{{cite book | author = Chancellor, Henry | year = 2005 | title = James Bond: The Man and His World | publisher = John Murray | id = ISBN 0-7195-6815-3}}</ref>

===Writing career===
{{Cleanup|date=May 2006}}
As the DNI's personal assistant, Fleming's intelligence work provided the background for his spy novels. In 1953, he published his first novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. In it he introduced secret agent [[James Bond]], also famously known by his code number, [[007]], which indicates that he has a licence to kill.  Bond appears with the beautiful heroine Vesper Lynd, who was modeled on SOE agent [[Krystyna Skarbek|Christine Granville]]. Ideas for his characters and settings for Bond came from his time at [[Boodle's]]. Blade's, Bond's club, is partially modelled on Boodle's and the name of Bond's arch enemy, [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], was based on a fellow member's name.

Initially Fleming's Bond novels were not bestsellers in America, but when President [[John F. Kennedy]] included ''From Russia With Love'' on a list of his favorite books, sales quickly jumped.  Fleming wrote 14 Bond books in all: ''Casino Royale'' (1953), ''Live and Let Die'' (1954), ''Moonraker'' (1955), ''Diamonds are Forever'' (1956), ''From Russia With Love'' (1957), ''Dr. No'' (1958),'' Goldfinger'' (1959), ''For Your Eyes Only'' (1960),'' Thunderball'' (1961), ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1962), ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1963), ''You Only Live Twice'' (1964), ''The Man With The Golden Gun'' (1965), and ''Octopussy/The Living Daylights'' (1966).

In the late 1950s, the financial success of Fleming's James Bond series allowed him to retire to Goldeneye, his Jamaican estate. The name of the house and estate where he wrote his novels honours [[Operation Goldeneye]], an anti-Nazi operation he had created during his wartime career. The origin of the name is clearly from his wartime career, rather than being derived from some other likely sources, such the place name [[Oracabessa]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'head of gold') or the novel ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'', by ''[[Carson McCullers]]''.

''[[The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1962) stylistically departs from other books in the Bond series as it is written in the [[first person]] perspective of the (fictional) protagonist, Vivienne Michel, whom Fleming credits as co-author. It is the story of her life, up until when James Bond serendipitously rescues her from the wrong circumstance at the wrong place and time. 

Besides writing twelve [[novel]]s and nine [[short story|short stories]] featuring James Bond, Fleming also wrote the children's novel ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

In 1961, he sold the film rights to his already published as well as future James Bond novels and short stories to [[Harry Saltzman]], who, with [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli]], co-produced the film version of ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1962). For the cast, Fleming suggested friend and neighbour [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] as the villain [[Dr. Julius No]], and [[David Niven]] or, later, [[Roger Moore]] as James Bond.  Both were rejected in favour of Sean Connery, Broccoli and Saltzman's choice. Fleming also suggested his cousin, [[Christopher Lee]], either as Dr. No or even as James Bond. Although Lee was selected for neither role, in 1974 he portrayed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the eponymous villain of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. 

Neither Saltzman nor Broccoli expected "Dr. No" to be much of a success, but it was an instant sensation and sparked a spy craze through the rest of the 1960s.  

The successful "Dr. No" was followed by "[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]" (1963), the second and last James Bond movie Ian Fleming saw.  

During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]]s, which many [[Greek people|Greek]] and some [[Turkish people|Turkish]] scholars attributed to secret orchestrations by [[Britain]], Fleming wrote an account of the events, "The Great Riot of Istanbul", which was published in the ''Sunday Times'', on [[11 September]] [[1955]].

===Later life===
[[Image:LifeFleming.jpg|thumb|right|Ian Fleming. [[LIFE]] Cover.]]
Fleming was a [[bibliophile]] who collected a library of books that had, in his opinion,  "started something", and therefore were significant in the history of Western Civilization. He concentrated on science and technology, e.g. ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', yet he also collected sociological milestones such as ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and ''[[Scouting for Boys]]''. He was a major lender to the 1963 exhibition [[Printing and the Mind of Man]]. Currently, some six hundred books from Fleming's collection are in the Lilly Library at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A.

Fifty-six-year-old Ian Fleming died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] the morning of [[August 12]] [[1964]], in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], England, U.K., and later was buried in the churchyard cemetery of [[Sevenhampton, Wiltshire|Sevenhampton]] village, near [[Swindon]]. Upon their own deaths, Fleming's widow (Ann Geraldine Mary Fleming ([[1913]]&ndash;[[1981]])) and son ([[Caspar Robert Fleming]] ([[1952]]&ndash;[[1975]])) were buried next to him.

;Notes
<sup>1</sup> First U.S. paperback edition was retitled ''You Asked for It''.<br>
<sup>2</sup> First U.S. paperback edition was retitled ''Too Hot to Handle''.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Short story collection: (i) "From a View to a Kill," (ii) "For Your Eyes Only," (iii) "Risico," (iv) "Quantum of Solace", and (v) "The Hildebrand Rarity."<br>
<sup>4</sup> Subject of a legal battle over story credit which led to the book's storyline also being credited to [[Kevin McClory]] and [[Jack Whittingham]]; see [[Thunderball (novel)#The controversy over the novel|the controversy over ''Thunderball'']]<br>
<sup>5</sup> Fleming gives co-author credit to "Vivienne Michel", the fictional heroine of the book; Fleming refused to allow a paperback edition to be published in the UK, but one was eventually published after his death. His agreement with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman only allowed the use of the title for a movie.<br>
<sup>6</sup> For years, it has been alleged that [[Kingsley Amis]], and/or others, completed this novel as Fleming died before a finished manuscript was created. Many Fleming biographers dispute this; see [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)#The controversy over the novel|the controversy over ''The Man With The Golden Gun'']].<br>
<sup>7</sup> Posthumously compiled short story collection. Originally published with two stories: (i) "Octopussy" and (ii) "The Living Daylights". The 1967 paperback edition's title was shortened to ''Octopussy'' and a third story, "The Property of a Lady", increased its page count. In the 1990s, the collection's longer, original title was restored, and with the 2002 edition, the story, "007 in New York" (originally published in some editions of ''Thrilling Cities'' (see below) was added.

===Unfinished/unpublished works===
* Fleming kept a scrapbook containing notes and ideas for future James Bond stories. It included fragments of possible short stories or novels featuring Bond that were never published. Excerpts from some of these can be found in ''The Life of Ian Fleming'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]].<ref>http://www.ajb007.co.uk/articles/007/scrapbook/ </ref>

* The author [[Geoffrey Jenkins]] worked with Fleming on a James Bond story idea between 1957 and 1964. After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] to turn this story, ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'', into a novel, but it was never published.

*In 1960 Fleming was commissioned by the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] to write a book on the country and its oil industry. The typescript was titled ''State of Excitement'' but was never published as the Kuwait Oil Company "did not like its tone".<ref>http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200604/james-bond </ref>
