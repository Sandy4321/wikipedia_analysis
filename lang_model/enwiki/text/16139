The '''Large Black''', occasionally called the Devon or Cornwall Black, is a breed of [[domestic pig]] native to [[Great Britain]], particularly [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Essex]]. The Large Black is accurately named, as it is a large swine breed and is the only British pig that is entirely black. It is a hardy and docile pig, with Large Black [[wiktionary:sow#Noun|sows]] known for having large [[litter]]s. The breed's foraging ability make it particularly useful for [[extensive farming]], while a poor candidate for [[intensive farming]].

The Large Black combined local black pig breeds from the [[West Country]] and the [[East of England]]. With the founding of a [[breed association]] in 1898 or 1899, variations between the types from the two areas decreased. The Large Black was popular in the early 1900s and was exported to many areas of the world. Population numbers declined after the [[World War II|Second World War]] as farmers turned to breeds more suitable to [[intensive pig farming]], and by the 1960s the breed was almost extinct. Numbers have slowly risen, but it is still considered vulnerable by the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]], the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]], and [[Rare Breeds Canada]].

== History ==
The Large Black resulted from the amalgamation of black pigs from two geographically separate areas, [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in the south-west of England, and [[Essex]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Kent]] in the east.<ref name="RB" /><ref name="case">{{cite book | title = Beautiful Pigs: portraits of fine breeds | date = 2009 | author = Case, Andy | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UPJ4AaB4vkEC | page = 36 | publisher = London: Frances Lincoln | isbn = 978-0-7112-3059-0 }}</ref> The pigs from eastern England, mainly Essex, were influenced by importations from China in the late 18th century, while those from Devon and Cornwall were probably more closely related to the pigs in mainland Europe, particularly France.<ref name="RB">{{cite book | title = Rare Breeds | author = Alderson, Lawrence | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_3HZzMeMo_0C | year = 2001 | publisher = Princes Risborough: Shire Publications | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-0-7478-0511-3 | pages = 27<U+2013>28 | accessdate = 2012-03-20 }}</ref><ref name=OSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/swine/largeblack/index.htm|title=Large Black|publisher=Oklahoma State University|accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> The Devon pigs were originally selected for "the length of their bodies, ears, noses, tail and hair, the longer the better, without reference to quality or substance", but selective breeding brought improvements to the breed, and by 1850 the type was small-boned and thick-bodied, with good conformation and constitution.<ref name="Plumb">{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=GbxBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA762&dq=Large+Black+pig#v=onepage&q=Large%20Black%20pig&f=false | title = Types and Breeds of Farm Animals | author = Plumb, Charles Sumner | page = 762 | publisher = Ginn | date = 1920 | series = Country life education }}</ref> Alternative origins proposed for the black colour of the breed are black Guinea hogs imported from Africa (similar to the [[Guinea Hog]] of the US) or from [[Province of Naples|Neapolitan]] pigs.<ref name="Dohner">{{cite book | author = Janet Vorwald Dohner | title = The encyclopedia of historic and endangered livestock and poultry breeds | year = 2001 | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 978-0-300-08880-9 | pages = 189<U+2013>190 }}</ref>

During the late 19th century, the Large Black grew in popularity.<ref name="Dohner" /> A [[breed registry|breed association]], the Large Black Pig Society, was formed in 1898 or 1899,<ref name="miller">{{cite web | url = http://www.rbta.org/lgeblack.htm | title = Rare Breeds Trust of Australia: The Large Black | publisher = Rare Breeds Trust of Australia | author= Miller, Megg | accessdate = 2012-01-11 | date = 2001 }}</ref><ref name="ag&fish" /> in [[Ipswich]], Suffolk.<ref name="wall">{{cite book | title = Farm Live Stock of Great Britain | author = Wallace, Robert | edition = 4th | publisher = Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd; London: Gurney and Jackson | date= 1907 | page= 718 }}</ref> A trademark, consisting of the letters LBP within a shield, was registered in 1902.<ref name="miller" />

===1920s to modern times===

In 1919 a Large Black sow was Supreme Champion at Smithfield, and at the Royal Show that year 121 Large Blacks were entered, more than any other breed.<ref name="PigAssociation" /> Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s, however, and after World War II, population numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds that would do well in intensive indoor farming.<ref name="ALBC" /> The breed association was merged with the National Pig Breeders Association (later the British Pig Association) in 1949.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.largeblackpigs.co.uk/ | title = Breed History | publisher = Large Black Pigbreeders Club | accessdate = 2011-12-18 }}</ref>

In 1955 the Howitt report on the development of pig production in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only: the [[Welsh (pig)|Welsh]], the [[British Landrace]], and the [[Large White (pig)|Large White]].<ref name="trad3">{{cite book|author = Advisory Committee on Development of Pig Production in the United Kingdom | title = Development of pig production in the United Kingdom: Report of the Advisory Committee on Development of Pig Production in the United Kingdom | publisher = London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office|date= 1955}}, cited at: {{cite web | url = http://www.britishpigs.org.uk/trad3.htm | title = Official Policy to Focus on a Single Type of Pig | publisher = The British Pig Association | accessdate = 2012-01-10 }}</ref> The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including the Large Black. By the time the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct.<ref name="trad4">{{cite web | url = http://www.britishpigs.org.uk/trad4.htm | title = More Breeds are Lost | publisher = The British Pig Association | accessdate = 2012-01-10 }}</ref><ref name="trad5">{{cite web | url = http://www.britishpigs.org.uk/trad5.htm | title = The Tide Begins to Turn | publisher = The British Pig Association | accessdate = 2012-01-10 }}</ref> The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.<ref name="ALBC">{{cite web | url = http://albc-usa.org/cpl/largeblack.html | title = Large Black Pig | publisher = American Livestock Breeds Conservancy | accessdate = 2011-08-22 }}</ref>

===Outside of Britain===
By 1913, Large Black had by then spread throughout most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania.<ref name="ag&fish">{{cite book| title = British Breeds of Live Stock | author= Board of Agriculture and Fisheries | publisher= London: His Majesty's Stationery Office | date = 1913 | edition = Second | url= http://www.archive.org/stream/britishbreedsofl00grearich#page/n5/mode/2up }}</ref> The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the [[Berkshire pig]] because of their ability to thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s.<ref name="miller"/> The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985.<ref name="Dohner" /> Today, small herds can be found in the US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.<ref name=OSU/>

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Large Black pig close-up.jpg|thumb|The Large Black is notable for its very large ears, which often obscure its vision.]]
The Large Black is a long, deep-bodied pig, well known for its hardiness and suitability for [[extensive farming]].<ref name="Ekarius">{{cite book|author=Carol Ekarius | title = Storey's illustrated breed guide to sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs: 163 breeds from common to rare|year=2008 | publisher = Storey Publishing | isbn = 978-1-60342-036-5 | page = 197 }}</ref> Large Blacks are best suited for [[pasture]]-based farming due to their strong [[foraging]] and [[grazing]] ability, which efficiently converts poor quality feed into meat.<ref name="RBST"/><ref name="ALBC"/><ref name="Dohner" /> It is the only pig breed in Britain to be all black,<ref name="PigAssociation" /> and this helps protect the pig from [[sunburn]] in sunny climates.<ref name="Dohner" /><ref name="RBST"/> Temperamentally, the Large Black is a very [[:wiktionary:docile|docile]] breed which is easily contained by fencing. This is partly because its large, drooping ears obscure its vision,<ref name="RB" /><ref name="Dohner" /> although they also help to protect the face and eyes while the animal is foraging, especially when [[:wiktionary:root#Verb 2|rooting]] in dirt.<ref name="ALBC"/>

The breed is also known for its long periods of fertility and strong maternal instincts. Sows give birth to a large [[litter (animal)|litter]] of 8<U+2013>10 piglets, but some sows have been known to have litters of up to 13 piglets.<ref name="RB" /> Also of note is the Large Black sow listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' for having produced 26 litters between 1940 and 1952 <U+2013> the largest number of litters ever recorded for a pig.<ref name="RBST" /> Boars weigh {{convert|700|to|800|lbs|kg}} and sows around {{convert|600|to|700|lbs|kg}}, although obesity in sows sometimes results in [[Ovarian cyst|cystic ovaries]] and a loss of fertility.<ref name="ALBC" /> The breed has become larger over the years; in the early 1900s, weights averaged {{convert|500|lbs|kg}} for sows and larger for boars.<ref name="Plumb" />

At its peak of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, especially [[bacon]].<ref name="Ekarius" /> The meat from the Large Black is known for its lean quality and flavour without an excess of [[Fatback |back fat]],<ref name="PigAssociation" /><ref name="Dohner" /> but for commercial production it was often crossed with the [[Yorkshire pig|Yorkshire]] and [[Middle White]] pigs,<ref name="ALBC" /><ref name="Dohner" /> producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers.<ref name="ALBC" /> However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.<ref name=OSU/>

In 1954 there were 2195 Large Black pigs recorded, 269 licensed boars and 1926 registered sows, representing approximately 3.4% of the UK pig population of about 65,000.<ref name="trad1">{{cite web | url = http://www.britishpigs.org.uk/trad1.htm | title = Our Unique Genetic Heritage: The Decline of Traditional Breeds | publisher = The British Pig Association | accessdate = 2012-01-11 }}</ref> At the end of 2011 there were 421 Large Black pigs (86 boars and 335 sows) registered, a small increase over the 2010 figure of 405 (65 boars, 340 sows).

In 2004 the [[Rare Breeds Trust of Australia]] listed the status of the Large Black as "critical", meaning that sow registrations in the Australian Pure Bred Pig Herd Book of the Australian Pig Breeders Association were fewer than 30 per year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rbta.org/Pdf%20Files/Status%20of%20Rare%20Breeds%20in%20Australia%20v10.pdf | title = Status of Rare Breeds of Domestic Farm Livestock in Australia 2004|page=17|format=PDF|author=Chambers, Fiona | publisher = Rare Breeds Trust of Australia|date=June 2004 | accessdate = 2012-02-09 }}</ref>

The [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] estimated the Large Black population of the United States at 300 breeding hogs in 2008, and lists its status as "critical", which means that fewer than 200 animals are registered each year in the United States, and there are estimated to be fewer than 2,000 worldwide. The US population of Large Black pigs stood at around 300 as of 2008. Besides conservation for the sake of genetic diversity in livestock, the breed is also coming to be seen as a good option for fulfilling the needs of an increasing number of consumers interested in pasture-raised pork.<ref name="ALBC"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://albc-usa.org/cpl/wtchlist.html | title = Breed Information <U+2013> ALBC Conservation Priority List | publisher = American Livestock Breeds Conservancy | accessdate = 2011-08-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://albc-usa.org/cpl/parameters-livestock.html | title = Parameters of Livestock Breeds on the ALBC Conservation Priority List (2007) | publisher = American Livestock Breeds Conservancy | accessdate = 2011-08-22 }}</ref> [[Rare Breeds Canada]] identified the single remaining Canadian herd in 1997,<ref name="Dohner" /> and has since included the breed on its conservation watchlist as "endangered", with fewer than 500 of the animals in that country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rarebreedscanada.ca/pigbreeds.htm | title = Pig Breeds | publisher = Rare Breeds Canada | accessdate = 2012-01-15 }}</ref>
