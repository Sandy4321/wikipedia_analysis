'''Aaron Charles Rodgers''' (born December 2, 1983) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Rodgers was selected in the first round (24th overall) of the [[2005 NFL Draft]] by the Packers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?season=2005&round=round1 |title=National Football League: NFL Draft History |publisher=NFL.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Rodgers played [[college football]] while attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he set several [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]] records, including lowest interception rate at 1.43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/rodgers_aaron00.html |title=Player Bio: Aaron Rodgers |publisher=The University of California Official Athletic Site |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

Professionally, Rodgers is the NFL's all-time career leader in passer rating during both the regular season (98.4), and in the post-season (112.6) <U+2013> among passers with at least 1,500 and 150 pass attempts respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm |title=NFL Career Passer Rating Leaders |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> He also owns the league's lowest career pass interception percentage for quarterbacks during the regular season (1.99%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_int_perc_career.htm |title=NFL Career Pass Interception % Leaders |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>

==Early years==
Rodgers was born in [[Chico, California|Chico]] in [[Butte County, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/players/7200/|title=Aaron Rodgers <U+2013> #12 <U+2013> QB|publisher&nbsp;<U+2014> Sports Illustrated/CNN|accessdate= February 6, 2011}}</ref>  He attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School in [[Beaverton, Oregon]], playing baseball in the [[Raleigh Hills, Oregon|Raleigh Hills]] Little League at the positions of shortstop, center field and pitcher.<ref name="Oregonian">{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/beaverton/index.ssf/2011/02/green_bay_quarterback_aaron_rodgers_has_strong_ties_to_beaverton.html |title=Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers has strong ties to Beaverton |date=2011-02-05 |publisher=The Oregonian |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> He returned to Chico in 1997 and attended [[Pleasant Valley High School (California)|Pleasant Valley High School]], starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards.

Rodgers also set a single-season record with 2,466 total yards in 2001 and graduated in the spring of 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.krcrtv.com/news/26754870/detail.html|title= Aaron Rodgers' High School Cheers for the Packers|publisher= KRCRTV.Com|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afcwest/post/_/id/23903/page/espntexas/aaron-rodgers-is-chicos-man|title= Aaron Rodgers is Chico's man|publisher=ESPN.Com|work=AFC West Blog|author=Bill Williamson|date= February 1, 2011|accessdate= February 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnb.scout.com/a.z?s=61&p=8&c=1&nid=2983568|title= #12 Aaron Rodgers|publisher=Scout with FoxSports.Com|work= Packer Report|accessdate= February 6, 2011}}</ref>

==College career==
===2002===
Despite his record-setting statistics, Rodgers, who measured at 5-foot-10 and weighed 165 pounds as a senior,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/20110205aaron_rodgers_fights_off_brett_favre_legacy_to_build_his_own/srvc=sports&position=recent_bullet|title=Aaron Rodgers fights off Brett Favre legacy to build his own| publisher= Boston Herald.Com(Associated Press)|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate= February 6, 2011}}</ref> both undersized for [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] quarterbacks, garnered little interest from programs with only one offer, that of a [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] from [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]. He declined the invitation and attended [[Butte Community College]] in [[Oroville, California|Oroville]], about 15 miles (25&nbsp;km) southeast of Chico.  In his freshman season, he threw 28 touchdowns while leading Butte to a 10<U+2013>1 record, a NorCal Conference championship, and a No. 2 national ranking. While there, Rodgers was discovered by the [[California Golden Bears football|Bears]] head coach [[Jeff Tedford]], who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross. Because he had a 3.6 grade point average and [[SAT]] score of 1300 out of high school, Rodgers was  eligible to transfer after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.<ref name="Cal's QB Hope">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/08/03/SP275334.DTL |title=Cal's QB hope: JC transfer Rodgers has what Tedford like |author=Bruce Adams |date=2003-08-03 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>

===2003===
As a [[junior college]] transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]]. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, coincidentally against the only team that offered him a Division I opportunity out of high school, [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]]. As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7<U+2013>3 record as a starter.<ref>[http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/rodgers_aaron00.html "Player Bio: Aaron Rodgers"] Official Website of Cal Athletics</ref> Against the then-No. 3 ranked [[2004 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21<U+2013>7 halftime lead before being replaced due to injury in the second half by Reggie Robertson.<ref name=calfans/><ref>{{cite web |title=Cal-USC Postgame Quotes |date=September 27, 2003 |publisher=Cal Athletics |url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/092703aac.html |quote=After the interception for the touchdown, I went over to him and said 'Do you want to take a couple of series off?' and he said 'Yes.'

In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with 5 and set a school record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.<ref name="cstv.com">Rodger's NFL career passing rating through week 11 of the 2010<U+2013>11 season is 96.9.

===2004===
As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10<U+2013>1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss coming in a closely contested and well-played game at #1 [[2004 USC Trojans football team|USC]], 17<U+2013>23. In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game. Rodgers set a school single game record for passing completion, completing 85.3% of his passes in that game. Rodgers also holds the school career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95%.<ref name="cstv.com"/>  Despite these records, the Bears had 1st and goal with 1:47 remaining and could not score a winning touchdown. The game-ending sequence included three incomplete passes and a sack by USC.<ref>[[2004 USC Trojans football team]]</ref>

After [[2004 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] was picked over Cal for a [[2005 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] berth, the fourth-ranked Bears earned a spot in the [[2004 Holiday Bowl|Holiday Bowl]], but lost to [[2004 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]], 45<U+2013>31.<ref>[[California Golden Bears football]]</ref> After the season, Rodgers decided to forego his senior season (without a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]]) to enter the [[2005 NFL Draft]].

==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
====Backup seasons (2005<U+2013>2007)====
[[Image:Aaron Rodgers.jpg|thumb|150px|Rodgers in September 2007]]
Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the [[2005 NFL Draft]] and was thought of as the potential number one pick overall.  He had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rating. He had tied an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record when he completed 23 consecutive passes against the eventual national champions, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|USC]]. He threw for 24 [[touchdown]]s and only 8 [[interception]]s in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. Rodgers' slip to the 24th choice became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. The [[San Francisco 49ers]], who held the first overall pick, were not interested in Rodgers as then-49ers head coach [[Mike Nolan]], a strong personality, did not believe that Rodgers' attitude could co-exist with him.  The 49ers would select quarterback [[Alex Smith]].<ref>{{cite |last=Peterson|first=Gary|title=Peterson: 49ers fans can play fantasy football over Aaron Rodgers vs. Alex Smith and Mike McCarthy vs. Mike Nolan|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=January 26, 2001|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/49ers/ci_17199568?nclick_check=1|accessdate=January 26, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w2fU2O58|archivedate=January 26, 2011|quote=Nolan was no-nonsense, a strong personality who didn't like to be challenged. He met with Rodgers and Smith before the draft. He caught a whiff of attitude from Rodgers, and that was that.}}</ref> In addition to the fact that many  teams drafting between second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback, Rodgers' moderate height (6'2") may have contributed to his precipitous slide.  Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by [[Jeff Tedford]] to be drafted in the first round, joining [[Akili Smith]], [[Trent Dilfer]], [[Joey Harrington]], and [[Kyle Boller]].

In August 2005 at age 21, Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met.

Rodgers spent a disappointing 4<U+2013>12 [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|2005 season]] as the Packers' back-up quarterback behind [[Brett Favre]]. Rodgers had little playing time during the year, but played in a win against the [[New Orleans Saints]] and in a loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

When Favre decided to continue his career into the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006 season]], Rodgers was forced to continue in his role as the second quarterback on the depth chart.

On November 19, 2006, Rodgers broke his left foot against the New England Patriots in a 35<U+2013>0 defeat at home while filling in for an injured Brett Favre and missed the remainder of the 2006 season. Rodgers made a full recovery and was ready for the start of the 2007 season.

Weeks after an emotional interview with NBC's Andrea Kramer following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced he would stay with the Packers for the [[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007 season]], again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Green Bay Packers' starting quarterback. Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for wide receiver [[Randy Moss]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2803272 |title=Packers GM insists QB Rodgers not on trading block |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-03-18 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>  However, Moss was traded to the [[New England Patriots]] during the second day of the [[2007 NFL Draft]], and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.

Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on [[Thursday Night Football]] on November 29, 2007. Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions. He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times. Rodgers brought the team back from a 17 point deficit to a 3 point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37<U+2013>27.

====Starting seasons====
=====2008=====
[[Brett Favre]]'s retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008 season]]. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the [[New York Jets]], meaning Rodgers would remain the starter.<ref>JSOnline. http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=726140</ref>

With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 24<U+2013>19 at [[Lambeau Field]]. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and 2 touchdowns (1 passing/1 rushing).<ref name="Miami victory">{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/09/08/7/ |title=Rodgers Strong In Starting Debut |accessdate=2008-09-10 |author=Tom Fanning |date=2008-09-08 |work=Packers.com |publisher=National Football League}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air award]] winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the [[Detroit Lions]].<ref name="FedEx Air and Ground Winners Week 2 2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80af20df |title=FedEx Air and Ground Week 2 2008 Winners |accessdate=2008-09-20 |author=NFL Network |date=2008-09-20 |work=NFL Network |publisher=National Football League }}</ref> During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by [[Derrick Brooks]] of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

=====2009=====
For the opening game of the [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009 season]], Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the 4th quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty yard touchdown pass to [[wide receiver]] [[Greg Jennings]] with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21<U+2013>15 victory over the [[Chicago Bears]].<ref name="NFL Game Center Chicago Bears @ Green Bay Packers">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091312/2009/REG1/bears@packers |title=NFL Game Center Chicago Bears @ Green Bay Packers |accessdate=2009-11-02 |author=NFL.com |date=2009-11-02 |work=NFL.com |publisher=NFL.com }}</ref> Rodgers was named [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.<ref name="QB Aaron Rodgers Named NFC Offensive Player Of The Month For October ">{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2009/10/29/1/ |title=QB Aaron Rodgers Named NFC Offensive Player Of The Month For October |accessdate=2009-11-02 |author=Packers.com |date=2009-11-02 |work=Packers.com |publisher=Packers.com }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> After a mediocre 4<U+2013>4 start to the season and a devastating loss to the previously winless [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], the team began to heat up.

Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7<U+2013>1 record and an overall 11<U+2013>5 record; good enough to secure a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs. Rodgers also made the record books, becoming the first [[quarterback]] in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2009/12/30/2/ |title=Rodgers' Season Draws Praise |accessdate=2010-01-25 |author=Green Bay Packers |publisher=Packers.com }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only [[Lynn Dickey]]'s all-time single-season record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prod.static.packers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2010mediaguide_records.pdf#page=6 |title=Individual Records&nbsp;<U+2014> Passing |accessdate=2011-01-08 |author=Green Bay Packers |publisher=Packers.com }}</ref>

In his first action as a starter in the playoffs against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Rodgers's first pass was intercepted by [[Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie]]. Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game 28 of 42 for 422 yards with four touchdowns. Despite Rodger's offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on the last play of the game in overtime. The ball was returned by [[Karlos Dansby]] for the winning touchdown in the 51<U+2013>45 Cardinals victory. It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.<ref name="NFL Game Center Green Bay Packers @ Arizona Cardinals">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010011000/2009/POST18/packers@cardinals#tab:recap |title=NFL Game Center Green Bay Packers @ Arizona Cardinals |accessdate=2010-01-15 |author=NFL.com |date=2010-01-10 |work=NFL.com |publisher=NFL.com }}</ref>

Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first [[Pro Bowl]] as the NFC's third Quarterback behind [[Drew Brees]] and [[Brett Favre]]. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in [[Super Bowl XLIV]], Rodgers became the NFC's starter for the game. He finished the day 15 of 19 passing with 197 yards and two touchdowns, despite the NFC losing the game.

===Touchdown celebration===
Since becoming a starter, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration which he and his teammates have dubbed "the Championship Belt".  After a significant play (more specially, on any scoring plays) Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible belt on around his waist.<ref>http://realfantasy.sportspagenetwork.com/2011/01/The-Evolution-Of-Aaron-Rodgers-Weird-Belt-Dance.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.sportsgrid.com/nfl/aaron-rodgers-championship-belt-celebration/</ref>  Teammate [[Greg Jennings]] said of the celebration: "It's just something fun that he does.  We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense."<ref name="youtube1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcwa2EvQ61Y</ref>  The gesture drew the praise of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] wrestler [[Triple H]] and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic the celebration as a point of pride during games.<ref name="youtube1"/>

During the NFC Divisional Round of the playoffs on January 15, 2011 against the [[Atlanta Falcons]], Rodgers was sacked by Falcons defensive tackle [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] who performed the celebration immediately following the play.  It was Abraham's only sack of the night.  Minutes later, Rodgers scored a rushing touchdown and did the celebration in the Falcons' endzone.  The Packers went on to win the game 48<U+2013>21.<ref name="youtube1"/>

After scoring a touchdown in the [[2010<U+2013>11 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Green Bay Packers 21, Chicago Bears 14|NFC Championship game]], fellow Packer [[B. J. Raji]] celebrated using the "Championship Belt" celebration.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dO828YUmlg</ref>

While holding the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Lombardi Trophy]] after winning [[Super Bowl XLV]], Rodgers' teammate [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] placed a replica of the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] belt on Rodgers shoulder.
