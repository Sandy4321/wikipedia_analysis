'''Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park''' belongs to the [[California State Historic Park]] system, a part of the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Malakoff Diggins is the site of [[California]]'s largest [[hydraulic mining|hydraulic mines]]. It is a 26 mile (42&nbsp;km) drive north-east of [[Nevada City, California]] in the Gold Rush country.<ref name="wildernet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?areaid=CASPMALDIGGIN&cu_id=157 |title=Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park, California State Parks, Beaches and Historic Parks |publisher=Wildernet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

The "canyon" is {{convert|7000|ft|m}} long, as much as {{convert|3000|ft|m}} wide, and nearly {{convert|600|ft|m}} deep in places. Visitors can see huge cliffs carved by mighty streams of water, results of the [[hydraulic mining]] technique of washing away entire mountains of gravel to wash out the gold. 

==History==
[[File:MalakoffDigginsStatePark.jpg|thumb|right|Former hydraulic mine at Malakoff Diggins]]
While beautiful in its own way, the Malakoff mine pit on the [[San Juan Ridge]] is a testimony to the avarice that was part of the [[California gold rush]], and to one of the nation's first [[Environmental Movement|environmental protection]] measures. 
 
In 1850 there was little gold left in streams. Miners began to discover gold in old riverbeds and on mountainsides high above the streams. In 1851, three miners headed northeast of what is now Nevada City for a less crowded area to prospect. One miner went back to town with a pocket full of gold nuggets for supplies and was followed back by many prospectors. These followers, however, did not find any gold and declared the area "Humbug", thus the stream was so named "Humbug Creek". Around 1852, settlers began to arrive in the area and the town of "Humbug" sprang up. These miners could not decide how to move the dirt to a place where there was water.<ref name="ghosttownexplorers1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghosttownexplorers.org/california/bloomfield/bloomfield.htm |title=North Bloomfield |publisher=Ghosttownexplorers.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

By 1853 miners invented a new method of mining called [[hydraulic mining]]. Dams were built high in the mountains. The water traveled from the reservoirs through a wooden canal called a [[flume]] that was up to forty-five miles long. The water ran swiftly to the canvas hoses and nozzles called monitors waiting in the old river beds. The miners would aim the monitors at the hillsides to wash the gravel into huge sluices. Over time the monitors became bigger and more powerful. Their force was so great they could toss a fifty pound rock like a cannonball or even kill a person. Over 300 Chinese worked on this project and two Chinese settlements existed in North Bloomfield. 

By 1857 the town had grown to 500 residents. Locals felt the name "Humbug" was too undignified and renamed the town "Bloomfield", but California already had a town by this name so they renamed the town "North Bloomfield".

In the late 1860s, the towns of [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Yuba City]] were buried under {{convert|25|ft|m}} of mud and rock, and [[Sacramento]] flooded repeatedly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/qtvr-malakoff.html |title=Onsite Adventures - Malakoff |publisher=Museumca.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>
The farmers in the valleys complained about the tailings that flooded their land and ruined their crops. Thousands of acres of rich farmland and property were destroyed as a result of hydraulic mining.

By 1876, the mine was in full operation with 7 giant water cannons working around the clock. The town had grown to a population of around 2000 with various business and daily stage service. 

In 1880, electric lights were installed in the mine and the world<U+2019>s first long distance telephone line was developed to service the mine, passing through North Bloomfield as it made its way from [[French Corral]] to [[Bowman Lake (California)|Bowman Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghosttown.info/ca/northbloomfield/index.html |title=North Bloomfield, CA |publisher=Ghosttown.info |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

By 1883, San Francisco Bay was estimated to be filling with silt at a rate of one foot per year.<ref name="ghosttownexplorers1"/>  Debris, silt, and millions of gallons of water used daily by the mine caused extensive flooding, prompting Sacramento valley farmers to file the lawsuit ''Woodruff v. [[North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company]]''. On January 7, 1884 Judge [[Lorenzo Sawyer]] declared hydraulic mining illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calgoldrush.com/travel/malakoff.html |title=Travel - Malakoff Diggins is pure gold |publisher=Calgoldrush.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

==Climate==
At an altitude of {{convert|3248|ft|m}}, Malakoff Diggins generally has warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Weather can change rapidly any time of the year.  Rain and snow fall usually from October until April, though there may be thunderstorm activity in the summer as well.<ref name="wildernet1"/>

==North Bloomfield==
The visitor center has exhibits depicting life in the old mining town of [[North Bloomfield, California|North Bloomfield]], with a past population of 1,500 that served as a supply base for the Diggins. About a block of buildings, some dating to the 1850s, are restored or re-created in a Gold Rush style, including white picket fences. One of the buildings is used as park headquarters and there's a museum with old artifacts, and a model showing how hydraulics worked. In summer, park rangers lead tours through a general store, a furnished home, and a drugstore whose shelves are lined with bottles, boxes and vials of medicines. A church, schoolhouse and other buildings are also part of the tour. 

Park facilities include hiking trails, picnic area, swimming and fishing, a campground and rustic cabins that can be rented by campers. 
 
Humbug Days, including a parade and BBQ, is an annual event.<ref>http://www.auburnjournal.com/articles/2007/06/08/news/arts_and_entertainment/03t2djune8.txt</ref>

==Hiking and trails==
[[File:Hiller Tunnel, Malakoff Diggins.jpg|thumb|Looking out the Hiller Tunnel near Malakoff Diggins.]]
Visitors to the {{convert|3000|acre|adj=on}} state historic park can hike on miles of trails. The mining pit is unfenced and accessible from the road and pathways that surround it. Hikers can enter the {{convert|556|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Hiller Tunnel, through which water for the mining operation once flowed. The park also contains a {{convert|7847|ft|m|adj=on}} bedrock tunnel that served as a drain. Other hiking includes:<ref>[http://www.nevadacitychamber.com/area_hike.htm ]{{dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/sdw_report_v2.first_table?pws_id=CA2910301&state=CA&source=Surface_water&population=2&sys_num=1 |title=EPA &#124; Envirofacts Warehouse &#124; SDWIS |publisher=Oaspub.epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

==Proposed for closure==
Malakoff Diggins is one of the 48 [[List of California state parks|California state parks]] proposed for closure in January 2008 by California's Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as part of a deficit reduction program since rescinded following public outcry.<ref>[http://cbs5.com/local/California.parks.budget.2.627476.html CBS5.com: List Of Calif.
