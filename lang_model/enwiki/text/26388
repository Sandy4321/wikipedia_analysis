[[Image:DreyschockLitho.jpg|thumb]]'''Alexander Dreyschock''' ([[October 15]], [[1818]] - [[April 1]], [[1869]]) was a Czech [[pianist]] and [[composer]].

Born in [[<U+017D><U+00E1>ky]] in [[Bohemia]], his musical talents were first noticed at age of eight, and at age fifteen he travelled to [[Prague]] to study piano and composition with [[V<U+00E1>clav Tom<U+00E1><U+0161>ek]]. By the age of twenty, Dreyshock undertook his first professional tour in December 1838, performing in various northern and central towns in [[Germany]].

Subsequent tours saw Alexander visiting [[Russia]] (1840-42); [[Paris]] (spring 1843); [[London]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] (1846); and [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] in 1849. Elsewhere he caused a sensation with prodigious execution of thirds, sixths, and octaves, plus other tricks. When he made his Paris debut in 1843 he included a piece for the left hand alone. Dreyschock's left-hand was renowned, and his most famous technical stunt was to play the left-hand arpeggios of Chopin's [[Etude op. 10 no. 12|Revolutionary <U+00C9>tude]] in octaves. Observers of the time report that he played it in correct tempo, and it is known that he programmed it in all of his recitals.<ref>Schoenberg, Harold C., ''The Great Pianists''</ref>

In 1862 Dreyschock became a staff member at the newly-founded [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St. Petersburg Conservatory]] at [[Anton Rubinstein]]'s invitation. He was appointed Court Pianist to the Tsar as well as Director of the Imperial School of Music for the Operatic Stage. He maintained this double post for six years, but his health suffered from the Russian climate. He moved to [[Italy]] in 1868 and died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Venice]] on [[April 1]], [[1869]] at the age of fifty-one. At the wish of his family he was buried in Prague.
