{{for|an account of the club's history before 1961|History of Aston Villa F.C. (1874<U+2013>1961)}}
The history of [[Aston Villa F.C.]] from 1961 to the current season covers the fluctuating fortunes of the club during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[European Cup]] victory in 1982 and the present day's [[Premier League|Premiership]] club.

The late 1960s was a turbulent time for the club and pressure from fans led to a change of ownership and management.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.100, "...cut little ice with the fans, who pointed the finger of blame unerringly in the direction of the directors' box."</ref> The problems started when the club was [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] from the first tier of English football for the third time, under manager [[Dick Taylor (football manager)|Dick Taylor]] in [[1967 in football (soccer)|1967]]. Within two years, pressure from supporters had led to the resignation of the [[board of directors]]. The club was then relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In the [[1971-72 in English football|1971&ndash;72 season]] Aston Villa returned to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] as champions with a record 70 points. In 1973 [[Ron Saunders]] was appointed manager and by 1977 he had led the club back into the First Division and into European competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/FormerManagersDetails/0,,10265~1157009,00.html |title=Former Managers:1970s |publisher=AVFC.co.uk |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref><ref>Ward, Adam, p.115, "After finishing in the top four and winning the League Cup, Villa were now back in Europe"</ref> The club was back among the elite and it continued to have much success under Saunders and won the league in the [[1980-81 in English football|1980&ndash;81]] season. Saunders' resignation halfway through the [[1981-82 in English football|1981&ndash;82]] season came as a surprise, with the club in the quarter-final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his assistant manager [[Tony Barton]] who guided them to 1&ndash;0 victory over [[Bayern Munich]] in the [[1982 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in Rotterdam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/history/Season=1981/intro.html |title=1981<U+2013>82 season European campaigns |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> However, winning the cup marked a pinnacle and the club fell steadily down the League standings over the next five years and was [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1987. However, the club was promoted the following year and achieved second place in the Football League in 1989.

Villa was one of the founding members of the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] in 1992, and finished runners-up to [[Manchester United]] in the [[FA Premier League 1992-93|inaugural season]]. The 1990s was a decade of inconsistency; the club had three different managers and league positions were unpredictable, despite winning two League Cups.<ref>League tables relating to Premiership at [[Soccerbase]]</ref> They reached the [[FA Cup]] [[FA Cup Final|Final]] for the first time since 1957 in [[2000 FA Cup Final|2000]], but lost 1&ndash;0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the last game to be played at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]].<ref name=Fahist>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2006/01/FACup_History.htm |title=FA Cup history |publisher=Football Association (FA) |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Once again Villa's league position fluctuated under various managers and in the summer of 2006, [[David O'Leary]] left under acrimonious circumstances.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/5196872.stm |title=David O leary parts ways with Villa |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> [[Martin O'Neill]] soon arrived and received a rapturous reception.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/08/07/taylor_oneill_villa_feature.shtml |title=Sport - Fresh hope for Villa? |publisher=BBC, Birmingham |accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> After 23&nbsp;years as chairman and largest shareholder, owning approximately 38% of the club, [[Doug Ellis]] decided to sell his stake to [[Randy Lerner]], the owner of [[NFL]] franchise the [[Cleveland Browns]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5356730.stm |title=Lerner set to complete Villa deal |publisher=BBC |date=[[2006-09-27]] |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> The arrival of a new owner and manager marked the start of sweeping changes throughout the club, including a new crest, a new kit sponsor and new players in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=407236&cc=5739|title=Villa secure new kit deal with Nike|publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=[[2007-02-07]] |accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706164828/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/CrestTest/0,,10265,00.html |title=New Crest |publisher=AVFC |date=[[2007-05-02]] |accessdate=2007-06-26}} (Web Archive)</ref>

== Instability ==
Winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1961 Football League Cup Final|1961]] was a pinnacle for the club. Although Villa finished seventh in [[1961-62 in English football|1961&ndash;62]], the following season saw the beginning of a decline in form that would see them finish in 15th place in [[1962-63 in English football|1963]] and fourth from bottom in [[1963-64 in English football|1964]]. The manager [[Joe Mercer]] parted company with the club in July 1964 because of these results and his declining health.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.97, "Mercer began to suffer ill health and in 1964 he left the club."</ref> His replacement, [[Dick Taylor]], managed to avoid relegation in the [[1964-65 in English football|1964&ndash;65 season]] as Villa finished 16th after a poor start to the season.<ref>Ward, Adam, pp.96&ndash;97</ref> The following year Villa finished 16th once again. Following a 4&ndash;2 final day defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] the club was relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the [[1966-67 in English football|1966&ndash;67 season]]. Manager [[Dick Taylor (football manager)|Dick Taylor]] was sacked and [[Tommy Cummings]] was appointed in his place. The decline was not solely the responsibility of the manager; the club had an ageing five-man board "who had failed to adapt to the new football reality."<ref>Ward, Adam, p.98</ref> The club had neither developed a scouting network nor an effective coaching structure. The board had also sold two of Villa's best players, [[Phil Woosnam]] and [[Tony Hateley]].<ref>Ward, Adam, p.96 "...but more worryingly the club continued to lose its best players; Phil Woosnam... headed for America and Hateley left for Chelsea."</ref> The fans' calls for the board to resign became more and more pronounced when Villa finished 16th in the Second Division in 1968.<ref name=Ward100/> Events on the pitch came to a head in November 1968, with Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two; the board sacked Cummings. On [[21 November]] [[1968]] the problems in the boardroom were highlighted when a board member, George Robinson, resigned. Following his resignation the board issued a statement: "[The board] would make available, by their resignation, such seats as new financial arrangements might require."<ref name=Ward100>Ward, Adam, p.100</ref> Aston Villa F.C was up for sale. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by [[London]] financier [[Pat Matthews]], who brought in local travel-agent [[Doug Ellis]] as [[chair (official)|chairman]] of the new board that was convened on [[16 December]] [[1968]]. Two days later [[Tommy Docherty]] was appointed as manager.<ref name=Ward100/>

== Rebuilding ==
Docherty rebuilt confidence in the team and Villa went on to win five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against [[Charlton Athletic]] in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised <U+00A3>200,000 for the club, <U+00A3>140,000 of which was spent on new players.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.102</ref> In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were at the bottom of the Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, [[Vic Crowe]], was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the [[1969-70 in English football|1969&ndash;70 season]]. Despite finishing fourth in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1970-71 in English football|1970&ndash;71 season]], Villa reached the [[1971 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] after beating [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2&ndash;0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-english-football-archive.com/domestic_competitions/results/league_cup/1971.htm |publisher=The English Football Archive |title=1971 League Cup Final |accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref> The [[1971-72 in English football|1971&ndash;72 season]] saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.106</ref> In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43&nbsp;days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an [[Extraordinary General Meeting|EGM]], who also voted to replace the existing directors.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.107&ndash;108</ref> Their first season back in the Second Division in [[1972-73 in English football|1972&ndash;73]] saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with [[Ron Saunders]].<ref>Ward, Adam, p.108</ref>

For the club's centenary season of [[1974-75 in English football|1974&ndash;75]], Saunders brought in only two new players, [[Frank Carrodus]] and [[Leighton Phillips]]. At the end of his first season in charge, Villa were back in the First Division after finishing second, and had won the [[1975 Football League Cup Final|1975 League Cup final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Villa beat [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 1&ndash;0 with [[Ray Graydon]] scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the [[1975-76 in English football|1975&ndash;76 season]] Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board.<ref name=IndEllis>{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premier-league/article323736.ece |title=Deadly's legacy will have lively potential |publisher=The Independent |author=Shaw, Phil |date=[[2005-11-01]] |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> Ellis left the club in a good position on the field. They were in the First Division and the [[UEFA Cup]] for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 5&ndash;1 by [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]] in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the [[1976-77 in English football|1976&ndash;77 season]], two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 3&ndash;2 in the [[1977 Football League Cup Final|1977 Final]] played over two legs.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.110</ref>

== European football ==
[[Image:Morley, Tony.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Morley, one of the members of the Villa side that won the First Division championship in the [[1980-81 in English football|1980&ndash;81 season]]]]
In the [[1977-78 in English football|1977&ndash;78 season]] Villa reached the quarter-final of the [[UEFA Cup]] where they went out 4&ndash;3 [[two-legged match|on aggregate]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team in the summer of 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board.<ref name=IndEllis/> Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.118</ref> [[Allan Evans]], [[Ken McNaught]] and [[Kenny Swain]] were brought into the defence and [[Des Bremner]] was brought into the midfield to play alongside [[Dennis Mortimer]] and [[Gordon Cowans]]. [[Tony Morley]] and [[Gary Shaw]] were the new strike partnership. When [[Peter Withe]] was signed from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.

The first success was to come in the [[1980-81 in English football|1980&ndash;81 season]] when Villa won their first League Championship for 71&nbsp;years, fighting off competition from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] using only 14 playing staff in the whole season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1720956,00.html |work=Observer Sport Monthly |title=Aston Villa, 1981 |author=Adams, Tim |date=[[2006-03-05]] |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> The next season Villa did not start well and they were in mid-table at Christmas although the club was still in the [[European Cup]]. In the first round Villa beat [[Valur]] 7&ndash;0 on aggregate. In the second round they scored twice at [[Dynamo Berlin]] to achieve a 2&ndash;2 draw, which saw them go through due to the [[away goals rule]]. These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league. By February 1982, the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned. It was later disclosed that the then chairman, Ron Bendall, had offered him a revised, shorter term, contract, which he had refused to accept.<ref name=Ward129>Ward, Adam, p.129</ref> Saunders' assistant [[Tony Barton]] was promoted in his place. When Barton took over, although Villa were in a poor league position, they were in the quarter-final of the European Cup. In the quarter-finals, they beat [[Dynamo Kiev]] over two legs. Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying, "Once we got past Dynamo Kiev we began thinking we could go all the way."<ref name=Ward129/> In the semi-final, they played [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] over two legs, with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa's place in the final.

== European Champions and subsequent decline ==
{{main|European Cup 1981-82}}
[[Image:Ligue des champions NB.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The [[European Cup]]]]
On [[26 May]] [[1982]], just three months after being appointed manager, Barton guided Villa to a 1&ndash;0 victory over [[Bayern Munich]] in the [[1982 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in [[Rotterdam]]. As of January 2008, Villa remain one of only four English teams to have won the European Cup, along with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. They were the underdogs in the final and were expected to lose.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.124</ref>

The final was held in [[Feijenoord Stadion|Feyenoord Stadium]], Rotterdam, with an attendance of 39,776. Only nine minutes into the game, Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper [[Jimmy Rimmer]] to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by 23-year-old reserve goalkeeper [[Nigel Spink]], who had only played one match for the club in five years since joining from [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford]]. Spink went on to make one of his best performances for the club<ref>Ward, Adam, p.131, "[Spink] produced the performance of a lifetime just when it was needed most"</ref> against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce, which included [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]]. Other key players in this Villa side included [[Tony Morley]], [[Gordon Cowans]] and [[Dennis Mortimer]].<ref name=Ward133>Ward, Adam, p.133</ref>

The win was not followed with more success and the team performed badly in the following seasons. At the [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] in October 1982, it was revealed that the club were in <U+00A3>1.6&nbsp;million of debt, mainly due to escalating wages and building costs, including the construction of the North Stand.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.135</ref> At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis, who bought Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding.<ref name=Ward137>Ward, Adam, p.133</ref> In January 1983, Villa beat [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 3&ndash;1 on aggregate to win the [[1982 UEFA Super Cup]]. Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, but was sacked at the end of the [[1983-84 in English football|1983&ndash;84 season]] despite Villa finishing 10th in the First Division and reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] manager [[Graham Turner]] was brought in as his successor. Turner was unable to reverse the decline, and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division.<ref name=Ward137/> A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September. [[Billy McNeill]] was hired in his place, but was unable to save Villa from relegation. They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. McNeill handed in his notice and moved to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] when the season ended. Chairman Ellis persuaded [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] manager [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.149</ref>

== Taylor, Venglo<U+0161> and Atkinson ==
[[Image:RonAtkinson.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Ron Atkinson, who guided Villa to second place in the First Division in his first season with the club]]
Taylor's first season at Villa ended with automatic promotion as Second Division runners-up, being pipped to the title by [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. One player who contributed to that season's success was the recently signed [[David Platt]], a former Manchester United reserve who had signed from [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] for <U+00A3>200,000 just after Taylor's arrival.<ref name=Ward149>Ward, pp.149&ndash;152</ref> Before he left in 1991 Platt scored 68 goals in his 155 appearances for the club. Villa avoided relegation on the last day of the [[1988-89 in English football|1988&ndash;89 season]] as other results favoured them.<ref name=Ward149/> In the [[1989-90 in English football|1989&ndash;90 season]] they emerged as surprise contenders for the title, leading for three weeks in the latter stages of the season before finishing in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Taylor departed for the England manager's job and was succeeded by Slovak coach [[Jozef Venglo<U+0161>]], the first foreign manager in the First Division.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/134664.stm |title=Celtic appoints new coach |publisher=BBC |date=[[1998-07-17]] |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

The [[1990-91 in English football|1990&ndash;91 season]] was Venglo<U+0161>'s only season as manager of Aston Villa. Their second-place finish the previous season earned them qualification for the [[UEFA Cup 1990-91|UEFA Cup]] as one of the first English clubs to enter European competition after ban resulting from the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] was lifted.<ref name="ward156">Ward, p.156</ref> They beat first round opponents [[Banik Ostrava]] over two legs, and won the first leg of the second round tie against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]]. However, this lead was overturned by Inter Milan in the return leg 3&ndash;0, and Villa were eliminated.<ref name="ward156"/> The defeat started a decline, and by the end of the season they were two places above the relegation zone. Venglo<U+0161> stepped down and David Platt was sold to [[Italy|Italian]] side [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] for <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million. Aston Villa's new manager was [[Ron Atkinson]], who had taken [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] to the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] and had won the League Cup with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. In his first season in charge, [[1991-92 in English football|1991&ndash;92]], Villa finished in sixth place and thus became one of the founder members of the [[FA Premier League]].<ref>Ward, Adam, p.161</ref>

== Villa in the Premiership ==
[[Image:Holte.jpg|thumb|left|The Holte End was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994.]]
In his first 18&nbsp;months in charge, Atkinson bought [[Earl Barrett]], [[Dean Saunders]], [[Andy Townsend]], [[Dalian Atkinson]], [[Kevin Richardson (footballer)|Kevin Richardson]], [[Ray Houghton]] and [[Shaun Teale]]. They all helped the club to finish as runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural [[Premier League]] season of [[FA Premier League 1992-93|1992&ndash;93]]. The strike partnership of Saunders and Atkinson established itself as one of the most successful partnerships in the Premiership.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.162</ref> In 1994 Villa won the [[1994 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] 3&ndash;1, to secure a second successive UEFA Cup campaign. At the end of the [[1993-94 in English football|1993&ndash;94 season]], they played their last game at a [[terrace (stadium)|terraced]] [[Villa Park]] before it was converted over the summer to an [[all-seater stadium]] to comply with the [[Taylor Report]].<ref>Ward, Adam, pp.165&ndash;166</ref> In November 1994, Atkinson was dismissed following a poor start to the season. 

Leicester City's manager [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]] was forbidden to speak to Aston Villa by their board, after rumours began circulating that Ellis wanted to hire him. Whilst maintaining that he had not spoken to Ellis or Villa, Little resigned from his post at Leicester with three years left on his contract.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.170</ref> Three days after his resignation, Ellis hired him as the new Villa manager. Little kept Villa in the Premiership, and then reshaped the squad in the 1995 close-season by selling most of the club's older players and buying in several younger ones.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.171</ref> Villa won the [[1996 Football League Cup Final|1996 League Cup]] with a win over Leeds United, reached the FA Cup semi-finals and finished fourth in the Premiership in the [[1995-96 in English football|1995&ndash;96 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/TimelineDetail/0,,10265~1097070,00.html |title=Villa timeline:1990s |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> In February 1998, with Villa standing 15th in the Premiership and speculation rife that he would be sacked, Little resigned, stating that "There were certain things going on behind the scenes which were affecting my own managerial position."<ref name=Ward175>Ward, Adam, p.175</ref> Ellis came out with a statement directly challenging that it had anything to do with the management at Villa Park. Instead, he suggested it was due to a "variety of pressures" including abuse directed towards Little and his family by irate fans.<ref>Ward, p. 176</ref> 
[[Image:Wembleyold.jpg|thumb|right|Aston Villa played Chelsea in the last [[FA Cup Final]] to be held at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]].]]
Ellis appointed [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]], a former Aston Villa coach, as Little's successor. Gregory revitalised the team and Villa finished seventh in the Premiership and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Usually, only the top six teams qualified for European competition, but due to the progress of other teams in the top seven it was the first time that a seventh placed club had automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup. Despite the <U+00A3>12.6&nbsp;million sale of [[Dwight Yorke]], a player who had scored 97 goals in 287 appearances for the club, to Manchester United in August 1998, John Gregory had guided Aston Villa to the top of the Premiership by the middle of the [[1998-99 in English football|1998&ndash;99 season]]. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 for the first time since 1957, but lost 1&ndash;0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the last final to be played at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]]. The [[2000-01 in English football|2000&ndash;01 season]] saw Villa finish eighth in the Premiership, although they did eventually qualify for the UEFA Cup by winning the [[Intertoto Cup]] in the summer of 2001. In November 2001, Gregory accused Ellis of "living in a time-warp", but was forced to apologise a few days later after provoking an uproar.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.184</ref> Whilst Gregory remained in his job, the relationship between him and Ellis was strained.<ref>Ward, Adam, p.184, "...the relationship between the two had taken an irrevocable turn for the worse."</ref> A year after Gregory's outburst, he quit the club with Villa in the middle of the Premiership table.

In January 2002 chairman Doug Ellis once again appointed [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] as manager. Villa finished the [[2001-02 in English football|2001&ndash;02 season]] in eighth place, which was similar to most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager for the second time after the end of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03 season]]. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Taylor's second reign at Villa Park was blighted by signings such as [[Bosko Balaban]] for <U+00A3>6&nbsp;million, who made little impact on the pitch.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/0415/Villa.html |title=Villa nightmare for Balaban |publisher=RT<U+00C9> |date=[[2002-04-15]] |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> [[David O'Leary]], who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 2000&ndash;01 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement.

At a press conference on [[4 August]] [[2006]], Doug Ellis introduced [[Martin O'Neill]] as the new manager and O'Neill said: {{cquote|It's absolutely fantastic to be back and with a club such as this.

After several years of speculation and failed bids, the 23-year reign of Doug Ellis as chairman came to an end. Ellis, the largest shareholder with approximately 38%, decided to sell his stake. For many years supporters groups had been urging Ellis to resign, though the actions including two "Ellis out" protests, and an "Ellis out" march marked an increase in intensity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/4772103.stm |title=Villa fans urging Ellis to resign |date=[[2006-05-15]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/1709493.stm |title=Villa fans plan protest |date=2001-12-13 |accessdate=2008-02-20 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The decision to leave the club was likely to have been prompted by Ellis' ill-health.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/4078462.stm |title=Ellis recovering after operation |publisher=BBC |date=[[2006-06-13]] |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> [[Randy Lerner]], the owner of [[NFL]] franchise, the [[Cleveland Browns]], was announced as the preferred bidder.
