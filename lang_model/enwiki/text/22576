===Probing===
Reacting to the incident, Union Railway Minister Mukul Roy has said that sabotage cannot be ruled out of the list of probabilities. Earlier, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also demanded a probe into the incident pointing that it happened on a day when a nation-wide bandh had been enforced by NDA and Left parties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doon Express mishap: Mukul Roy says sabotage can't be ruled out|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/doon-express-mishap-roy-says-sabotage-possible/263330-37.html|publisher=Cable News Network LP, LLLP|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> "Since the accident has taken place during a country-wide bandh we want this to be probed. Who has caused this mishap? It has to be seen whether this is truly an accident or an incident," said Ms Banerjee who was Railways Minister herself till she was elected chief minister in 2011. Railways Minister Mukul Roy left for the accident site while he ordered a high-level probe into the accident.  "I have ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such repeated accidents are happening. We will take serious steps to prevent such accidents," he said. The minister also announced compensation of Rs.5 lakh for the families of each of those killed; Rs. 1 lakh for those injured and Rs. 25,000 for those who have sustained minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doon Express derailment: Four killed, Mamata floats sabotage theory|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/doon-express-derailment-5-killed-mamata-floats-sabotage-theory-220792|publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Eyewitnesses and villagers, who reached the accident site, said a loud sound was heard after the derailment, suggesting that the train was in high speed when the accident occurred.

==Recovery==
Prima facie ruling out that the derailment of Doon Express was the handiwork of anti-social elements, the Railway Minister, Mr Mukul Roy, that night, said an inquiry into the incident would be conducted by the Commissioner of Railway Safety and stern action would be taken against the guilty. Mr Roy visited the district hospital in the wee hours and inquired about the well-being of the passengers injured in the accident. He said that expenses for the treatment of those seriously injured would be borne by the Railway Ministry. <ref>{{cite web|title=Doon Express derailment: Stern action to be taken against guilty|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/government-and-policy/article3479415.ece|publisher=The Hindu Business Line.|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Finally on June 2, the movement of trains between Lucknow and Varanasi has been restored.
