"'''The Coup'''" is the third episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. It first aired on October 5, 2006 on [[NBC]] in the United States.

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Jan Levenson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) becomes unimpressed with how [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is controlling his branch, so [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries to take his job and an office power play ensues. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) conducts a lunchtime fashion show, and the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' as a team-building exercise, something [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) does not do well in. 

The episode was written by co-executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] and directed by executive producer [[Greg Daniels]]. Several cast members noted that the episode contained [[Shakespeare]]an elements, such as [[Angela Martin]]'s similarities with the ''[[Macbeth]]'' character [[Lady Macbeth]]. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was viewed by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Critical reception was largely mixed, with several reviewers criticizing Jim's Stamford storyline

==Synopsis==
[[Jan Levenson|Jan]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) berates [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) when she discovers that he calls the entire office into the conference room every Monday to watch a movie. [[Angela Martin|Angela]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) prods [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her awkward meeting with Dwight, where he declares he can be a better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.

The [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays poorly and draws the ire of his teammates. As he leaves for home, Jim pretends to toss a grenade at [[Karen Filippelli|Karen]] ([[Rashida Jones]]), who responds by creating a pretend explosion with paper clips. Karen longingly watches Jim leave.

Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) insists that [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse. When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes that it is too revealing.

Michael leads Dwight to believe that he has been given control of the branch before revealing the ruse. Dwight begs for his job and for Michael's forgiveness, offering to do his laundry for a year. When it appears that Michael is on the verge of firing Dwight, Michael insists that they "hug it out, bitch." Dwight quickly returns to being Michael's loyal right-hand man, but Michael is still resentful, and forces Dwight to stand atop a box in the middle of the office, wearing a sign that says "LIAR"--and the promise to do Michael's laundry for a year.

In preparation for some episode scenes, Rashida Jones "took some serious ''Call of Duty''" lessons from the writers, as they all play the online game. In the DVD [[audio commentary]], Rainn Wilson stated that he was happy that the series could "have the nuanced stuff and then the really brood stuff"; he referred specifically to Michael confronting Dwight in this episode as well as to the season's twenty-third episode "[[Beach Games]]", where "people are running around in inflatable outfits bashing each other." Also in the audio commentary, Jones suggested that Dwight's punishment <U+2013> being forced to wear a "liar" sign and stand silently on some boxes in the middle of the office <U+2013> was reminiscent of the iconic photo of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].<ref name=commentary/> 

The season three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes that were edited from the episode. These include [[Creed Bratton (The Office)|Creed]] revealing that he sleeps under his desk four nights a week, Dwight and Angela flirting in the break room after he tries to persuade her to join Movie Monday, Michael becoming suspicious when Pam interrupts to tell him that he has a phone call, Pam responding to [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]]'s unwanted attention to her neckline, and Creed reacting to having Dwight as the new boss.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2007 |title=Deleted scenes for "The Coup" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Three'' Disc 1 }}</ref>

==Reception==
{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=260px|align=right|quote=Overall, "The Coup" had its moments, but it's far from being among the best ''Office'' episodes to date. Dwight being shamed and groveling for mercy on Michael's floor was funny (and disturbing) but not as satisfying as when Pam & Jim pull an elaborate prank on Mr. Schrute. Here's hoping the series kick-starts the Pam-Jim storyline again soon, before we start wondering why those documentary cameras are still following Jim way over in the Stamford branch.|source='''Brian Zoromski, [[IGN]]'''<ref name=ignreview/>}}

"The Coup" first aired on October 5, 2006 in the United States on [[NBC]]. It received a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.1/11. This means that it was seen by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode placed as the 24th most-watched episode for the week in that demographic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-165690772.html |title=Nielsen primetime ratings report. (Statistical table) |work=Daily Variety |date=October 11, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. [[IGN]] columnist Brian Zoromski rated "The Coup" 7.8/10, indicating it as a "good" episode. He felt that after the "brilliant" [[The Convention (The Office)|episode from the previous week]], "The Coup" was "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor."<ref name=ignreview>{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/737/737713p1.html |title=The Office: ''The Coup'' Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Brian |last=Zoromski |date=October 6, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> [[AOLTV]]'s Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were "beginning to grate on [him]. Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? I think it would have been funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all. The ''Call of Duty'' bits didn't do much for me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/10/06/the-office-the-coup/ |title=The Office: The Coup |publisher=[[AOLTV]] |first=Michael |last=Sciannamea |date=October 6, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> 

Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called Dwight's groveling "hilarious," but was unsure about Jim and Karen's ending scene, explaining that it "was adorable. Too adorable. And I<U+2019>m not quite ready to handle the fact that I<U+2019>m not HATING the idea of Jim and Karen. I feel like I<U+2019>m betraying Pam. I<U+2019>m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it<U+2019>s nice to see Jim smile again." Skerry concluded that "there were some seriously funny, laugh out loud moments tonight, but I don<U+2019>t think this episode is going to make my favorites list. But even when ''The Office'' isn<U+2019>t at its best, it<U+2019>s still hands down the best comedy on TV."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.givememyremote.com/remote/2006/10/06/the-office-recap-the-coup/ |title=The Office Recap: The Coup |publisher=Give Me My Remote |first=Kath |last=Skerry |date=October 6, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> [[Television Without Pity]] graded the episode with an A-.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-office/the-coup-1.php?page=9 |title=The Coup |publisher=[[Television Without Pity]] |first=Wing |last=Chun |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that "The Coup" is "not a fan favorite," though it was submitted for an [[Emmy Award]].<ref name=commentary/>
