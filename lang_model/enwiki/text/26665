'''William Alexander Hammond''' (28 August 1828<U+2013>5 January 1900) was an American [[military medicine|military physician]] and [[neurologist]]. During the [[American Civil War]] he was the eleventh [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] (1862<U+2013>1864) and the founder of the Army Medical Museum (now the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]]).<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us: History of the National Museum of Health and Medicine | url= http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/about/about.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110725181129/http://nmhm.washingtondc.museum/about/about.html | archivedate = July 25, 2011| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}</ref>

He was the first American physician to devote himself entirely to neurology, the author of the first American treatise about neurology, and one of the founders of the [[American Neurological Association]].<ref>Freemon, PMID 11770195</ref><ref name="UAB">{{cite web | title = Reynolds Historical Library: Hammond, William Alexander | url= http://www.uab.edu/reynolds/cwfigs/hammond| accessdate = 2012-04-15}}</ref><ref>G.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Annapolis]] ([[Maryland]]), Hammond grew up in [[Harrisburg]] ([[Pennsylvania]]). He received his [[M.D.]] from [[New York University]]<ref>Then known as the University of the City of New York</ref> at the age of 20.<ref name="UAB"/> After his [[internship]] and a few months in private practice he became assistant-surgeon<!-- As of April 2012 the article with that name is only concerned with the Royal Navy--> in the [[American Army]], serving from 1849 to 1860. He was first sent to [[New Mexico]] and took part in the [[Sioux Wars]]. While on sick leave, he visited [[military hospital]]s in Europe.<ref>Hammond left {{date|8 May 1858}} and returned in early August. [[#Blustein|Blustein]], {{google books|4GxdL5fpdskC|p.49|page=49}}</ref> He conducted research over many years and the resulting paper was awarded a prize by the [[American Medical Association]] in 1857.<ref>Hammond (1857)</ref> With a common interest in poisons acting on the nervous system (among them [[snake venom]]), he wrote a paper with [[Silas Weir Mitchell]] that was published in 1859.<ref>July 1859 issue of ''[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]]''<!-- Not yet digitized. 2012.4.12 -->. The paper is about corroval and vao, two substances to poison arrows. [[Brown-S<U+00E9>quard]] (1859) blamed the authors on a point: subsuming those poisons under the generic name of "[[curare]]s": ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77339z/f719.image Journal de la physiologie de l'homme et des animaux]''.

While serving at [[Fort Riley]] as medical director, Hammond also collected biological specimens.<ref name=Phalen>[[#Phalen|Phalen]]</ref> In 1860 he accepted a [[Chair (academic)|chair]] of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] at the [[University of Maryland]] in [[Baltimore]] and left the army.

=== Civil War ===

When the [[American Civil War]] broke out Hammond spent some time at the Baltimore infirmary<ref>He cared for Massachusetts soldiers wounded in the [[Baltimore Riot of 1861|Baltimore riot]]. [[#Phalen|Phalen]]</ref> then joined the army (without recognition of his past service) on 28 May 1861, a month a half after the beginning of the hostilities. Surgeon General [[Clement Finley]] soon transfered him to [[West Virginia]] under the command of General [[William Starke Rosecrans]] command "to lessen his visibility".<ref name=Greenwood>[[#GW|Greenwood (2003)]]</ref> There Hammond met [[Jonathan Letterman]]. Hammond worked with Letterman and Rosecrans on the design of a new ambulance wagon.

The atmosphere in the upper levels of medical services was then one of internal strife and personal conflicts. Hammond<U+2014>a tall and imposing young man<ref>He was a tall man (1.88 meter, 6'2", which was rare at the time), weighed up to 250 pounds and kept his military bearing all his life.</ref><U+2014>was no man of intrigue, nor even, according to all accounts, a very flexible person. However, the situation offered him the possibility for advancement. When Finley, the 10th Surgeon General, was fired after an argument with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], against Stanton's advice and the normal rules of promotion,<ref name=Greenwood /><ref>"[Hammond had] served under two men, Charles Tripler and Jonathan Lettermen, [sic] who were sufficiently impressed with his abilities to serve later as his subordinates without apparent objection." {{cite book |title = The Army Medical Department, 1818<U+2013>1865 |series = Army Historical Series, Center for Military History Publication |author =Gillett, Mary C. |publisher = Government Printing Office |year = 1987 |url = {{google books|hdu-6pn7CK8C|p. 178|page=178}}.}} Not all were like Letterman and Tripler.</ref> named the 34-year-old Hammond to succeed him with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. Hammond became Surgeon General of the Army on 25 April 1862, less than a year after rejoining the army.

==== Surgeon General ====

Hammond launched a number of reforms.<ref>See the account given in [[#USAMD|USAMD]], especially from p. 104</ref> He raised the requirements for admission into the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Army Medical Corps]].<ref name=MedicalTimes>{{Google books |cblXAAAAMAAJ|The medical department of the United States Army|page=90}}. ''The medical times and gazette'', '''1''' (1863-01-24) (Review of the Surgeon General's report for the year ending 30 June 1862)</ref> The number of hospitals was greatly increased and he paid close attention to aeration.<ref>{{harvnb|Freemon2001}} {{Google books|Un92utsPUmoC|p. 89|page=89}} and [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Un92utsPUmoC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38 p. 38]</ref> He created [[Satterlee Hospital]] (which had up to 4,500 beds in hundreds of tents).<ref>Photograph : {{harvnb|Freemon2001}} {{Google books|Un92utsPUmoC|p. 88|page=88}}. Again in [[Philadelphia]] was built the "U. S. Army Hospital for diseases and injuries of the nervous system" ({{Google books|Un92utsPUmoC|[[Ibid]]., p. 89|page=89}})</ref> Hospitals were ordered to maintain much more complete records. In Washington he founded the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]] (then called Army Medical Museum)<ref>"[Medical museums] were central to instruction at medical schools during the nineteenth century."

Efficiency increased, as Hammond promoted people on the basis of competence, not rank or connections, and his initiatives were positive and timely.<ref>"There are numerous instances where positive orders were given not to buy of particular houses, whose prices, or the quality or measure of whose goods was found objectionable". {{Google books|Cp1XAAAAMAAJ|Circular in behalf of the surgeon-general, 1863 |page=11}}. ''American Medical Times'' '''8''' (1864-01-02), p. 11</ref>

==== Removal from office ====
On 4 May 1863 Hammond banned the mercury compound [[calomel]] from army supplies, as he believed it to be neither safe nor effective (he was later proved correct). He thought it dangerous to make an already debilitated patient vomit.<ref>[[Tartar emetic]] was also banned: [http://www.civilwarhome.com/medicinehistory.htm Caring for the Men]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Freemon2001}}</ref> A "Calomel Rebellion" ensued,<ref>For a short and lively account of this episode: Jose Llinas, "[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19870605&id=6T9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4890,1106980 Only victim of the Calomel Rebellion]".

Or this excerpt from Steve Herman's book: ''Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Cohen: Call Sign Band-Aid Six''. {{Google books|5sLtK9F-bBIC|p. 169-172| page=169}}</ref> as many of his colleagues had no alternative treatments and resented the move as an infringement on their liberty of practice. Hammond's arrogant nature did not help him solve the problem,<ref>An assistant-surgeon who had seen Hammond inspect his hospital described him as "arrogant and pompous". Freemon, who recounts the incident ({{harvnb|Freemon2001}} {{Google books |Un92utsPUmoC|p. 143|page=143}}), also points to an occasion when Hammond could say: "I was then an assistant surgeon of the army, and rather more puffed up than I am now". ([http://www.jstor.org/stable/982825?seq=32&returnArticleService=showFullText&resultsServiceName=null Hammond, ''Our friends who have passed away''])</ref> and his relations with Secretary of War Stanton became strained. On 3 September 1863 he was sent on a protracted "inspection tour" to the South,<ref name=OffRec>Typewritten Army record, reproduced in {{harvnb|Freemon2001}} {{Google books|Un92utsPUmoC|Gangrene and glory, p. 162 |page=162}}</ref> which effectively removed him from office. [[Joseph Barnes]], a friend of Stanton's and his personal physician, became acting Surgeon General.<ref>{{harvnb|Freemon2001}} {{Google books|Un92utsPUmoC|p. 142 |page=142}}.</ref>

Hammond demanded to be either reinstated or [[court-martial]]ed. A court-martial found him guilty of "irregularities" in the purchase of medical furniture (Stanton "used false data").<ref>Steve Herman, ''Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Cohen: Call Sign Band-Aid Six''. {{Google books|5sLtK9F-bBIC|p. 171|page=171}}</ref><ref>{{citation|[T]rumped-up charges}} {{cite web | title = Reynolds Historical Library: Hammond, William Alexander | url= http://www.uab.edu/reynolds/cwfigs/hammond| accessdate = 2012-04-15}}</ref> Hammond was dismissed on 18 August 1864.<ref name=Phalen/><ref name=OffRec/>

=== Neurology ===

With the help of friends Hammond established himself in [[New York City]].<ref>"Hammond found himself in straitened circumstances from the expense of his trial." {{harvnb|Phalen|1940}}</ref> He became professor of nervous and mental diseases at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] in 1867 and at the [[New York University]] in 1874. He served on the faculty of the [[University of Vermont at Burlington]]<ref>Summer sessions. Hammond worked for free. [[#Blustein|Blustein]], {{Google books|4GxdL5fpdskC|p. 98|page=98}}</ref> and was co-founder and faculty member of the Post Graduate Medical School of New York.<ref name=Phalen/> In 1870s, he limited his practice to possible cases of nervous or mental diseases, the first American physician to do so.<ref>Freemon, Dec. 2001, PMID 11770195</ref> He conducted early experiments on the use of [[lithium]] for the treatment of [[mania]].<ref>Hammond, {{Google books|2S0AAAAAQAAJ|A Treatise on diseases of the nervous system|page=381}}, p. 381 : "I have used the bromide of lithium in cases of acute mania[...] The doses should be large[...]" Comment in [http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78%284%29515.pdf a bulletin] of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], p. 516 : "it is difficult to determine in retrospect whether it was the lithium or the bromide that was the critical agent."</ref>

In 1871 he published his best-known work, ''Treatise on diseases of the nervous system''.<ref>Translated into French by [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Labadie-Lagrave]] (''[http://gallica.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k773676 Trait<U+00E9> des maladies du syst<U+00E8>me nerveux...]''). Translated into Spanish and Italian: [[#Blustein|Blustein]], {{Google books|4GxdL5fpdskC|p. 280|page=280}}</ref> In early 1872 he traveled to California to visit his ailing friend Letterman.<ref>[[#GW|Greenwood (2003)]].

Clements, {{google books|IBcTAAAAYAAJ|Memoir of Jonathan Letterman|page =24}}, 1883</ref> In 1874 he founded, with Silas Weir Mitchell and many others, the [[American Neurological Association]].<ref>Official site of the ANA: {{cite web|url=http://www.aneuroa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3293 |title=History |accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> In 1878 "he was restored to the army [...] with the grade of brigadier general, without pay or allowances".<ref name=Phalen/><ref>The bill authorizing the president to reinstate Hammond "was passed by the house unanimously, and by the senate with but one dissenting vote". {{google books|g5sLAAAAMAAJ|Appletons' cyclopaedia of American biography, vol. 3, p.69|page=69}}</ref>

Hammond was the author of many books and articles,<ref>The list of his articles in scientific journals given by [[#Blustein|Blustein]], {{google books|4GxdL5fpdskC|p. 271|page=271}} extends over nine pages with more than twenty articles per page (translations included)</ref> some of them published in a journal he had founded.<ref>''Quarterly journal of psychological medicine and medical jurisprudence''</ref> He was energetic, sceptical,<ref>[[#1871b|1871b]]; [[#1879b|1879b]]</ref> moderate,<ref>[[#PSM1887|''Popular Science Monthly'' 1887]]</ref> a believer in freedom,<ref>[[#1879a|1879a]]; [[#PSM1890|''Popular Science Monthly'' 1890]]</ref> and a reformer. He enjoyed writing in his spare time, becoming a [[Science journalism|science journalist]] and a [[Natural history|naturalist]]. He also wrote a short biography of [[Polydore Vergil]].

In 1888 he returned to Washington, where he founded a hospital<ref>Called at the time a sanatorium</ref> for patients with nervous and mental diseases.<ref name="UAB"/> He died in Washington on 5 January 1900 of heart failure and was buried with military honors at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=Arlington>Section 1, grave 465 : {{cite web | title = William Alexander Hammond | url= http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/whammond.htm | title = Site of the cemetery| accessdate = 2012-04-14}}</ref>

Hammond was married twice. On 3 July 1849, the day following his first commission as an assistant surgeon, he married Helen Nisbet. They had five children, two of whom died in infancy.<ref>{{cite journal
