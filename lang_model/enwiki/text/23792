'''Geovany Soto''' (born [[January 20]], [[1983]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]].

==Professional career==
[[Image:Geo soto .jpg|thumb|left|Soto wearing full catcher attire]]
Selected by the Chicago Cubs 318th overall in the 11th round of the [[2001 Major League Baseball Draft]], he made his major league debut on September 23, 2005, against the [[Houston Astros]].  He was recalled by the Cubs on July 12, 2007, but only had 1 hit in 7 at bats.<ref name="Game Log">{{cite web| url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/stats/individual_player_gamebygamelog.jsp?playerID=434567&statType=1|  title=Stats: Individual Player Game Log - Geovany Soto C| publisher=Major League Baseball| accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>  In September 2007, when the Cubs expanded their roster, he joined the team again.  This was mainly because, in the minor leagues that year, he batted .353 with 26 home runs and 109 RBI and was named the [[Pacific Coast League]]'s MVP while playing for the [[Iowa Cubs]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?n=Geovany%20Soto&pos=C&sid=milb&t=p_pbp&pid=434567| title=Player Statistics: Geovany Soto| publisher=Minor League Baseball| accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>  After his call-up in September, Soto had an average of .389.<ref name="Game Log"/>  Soto started for the Cubs during the 2007 playoff series against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].  In game 2 of the series, Soto hit a home run into the left field bleachers at [[Chase Field]], giving the Cubs an early 2-0 lead.  The Cubs ended up losing that game, but it further solidified him as the Cubs' full-time catcher going into 2008, with [[Jason Kendall]] moving on to Milwaukee as a free agent.

Arguably the best offensive performance in Soto's young career came April 30, 2008, in a rout against the Brewers.  Soto hit two 3-run homers to account for 6 of the Cubs' 19 RBIs, only a few days removed from a two-game stretch against the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]] in which he struck out in 8 consecutive at-bats.  Soto was voted the [[National League]] Rookie of the Month for April 2008 after hitting .341 with 5 home runs, 8 doubles, and 20 [[RBI]]s, with an [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] of 1.059.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080509&content_id=2668292&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb| title=Soto catches Gillette rookie honor| author=Mike Scarr| publisher=Major League Baseball| date=[[2008-05-09]]| accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>  On May 19, 2008, he scored his first career [[Inside-the-park home run]] against the [[Houston Astros]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-nlgameofday20-2008may20,0,3440258.story| title=Geovany Soto's inside-the-park homer paces Cubs' 7-2 win|  publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''| date=[[2008-05-20]]| accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>  Soto led the early stage of the voting process for the National League's catcher in the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/beisbol/accion_deportiva/soto_se_consolida_en_la_votacion/205886| title=Soto se consolida en la votaci<U+00F3>n| author=Lester Jim<U+00E9>nez | publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=[[2008-07-01]]| accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref>  He was selected to be the National League's starting catcher in the game.
