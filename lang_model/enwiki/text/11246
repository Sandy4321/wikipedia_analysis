"'''Beside the Dying Fire'''" is the thirteenth episode and finale of the [[The Walking Dead (season 2)|second season]] of the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[television series]] ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', which aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on March 18, 2012. The episode was written by creator [[Robert Kirkman]] and showrunner [[Glen Mazzara]] and directed by series regular [[Ernest Dickerson]]. In the episode, a large number of walkers invade the Greene farm, which forces [[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) and his group to leave the premise for safety. Meanwhile, [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]] ([[Laurie Holden]]) is separated from the group, leaving her to fight off the same horde of walkers that attacked Hershel's farm.

Such themes as [[romance]], [[death]], and [[survival]] are prevalent throughout "Beside the Dying Fire". It is seen as a turning point for the development of several characters on the show, and flashbacks to various previous revelations in the series. "Beside the Dying Fire" introduces protagonist [[Michonne]], a character that has been prominently featured in [[The Walking Dead (comics)|the comics of the same name]]. Production for the episode transpired over an approximate period of eight days. 

"Beside the Dying Fire" has garnered critical praise from television commentators, who lauded the character progression and its storylines. Upon airing, it attracted 9 million viewers and a 4.7 rating in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode amassed record ratings, thus becoming the highest-rated cable program demographically of all time, an accolade that was previously held by "[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]". "Beside the Dying Fire" became the most-viewed cable telecast of the day, as well as the highest-rated cable program of the week.

==Plot==
Following the trail of a helicopter overhead, a massive herd of walkers begin to form and migrates from the city to the countryside. They come to rest in the woods outside [[Hershel Greene| Hershel's]] farm. The herd follows the sound of a [[Better Angels (The Walking Dead)|gunshot]] and discover the survivors' location. 

[[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) and his son [[Carl Grimes|Carl]] ([[Chandler Riggs]]) return to the Greene farm, where Carl asks his father about the death of [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] ([[Jon Bernthal]]), but before Rick is able to answer, he spots a large horde of walkers and the two flee to the barn. [[Daryl Dixon (The Walking Dead)|Daryl Dixon]] ([[Norman Reedus]]) and [[Glenn (The Walking Dead)|Glenn]] ([[Steven Yeun]]) report the death and reanimation of Randall ([[Michael Zegen]]). [[Lori Grimes]] ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) begs Daryl to go out and search for Rick and Shane - before he can however, the group spots the invading herd and are forced to mobilize.

The group is separated in the process, whilst formulating a plan to corral the walkers and lead them away in their vehicles. Hershel ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) is convinced on defending his land at risk of his own life, despite the protests of Lori and [[Carol Peletier]] ([[Melissa McBride]]). Rick and Carl light the barn on fire in order to eliminate all walkers corralled there. Instructed by Daryl, Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near the barn and rescues Rick and Carl, but is attacked and devoured by the walkers who manage to get inside the RV. [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]] ([[Laurie Holden]]) and Theodore "T-Dog" Douglas ([[IronE Singleton]]) realize that their plan is not working, and decide to flee the land. They rescue Lori and Beth Greene ([[Emily Kinney]]), but Patricia ([[Jane McNeill]]) is also devoured by several walkers. Carol is also cornered, but Andrea comes to her rescue. Rick escapes with Carl and convinces Hershel to abandon his land, T-Dog, Beth and Lori are forced to leave, Glenn and [[Maggie Greene]] ([[Lauren Cohan]]) flee the scene, and Daryl rescues Carol - leaving behind only Andrea, whom they see lying under a walker and presumed dead, who manages to escape on foot. 

Andrea flees to the woods. As she runs from the walkers, terminating some of them in the process, she runs out of ammunition. Exhausted, she is toppled by a final walker, but before it can bite her, she is saved by [[Michonne|a mysterious hooded figure]] who has two armless walker pets and wields a [[katana]]. The survivors, with the exception of Andrea, regroup and report their casualties (Shane, Patricia and Jimmy). Rick assures the group they can start anew elsewhere. When Daryl questions why Randall turned even though he wasn't bitten, Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner ([[Noah Emmerich]]) [[TS-19|whispered in his ear]]: they are all infected. This revelation upsets the group. Rick confesses to Lori about the true events surrounding Shane's death including Carl shooting the reanimated Shane. His lack of remorse in claiming he wanted Shane dead, leaves Lori visibly disturbed. The group questions Rick's leadership, with Daryl and Hershel defending Rick. A noise echoes in the distance, however Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that he never asked that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He then cools down and encourages anyone to leave. Nobody leaves, and he issues a final warning: "If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore," establishing his position as leader of the group. It is then revealed that the group is camped near a prison.

==Production==
"Beside the Dying Fire" was directed by [[Ernest Dickerson]] and written by creator [[Robert Kirkman]] and showrunner [[Glen Mazzara]]. Mazzara teased the episode in a conference call with various journalists: "We're proud of this finale, we've been building to it all season, and we can't wait for you to see it. [...] There's more bloodshed coming. They thought they were safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here. [...] There are answers about the nature of the virus in the finale. [...] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and want to know what comes next. People will have a lot of questions, but in a good way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/15/walking-dead-season-2-finale/|title='Walking Dead' showrunner talks finale, controversies: 'There's more bloodshed coming'|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=March 15, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

Filming for the episode commenced over a period of eight days.<ref name=amm>{{cite video | people=|date=March 19, 2012 |title=Making of the Season 2 Finale: Inside The Walking Dead|format=Audio commentary |medium=Dialogue |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]}}</ref> In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a cigarette lighter and drops it onto a horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. [[Greg Nicotero]], the special effect director for ''The Walking Dead'', used black panels to capture the elements of the fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of [[flame retardant]] suits. The first layer consisted of a dry [[Nomex]] undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled.<ref name=amm/> Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing [[cationic polymer]]s. The last layer was a [[raincoat]], which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.<ref name=amm/>

"Beside the Dying Fire" features the deaths of Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside the deaths of the aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the [[Better Angels (The Walking Dead)|previous installment]]. Since Kirkman felt that there was a lot of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script.<ref name=hollz/> Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance.<ref name=hollz/> "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]], 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive."<ref name=hollz>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-robert-kirkman-glen-mazzara-season-2-finale-michonne-301394|title='The Walking Dead' Dissection: Glen Mazzara and Robert Kirkman Spill on the Bloody Finale|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

This episode introduces the character [[Michonne]], a protagonist in [[The Walking Dead (comics)|the comic series of the same name]] who is portrayed by [[Danai Gurira]]. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of "Beside the Dying Fire", although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale.<ref name=hollz2/> Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]''.<ref name=hollz2/> [[Rutina Wesley]], notably known for her role in ''[[True Blood]]'', was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman affirmed that she was never involved in the auditioning process. "It was a lot of actresses. The ''True Blood'' actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on ''True Blood''. I don't know where that rumor came from, but to my knowledge, she was never involved."<ref name=hollz2>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-robert-kirkman-danai-gurira-michonne-casting-301729|title='The Walking Dead's' Robert Kirkman on the Casting of Danai Gurira as Michonne|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

In the conclusion of "Beside the Dying Fire", a large prison is seen in the background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. [[Bear McCreary]] composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location.<ref name=mtv/> "There<U+2019>s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," he asserted. "I had been thinking about it, there<U+2019>s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don<U+2019>t want to do that.  But, we<U+2019>ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It<U+2019>s a little early to think about it, but I<U+2019>m definitely thinking about it anyway."<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2012/03/20/walking-dead-prison-theme/|title='Walking Dead' Composer Teases Prison Theme|first=Kara|last=Warner|publisher=[[MTV]] ([[Viacom]])|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

==Themes==
{{double image|right|Andrew Lincoln crop.jpg|170|Sarah Wayne Callies 2011.jpg|176|"Beside the Dying Fire" has been seen as a transitioning stage for future development on the show, including the marriage between Rick (Lincoln, ''left'') and Lori (Callies, ''right'').}}

"Beside the Dying Fire" is seen as a transitional stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode, in which he yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for ''The Walking Dead''. "Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was at the start of the season," concluded ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Darren Franich.<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/19/walking-dead-glen-mazzara-showrunner/|title='Walking Dead' showrunner talks finale and season 3|first=Darren|last=Franich|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, "it looks pretty clear that he has lost [Lori and Carl] by doing this" at the end of "Beside the Dying Fire".<ref name=hollz/> In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: "I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn<U+2019>t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that<U+2019>s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He<U+2019>s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn<U+2019>t go well. So I think that he<U+2019>s just done with these people. I think he doesn<U+2019>t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don<U+2019>t like it, they<U+2019>re free to leave."<ref name=ew/>

The episode flashbacks to the previous developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the [[love triangle]] between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son was a part of it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability."<ref name=hollz/>

"Beside the Dying Fire" reminiscences to the first season finale, "[[TS-19]]", in which Rick reveals that everyone in the group is infected with the virus. Although Kirkman described his actions as "exhibiting good leadership skills", Mazzara said that the group began to question Rick's capabilities as a leader. "He presents them with a very pragmatic option: If you don't like it, get the hell out and there are no takers. At the end of the finale, the true horror is Rick when he says, 'It ain't a democracy anymore.' That's the true horror."<ref name=hollz/>

Themes of [[social darwinism]] and [[survival]] are prevalent throughout "Beside the Dying Fire". In the episode, Andrea is separated from the group and is forced to fend herself against the horde of walkers that invaded Hershel's farm. Mazzara felt that separating Andrea from her group would be essential in exploring her character in-depth, as he stated that she was viewed in the light of other characters on ''The Walking Dead''.<ref name=hollz/>

[[File:Laurie Holden 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Critics were keen to the character progression of Andrea (Holden, ''pictured'').]]

The character development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson felt that it served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress [[Linda Hamilton]]. "After a season of whining, there had to have been at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly become Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," he said.<ref name=paste/> Likewise, Kine asserted that "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across."<ref name="Kine"/> Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, on the edge of my seat. And the appearance of the caped figure<U+2014>towing two armless walkers, no less<U+2014>was as dramatic as could be."<Ref name=huff/> 

The gradual alteration of Rick was frequently mentioned in the critiques. Dan Hopper of ''[[Best Week Ever]]'' theorized that such a drastic transition was attributed by the death of his friend Shane.<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestweekever.tv/2012-03-19/walking-dead-finale-recap-beside-the-dying-fire/|title=The Walking Dead Season 2 Finale Recap: A Real Barnburner|first=Dan|last=Hopper|work=[[Best Week Ever]]|publisher=[[VH1]]|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref> Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character. "This is a definite direction. I<U+2019>m not sure if the show<U+2019>s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it<U+2019>s a strong choice. ''The Walking Dead'' has tried to make us value this group of people, as if together, they mean more than they do alone. That hasn<U+2019>t worked, so now it appears we<U+2019>re going to try trial by fire."<ref name=av/> By the end of "Beside the Dying Fire", Ryan concluded that "Rick is becoming the leader he should have been from the start, and he's being clear and upfront about his goals and leadership style."<Ref name=huff/> 

Commentators were divided with the interactions between Rick and his wife Lori. Although Ryan reacted positively to Lincoln's performance, she affirmed that the contradictory nature of Lori almost ruined the scene.<Ref name=huff/> Similarly, Kine criticized Callies' facial expressions during the sequence.<ref name="Kine"/> Jackson wrote, "If that was a challenge from the writers, though, Sarah Wayne Callies has to feel like they're just messing with her at this point. Her character, Lori, basically tells Rick that Shane needs to be put down, and then treats him like a monster when he<U+2019>s forced to follow through with it."<ref name=paste/>
