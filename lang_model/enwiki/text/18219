'''George Francis "Doc" Medich''' (born December 9, 1948) in [[Aliquippa, Pennsylvania|Aliquippa]], [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]], is a former professional [[baseball]] player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1972-1982. He was a medical student at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and acquired the nickname '''"Doc"''' during his early baseball career.

==Early years==
While in college, he pitched for the Pitt baseball team and played tight end on the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football]] team.<ref>{{ cite book | last = O'Brien

Medich received a call to the majors in September {{by|1972}}, facing four batters in his major league debut, giving up two [[single (baseball)|singles]] and two [[base on balls|walks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL197209050.shtml|title=New York Yankees 7, Baltimore Orioles 6|date=September 5, 1972|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

==New York Yankees==
From there, Medich improved substantially, as he went 14-9 with a 2.95 ERA in {{by|1973}} to finish third in [[American League]] [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] balloting. He was also the last Yankee winning pitcher at the Original Yankee Stadium, pitching a shutout on September 29, 1973 against the Detroit Tigers. In {{by|1974}}, Medich won a career high 19 games for the Yankees, tied with teammate [[Pat Dobson]] for most wins on the team. Following a {{by|1975}} season in which Medich went 16-16 with a 3.50 ERA, the New York Yankees completed one of the better trades in franchise history, sending Medich to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for [[Ken Brett]], [[Dock Ellis]] and perennial [[All-Star]] [[second baseman]] [[Willie Randolph]].

==Pittsburgh Pirates==
Medich spent just one injury plagued season with his hometown Pirates, going 8-11 with a 3.52 ERA. Medich put his medical training to good use during a game on the 11th of April against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] at [[Veterans Stadium]]. A 73-year old spectator collapsed with a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and Medich performed [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] on the spectator.<ref>Mackin, Bob, "The Unofficial Guide to Baseball's Most Unusual Records"</ref> During [[Spring training]] {{by|1977}}, he was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] with [[Tony Armas]], [[Doug Bair]], [[Dave Giusti]], [[Rick Langford]] and [[Mitchell Page]] for [[Chris Batton]], [[Phil Garner]] and [[Tommy Helms]].

==1977 season==
Medich was unhappy with his trade as he was a student at the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]], and wished to remain near the school. He threatened to retire, but later joined the A's, and went 10-6 with a 4.69 ERA. As he was slated to become a free agent at the end of the season, A's owner [[Charlie Finley]] attempted to sign Medich to an extension. Unsuccessful, he sold Medich's contract to the expansion [[Seattle Mariners]] in September. He was 2-0 with a 3.63 ERA in three starts for the Mariners before being placed on waivers, and selected by the [[New York Mets]]. He made one start for the Mets, losing to the Pirates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT197709290.shtml|title=Pittsburgh Pirates 5, New York Mets 2|date=September 29, 1977|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

==Texas Rangers==
Medich signed as a Free Agent with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] following the season, going 9-8 with a 3.74 ERA his first season with the club. His best season was the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike shortened]] {{by|1981}} season in which he went 10-6 with a 3.08 ERA, and tied for the AL lead with four [[shutout]]s with [[Richard Dotson]], [[Ken Forsch]], and [[Steve McCatty]]. In five seasons with the club, Medich went 50-43 with a 3.95 ERA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonestarball.com/2006/3/2/173854/5160|title=The Greatest Rangers of All Time - #42 Doc Medich|author=Adam J. Morris|date= March 2, 2006|publisher=Lone Star Ball}}</ref>

==Milwaukee Brewers==
With the Rangers languishing in sixth place in the [[American League West]], Medich's contract was sold to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], who were in first place in the [[American League East]], on August 11, {{by|1982}}. On August 27, [[Rickey Henderson]] broke [[Lou Brock]]'s record for most stolen bases in one season against the Brewers with Medich on the mound.<ref>Baseball<U+2019>s Top 100: The Game<U+2019>s Greatest Records, p.52, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, ISBN 978-1-55365-507-7</ref> Medich reached the post-season for the only time in his career as a member of the Brewers. His only post-season appearance came in game six of the [[1982 World Series]]. Already down 7-0 to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Medich entered in the sixth inning, and gave up six runs (four earned) in two innings of work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN198210190.shtml|title=1982 World Series, Game Six|date=October 19, 1982|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

==Medical career==
Twice during his baseball career Medich went into the stands during a game to aid a fan who was suffering a heart attack. In 1976 in Philadelphia he performed CPR and mouth-to-mouth on a fan who died later that day. In a 1978 game between the Texas Rangers and the [[Baltimore Orioles]] he revived a man who was suffering a heart attack. The man survived and lived several more years.

Shortly after receiving an M.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Medich had his medical license suspended in [[Pennsylvania]] due to a "guilty plea to twelve counts of knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled substance obtained through prescriptions written to nonexistent patients and to people who never received the drugs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6D61239F934A25752C1A965948260|title=Medich in Drug Program|date=November 17, 1983|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

His license remains suspended and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons voted to expel Medich.<ref>(Source: AAOS Bulletin - August 2006 - http://www2.aaos.org/bulletin/aug06/fline14.asp)</ref>
