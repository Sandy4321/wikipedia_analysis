=== Patriarchate of Peja ===
The Patriarchate of Peja ({{coord|42.661|N|20.266|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}) is a Serbian-Orthodox Monastery and serves as the seat of the Serbian archbishopric and patriarchs.

It is believed that the Patriarchate was found when Saint Sava around 1235 was still alive and the site became a metoh (land owned and governed by a monastery).

The Patriarchate of Peja consists of 4 main structures (churches). Its main churches are the Holy Apostles church (1266), the Church of Saint Demetrius (1320), the Church of the Holy Virgin Hodegetria (1330), the church of Saint Nicholas. The decoration of the Church of Saint Demetrius was decorated with frescoes around 1345.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5NyQEh8qFIQC], A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, (The Encyclopaedia Britannica Company, ltd., Jan 1, 1999 - 204 pages)</ref> Paint decoration was used for the exterior walls instead of creating a relief from stone and brick.<ref>Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku (Serbian)</ref>

The Patriarchate of Peja was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004 as an extension to the De<U+00E7>an Monastery, these structures can be found under the category of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Monuments_in_Kosovo ''Medieval Monuments in Kosovo'']<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/], UNESCO (2006). "List of World Heritage in Danger". Retrieved 24 February 2013.</ref>

In the 14<sup>th</sup> century the Church of the Holy Apostles was decorated since small modifications were made to it.

The Serbo-Byzantine architecture has been influenced by the Byzantine architecture and art traditions. Churches built with a Serbo-Byzantine architecture have a rectangular foundation, they have a central
main dome with other smaller domes surrounding the main dome. A typical Serbo-Byzantine church has a rectangular foundation, with a major dome in the center with smaller domes around the center one. Usually Serbo-Byzantine monasteries/churches are decorated with frescoes that depict biblical stories.<ref>[http://www.znanje.org/i/i19/99iv04/99iv0416m/broj3.htm], Srpsko-vizantijski stil - opste osobine (Serbian)</ref><ref>Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku</ref>
