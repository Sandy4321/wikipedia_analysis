'''Max A. Sandlin, Jr.''' (born [[September 29]], [[1952]]), [[United States|American]] politician, was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] representing [[Texas's 1st congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[1997]] to [[2005]].  Sandlin was a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a group of fiscally moderate Democrats in Congress.

Born in [[Texarkana, Arkansas]], Sandlin earned [[Bachelor of Arts| Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Juris Doctor]] degrees from [[Baylor University]], and he was also a member of the university's [[Tryon Coterie]] Club (now the Texas Lambda chapter of [[Phi Delta Theta]]). Here, he was selected Outstanding Young Alumni.  His political career began when he was elected county judge (chief executive) of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]] in [[1986]]. In only one term, he balanced the county [[budget]] and left office with a budget [[surplus]].  He also cut [[ad valorem tax]]es.  In [[1989]], Sandlin was elected Judge of the County Court at Law in the county seat of [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], serving there until his election to Congress in [[1996]]. 

Sandlin served on the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|House Transportation and Infrastructure]], [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services]], [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]] committees.  In [[2002]], Sandlin became a chief deputy whip for the House Democrats.

Sandlin was a leading critic of the [[2003]] redistricting orchestrated by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]].  His district was largely rural and had been throughout its history, but the [[2003]] redistricting cut out [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] and several rural areas that had been part of the district for more than a century.  In their place, it added the heavily [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] cities of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]] and [[Longview, Texas|Longview]].  Sandlin claimed that such a remap silenced unfairly the voices of rural and minority Texans.  After considering a run against Democrat-turned-Republican [[Ralph Hall]] in neighboring [[United States House of Representatives, Texas District 4|District 4]], which had absorbed several counties of his former district, he decided to run again in District 1 in January [[2004]].  He was defeated by Republican [[Louie Gohmert]] in the November election. 

Sandlin advocated that the 2003 redistricting process was illegal and should be ruled as unconstitutional.

On November 1, 2006, Fleishman-Hillard International Communications announced that Max Sandlin would serve as Co-Chair of the newly merged Fleishman-Hillard Government Relations and Mercury Public Affairs Government Relations Operations.

In December, 2006, Max became engaged to be married to [[South Dakota]]'s Congresswoman [[Stephanie Herseth]].<ref>{{cite news|
