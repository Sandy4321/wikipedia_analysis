'''Organ donation''' is the removal of the [[Biological tissue|tissues]] of the [[human body]] from a person who has recently [[died]], or from a living donor, for the purpose of [[Organ transplant|transplanting]] or [[Medical grafting|grafting]] them into other persons. Organs and tissues are removed in procedures similar to [[surgery]], and all incisions are closed at the conclusion of the surgery. Steps are taken to provide a traditional [[funeral]] viewing so that people will not know the deceased was a donor. People of all ages may be organ and tissue donors. See "[[organ transplant]]" for discussion of the mechanics and history of organ transplantation.

In numerical terms, donations from dead donors far outweigh donations by living ones. The laws of different countries allow either the potential organ donor to consent or dissent to the donation during his life time, or his relatives to consent or dissent. Due to these different legislative possibilities, the number of donations per million people varies substantially in different countries.

== Organs and tissues which can be donated ==
Organs that can be procured include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyodn.org/transplant/organ_which.html |publisher=New York Organ Donor Network |title=Which Organs Can Be Donated for Transplantation?}}</ref> the [[heart]], [[intestine]]s, [[kidney]]s, [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[pancreas]]. These are procured from a [[brain death|brain dead]] donor or a donor where the family has consent for donation after cardiac death also know as [[DCD]]. This is where the donor has not progressed to [[brain death]].

The following tissues can be procured include: [[Bone grafting|bones]], [[tendon]]s, [[cornea]]s, [[heart valve]]s, [[femoral vein]]s, [[great saphenous vein]]s, [[small saphenous vein]]s, [[pericardium]], [[Skin grafting|skin grafts]], and the [[sclera]] (the tough, white outer coating surrounding the eye).
These are only procured after someone has [[died]].

Organs that can be donated from living donors include the lung, partial liver or [[Pancreas Transplantation|pancreas]] and the kidney.

== Legislation regarding organ donation ==
There are basically four different legislative approaches to the donation, if the donor has not explicitly dissented. The least restrictive approach is the "dissent solution", according to which the donor has to explicitly dissent to donation during his lifetime. According to the "extended dissent solution", relatives may dissent in the event the potential donor has not consented.

The different legislative approaches are the main reason that countries like Spain (27 donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (24 donors per million inhabitants) have higher "donor rates" than Germany (13 donors) or Greece (6 donors). In most countries with the dissent solutions, there is no "waiting list" for donations, or the list is short, while most countries with consent solutions have substantial "organ shortages".

Under [[United States]] law, the regulation of organ donation is left to [[U.S. states|states]] within the limitations of the federal National Organ Transplant Act of 1968.  Each state's [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] seeks to streamline the process and standardize the rules among the various states, but it still requires that the donor make an affirmative statement during her or his lifetime that she or he is willing to be an organ donor.  Many states have sought to encourage the donations to be made by allowing the consent to be noted on the [[driver's license]].  Still, it remains a pure consent system rather than an extended consent system or even a dissent opt-out system.  Curiously, though, relatives can still dissent even in the presence of evidence of explicit consent by the potential organ donor (driver's liscence, living will, registry information, etc.).   As such, many organ donation campaigns in the United States encourage family communication about one's decision to donate or not to donate.

== Bioethical issues in organ donation ==
Since the mid-[[1970s]], [[bioethics]], a relatively new area of [[ethics]], has emerged at the forefront of modern clinical science.  Many philosophical arguments against organ donation stem from this field.  Generally, the arguments are rooted in either [[deontology|deontological]] or [[teleology|teleological]] ethical considerations.

=== Deontological issues ===
Pioneered by [[Paul Ramsey]] and [[Leon Kass]], few modern bioethicists disagree on the moral status of organ donation. Certain groups, like the [[Roma people|Roma]] ("gypsies"), oppose organ donation on religious grounds, but most of the world's religions support donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community. Issues surrounding [[patient autonomy]], [[living will]]s, and [[guardianship]] make it nearly impossible for [[involuntary organ donation]] to occur. In issues relating to [[public health]], it is possible that a compelling state interest overrules any patient right to autonomy.

From a philosophical standpoint, the primary issues surrounding the morality of organ donation are semantical in nature. The debate over the definition of [[life]], [[death]], [[human]], and [[body]] is ongoing. For example, whether or not a [[brain-dead]] patient ought to be kept [[artificially]] [[animate]] in order to preserve organs for harvesting is an ongoing problem in clinical [[bioethics]]. 

[[Jewish medical ethics]] takes a unique approach. It accepts organ donation as a meritorious charitable act, but with two conditions: that the donor be deceased before removal of the organ and that the organ be treated respectfully (and not, for instance, merely discarded if it for some reason becomes unusable). The ethical problem stems from a lack of consensus on the definition of "deceased." According to the strictest interpretation of [[halachah]], "deceased" means the cessation of all brain stem activity. For most organs, this point is too late for the donation to be medically useful; nevertheless, for the adherent to this view, any prior removal would be tantamount to murder. Given the nature of the "market" for donated organs, the second condition would limit donation to a case where there is a known and ready need for that specific organ. Alternatively, a promise can be made to ensure a proper burial for a donated organ in the event that it is not transplanted.  A movement to promote organ donation from Jews to the general population in consonance with [[halachah]] has been spearheaded by the [[Halachic Organ Donor Society]].

Further, the use of [[cloning]] to produce organs with an identical [[genotype]] to the recipient has issues all its own. Cloning is still a controversial topic, more so when the clone is created with the express purpose of being destroyed for harvesting. {{Fact|date=July 2007}} While the benefit of such a cloned organ is a zero-percent chance of [[transplant rejection]], the ethical issues involved with creating and killing a clone may outweigh these benefits.

A relatively new field of transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. [[Xenotransplantation]], or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues while creating many of its own. While [[xenotransplantation]] promises to increase supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ [[transplant rejection]] and the risk of [[xenozoonosis]], coupled with the general anathema to the idea decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them.

=== Teleological issues ===
On [[teleological]] or [[utilitarian]] grounds, the moral status of "black market organ donation" relies upon the ends, rather than the means. In so far as those that donate organs are often impoverished and those that can afford black market organs are typically well-off, it would appear that there is an imbalance in the trade. In many cases, those in need of organs are put on waiting lists for ''legal'' organs for indeterminate lengths of time &mdash; many die while still on a waiting list. 

Organ donation is fast becoming an important [[bioethics|bioethical]] issue from a social perspective as well.  While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the fact remains that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a [[black market]] often referred to as ''transplant tourism.''

The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are "exploiting" those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs, and that stopping them is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that "exploitation" is morally preferable to "death," and insofar as the choice lies between abstract notions of "justice" on the one hand and a dying person desperately in need of an organ on the other hand, the [[organ trade]] should be legalized.  Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown an extreme regret in a majory of the donors who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11586226&ordinalpos=9&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum</ref>.  Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure <ref>http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/13/1589</ref>

Legalization of the organ trade carries with it its own sense of "justice" as well. Continuing black-market trade creates further disparity on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the welathiest segments could afford such organs as well.

Exploitation arguments generally come from two main areas:

* '''Physical exploitation''' suggests that the operations in question are quite risky, and, taking place in third-world hospitals or "back-alleys," even more risky. Yet, if the operations in question can be made safe, there is little threat to the donor.

* '''Financial exploitation''' suggests that the donor (especially in the [[India]]n subcontinent and [[Africa]]) are not paid "enough." Commonly, accounts from persons who have sold organs in both legal and black market circumstances put the prices at between $150 and $5,000, depending on the local laws, supply of ready donors and scope of the transplant operation <ref>http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_prices</ref>, <ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111200375.html</ref>, <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm</ref>.  In Chennai, India where one of the largest black markets for organs is known to exist, studies have placed the average sale price at little over $1,000 <ref>http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/13/1589</ref>.  Many accounts also exist of donors being postoperatively denied their promised pay <ref>http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_rani</ref>.

* '''The New Cannibalism''' is a phrase coined by anthropologist [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] in 1998 for an article written for The [[New Internationalist]]. Her argument was that the actual exploitation is an ethical failing, a human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ recepticles which may be used to extend the lives of the wealthy[[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/biotech/organswatch/pages/cannibalism.html]].

== Political issues==
There are also controversial issues regarding how organs are allocated between patients.  For example, some believe that livers should not be given to alcoholics in danger of reversion, while others view alcoholism as a medical condition like diabetes.  

Faith in the medical system is important to the success of organ donation.  [[Brazil]] switched to an opt-out system and ultimately had to withdraw it because it further alienated patients who already distrusted the country's medical system.[http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/may/consent01088.pdf]

Adequate funding, strong political will to see transplant outcomes improve, and the existence of specialized training, care and facilities also increase donation rates.  Expansive legal definitions of death, such as [[Spain]] uses, also increase the pool of eligible donors by allowing physicians to declare a patient to be dead at an earlier stage, when the organs are still in good physical condition.

Allowing or forbidding payment for organs affects the availability of organs.  Generally, where organs can not be bought or sold, quality and safety are high, but supply is not adequate to the demand.  Where organs can be purchased, the supply increase somewhat, but safety declines, as families and living donors have an incentive to conceal unfavorable information.

Some political decisions have unintended consequences for donation rates.  For example, motorcycle helmet laws and drunk driving laws have lowered the number of sudden deaths in vehicle accidents, and therefore lowered the number of otherwise healthy corpses which could have been organ donors.

Healthy humans have two kidneys, a redundancy that enables living donors (''[[inter vivos]]'') to give a kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching  for "[[good Samaritan]]" donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. 

The [[Spanish transplant system]] is one of the most successful in the world, but it still can't meet the demand, as 10% of those needing a transplant die while still on the transplant list.<ref>http://www.ont.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=181&&&keyword=&auditoria=F</ref> Donations from corpses are anonymous, and a network for communication and transport allows fast extraction and transplant across the country. Under Spanish law, every corpse can provide organs unless the deceased person expressly rejected it. Because family members still can forbid the donation,[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070718/hl_afp/healthbritainorgan_070718135143], carefully trained doctors ask the family for permission, making it very similar in practice to the United States system.<ref>http://www.cmaj.ca/news/29_09_03.shtml</ref>

In the overwhelming majority of cases, organ donation is not possible for reasons of recipient safety, match failures, or organ condition.  Even in Spain, which has the highest organ donation rate in the world, there are only 35.1 actual donors per million people, and there are hundreds of patients on the waiting list.[http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/may/consent01088.pdf]  This rate compares to 24.8 per million in Austria, where families are rarely asked to donate organs, and 22.2 per million in France, which -- like Spain -- has a presumed-consent system and routinely asks families for the gift of life.

== Issues specifically arising in countries that have implemented the consent solution==
=== Organ shortfall ===
A persistent issue relating to organ donation is the scarcity of organ donors relative to the number of potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists.  In the [[United States]], the waiting list is quoted to be about 96,522 people long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unos.org/ |publisher=United Network for Organ Sharing|title=Organ Donation and Transplantation| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}</ref>  Different organs have different waiting times and success rates because demand is significantly different for different organs.  Three-quarters of patients in need of an organ transplant are waiting for a kidney,[http://www.ctdn.org/resources_public.php#Statistics] and more than half of them die before a matching organ becomes available.[http://www.ustransplant.org/annual_reports/current/105_dh.htm]  This is less common with other organs.  At the Oregon Health and Science University, for example, the median patient who ultimately received an organ waited only three weeks for a heart and three months for a pancreas or liver <U+2014> but 476 days for a kidney, because demand for kidneys substantially outstrips supply.[http://www.ohsu.edu/transplant/]  
In Australia, there are 10.8 transplants per million people [http://www.donatewest.health.wa.gov.au/documents/ReflectionsWinter_2005.pdf], about a third of the Spanish rate. The [[Lions Eye Institute]], in Western Australia, houses the [[Lions Eye Bank]]. The Bank was established in [[1986]] and coordinates the collection, processing and distribution of eye tissue for transplantation. The Lions Eye Bank also maintains a waitlist of patients who require corneal graft operations.
About 100 corneas are provided by the Bank for transplant each year, but there is still an extensive waiting list for corneas.<ref>http://www.lei.org.au/bank/</ref>


Approaches to addressing this shortfall include:
* donor registries and "primary consent" laws, to remove the burden of the donation decision from the legal next-of-kin
* monetary incentives for signing up to be a donor
* an opt-out system ("dissent solution"), in which a potential donor or its relatives must take specific action to  be excluded from organ donation, rather than specific action to be included
* social incentive programs, wherein members sign a legal agreement to direct their organs first to other members who are on the transplant waiting list

===Recent controversy in Organ Transplantation Case in California===

A doctor ([[Hootan Roozrokh]]) in San Luis Obispo, California has been accused by prosecutors of prescribing excessive doses of morphine and sedatives to hasten the death of a disabled man with [[cerebral palsy]] and irreversible brain damage, in order to harvest his organs for transplant.  The case being brought against Dr. Hootan Roozrokh is the first time in US medical history a transplant doctor has ever been charged in this manner.

A concern which many people have about organ donation is that the quality of care which a potential donor may receive may be affected by the arrest and charging of Dr. Roozrokh. Dr. Timothy Pruett, president-elect of the United Network for Organ Sharing [[UNOS]], called the allegations 'horrific.'  

In addition, he worried that they could scare people away from donating organs to help the 95,000 people awaiting life-saving transplants nationwide. UNOS is the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and equity of the nation's transplant system. 'We have to guarantee to the public that we're not going to go out and kill people to get their organs,' said Pruett, chief of transplant surgery at the University of Virginia. 'That's the worst of those cheap sci-fi books: 'The ghoulish docs are out pulling the plugs on these poor defenseless people, trying to snatch their organs.'
