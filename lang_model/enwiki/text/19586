'''Jonathan Stewart Vaughn''' ({{birth date and age|1970|3|12}} in {{city-state|Florissant|Missouri}}) is a former professional [[American football]] player who played [[running back]] and served as a [[kick returner]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for 4 seasons from [[1991 NFL season|1991]] to [[1994 NFL season|1994]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[New England Patriots]], and [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  In his most productive season, he led the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] Patriots in rushing and led the NFL in kickoff returns with a 28.2&nbsp;yards per return average on twenty returns.<ref name=NEPBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriots.com/alumni/index.cfm?ac=alumnibiosdetail&bio=2293|title=Alumni: Alumni Bios Detail|accessdate=2007-12-24|publisher=New England Patriots}}</ref>  Vaughn was the tenth NFL player to accumulate four kickoff return touchdowns during his career and the second to accumulate kickoff return touchdowns for three different teams.<ref name=SN>{{cite web|url=http://news.steelers.com/MediaContent/2007/11/13/11/Steelers_notes_for_Jets_game_84713.pdf|title=Steelers News|publisher=Steelers.com|accessdate=2007-12-25|year=2007|month=November}}</ref> Vaughn measured {{height|ft=5|in=9|abbr=mos|wiki=yes}} and {{convert|203|lb|kg|lk=on}} during his NFL playing days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=VAUGHJON01|publisher=databaseSports.com|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Jon Vaughn}}</ref>

Prior to declaring himself eligible for the [[NFL Draft]] despite remaining eligibility, Vaughn had starred in the [[Big Ten Conference]] for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverines]] earning Co-Big Ten Offensive Football Player of the year honors for the 1990 Big Ten Champions during the [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season]].  Vaughn had established new University of Michigan standards in 200-yard games and yards per carry.   He had also previously been a record setting Missouri high school sprinter who for nearly two decades held both the [[Missouri State High School Activities Association]] (MSHSAA) [[100 metre]] and [[200 metre]] records.

==Early life==
Vaughn was both born and raised in Florissant and attended Florissant [[McCluer North High School]].

Vaughn had a short collegiate career for  the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverines]], but he played for back-to-back Big Ten Conference Champions.<ref name=Bentley1990/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1989fbt.htm|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=2007-10-15|date=2007-03-31|title=1989 Football Team}}</ref>  He accumulated rushing statistics in only sixteen [[NCAA]] games for the Wolverines over the course of two seasons.<ref name=UMStats>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/footstart.php|accessdate=2007-10-16|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|title=M Go Blue - University of Michigan Athletics Official Site}}</ref>  However, in his [[redshirt]] sophomore 1990 season he was selected Co-Big Ten Offensive Football Player of the year (along with [[University of Iowa]] [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Hawkeyes]] players [[Nick Bell (football)|Nick Bell]] and  Matt Rodgers) by the conference's coaches when he started 11 of 12 games.<ref name=Bentley1990>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1990fbt.htm|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=2007-10-15|date=2007-03-31|title=1990 Football Team}}</ref>  Vaughn, who wore #25 for the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] program in [[1989 NCAA Division I-A football season|1989]] and [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]], played running back after redshirting as a [[defensive back]] who wore #46 in [[1988 NCAA Division I-A football season|1988]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm|accessdate=2007-11-04|date=[[2003-08-25]]|title=Bentley Historical Library -- -- U of M Football Rosters|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref>

Vaughn has claims to several important distinctions in University of Michigan Football history. First, he continues to hold the University of Michigan career yards per attempt record (minimum 200&nbsp;attempts).<ref name=RB>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/fbl-2007spring-records1.pdf|title=Record Book|accessdate=2007-12-27|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan & Host Interactive}}</ref>  Second, he opened the 1990 season by posting 201&nbsp;rushing yards on [[September 15]] [[1990]] against [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]] and following it up with 288&nbsp;rushing yards against the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] [[UCLA Bruins|Bruins]] on [[September 22]] [[1990]] at the [[Michigan Stadium|Big House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/gametot.php?gkey=440|title=Versus Notre Dame September 15, 1990|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|work=M Go Blue - University of Michigan Athletics Official Site|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/gametot.php?gkey=443|title=Versus UCLA September 22, 1990|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|work=M Go Blue - University of Michigan Athletics Official Site|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>  This feat made him the first Michigan back to rush for 200&nbsp;yards in consecutive games, a feat not duplicated until [[Mike Hart (football player)|Mike Hart]] did so in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2004/10/26/Sports/Daniel.Bremmer.Hart.Playing.Like.A.Heisman.Candidate-1426155.shtml|title=Daniel Bremmer: Hart playing like a Heisman candidate|publisher=The Michigan Daily |author=Bremmer, Daniel|date=2004-10-26|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>  His third claim is that the 288-yard effort ranks third on the All-time Michigan single game rushing yards list (behind [[Ron Johnson (running back)|Ron Johnson]]'s 347&nbsp;yards in 1968 against the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] and [[Tshimanga Biakabutuka]]'s 313&nbsp;yards against the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] in 1995).<ref name=MFSAQP>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/footstart.php|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=Michigan Football Statistic Archive Query Page| publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref>  In addition to these claims, his 1416&nbsp;yards rushing that season still ranks 13th on the Michigan All-time single season rushing list.<ref name=UMStats/>  During that redshirt sophomore season he paired with freshman [[Ricky Powers]] who set the Michigan freshman rushing record later broken by Hart and who tied with Vaughn for a team-high five 100-yard rushing games although accumulating far fewer total yards than Vaughn.<ref name=UMStats/><ref name=Top5>{{cite web|url=

During the 1990 season Vaughn was closely watched in the press. [[NCAA]] football rushing averages are calculated on a per game basis.  Since Vaughn started the season with two 200-yard efforts, he was atop the rushing charts well into the season.  He entered Michigan's seventh game the weekend of [[October 28]][[1990]] as the nation's leading rusher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF123DF93BA15753C1A966958260|title= College Football: Midwest; Flowers Nets 208 for Nebraska|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2007-12-12|date=[[1990-10-28]]}}</ref>  Entering the eighth week he was averaging over 144 yards per game and was still second in the nation and first in the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD61230F937A35752C1A966958260|title= College Football: Southwest/Midwest; Houston Goes to 8-0 A|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2007-12-12|date=[[1990-11-04]]}}</ref>  He only gained a total of 94 yards in his ninth, tenth and eleventh games combined and entered Michigan's bowl game as #11 in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DD1131F932A05751C1A966958260|title= A Long Day's Wait for No. 1|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2007-12-12|date=[[1990-12-31]]}}</ref>  He ran for 128 yards in his final game and ended the season as the Big Ten Offensive Player of the year.  He also ended the season eleventh in the nation in rushing and second in the Big Ten with 112.4 yards per game.<ref name=NEPBio/>

Oddly, despite his eventual professional success as a kickoff returner, he never returned kickoffs in college.  In 1990, [[Desmond Howard]] and [[Derrick Alexander (wide receiver)|Derrick Alexander]] shared the kick return duties.  In 1989, Desmond Howard and [[Tony Boles]] shared the role.<ref name=MFSAQP/>
