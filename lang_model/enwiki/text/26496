The '''historicity of Jesus''' is the question whether Jesus existed in actuality as a historical figure (rather than being myth, legend or fiction), and whether any of the major events in his life as portrayed in the gospels can be confirmed by historical evidence as having actually happened. The historical analysis techniques used by Biblical scholars have been questioned,<ref name=Allison59>{{cite book | last1 = Allison | first1 = Dale | title = The Historical Christ and the Theological Jesus | publisher = Wm.

However, virtually all scholars of various disciplines who have commented on the subject consider Jesus to have existed, although biblical scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the parts of his life that have been recorded in the Gospels.<ref name=fox>{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0465024971|page=48}}</ref><ref name=nobbs>{{cite web|last1=Dickson|first1=John|title=Best of 2012: The irreligious assault on the historicity of Jesus|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/12/24/3660194.htm|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=Ehrman285>While discussing the "striking" fact that "we don't have any Roman records, of any kind, that attest to the existence of Jesus," Ehrman dismisses claims that this means Jesus never existed, saying, "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees, based on clear and certain evidence."
