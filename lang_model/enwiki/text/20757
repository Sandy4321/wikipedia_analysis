{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
The music of the [[video game]] '''''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''''' was composed by regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The ''Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version'', a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by [[Square]]/[[NTT Publishing]], and subsequently re-released by NTT Publishing.  It was released in North America by [[Tokyopop]] as ''Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack'', with one additional track.  An [[arrangement|arranged]] album entitled ''Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon'', containing a selection of musical tracks from the game performed in the style of [[Celtic music]] by [[M<U+00E1>ire Breatnach]], was released by Square and later re-released by NTT Publishing.  Additionally, a collection of [[piano]] arrangements composed by Nobuo Uematsu and played by [[Toshiyuki Mori]] titled ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV'' was released by NTT Publishing.

==Concept and creation==
Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square Co. headquarters.  He blamed much of the problem on the fact that this was his first soundtrack to use the new [[Super Famicon]] hardware, as opposed to his previous soundtracks composed for the [[Famicon]]. The liner notes for the ''Final Fantasy IV OSV'' album were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM "in the office, naturally."<ref>{{cite web | author=Uematsu, Nobuo | title=Final Fantasy IV OSV Liner Notes | staff=Rebecca Capowski | date=1991-04-13 | url=http://chudahs-corner.com/liners/index.php?catalog=PSCN-5014 | work=http://chudahs-corner.com/ Chudah's Corner | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version'' is a [[soundtrack]] [[album]] of [[video game music]] from ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. The album contains the musical tracks from the game, composed, arranged, produced and performed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. It spans 44 tracks and covers a duration of 58:25. It was first released on [[June 14]], [[1991]], by [[Square Co.]]/[[NTT Publishing]], and subsequently re-released on [[November 26]], [[1994]], and [[October 1]], [[2004]], by NTT Publishing. The original release bears the catalog number ''N23D-001'', and the re-release bears the catalog number ''NTCP-5014''.  After the release of ''Final Fantasy IV'' for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] as part of [[Final Fantasy Chronicles]], the album was released in North America by [[Tokyopop]] on [[August 21]], [[2001]] as ''Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack: Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles''. This is nearly the same release as ''Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version'', except that the songs were rerecorded by [[TOSE]], resulting in minor differences, some song titles were slightly changed, and a 45th track was added, "Theme of Love (Arranged)", which had previously only been released as a piano version on the second track of ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV''.  This release has the catalog numbers ''TPCD 0210-2''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Square Enix Music Online | title=Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack: Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles - Album Information | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ff4official.shtml| work=http://www.squareenixmusic.com | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> 

This album has also been re-released many times with slight changes and under different names. Six tracks from the OSV were released as a promotional 8cm disk in Japan by NTT Publishing as ''Final Fantasy IV Minimum Album'' on [[September 5]], [[1991]], with the catalog number ''N09D-004''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Square Enix Music Online | title=Final Fantasy IV Minimum Album - Album Information | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ff4minimum.shtml| work=http://www.squareenixmusic.com | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref>  The North American version was again released as part of the ''Final Fantasy Finest Box'' by Square Enix on [[March 28]], [[2007]] under the catalog numbers ''FFFB-0001-6'' along with the OSTs of ''Final Fantasy V'' and ''Final Fantasy VI'' after the game was ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]]. This version included several tracks which were not included in the original album, such as the ''Chocobo Forest'' theme, the music for the dancing girl, the short intro to "Cry in Sorrow/Sorrow and Loss", and various fanfares.<ref name="FinestBox">{{cite web | author=Tjan, Mark | title=FF Finest Box | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff-finest/index.html| work=http://www.rpgfan.com| accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Square Enix Music Online | title=Final Fantasy Finest Box - Album Information | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ff4-6box.shtml| work=http://www.squareenixmusic.com | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> After the release of ''Final Fantasy IV'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], a new version of the Soundtrack was released in Japan in January 2008 as ''Final Fantasy IV DS OST''.  Although the songs were the same as on the original album, they were reproduced for the sound hardware of the DS, with new synthesizer effects.  It was released as a two-disk set with a bonus [[DVD]] containing the [[full motion video]] included in the re-releases of ''Final Fantasy IV'', and has the catalog numbers ''SQEX-10105-7''. The theme playing during that video has never been released on any album.

==Reception and legacy==

''Final Fantasy IV OSV'' was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schweitzer, Ben | title=Final Fantasy IV OSV | date=1999 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff4ost/index.html| work=http://www.rpgfan.com| accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref> Sountrack Central compared it favorably with Uematsu's later works, especially the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI, and termed it a "great cd".<ref>{{cite web | author=Hoyak, Paul | title=Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version | url=http://www.altpop.com/stc/reviews/ff4osv.htm | work=http://www.altpop.com| accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> However, the length of several tracks as well as of the album as a whole was criticized, with reviewers finding it "too short" and disapproving of the early fade-out of some songs.  Reviewers found the expanded and remastered version found in the ''Finest Box'' to be comparable to the quality of the original album, with some tracks improving in their remake, becoming "deeper" or "sharper" as was appropriate.<ref name="FinestBox" />  Overall reception of ''Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon'' was also positive, though some reviewers found fault with it. Patrick Gann of [[RPGFan]] described it as "Awesome. Purely spectacular." and Matt Brady of Final Fantasy Symphony concurred, saying that the "music quality for this soundtrack was spectacular."<ref name="RPGFCM">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick; Space, Daniel| title=Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon | publisher=rpgfan.com | year=2003 | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff4celtic/index.html | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref><ref name="FFSCM">{{cite web | author=Brady, Matt | title=Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon | publisher=ffsymphony.net | url=http://www.ffsymphony.net/staff_reviews.php?review_id=9&soundtrack_id=43 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Daniel Space of RPGFan, however, found the quality mixed, and said that "some of the pieces do not live up to the new orchestration," although others "were a delight to hear."  He also found some of the instruments to be slightly out of tune, which he disliked, though Matt Brady felt it gave the songs an "ethnic feel".<ref name="RPGFCM" /><ref name="FFSCM" /> Critical reception for ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV'' was positive, with reviewers terming the album "fantastic".<ref name="RPGFPC">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick; Thomas, Damian| title=Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections | publisher=rpgfan.com | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff4piano/index.html | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Damian Thomas of [[RPGFan]] said that the album was "a true gem" and said that despite his dislike of piano arrangements, he "truly appreciated" the album.  Some reviewers felt that the songs in the album were "simplistic", especially in comparison to the piano collections for [[Final Fantasy V]] and [[Final Fantasy VI]], but said that "its simplicity calls for a different feeling, and it is still great," and that despite the lack of complexity, "all of the songs...are extremely nicely done."<ref name="RPGFPC" /><ref>{{cite web | author=Gordon, Adam| title=Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections | publisher=altpop.com | url=http://www.altpop.com/stc/reviews/ff4pc.htm | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

The music of Final Fantasy IV has remained popular since its release, especially in Japan. The track "Theme of Love" has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hitmitsu, Suppai | title=Final Fantasy Becomes Curriculum | publisher=ign.com | year=March 31st, 2004 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/503/503226p1.html | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | year=2007 | date=July 30 | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/22905.html | title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part III | medium=GameTrailers.com feature | publisher=[http://www.gametrailers.com GameTrailers.com]}}</ref> Additionally, [[The Black Mages]], a band that arranges music from ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'' video games into a [[rock music]] style, has arranged two pieces from ''Final Fantasy IV''. These are "Battle with the Four Fiends", an arrangement of  "The Dreadful Fight", and "Zeromus", an arrangement of "The Final Battle", both of which can be found on the album ''[[The Black Mages II: The Skies Above|The Skies Above]]'', published in 2004.<ref>N/A (2004).
