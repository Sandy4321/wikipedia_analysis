The '''Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race 10K''', or more commonly called the '''Peachtree Road Race''', is a [[long-distance track event|10 kilometer]] [[road running|road race]] held annually in Atlanta, Georgia on [[July 4]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. The Peachtree Road Race was until recently the world's largest 10 kilometer race (an estimated 55,000 participants in 2007),<ref name='at history'>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/at02008.htm |title=History of Peachtree |accessdate=2008-02-07 |work=Atlanta Track Club }}</ref><ref name='ajc'/> a title it  has held since the late 1970s.<ref name=facts>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/at02010.htm Peachtree Fun Facts]</ref> The Race's registration of 55,000 was surpassed in April 2008 by the [[Vancouver Sun Run]] which had over 59,000 registrants (although the Sun Run is two races, a 10k and a 2.5k;  the Peachtree has just one).<ref>The Vancouver Sun at canada.com http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/sunrun/index.html</ref> The race has become a city-wide tradition in which over 70,000 amateur and professional runners try to register for one of the limited 55,000 spots. The event also includes a [[wheelchair]] race which precedes the footrace. In recent years the race also has a special divisions for soldiers stationed in the [[Middle East]].  

Children can participate in Peachtree Junior, held in late May or early June.  

== History ==
[[Image:Peachtreeroadrace.jpg|thumb|2007 Peachtree Road Race]]
The Peachtree Road Race was started in 1970 by the [[Atlanta Track Club]]. The first year approximately 110 runners ran from the old Sears building at the corner of [[Peachtree Street|Peachtree Road]] and Roswell Road to Central City Park (now [[Woodruff Park]]). The race was sponsored by [[Carling|Carling Brewery]]. The next year the race increased to 198 runners. Organizers used the sponsorship money to purchase [[T-shirts]] but underestimated the number of participants. T-shirts were given out to the first finishers until they ran out. In 1972 the organizers only ordered 250 T-shirts but 330 runners ran the race. In 1974 the event grew to 765 runners, 1975 there were over 1000 runners.<ref name='at history'/>

In 1976 Carling Brewery dropped its sponsorship of the race and the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' began sponsoring the race, bringing added coverage and popularity to the race. That year over 2300 runners competed. In 1977 over 6500 runners competed overwhelming the capacity of Central City Park. As a result, in 1978 the course was moved to starting at Lenox Square and finishing at the [[Piedmont Park]]. In 1979 the race attracted over 20,000 runners. In 1980 the number of participants was limited to 25,000 runners, which continued until 1990. In 1982 the wheelchair division was formed for the race.<ref name='at history'/>

The race became so popular that by 1989 the race reached capacity in only 9 days and the Atlanta Track Club increased the limit to 40,000 in 1990. In 1992 it expanded to 45,000 runners; in 1995 it expanded to 50,000 runners; and in 1998 it was expanded to 55,000 runners, which remains the current limit.<ref name='at history'/>

The Peachtree Road Race has become an event important in Atlanta culture. In addition to the 55,000 participants there are approximately 150,000 observers who line both sides of the entire course to cheer and support the runners.<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/at02000.htm Peachtree 10K]</ref>  Atlantan and nationally syndicated consumer advocate [[Clark Howard]] also participates in the race by running in the last starting group, wearing number 99999. Atlanta [[mayor]] [[Shirley Franklin]] also participates in the event. Some runners deliberately wear costumes, many of which are patriotic (due to the event occurring on Independence Day). The entire race is also televised on [[WAGA-TV]].<ref name='at history'/> 

The race hosted the [http://www.usatf.org/events/2007/USA10kmChampionship-Men/ USA Men's 10 km Championship] in 2007.

== Course description ==
The Peachtree Road Race is a 6.2 mile (10,000 m) road race. The race starts on Peachtree Road at Lenox Square Mall (just south of Lenox Road). The race continues down Peachtree Road. Mile 4<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/pdf/prr-elevation.pdf Peachtree Road Race Course Profile]</ref> (near Piedmont Hospital) is mostly uphill and has received the nickname "Cardiac Hill".<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/am-coursemap.pdf Atlanta Track Club Thanksgiving-day Marathon Map]</ref>. After mile 5, the race turns east onto 10th Street with the finish line next to Piedmont Park.<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/at02020.htm Peachtree Road Race Course]</ref> 

In 2008, because of severe drought conditions, the race was unable to end in Piedmont Park, and runners turned east onto 10th street before heading to Juniper Street, ending at the intersection of Ponce de Leon and Juniper St, where racers finished by going uphill instead of the older downhill stretch of 10th St.  Runners then walked a short distance to the Atlanta Civic Center for finish line festivities.  This unpopular course lasted one year, after which the course returned to the traditional pattern.

As typical of other road races, the roads used are completely closed to vehicular traffic and observers watch from the sidewalks. Water is provided at each mile; approximately 500,000 cups and 120,000 gallons of water are used.<ref name=facts/>  Approximately 3,000 volunteers are needed to work the race.<ref name=facts/>

Many runners utilize [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] to travel to the start site and back from the finish line due to the large crowds, limited parking and road closures.

== Race registration and starting group placement ==
Until 2008, applications for registration in the Peachtree Road Race were published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on the third Sunday in March. The first 45,000 applications received were automatically entered into the race; an additional 10,000 applications are randomly selected from remaining applications post-marked by March 31. The race is currently limited to 55,000 entries. The 2009 registration fee is $33.<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/at02001.htm Peachtree Registration]</ref>  The Atlanta Track Club requires runners to be at least 10 years of age on the day of the race.  

The race is comprised of 9 starting groups. The first group is divided into top-seeded runners, sub-seeded runners (sub 42 minutes), timegroup 1A (42 to 50 minutes), timegroup 1B (50 minutes to 55 minutes). A documented 10K time is required for placement into these groups. In recent years, the Atlanta Track Club has recommended all runners who have run a [[USA Track and Field|USATF]] certified 10k within the past two years to submit their times to race authorities in order to be placed in appropriate groups, so that faster runners will not be put in the slower groups.  This reserves timegroup 2 to be for runners between 55 and 75 minutes.  The remaining starting groups (3-9) are for undocumented times and casual runners/walkers<ref>[http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/peachtree/Time_Group_Placement/10K_Qualifying_Times.htm Qualifying Times]</ref>.  The starting groups are so large that it takes approximately an hour and a half from the first group starting until the last group starts, as the groups are started in twelve-minute intervals.

Due to the limited number of spaces available in the race, as well as the 3 and a half month advance registration requirement, some people have attempted to sell their number on ebay and craigslist, although this practice is prohibited by the Atlanta Track Club. Runners who are assigned a number for the race, and subsequently cannot run, are able to return their number to the Atlanta Track Club in exchange for a card guaranteeing placement in next year's race. (Registration fees, however, are not refunded.)

On July 4th 2007, three men were caught sneaking into the Peachtree Road Race. In addition to a $1,000 fine, each was banned from the Peachtree Road Race for life.<sup>Citation Needed</sup>

==2009 Changes==

Starting in 2009, registration applications began to be implemented online on the Active.com site, in association with the Atlanta Track Club starting on the third Sunday in March.  Controversy ruled over the 2009 registration, as over 800 complaints were filed because of server failures by the outsourced registration.  The 45,000 applications sold out within hours. <REF>[http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/peachtree/stories/2009/03/15/peachtree_registration_open.html AJC Peachtree Online Registration closed]</REF>

The next Sunday, applications for the 10,000 slot lottery are published in the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution''  These slots are randomly selected from remaining applications post-marked by March 31. 

The Atlanta Track Club experimented in November 2008 at The Weather Channel Atlanta Marathon and Half Marathon with implementation of the ChronoTrack D-Tag transponder system, a disposable tag system.  Following its success, the organisation announced starting with the 2009 Peachtree, all runners -- not just the Elite and Time Group 1 runners -- will be timed.   This will help with positioning runners for future Peachtree events.<REF> [http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/peachtree/stories/2009/02/26/peachtree_road_race_electronic_timing.html Peachtree Road Race will time all runners]</REF>

== T-Shirts ==
[[Image:Peachtree Road Race Tshirt.JPG|thumb|2007 Peachtree Road Race T-shirt]]
[[Image:Peachtree tshirt 2009.jpg|thumb|2009 Peachtree Road Race T-shirt]]
The official race t-shirt is perhaps the most popular aspect of the Peachtree Road Race, perhaps due to the limited numbers of t-shirts available in the early race years. Each year a different design is chosen through a contest sponsored by the [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] newspaper and a limited number of shirts are made. T-shirts are only available to runners who finish the race, and thus have become a status-symbol among Atlanta culture.

== 2008 Course ==
With the entire north Georgia region facing historic drought conditions in 2008, water conservation measures were enacted prohibiting outdoor watering of plants and lawns. As a result of the watering ban, the City of Atlanta decided to prohibit large festivals (over 50,000 people) from using Piedmont Park in 2008 in order to protect the grass lawns which cannot be watered. Displaced events included the Atlanta Pride, Jazz, and Dogwood Festivals as well as the Peachtree Road Race which traditionally used Piedmont Park for the finish line of the race and distribution of T-shirts.<ref name='ajc'>{{cite news | first=Ken | last=Sugiura | coauthors= | title=Peachtree Road Race, 3 festivals moved from Piedmont Park | date=2008-01-11 | publisher= | url =http://www.ajc.com/wireless/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/01/11/piedmont_0112.html | work =The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | language = }}</ref>  The Peachtree Road Race considered moving the finish area to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], but Georgia Tech refused, citing safety concerns.<ref name='ajc-2'>{{cite news | first=Ken | last=Sugiura | coauthors= | title=Georgia Tech says no to Peachtree Road Race | date=2008-01-31 | publisher= | url =http://www.ajc.com/news/content/sports/stories/2008/01/31/roadrace_0201.html | work =The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | language = }}</ref>  On February 19th it was announced that the race finish line will be at the intersection of Juniper Street and Ponce de Leon Avenue in Midtown. Runners then walked three more blocks to the [[Atlanta Civic Center]] parking area where the awards stage, family meeting area and sponsor village were located.<ref>{{cite press release | title=New Finish Line Announced for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race 2008 | url=http://www.atlantatrackclub.org/pdf/08-prr-release.pdf}}</ref> The race returned to its previous course in 2009.

== Race financials ==
It is estimated that the Peachtree Road Race costs over $1,000,000, if in-kind contributions are included.<ref name=atlbuscron>{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Bently | coauthors= | title=Cashing in on race day| date=2003-07-18 | publisher= | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/07/21/smallb2.html | work =The Atlanta Business Chronicle | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | language = }}</ref>  The race must pay between $25,000 and $30,000 to government agencies for their costs of supporting the race. T-shirts for runners and volunteers are estimated to cost over $200,000. The race also pays $25,000 for its timing system and $100,000 for contract labor.<ref name=atlbuscron/>  The Peachtree Road Race was estimated in 2003 to have an economic impact over $10,000,000.<ref name=atlbuscron/>  Profits from the race entry fees and sponsorships are used to fund the Atlanta Track Club.<ref name=atlbuscron/>
