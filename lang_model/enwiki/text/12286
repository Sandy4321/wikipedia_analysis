'''''Auf der Maur''''' is the eponymous debut studio album by the Canadian [[alternative rock]] musician [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], released on February 2, 2004 on [[Capitol Records]]. Following her career as a bassist for [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], Auf der Maur recorded the album of the course of two years in various studios through the United States and Canada with producer [[Chris Goss]]. The songs featured on ''Auf der Maur'' were written over a ten year period, from 1992 to 2002, throughout her time in [[Tinker (band)|Tinker]], Hole and The Smashing Pumpkins.

''Auf der Maur'' features a number of guest musicians and collaborators including former bandmates [[Eric Erlandson]] and [[James Iha]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]] frontman [[Josh Homme]], [[Mark Lanegan]], [[Jeordie White]] and [[John Stanier (drummer)|John Stanier]]. The album's sound deviates significantly from Auf der Maur's previous work and features a more [[Experimental music|experimental]] and [[Progressive rock|progressive]] sound.

Upon its release, ''Auf der Maur'' received generally favourable reviews and was a moderate commercial success, selling 200,000 copies worldwide. Following a successful tour through Europe and United Kingdom prior the album's release, two of the album's three singles<U+2014>"[[Followed the Waves]]" and "[[Real a Lie]]"<U+2014>charted in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A subsequent tour of North America and another tour in the United Kingdom led the album to chart in both the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[UK Album Chart]] at number 187 and number 31, respectively.

==Background==
Following her departure from [[Hole (band)|Hole]] in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for [[D'arcy Wretzky]] in [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] in early 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hole Call It Quits &#124; Music News|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hole-call-it-quits-20020524|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Saraceno|first=Christina|date=May 24, 2002|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref> Auf der Maur toured with the band for the ''Sacred and Profane'' tour<ref>{{cite web|title=For Your Excessive Heat Warning Listening Pleasure: Smashing Pumpkins at Bronco Bowl <U+2013> Dallas News <U+2013> Unfair Park|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2011/07/for_your_sunday_night_listenin.php|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|date=July 31, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref> in support of ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]'' (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with [[Jam!]], Auf der Maur said: "one of the reasons why I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" and that her "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record."<ref name="jam">{{cite web|title=MAdM &#124; Melissa Auf der Maur &#124; Archives &#124; Articles &#124; Jam Music <U+2013> Auf Der Maur calls on friend for solo album|url=http://melissaaufdermaur.org/articles/view/17|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=melissaaufdermaur.org|date=June 20, 2002|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref> In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered "old demos" in her [[Montr<U+00E9>al]] residence and "realized [she] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." Among the demos was "[[Real a Lie]]", a song written with frequent collaborator [[Steve Durand]], that was released as a single by the duo's former band [[Tinker (band)|Tinker]] in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album "happened very naturally."<ref name="jam" />

==Recording==
The album was recorded during 2001, 2002 and 2003 at various studios throughout the United States and Canada, including [[Stagg Street Studios]] in Los Angeles, [[Stratosphere Sound]] in New York City, [[Rancho De La Luna]] in [[Joshua Tree, California]], Glenwood Place Studios in [[Burbank, California]], [[The Sound Factory]] in Hollywood, [[Sound City Studios]] and Kevin Augunas's residence in [[Van Nuys, California]], and French Kiss Studios in [[Montr<U+00E9>al]], Canada.<ref name="notes" /> Recording sessions began in October 2001 and initially she intended to record in Chicago, Illinois, but those plans were later abandoned.<ref name="MTV1">{{cite web|title=Hole/Pumpkins Bassist Gets Her Rocks Off While Working On Solo LP <U+2013> Music, Celebrity, Artist News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453042/holepumpkins-bassist-working-on-solo-lp.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=March 25, 2002|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref> Although each session had individual [[Audio engineering|engineers]], Auf der Maur and [[Chris Goss]] were primary producers of the project. Auf der Maur also financed the recording sessions herself,<ref name="jam" /><ref name="MN" /> as she was not signed to a record label at the time. She also self-financed the sessions to "secure creative control" as she "wanted the foundation of it to be really pure."<ref name="MN">{{cite web|title=MAdM &#124; Melissa Auf der Maur &#124; Archives &#124; Articles &#124; MetroNews <U+2013> Melissa's moment|url=http://melissaaufdermaur.org/articles/view/93|work=Metro News|publisher=melissaaufdermaur.org|date=May 28, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Describing the recording process, Auf der Maur said: "The L.A. section of the record is the prettier, more ethereal stuff [and] the dark, rock stuff actually <U+2013><U+2013> which is really my main route and the muscle of the record <U+2013><U+2013> was recorded in Canada.

Various musicians collaborated during the recording of ''Auf der Maur''. Former bandmates [[Eric Erlandson]] and James Iha performed guitar to "Would If I Could" and "Skin Receiver," respectively, [[Mark Lanegan]] provided additional vocals to "[[Taste You]]," and [[Queens of the Stone Age]] frontman [[Josh Homme]] played guitar on four songs and backing vocals on "Skin Receiver." Speaking of the contributions, Auf der Maur said: "I am so lucky I have all these talented friends. It is not too hard to find musicians who are available to play. It just so happens the most generous people are also the best and were willing to play."<ref name="jam" /> During the earlier stages of recording, a duet with [[Rufus Wainwright]] was also considered.<ref name="take" />

Following the tour, Capitol Records was taken over by EMI. All of the material that had been recorded for ''Auf der Maur'', including outtakes, demos and rehearsal recordings, were seized by EMI's [[red tape]]. Following months of negotiations, Auf der Maur won the rights to the recordings and was subsequently dropped from Capitol/EMI in 2006. Reflecting on the experience, Auf der Maur said there is "a gross feeling when you merge your heart with a corporate structure."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verbicidemagazine.com/2011/02/24/interview-melissa-auf-der-maur/|title=Interview: Melissa Auf der Maur|work=Verbicide|last=Lapham Fersch|first=Andrew|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> Auf der Maur took the experience into consideration when considering labels to release ''Auf der Maur'''s follow-up, ''[[Out of Our Minds]]'' (2010), which was [[self-released]].
