"'''The World Is Not Enough'''" is a 1999 orchestral rock song performed by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], and was the [[theme music|theme]] [[single (music)|single]] of the [[James Bond]] film [[The World Is Not Enough|of the same name]].<ref name=TWINEcredits>{{cite web|title=The World Is Not Enough; Music; Credits|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/twine_music.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ|accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref> The song and [[The World Is Not Enough (soundtrack)|accompanying soundtrack]] were released internationally by [[Radioactive Records]] as the feature film [[premiere]]d in [[movie theaters|theaters]] around the world at the end of November of that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garbage Puts Bond To Bed; B-Sides, Remixes Up Next|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429328/garbage-puts-bond-bed-bsides-remixes-up-next.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=1999-08-24}}</ref> Garbage recorded the theme song while [[Version 2.0 tour|touring Europe]] in support of their [[Music recording sales certification|platinum certified]] album ''[[Version 2.0]]''.<ref name="jam">{{cite web | url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/G/Garbage/1999/11/05/745309.html| title=Garbage tackles Bond legacy| work=JAM!

"The World Is Not Enough" was written by [[composer]] [[David Arnold]], who also did the score for the film, and [[lyricist]] [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]], who had worked in four [[James Bond music|Bond songs]] before.

"The song reflects the film.

==Development==
===Background===
In September 1998, [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]], the owners of [[Eon Productions]] and long-time producers of the [[James Bond (films)|James Bond movie franchise]] selected David Arnold to compose the [[Film score|score]] for the nineteenth Bond movie, which was scheduled for [[theatrical release]] in November of the following year.<ref name=Courtcase>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1380062.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60N7GghtM |date=2004-08-03|archivedate=2011-07-22| title=Frank P. FOGERTY and Nathan Crow, Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. MGM GROUP HOLDINGS CORP., INC., d/b/a MGM Universal Music Group, Inc., Universal Studios, Inc., and EON Productions, Ltd., Defendants-Appellees|publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> Arnold had already composed the score for the previous film, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' and oversaw the recording of ''[[Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project]]'', an album of [[cover versions]] recorded by contemporary artists such as [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Aimee Mann]] and [[David McAlmont]]. Arnold and the movie [[production team]] were keen for a rough draft to be written early so that elements of the [[melody]] could be incorporated into the main score. [[Michael Apted]], who would [[movie director|direct]] the film, thought that the use of "[[Nobody Does It Better]]", as a love theme throughout ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' had been very effective and wanted Arnold to use that as a reference point.<ref>{{cite video| people = [[Michael Apted]]|date = 2000| quote="I made it clear to [Arnold] the sort of tone I needed for the song. We wanted something romantic and haunting. I was insistent that we got a rough draft of the song out soon enough so that it could be incorporated into the score. I remembered how effective that was in ''The Spy Who Loved Me''; they were able to use the song, "Nobody Does It Better" as a love theme throughout the film."|title = The World Is Not Enough [[Audio commentary|DVD Commentary]]| medium = DVD| publisher = MGM Home Video}}</ref>

===Composition===
Arnold felt the need to compose a theme song that married the "classic Bond sound" with the [[electronica]] that would influence the majority of his score.<ref name=Cocktail>{{cite video| people = [[David Arnold]]|date = 2000| title = ''Bond Cocktail'' |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM Home Video| quote=If James Bond abandoned his [[black tie|dinner jacket]], [[Womanizing|womanising]], or [[List of James Bond gadgets|gadget-using]] you'd feel cheated. The music is a safety net for the audience, without it you haven't got a James Bond movie, you've got an action movie.}}</ref> An [[orchestra]]l sound would be required because the audience were [[classical conditioning|conditioned]] to expect certain elements in a Bond movies, and that without them, ''The World Is Not Enough'' would simply be a generic [[action movie]].<ref name=Cocktail/> Getting the balance right could potentially be a "[[Chalice#Poisoned chalice|poisoned chalice]]", <!--- paraphrasing from: "and it's one of those things where people say it sounds too much like a James Bond song, or not enough like a James Bond song" ---> because the final results could either sound ''too much'' or ''too little'' like a Bond theme.<ref name="comment2">{{cite video| people = [[David Arnold]]|date = 2003| title = The World Is Not Enough [[Audio commentary|DVD Commentary]]: Pete Lauritson, David Arnold & Vic Armstrong |medium = DVD| publisher = MGM Home Video}}</ref> To help write the lyrics for the song, which was titled "The World Is Not Enough" after the film, Arnold collaborated with lyricist [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]].<ref name=Courtcase/> Black already had thirty years of experience of writing Bond themes, and had written the lyrics to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]'s "[[Thunderball (soundtrack)|Thunderball]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=Thunderball; Music Credits|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/tb_music.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ.com|accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref> [[Shirley Bassey]]'s "[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=Diamonds Are Forever; Music; Credits|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/daf_music.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ|accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref> [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu's]] "[[The Man with the Golden Gun (soundtrack)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Man With The Golden Gun; Music; Credits|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/tmwtgg_music.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ|accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]'s [[closing credits]] theme "[[Tomorrow Never Dies (soundtrack)|Surrender]]" from the previous film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tomorrow Never Dies; Music; Credits|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/tnd_music.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ|accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref> Arnold and Black met several times to discuss the lyrics for "The World Is Not Enough" and otherwise collaborated via the exchange of phone calls, faxes and e-mails.<ref name=Courtcase/> According to Arnold, he "strung some la-las together, and all of a sudden the [song] came to life". By the end of the year, Arnold and Black had completed the music and lyrics, except for the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] - a contrasting section of around eight [[Bar (music)|bars]].<ref name=Courtcase/>

{{Quote box|| quote ="Part of the reason I thought Garbage would be such a good idea [for the theme song], is that I think Shirley Manson is someone who could easily inhabit Bond's world. The whole thing about the song is that it needs to entice you, and beckon you in.

[...] Shirley is the only person I can think of in the world of contemporary music who is the musical equivalent of Elektra.

Arnold personally presented the demo to Wilson, Broccoli and Apted, who were "extremely pleased" with the results. Shortly after, Arnold's [[Talent agent|agent]] presented the demo to [[MGM]] [[Senior management|executives]] in Los Angeles who initially disliked it because it was a [[ballad (music)|ballad]] and not more upbeat with a faster [[tempo]]. MGM later asked Arnold to rewrite a [[note|three-note]] [[Sequence (music)|sequence]] that was felt too similar to a [[Motif (music)|motif]] present in earlier Bond themes.<ref name=Courtcase/>

Arnold first proposed offering the theme tune to [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] [[lead singer]] [[Shirley Manson]] in London at the beginning of the year.<ref name=Courtcase/> A week after their meeting, he sent the band the rough demo; Garbage loved it.<ref name="kiss">{{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html|title=MKKBB talks with Butch Vig|accessdate=2006-09-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060902043547/http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html |archivedate = September 2, 2006|deadurl=yes|quote=David sent us a rough demo with just the synthesizer playing the string mockup and after Don entered some lyrics.

Manson later explained, "I jumped at the chance [to record the theme] because I think it's an institution I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child."<ref name="cocktail" /> The opportunity to record a Bond theme appealed to Manson because "you know it's going down in movie history."<ref name="kerrang">{{cite journal| date = 1999-11-17| title = I Am A Bond Girl!| journal = [[Kerrang!]]| publisher = [[Emap]]| quote = One of the biggest attractions in doing a Bond song is that you know it's going down in movie history.}}</ref> Manson eventually requested a small lyrical change because the line ''"I know when to kiss and I know when to kill"'' did not meet her tastes.

Garbage's involvement was confirmed at the beginning of August in a [[press release]] sent out by MGM and Shirley Manson's [[record label]] Radioactive Records, who were to release the soundtrack and the single.<ref name=TWINEad/> Radioactive's [[Gary Kurfirst]] stated "The score for the film is first rate and the Garbage track is stellar. Our own Shirley Manson is spectacular as always", while [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president Jay Boberg followed up "Every James Bond film is a vital piece of popular culture, and as a life-long Bond fan, thrilled at releasing the soundtrack.

===Recording===

Four man sit in front of a soundboard, while a woman wearing a red shirt stands inside the recording booth.]] Garbage, who were in the middle of a European [[concert tour]], and Arnold co-produced the [[String section|string arrangement]] for the song over the phone. The band were anxious that the right [[Key (music)|keys]] and tempo were considered before they could schedule a window in their itinery to record their parts. The band set up a portable [[Pro Tools|digital studio]] to record material to present to Arnold from wherever in Europe they were performing. The strings would have to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts, as the string arrangement carried the structure of the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html|title=MKKBB talks with Butch Vig|accessdate=2006-09-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060902043547/http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html |archivedate = 2006-09-23|deadurl=yes|quote=It was the first time we were working with a 60-piece orchestra.

Further recording took place in August at [[Armoury Studios]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where Garbage built upon the initial mix of "The World Is Not Enough" by adding their own production to the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html|title=MKKBB talks with Butch Vig|accessdate=2006-09-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060902043547/http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/mkkbb/index.html |archivedate = 2006-09-23|deadurl=yes|quote="We flew up to Vancouver where we took the track and 'Garbage-ized' it.

"The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going [[Dynamics (music)|dynamically]]", Vig recalled, "Besides the drums and bass and some [[percussion|percussive]] [[Music loop|loops]], there's a little bit of guitar that [[Duke Erikson|Duke]] and [[Steve Marker|Steve]] did.

===Copyright infringement case===
Two song-writers sued Eon, MGM, [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] and [[Universal Studios]] for [[copyright infringement]] over "The World Is Not Enough", alleging that the track was a derivative of their song "This Game We Play" which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration on the [[soundtrack]] of ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]''. The basis for their claim centered around a four-note sequence in "The World Is Not Enough" that they alleged was identical to a part in "This Game We Play". While the songwriters were gathering [[evidence]] to prove their case, they posed as an employee of composer [[James Horner]] to contact Don Black and solicit his services for the film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''. They recorded their conversation with Black, and deliberately tried to trick him into revealing when he and Arnold composed "The World Is Not Enough". The pair also contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.<ref name=Courtcase/>

The case was argued in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee]] in June 2004. It was agreed by the court that "The World Is Not Enough" did share an identical sequence with "This Game We Play". The [[plaintiffs]] eventually conceded that Arnold did not have access to "This Game We Play" after it was proved, with journal entries, delivery [[invoice]]s, phone call records, computer records, written declarations from both Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and [[Deposition (law)|testimony]] from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson, and Arnold's [[personal assistant]] as "irrefutable evidence" that "The World Is Not Enough" had already been written and had not been changed significantly, aside from a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and one amendment to the score (the removal of the "three-note motif" to accommodate the MGM executives), from the date that "This Game We Play" was submitted to MGM.<ref name=Courtcase/>

Some of the shots look like [[Stanley Kubrick]]", recalled Vig, "For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video."<ref name="kiss"/> "[It is] like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a [[kamikaze]] warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get [to being in a Bond movie]," Manson later commented.<ref name="MM"/>

The video shoot was documented by a ''[[Making The Video]]'' camera crew, and made its worldwide premiere on [[MTV]] following the special on October 20, 1999.<ref name="mtvema"/> The video debuted on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' the next day.

===Critical reception===
"The World Is Not Enough" received mostly positive critique from music journalists. ''Kerrang!'' magazine noted that "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem."<ref>{{cite journal| date = 1999-11-13| title = Review of The World Is Not Enough| journal = [[Kerrang!]]| publisher = [[Emap]]| quote = Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem}}</ref> ''[[Radio Times]]'' noted that the song "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/chmph/the-world-is-not-enough-%281999%29|title=Radio Times Film Review|publisher=''Radiotimes.com''|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> while [[Allmusic]]'s Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage had "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r443585|pure_url=yes}}|title="The World Is Not Enough" OST review |publisher=''[[Allmusic]]''|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> [[PopMatters]] considered the song a "top-notch Bond theme, following the template of Shirley Bassey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/46074/garbage-absolute-garbage/|title=Absolute Garbage review|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|last=Sawdey|first=Evan|date=2007-08-03|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> Chuck Taylor, in a review for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', wrote that the use of Garbage was an inspired choice, and that the song "rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus we have come to expect," adding, "the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint.

Some negative comment towards the theme centred around its classic Bond sound. [[LAUNCHcast]]'s James Poletti commented whilst the song was a "perfectly competent Bond theme" but "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps they would have done better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek."<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515221941/http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_s/12123.html/|archivedate=2011-05-15| url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_s/12123.html/| title= Garbage : The World Is Not Enough| work=LAUNCHcast| accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> [[Melody Maker]] stated "you know what this sounds like before you hear it.
