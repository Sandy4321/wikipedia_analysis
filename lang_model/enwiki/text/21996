'''''Wrapped in Red''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Kelly Clarkson]], released on October 25, 2013 by [[RCA Records]]. The album is a follow-up to her first [[greatest hits album]], ''[[Greatest Hits <U+2013> Chapter One (Kelly Clarkson album)|Greatest Hits <U+2013> Chapter One]]'', and its companion [[extended play]], ''[[The Smoakstack Sessions Vol. 2]]''. Produced by [[Greg Kurstin]], it is her first [[Christmas album]] and her first record to be solely released by RCA. ''Wrapped in Red'' consists sixteen tracks, featuring five co-penned original songs and eleven cover versions of [[Christmas music#Popular Christmas songs|Christmas standards]] and [[Christmas carol|carol]]s, two of which are duets featuring recording artists [[Ronnie Dunn]], [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Trisha Yearwood]].

Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre, Clarkson had long-desired to record a Christmas album as a means defy genre limitations. She commissioned her frequent collaborator [[Greg Kurstin]], who studied [[jazz|jazz music]] under the tutelage of [[Jaki Byard]], to produce the entire album. Drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' and ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'', as well as the Christmas albums by [[Mariah Carey]], McEntire, and [[Phil Spector]], they experimented on various styles and sounds using Spector's famed [[Wall of Sound]] technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics. The Christmas music of ''Wrapped in Red'' comprises a variety of the genres such [[pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], and [[Memphis soul|soul]], marking a departure from the [[pop rock]] sound established from her previous studio albums; while its lyrics share an singular theme of the [[color red]], which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays.

''Wrapped in Red'' is Clarkson's most critically successful album to date, with music critics lauding its original songs as prospective Christmas standards. It became a commercial success in the United States and Canada, where it debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at number 3 and topped the [[Top Holiday Albums|''Billboard'' Top Holiday Albums]] chart with 70,000 copies sold in its first week of release, For nine consecutive weeks, ''Wrapped in Red'' stayed on the top ten of both charts was [[record certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and [[Music Canada]]. By the end of 2013, it became the year's [[Best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States#2010s|best-selling Christmas release]] in the United States and the second best selling Christmas release in Canada. Its lead single "[[Underneath the Tree]]" became an international top forty Christmas hit song and was radio's most-played new holiday song of 2013. In promoting ''Wrapped in Red'', Clarkson appeared in red dresses on various televised appearances; and filmed an accompanying television special, ''[[Kelly Clarkson's Cautionary Christmas Music Tale]]'', at [[The Venetian Las Vegas]], which premiered on [[NBC]] on December 11, 2013.

== Background ==
[[File:Greg-Kurstin-Amoeba-Music.jpg|180px|left|thumb|alt=A brown-haired man in a navy blue coat|The entirety of ''Wrapped in Red'' was produced by [[Greg Kurstin]], whom Clarkson had first collaborated on her fifth studio album ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]''.<ref name="Billboard 1" />]]
Clarkson had expressed interest in recording a Christmas album for years,<ref name="Billboard 1" /> having recorded various Christmas songs such as "[[Oh Holy Night]]" and "[[Grown Up Christmas List|My Grown Up Christmas List]]" on the ''[[American Idol compilation series|American Idol: The Great Holiday Classics]]'' (2003), "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]" on ''[[iTunes Session (Kelly Clarkson EP)|iTunes Session]]'' (2011), and being featured on [[Blake Shelton]]'s Christmas album ''[[Cheers, It's Christmas]]'' (2012).<ref name="Hollywood Reporter 1" /><ref name="LA Times 1" /><ref name="AllMusic 1" /><ref name="Taste of Country 1" /> Weary of constantly being being asked for her primary genre, she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> She remarked, "I always get asked what genre I'm in: 'Is this country or pop or rock? What are you?' And what's cool about making the Christmas album was, 'Oh, there are no limitations! We can do whatever we want!'".<ref name="Billboard 1" /> She further added, "The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or what kind of a year you've had<U+2014>it's a fresh start. I'm going to clear the air and take stock of the good that's happened."<ref name="Billboard 1" />

Discussions about making her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, a month after releasing her first greatest hits album, ''[[Greatest Hits <U+2013> Chapter One (Kelly Clarkson album)|Greatest Hits <U+2013> Chapter One]]''.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> Having found the opportunity to do so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist [[Greg Kurstin]], whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]'' and ''Chapter One'', to solely produce the whole album.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> Despite having been raised in a [[Jewish]] faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project.<ref name="Jewish Standard 1" /> As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being [[David Kahne]] solely producing ''[[My December]]'' in 2007).<ref name="Washington Post 1" /> It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from being a member of the musical groups [[The Bird and the Bee]] and [[Geggy Tah]] (the first three being [[Lily Allen]]'s ''[[It's Not Me, It's You]]'' in 2009, [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s ''[[We Are Born]]'' in 2010, and [[The Shins]]' ''[[Port of Morrow (album)|Port of Morrow]]'' in 2012).<ref name="Sound on Sound 1" /><ref name="Spin 1" /><ref name="Rolling Stone 1" />

== Recording ==
Recording sessions for ''Wrapped in Red'' took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at [[EastWest Studios]] in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville.<ref name="liner notes" /> In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> He recalled, "It was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." Further adding, "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off."<ref name="Billboard 1" /> Kurstin, who studied with [[jazz]] musician [[Jaki Byard]] at [[The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music]], recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as [[James Gadson]], [[Kevin Dukes]], [[Roy McCurdy]], and [[Bill Withers]] to perform on the record to resonate a [[Memphis soul]] sound.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="LA Times 2" /> He also collaborated with [[Joseph Trapanese]] to arrange and conduct a [[chamber orchestra]].<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="ASCAP 1" />

In providing instrumentation for the record, Kurstin used all of his instruments such as a [[Mellotron]] and a [[Chamberlin]], taping them from a distance to stimulate the [[Wall of Sound]], a recording technique originally developed by [[Phil Spector]] that was popular in the early 1960s.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Jewish Standard 1" /><ref name="HitFix 1" /> He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a chorus, was pleased with the aspect; saying, "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before<U+2014>doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir."<ref name="Billboard 1" /> Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Idolator 1" /> She commented, "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like [[Harry Potter]], made this happen. It's so weird."<ref name="Access Hollywood 2" />

Clarkson has cited the color [[red]] as the album's only theme.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> A color [[red#Happiness, celebration and ceremony|traditionally associated with Christmas]], she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> Wanting to stray away from her usual [[pop music|pop]] sound, she described ''Wrapped in Red''{{'}}s music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, [[country music|country]] and Memphis soul.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Associated Press 1" /> She recalled, "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, [[rock and roll]], you can do pop, you can do [[blues]], like you can do all that stuff and it works<U+2014>cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding."<ref name="99.5 PLJ 1" /> She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributes to her artistic goal, saying, "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like "[[I Fall to Pieces|Fall to Pieces]]" and "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did<U+2014>without having to have an umbrella for everything."<ref name="Billboard 1" />

In gathering inspirations for ''Wrapped in Red'', Clarkson started by listening to [[Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas|Bing Crosby]]'s and [[Irving Berlin's White Christmas|Rosemary Clooney]]'s soundtracks from the 1954 feature film ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' as well as [[Mariah Carey]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994) and ''[[Merry Christmas to You]]'' (1997) by [[Reba McEntire]].<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Taste of Country 4" /> While Kurstin, who used to play in a jazz band, took influences from ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas (album)|A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' by the [[Vince Guaraldi Trio]] and ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector|A Christmas Gift for You]]'' by [[Phil Spector]] as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Slate Magazine 1" /> Clarkson also cited that her relationship with her then-fianc<U+00E9> Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.<ref name="Access Hollywood 1" />

=== Song analysis ===
Clarkson shares writing credits on all five original songs on ''Wrapped in Red'', some of which were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Idolator 1" /> She co-wrote the opening and the titular track, "[[Wrapped in Red (song)|Wrapped in Red]]", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and [[Shane McAnally]]. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), in which someone confesses [[unrequited love]] towards another.<ref name="Youtube 1" /><ref name="The New York Times 1" /><ref name="Phillymag 1" /> Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most.<ref name="NPR 1" /> The second track, "[[Underneath the Tree]]", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together.<ref name="USA Today 1" /><ref name="Youtube 2" /> Clarkson remarked, "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record."<ref name="Youtube 2" /> [[RCA Records]] chief executive [[Peter Edge]] remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]" by Carey.<ref name="Billboard 2" /> The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.<ref name="On Air with Ryan Seacrest 1" />

Clarkson favored "[[Run Rudolph Run|Run Run Rudolph]]" as her favorite classic, saying "Just because it got to be a little more rock and roll."<ref name="On Air with Ryan Seacrest 1" /> She also remarked that "[[Please Come Home for Christmas|Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)]]", was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics.<ref name="On with Mario 1" /> Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album.<ref name="Access Hollywood 1" /> She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Blackstock, McEntire's stepson, saying "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'".<ref name="Access Hollywood 1" /> The seventh track is a cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Blue Christmas]]".<ref name="Access Hollywood 1" /> Its follow-up, a rendition of "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]", features [[Ronnie Dunn]].<ref name="Taste of Country 2" /> Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink."<ref name="Sony Music Nashville 1" /> "[[Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)]]" was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked, "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more<U+2026> It<U+2019>s just a happier time."<ref name="Access Hollywood 1" />

The tenth track, "White Christmas", was the first song to be recorded for ''Wrapped in Red''.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Idolator 1" /> A cover of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]" follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performance of the song to stray away from [[Julie Andrews]]'s version, citing "I think you shouldn't go near anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good."<ref name="Yahoo 6" /> Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote "[[4 Carats]]" with [[Cathy Dennis]] and [[Livvi Franc]]. Originally written a pop song, they converted it as a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between [[Eartha Kitt]]'s "[[Santa Baby]]" (1953) and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Material Girl]]" (1984).<ref name="Billboard 1" /> A rendition of [[Imogen Heap]]'s "[[Just for Now]]" was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying "Can we just stop for like five minutes and have like a normal Christmas setting?"<ref name="Billboard 1" /> The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune "[[Carol of the Bells]]".<ref name="liner notes" /> The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol "[[Silent Night]]", features McEntire and [[Trisha Yearwood]] and ends in an [[a capella]] setting between the trio.<ref name="Billboard 1" /><ref name="Sony Music Nashville 1" /> In addition, two tracks were also included in the deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of "I'll Be Home for Christmas" from ''iTunes Session''; and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn "[[O come, O come, Emmanuel|Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel]]".<ref name="Release - United States 2" /><ref name="Release - Germany" />

That's what this is intended to be-an album launched this year but timeless and genre-defying."<ref name="Billboard 1" /> In preparation for its release in the United States, RCA shipped a half-million units on [[Amazon.com]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]],<ref name="Billboard 1" /> which exclusively released a deluxe edition.<ref name="Release - United States 2" /> A red [[LP record|LP]] pressing of ''Wrapped in Red'' by [[United Record Pressing]] followed the CD release on November 25, 2013, marking the first time an album by Clarkson was released on a vinyl record.<ref name="Release - United States 3" /> A deluxe LP and CD edition was also released on the Sony Music store which included a scarf, a holiday ornament, and a snow globe, all of which were decorated in red as inspired from the album.<ref name="MyPlay" /> A international promotion campaign was also planned for Clarkson, but was later halted due her pregnancy.<ref name="Yahoo 1" />

''Wrapped in Red'' is Clarkson's most critically successful album. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 6 reviews, and scoring higher than any other album by Clarkson.<ref name="Metacritic" /> [[AllMusic]]'s senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] gave it a three-and-a-half stars. He described its uptempo arrangements, as well as Clarkson's vocal performance, as "bold and brassy" and its mid-tempo arrangements as "even more alluring".<ref name="AllMusic 1" /> He also noted the track selection "favors the bold," but that "she fares well in this setting, always sounding like the strongest element in the mix"<ref name="AllMusic 1" /> Towards the end of his review, he wrote that "Perhaps the concept and execution are conventional, but even in this utterly expected setting, Clarkson retains her fiery, individual spirit, and that's what makes ''Wrapped in Red'' appealing: to the letter, it delivers what it promises."<ref name="AllMusic 1" /> Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] also gave it a similar rating. He noted that the album "largely offers a respite from the pop-rock template she's been relentlessly pursuing since ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'', with less shouting and more of the varied range and texture on full display that helped coronate her the winner of the inaugural season of ''[[American Idol]]''. For better or worse, a decade of recording and touring has roughed up the edges of her voice, lending a lived-in quality that imbues lyrics about love and longing with an authenticity that might have otherwise been missing had she recorded these songs just a few years earlier."<ref name="Slant Magazine" />

[[NPR]]'s [[Ken Tucker]] described the album as a "glossy but heartfelt work" and approvingly compared its contrasting philosophy to [[Nick Lowe]]'s ''Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection for All the Family'', both of which he described as "will put you in a holiday mood".<ref name="NPR 1" /> Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave a favorable review, particularly lauding "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering the Christmas standards as "fairly straight". She added, "She starts gently on "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" before belting out the money notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" and hangs by the piano for a torchy <U+201C>White Christmas."<ref name="The Boston Globe 1" /> ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that "Clarkson handles it all expertly <U+2014> hitting remarkably high notes on "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and swinging jazzily on "Baby It's Cold Outside" with Dunn. The new songs make ''Wrapped in Red'' a real gift, as the title track and "Underneath the Tree" channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and "4 Carats" somehow blends "[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)|Stronger]]" and "Santa Baby".<ref name="Newsday 1" /> Reviewing for [[HitFix]], Melinda Newman gave the album an "A" rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Kurstin "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore<U+2014>most notably Spector's ''A Christmas Gift For You'' and [[Andy Williams]]' ''[[Merry Christmas (Andy Williams album)|Merry Christmas]]''<U+2014>to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets."<ref name="HitFix 1" /> Chris Klimek of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' declared ''Wrapped in Red'' as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting for its vintage sound.<ref name="Slate Magazine 1" /> He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably "Wrapped in Red" and "Underneath the Tree", have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now.<ref name="Slate Magazine 1" /> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Jon  Caramanica wrote that Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You." and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be."<ref name="The New York Times 1" />
