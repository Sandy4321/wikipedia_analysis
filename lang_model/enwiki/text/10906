'''Confirmation bias''', also called '''myside bias''', is the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.<ref group="Note">[[David Perkins (geneticist)|David Perkins]], a [[geneticist]], coined the term "myside bias" referring to a preference for "my" side of an issue. {{Harv |Baron|2000|p=195}}</ref><ref name="plous233">{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|p=233}}</ref> It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and a systematic error of [[inductive reasoning]]. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[cognitive bias|biased way]]. The effect is stronger for [[emotion]]ally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

A series of experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.

Confirmation biases contribute to [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor [[decision making|decisions]] due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.<ref name=cbiaspolitics>{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Raymond S.|title=Confirmation Bias: A Ubiquitous Phenomenon in Many Guises|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175<U+2013>220|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175}}</ref><ref>[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1984). ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam''. New York: Knopf.</ref><ref group="Note">Tuchman (1984) described a form of confirmation bias at work in the process of justifying policies to which a government has committed itself: "Once a policy has been adopted and implemented, all subsequent activity becomes an effort to justify it" (p. 245).

In the context of a discussion of the policy that drew the United States into war in Vietnam and kept the U.S. military engaged for 16 years despite countless evidences that it was a lost cause from the beginning, Tuchman argued:

<blockquote>Wooden headedness, the source of self deception is a factor that plays a remarkably large role in government. It consists in assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs. It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be deflected by the facts. It is epitomized in a historian's statement about Philip II of Spain, the surpassing wooden head of all sovereigns: "no experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in essential excellence". (p.7)
</blockquote>
Folly, she argued, is a form of self-deception characterized by "insistence on a rooted notion regardless of contrary evidence" (p.209)</ref>

== Types ==
Confirmation biases are effects in [[Information processing theory|information processing]]. They differ from what is sometimes called the ''behavioral confirmation effect'', commonly known as ''[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]'', in which a person's expectations influence the person's behavior, and the behavior helps cause the result that the person expected.<ref>{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}</ref>

Some psychologists restrict the term ''confirmation bias'' to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion. Other psychologists apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one's existing beliefs when searching for evidence, interpreting it, or recalling it from memory.<ref name="risen">{{Harvnb|Risen|Gilovich|2007}}</ref><ref group="Note">"Assimilation bias" is another term used for biased interpretation of evidence. {{Harv|Risen|Gilovich|2007|p=113}}</ref>

=== Biased search for information ===
[[File:Fred Barnard07.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A drawing of a man sitting on a stool at a writing desk|Confirmation bias has been described as an internal "[[Wikt:yes man|yes man]]", echoing back a person's beliefs like [[Charles Dickens]]' character [[Uriah Heep]].<ref name="WSJ">{{Citation |title=How to Ignore the Yes-Man in Your Head |first=Jason |last=Zweig |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |date= November 19, 2009 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184.html |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>]]
Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with their current hypothesis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=177<U+2013>178}}</ref><ref name="kunda112" /> Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence, they phrase questions to receive an affirmative answer that supports their hypothesis.<ref name="baron162" /> They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true, rather than what would happen if it were false.<ref name="baron162">{{Harvnb|Baron|2000 |pp=162<U+2013>164}}</ref> For example, someone using yes/no questions to find a number he or she suspects to be the number 3 might ask, "Is it an [[odd number]]?" People prefer this type of question, called a "positive test", even when a negative test such as "Is it an even number?" would yield exactly the same information.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|pp=162<U+2013>165}}</ref> However, this does not mean that people seek tests that guarantee a positive answer. In studies where subjects could select either such pseudo-tests or genuinely diagnostic ones, they favored the genuinely diagnostic.<ref>{{Citation |last=Devine |first=Patricia G. |first2=Edward R. |last2=Hirt |first3=Elizabeth M. |last3=Gehrke |year=1990 |title=Diagnostic and confirmation strategies in trait hypothesis testing |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=952<U+2013>963 |issn=1939-1315 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.952}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Yaacov |first2=Miriam |last2=Bassok |year=1982 |title=Confirmatory and diagnosing strategies in social information gathering |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=22<U+2013>34 |issn=1939-1315 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.22}}</ref>

The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias, since positive tests can be highly informative.<ref name="klaymanha" /> However, in combination with other effects, this strategy can confirm existing beliefs or assumptions, independently of whether they are true.<ref name="oswald82">{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=82<U+2013>83}}</ref> In real-world situations, evidence is often complex and mixed. For example, various contradictory ideas about someone could each be supported by concentrating on one aspect of his or her behavior.<ref name="kunda112" /> Thus any search for evidence in favor of a hypothesis is likely to succeed.<ref name=oswald82 /> One illustration of this is the way the phrasing of a question can significantly change the answer.<ref name="kunda112">{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=112<U+2013>115}}</ref> For example, people who are asked, "Are you happy with your social life?" report greater satisfaction than those asked, "Are you ''un''happy with your social life?"<ref>{{Citation |last=Kunda |first=Ziva |first2=G.T. |last2 =Fong |first3=R. |last3=Sanitoso |first4=E. |last4=Reber |year=1993 |title=Directional questions direct self-conceptions |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Society of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=29 |pages=62<U+2013>63 |issn=0022-1031}} via {{Harvnb|Fine|2006|pp=63<U+2013>65}}</ref>

Even a small change in a question's wording can affect how people search through available information, and hence the conclusions they reach. This was shown using a fictional child custody case.<ref name="shafir" /> Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways. Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities: a close relationship with the child but a job that would take him or her away for long periods of time. When asked, "Which parent should have custody of the child?" the majority of participants chose Parent B, looking mainly for positive attributes. However, when asked, "Which parent should be denied custody of the child?" they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that Parent B should be denied custody, implying that Parent A should have custody.<ref name="shafir">{{Citation |last=Shafir |first=E. |year=1993 |title=Choosing versus rejecting: why some options are both better and worse than others |journal=Memory and Cognition |volume=21 |pages=546<U+2013>556 |pmid= 8350746 |issue=4 |doi=10.3758/bf03197186}} via {{Harvnb|Fine|2006|pp=63<U+2013>65}}</ref>

Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests. In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the [[extroversion and introversion|introversion<U+2013>extroversion]] personality dimension on the basis of an interview. They chose the interview questions from a given list. When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert, the participants chose questions that presumed introversion, such as, "What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties?" When the interviewee was described as extroverted, almost all the questions presumed extroversion, such as, "What would you do to liven up a dull party?" These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them.<ref>{{Citation |last=Snyder |first=Mark |first2=William B. |last2=Swann, Jr. |year=1978 |title=Hypothesis-Testing Processes in Social Interaction |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1202<U+2013>1212 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.11.1202}} via {{Harvnb|Poletiek|2001|p=131}}</ref> A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from, such as, "Do you shy away from social interactions?"<ref name="kunda117" /> Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions, showing only a weak bias towards positive tests.

People generate and evaluate evidence in arguments that are biased towards their own beliefs and opinions.<ref name=stanovich /> Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals' personal beliefs.

Another experiment gave participants a complex rule-discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer.<ref name="mynatt1978">{{Citation |last=Mynatt |first=Clifford R. |first2=Michael E. |last2=Doherty |first3=Ryan D. |last3=Tweney |year=1978 |title=Consequences of confirmation and disconfirmation in a simulated research environment |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=395<U+2013>406 |doi =10.1080/00335557843000007}}</ref> Objects on the computer screen followed specific laws, which the participants had to figure out. So, participants could "fire" objects across the screen to test their hypotheses. Despite making many attempts over a ten-hour session, none of the participants figured out the rules of the system. They typically attempted to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses, and were reluctant to consider alternatives. Even after seeing objective evidence that refuted their working hypotheses, they frequently continued doing the same tests. Some of the participants were taught proper hypothesis-testing, but these instructions had almost no effect.<ref name="mynatt1978" />

=== Biased interpretation ===
{{Quote box |quote="Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons." |source=<U+2014>[[Michael Shermer]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|p=157}}</ref> |width=30% |align=right}}
Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence. Even if two individuals have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased.

A team at [[Stanford University]] conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment, with half in favor and half against it.<ref name="lord1979" /><ref name=baron201 /> Each participant read descriptions of two studies: a comparison of [[U.S. state]]s with and without the death penalty, and a comparison of murder rates in a state before and after the introduction of the death penalty. After reading a quick description of each study, the participants were asked whether their opinions had changed. Then, they read a more detailed account of each study's procedure and had to rate whether the research was well-conducted and convincing.<ref name="lord1979" /> In fact, the studies were fictional. Half the participants were told that one kind of study supported the [[deterrent]] effect and the other undermined it, while for other participants the conclusions were swapped.<ref name="lord1979" /><ref name="baron201">{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=201<U+2013>202}}</ref>

The participants, whether supporters or opponents, reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read. Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies, they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided, pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary. Participants described studies supporting their pre-existing view as superior to those that contradicted it, in detailed and specific ways.<ref name="lord1979" /><ref name ="vyse122">{{Harvnb|Vyse|1997|p=122}}</ref> Writing about a study that seemed to undermine the deterrence effect, a death penalty proponent wrote, "The research didn't cover a long enough period of time", while an opponent's comment on the same study said, "No strong evidence to contradict the researchers has been presented".<ref name="lord1979" /> The results illustrated that people set higher standards of evidence for hypotheses that go against their current expectations. This effect, known as "disconfirmation bias", has been supported by other experiments.<ref name="taber_political" />

Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 US presidential election]] and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates. They were shown apparently contradictory pairs of statements, either from Republican candidate [[George W. Bush]], Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] or a politically neutral public figure. They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable. From these three pieces of information, they had to decide whether or not each individual's statements were inconsistent.<ref name="westen2006">{{Citation |last= Westen |first=Drew |first2=Pavel S. |last2=Blagov |first3=Keith |last3=Harenski |first4=Clint |last4=Kilts |first5=Stephan |last5=Hamann |year=2006 |title=Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1947<U+2013>1958 |url=http://psychsystems.net/lab/06_Westen_fmri.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-14 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 |pmid=17069484}}</ref>{{rp|1948}} There were strong differences in these evaluations, with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory.<ref name="westen2006" />{{rp|1951}}

In this experiment, the participants made their judgments while in a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scanner which monitored their brain activity. As participants evaluated contradictory statements by their favored candidate, [[emotion]]al centers of their brains were aroused. This did not happen with the statements by the other figures. The experimenters inferred that the different responses to the statements were not due to passive reasoning errors. Instead, the participants were actively reducing the [[cognitive dissonance]] induced by reading about their favored candidate's irrational or hypocritical behavior.<ref name="westen2006" />{{page needed|date=February 2014}}

Biases in belief interpretation are persistent, regardless of intelligence level. Participants in an experiment took the [[SAT]] test (a college admissions test used in the United States) to assess their intelligence levels. They then read information regarding safety concerns for vehicles, and the experimenters manipulated the national origin of the car. American participants provided their opinion if the car should be banned on a six-point scale, where one indicated "definitely yes" and six indicated "definitely no." Participants firstly evaluated if they would allow a dangerous German car on American streets and a dangerous American car on German streets. Participants believed that the dangerous German car on American streets should be banned more quickly than the dangerous American car on German streets. There was no difference among intelligence levels at the rate participants would ban a car.<ref name=stanovich>{{cite journal|last=Stanovich|first=K. E.|author2=West, R. F. |author3=Toplak, M.

Biased interpretation is not restricted to emotionally significant topics. In another experiment, participants were told a story about a theft. They had to rate the evidential importance of statements arguing either for or against a particular character being responsible. When they hypothesized that character's guilt, they rated statements supporting that hypothesis as more important than conflicting statements.<ref>{{Citation |last=Gadenne |first=V. |first2=M. |last2=Oswald |year=1986 |title=Entstehung und Ver<U+00E4>nderung von Best<U+00E4>tigungstendenzen beim Testen von Hypothesen [Formation and alteration of confirmatory tendencies during the testing of hypotheses] |journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie |volume=33 |pages=360<U+2013>374}} via {{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|p=89}}</ref>

Even if people gather and interpret evidence in a neutral manner, they may still remember it selectively to reinforce their expectations.

=== Polarization of opinion ===
{{Main|Attitude polarization}}
When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way, their views can move even further apart. This is called "attitude polarization".<ref name="kuhn_lao" /> The effect was demonstrated by an experiment that involved drawing a series of red and black balls from one of two concealed "bingo baskets". Participants knew that one basket contained 60% black and 40% red balls; the other, 40% black and 60% red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw<U+2014>whether they initially thought the basket with 60% black balls or the one with 60% red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=201}}</ref>

A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence. Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift [[correlation|correlated]] strongly with their initial attitudes.<ref name="lord1979">{{Citation |last=Lord |first=Charles G. |first2=Lee |last2 =Ross |first3=Mark R. |last3=Lepper |year=1979 |title=Biased assimilation and attitude polarization: The effects of prior theories on subsequently considered evidence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=2098<U+2013>2109 |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2098}}</ref> In later experiments, participants also reported their opinions becoming more extreme in response to ambiguous information.

Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response. The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of [[gun politics|gun control]] and [[affirmative action]].<ref name="taber_political" /> They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example they could read the [[National Rifle Association]]'s and the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition]]'s arguments on gun control. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not. This biased search for information correlated well with the polarization effect.<ref name="taber_political" />

The "backfire effect" is a name for the finding that, given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backfireeffect.html|title=backfire effect|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref><ref name='CJR backfire'>{{cite web | url = http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_backfire_effect.php?page=all | title = The Backfire Effect | accessdate = 2012-05-01 | last = Silverman | first = Craig | date = 2011-06-17 | work = Columbia Journalism Review | quote = When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.}}</ref> The phrase was first coined by [[Brendan Nyhan]] and Jason Reifler.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Reifler|first2=Jason|year=2010|title=When Corrections Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions|journal=Political Behavior|volume=32|issue=2|pages=303<U+2013>330|doi=10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref>

=== Persistence of discredited beliefs ===
{{Quote box |quote="[B]eliefs can survive potent logical or empirical challenges.

Confirmation biases can be used to explain why some beliefs persist when the initial evidence for them is removed.<ref name="nick187" /> This belief perseverance effect has been shown by a series of experiments using what is called the "debriefing paradigm": participants read fake evidence for a hypothesis, their [[attitude change]] is measured, then the fakery is exposed in detail. Their attitudes are then measured once more to see if their belief returns to its previous level.<ref name="shortcomings">{{Citation |last=Ross |first=Lee |first2=Craig A. |last2=Anderson |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos |editor3-last=Tversky |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |pages= 129<U+2013>152 |chapter=Shortcomings in the attribution process: On the origins and maintenance of erroneous social assessments |isbn=978-0-521-28414-1 |oclc=7578020}}</ref>

A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debrief.<ref name="kunda99">{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=99}}</ref> In one experiment, participants had to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes. The feedback was random: some were told they had done well while others were told they had performed badly. Even after being fully debriefed, participants were still influenced by the feedback.

In another study, participants read job performance ratings of two firefighters, along with their responses to a [[risk aversion]] test.<ref name="shortcomings" /> This fictional data was arranged to show either a negative or positive [[correlation|association]]: some participants were told that a risk-taking firefighter did better, while others were told they did less well than a risk-averse colleague.<ref name="socialperseverance" /> Even if these two case studies were true, they would have been scientifically poor evidence for a conclusion about firefighters in general. However, the participants found them subjectively persuasive.<ref name="socialperseverance">{{Citation |title=Perseverance of Social Theories: The Role of Explanation in the Persistence of Discredited Information |first=Craig A. |last=Anderson |first2=Mark R. |last2=Lepper |first3=Lee |last3=Ross |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1980 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1037<U+2013>1049 |publisher= American Psychological Association |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/h0077720}}</ref> When the case studies were shown to be fictional, participants' belief in a link diminished, but around half of the original effect remained.<ref name="shortcomings" /> Follow-up interviews established that the participants had understood the debriefing and taken it seriously. Participants seemed to trust the debriefing, but regarded the discredited information as irrelevant to their personal belief.<ref name="socialperseverance" />

=== Preference for early information ===
Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series, even when the order is unimportant. For example, people form a more positive impression of someone described as "intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious" than when they are given the same words in reverse order.<ref name="baron197">{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=197<U+2013>200}}</ref> This ''irrational primacy effect'' is independent of the [[serial position effect|primacy effect in memory]] in which the earlier items in a series leave a stronger memory trace.<ref name="baron197" /> Biased interpretation offers an explanation for this effect: seeing the initial evidence, people form a working hypothesis that affects how they interpret the rest of the information.<ref name="nick187">{{Harvnb |Nickerson|1998|p=187}}</ref>

One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns. Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them.<ref name="baron197" /> In fact, the colors appeared in a pre-arranged order. The first thirty draws favored one urn and the next thirty favored the other.<ref name=nick187 /> The series as a whole was neutral, so rationally, the two urns were equally likely. However, after sixty draws, participants favored the urn suggested by the initial thirty.<ref name="baron197" />

Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide.<ref name="baron197" /> After each slide, participants had to state their best guess of what the object was. Participants whose early guesses were wrong persisted with those guesses, even when the picture was sufficiently in focus that the object was readily recognizable to other people.<ref name="nick187" />

=== Illusory association between events ===
{{Main|Illusory correlation}}
[[Illusory correlation]] is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data.<ref name=fine>{{Harvnb |Fine|2006|pp=66<U+2013>70}}</ref> This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s.<ref name="plous164">{{Harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=164<U+2013>166}}</ref> In one experiment, participants read a set of psychiatric case studies, including responses to the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set were more likely to report seeing buttocks, anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the inkblots. In fact the case studies were fictional and, in one version of the experiment, had been constructed so that the homosexual men were less likely to report this imagery.<ref name=fine /> In a survey, a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality.<ref name=fine /><ref name=plous164 />

Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period. Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions, although the real correlation was zero.<ref>{{Citation |last=Redelmeir |first=D. A. |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |year=1996 |title=On the belief that arthritis pain is related to the weather |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=93 |pages=2895<U+2013>2896 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.7.2895 |issue=7}} via {{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=127}}</ref>

This effect is a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs. It is also related to biases in hypothesis-testing behavior.<ref name="kunda127">{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=127<U+2013>130}}</ref> In judging whether two events, such as illness and bad weather, are correlated, people rely heavily on the number of ''positive-positive'' cases: in this example, instances of both pain and bad weather. They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain and/or good weather).<ref name="plous162">{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|pp=162<U+2013>164}}</ref> This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing.<ref name="kunda127" /> It may also reflect selective recall, in that people may have a sense that two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together.<ref name="kunda127" />

== Individual differences ==

Myside bias was once believed to be associated with greater intelligence; however, studies have shown that myside bias can be more influenced by ability to rationally think as opposed to amount of intelligence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanovich|first=K.

A study has found individual differences in myside bias. This study investigates individual differences that are acquired through learning in a cultural context and are mutable. The researcher found important individual difference in argumentation. Studies have suggested that individual differences such as deductive reasoning ability, ability to overcome belief bias, epistemological understanding, and thinking disposition are a significant predictors of the reasoning and generating arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals.<ref name="Mason 2006">{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lucia|author2=Scirica, Fabio|title=Prediction of students' argumentation skills about controversial topics by epistemological understanding|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=October 2006|volume=16|issue=5|pages=492<U+2013>509|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.09.007}}</ref><ref name="Weinstock 2009">{{cite journal|last=Weinstock|first=Michael|title=Relative expertise in an everyday reasoning task: Epistemic understanding, problem representation, and reasoning competence|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=4|pages=423<U+2013>434|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2009.03.003}}</ref><ref name="Weinstock 2004">{{cite journal|last=Weinstock|first=Michael|author2=Neuman, Yair |author3=Tabak, Iris |title=Missing the point or missing the norms?

A study by Christopher Wolfe and Anne Britt also investigated how participants' views of "what makes a good argument?" can be a source of myside bias that influence the way a person creates their own arguments.<ref name="Wolfe 2008" /> The study investigated individual differences of argumentation schema and asked participants to write essays. The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their side of the argument they preferred and given balanced or unrestricted research instructions. The balanced research instructions instructed participants to create a balanced argument that included both pros and cons and the unrestricted research instruction did not give any particular instructions on how to create the argument.<ref name="Wolfe 2008" />

Overall, the results revealed that balance research instruction significantly increased the use of participants adding opposing information to their argument. These data also reveal that personal belief is not a source of myside bias. Furthermore, participants who believed that good arguments were based on facts were more likely to exhibit myside bias than participants who did not agree with this statement. This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron's article that people's opinions about good thinking can influence how arguments are generated.<ref name="Wolfe 2008" />

[[File:Pourbus Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Engraved head-and-shoulders portrait of Francis Bacon wearing a hat and ruff. |[[Francis Bacon]]]]

=== Informal observation ===
Before psychological research on confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed anecdotally by writers, including the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460&nbsp;BC&nbsp;<U+2013> c. 395&nbsp;BC), Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265<U+2013>1321), English philosopher and scientist [[Francis Bacon]] (1561<U+2013>1626),<ref name="baron195">{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=195<U+2013>196}}</ref> and Russian author [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828<U+2013>1910). Thucydides, in ''[[The Peloponnesian War]]'' wrote: "...&nbsp;for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy."<ref>{{Thucydides|en|4|108|4|shortref}}</ref> In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] cautions Dante when they meet in Paradise, "opinion<U+2014>hasty<U+2014>often can incline to the wrong side, and then affection for one's own opinion binds, confines the mind."<ref>Alighieri, Dante. ''Paradiso'' canto XIII: 118<U+2013>120. Trans. Allen Mandelbaum</ref> Bacon, in the ''[[Novum Organum]]'', wrote,
{{quote|The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion&nbsp;...<!--"(either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself)" omitted for space--> draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects or despises, or else by some distinction sets aside or rejects[.]<ref name ="bacon" />}}Bacon said that biased assessment of evidence drove "all superstitions, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments or the like".<ref name="bacon">Bacon, Francis (1620).

In his essay "[[What Is Art?]]", Tolstoy wrote, {{quote|I know that most men<U+2014>not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems<U+2014>can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty<U+2014>conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.<ref>Tolstoy, Leo.

In ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'' (1893), he similarly declared, "The most difficult participants can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him" (ch. 3).

=== Wason's research on hypothesis-testing ===
The term "confirmation bias" was coined by English psychologist [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Gale |first=Maggie |first2=Linden J. |last2=Ball |year=2002 |chapter=Does Positivity Bias Explain Patterns of Performance on Wason's 2-4-6 task? |editor1-first=Wayne D. |editor1-last=Gray |editor2-first=Christian D. |editor2-last=Schunn |title=Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8058-4581-5 |oclc=469971634 |page=340}}</ref> For an experiment published in 1960, he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. At the outset, they were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule. Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.<ref name="wason1960" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=179}}</ref>

While the actual rule was simply "any ascending sequence", the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as "the middle number is the average of the first and last".<ref name="wason1960">{{Citation |last=Wason |first=Peter C. |year=1960 |title=On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=12 |issue=3 |publisher=Psychology Press |issn=1747-0226 |pages=129<U+2013>140 |doi=10.1080/17470216008416717}}</ref> The participants seemed to test only positive examples<U+2014>triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, "Each number is two greater than its predecessor", they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,19).<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewicka|1998|page=238}}</ref>

Wason accepted [[falsificationism]], according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it. He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence the term "confirmation bias".<ref group="Note">Wason also used the term "verification bias". {{Harv|Poletiek|2001|p=73}}</ref><ref name="oswald">{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=79<U+2013>96}}</ref> Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his [[Wason selection task|selection task]] experiment.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wason |first=Peter C. |year=1968 |title=Reasoning about a rule |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |publisher=Psychology Press |issn= 1747-0226 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273<U+2013>28 |doi=10.1080/14640746808400161}}</ref> In this task, participants are given partial information about a set of objects, and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a [[material conditional|conditional rule]] ("If A, then B") applies. It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule.<ref name="sutherland" /><ref>{{Citation |last=Barkow |first=Jerome H. |first2=Leda |last2=Cosmides |first3=John |last3=Tooby |title=The adapted mind: evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1995 |pages=181<U+2013>184 |isbn=978-0-19-510107-2 |oclc=33832963}}</ref>

=== Klayman and Ha's critique ===
A 1987 paper by Joshua Klayman and Young-Won Ha argued that the Wason experiments had not actually demonstrated a bias towards confirmation. Instead, Klayman and Ha interpreted the results in terms of a tendency to make tests that are consistent with the working hypothesis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=81<U+2013>82, 86<U+2013>87}}</ref> They called this the "positive test strategy".<ref name=kunda112 /> This strategy is an example of a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]]: a reasoning shortcut that is imperfect but easy to compute.<ref name="plous233">{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|p=233}}</ref> Klayman and Ha used [[Bayesian probability]] and [[information theory]] as their standard of hypothesis-testing, rather than the falsificationism used by Wason. According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person's prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative. Klayman and Ha argued that when people think about realistic problems, they are looking for a specific answer with a small initial probability. In this case, positive tests are usually more informative than negative tests.<ref name="klaymanha">{{Citation |last=Klayman |first= Joshua |first2=Young-Won |last2=Ha |year=1987 |title=Confirmation, Disconfirmation and Information in Hypothesis Testing |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=211<U+2013>228 |issn=0033-295X |url=http://www.stats.org.uk/statistical-inference/KlaymanHa1987.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-14 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.2.211}}</ref> However, in Wason's rule discovery task the answer<U+2014>three numbers in ascending order<U+2014>is very broad, so positive tests are unlikely to yield informative answers. Klayman and Ha supported their analysis by citing an experiment that used the labels "DAX" and "MED" in place of "fits the rule" and "doesn't fit the rule". This avoided implying that the aim was to find a low-probability rule. Participants had much more success with this version of the experiment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewicka|1998|page=239}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Tweney |first=Ryan D. |first2=Michael E. |last2=Doherty |first3=Winifred J. |last3=Worner |first4=Daniel B. |last4=Pliske |first5=Clifford R. |last5=Mynatt |first6=Kimberly A. |last6=Gross |first7=Daniel L. |last7= Arkkelin |year=1980 |title=Strategies of rule discovery in an inference task |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |publisher=Psychology Press |issn=1747-0226 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 109<U+2013>123 |doi=10.1080/00335558008248237}} (Experiment&nbsp;IV)</ref>

</center>
In light of this and other critiques, the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification to examine whether people test hypotheses in an informative way, or an uninformative but positive way. The search for "true" confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=86<U+2013>89}}</ref>

Confirmation bias is often described as a result of automatic, unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception.<ref name="oswald82">{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004}}</ref><ref name="Hergovich 2010">{{Harvnb|Hergovich|Schott|Burger|2010}}</ref> According to Robert Maccoun, most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of both "cold" (cognitive) and "hot" (motivated) mechanisms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maccoun|1998}}</ref>

Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people's ability to handle complex tasks, and the shortcuts, called ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]'', that they use.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedrich|1993|p=298}}</ref> For example, people may judge the reliability of evidence by using the ''[[availability heuristic]]''<U+2014>i.e., how readily a particular idea comes to mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|p=94}}</ref> It is also possible that people can only focus on one thought at a time, so find it difficult to test alternative hypotheses in parallel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=198<U+2013>199}}</ref> Another heuristic is the positive test strategy identified by Klayman and Ha, in which people test a hypothesis by examining cases where they expect a property or event to occur. This heuristic avoids the difficult or impossible task of working out how diagnostic each possible question will be. However, it is not universally reliable, so people can overlook challenges to their existing beliefs.<ref name="klaymanha" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=200}}</ref>

Motivational explanations involve an effect of [[desire (emotion)|desire]] on [[belief]], sometimes called "[[wishful thinking]]".<ref name=nick197 /><ref>{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|p=206}}</ref> It is known that people prefer pleasant thoughts over unpleasant ones in a number of ways: this is called the "[[Pollyanna principle]]".<ref>{{Citation |last=Matlin |first=Margaret W. |title=Cognitive Illusions: A Handbook on Fallacies and Biases in Thinking, Judgement and Memory |editor-first=R<U+00FC>diger F. |editor-last=Pohl |publisher=Psychology Press |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages=255<U+2013>272 |chapter=Pollyanna Principle |isbn= 978-1-84169-351-4 |oclc=55124398}}</ref> Applied to [[argument]]s or sources of [[evidence]], this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true.<ref name="nick197">{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=197}}</ref> According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion, people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas. In other words, they ask, "Can I believe this?" for some suggestions and, "Must I believe this?" for others.<ref>{{Citation |last=Dawson |first=Erica |first2=Thomas |last2=Gilovich |first3=Dennis T. |last3=Regan |date= October 2002 |title=Motivated Reasoning and Performance on the Wason Selection Task |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |volume=28 |issue =10 |pages=1379<U+2013>1387 |url=http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Dawson.Gilo.Regan.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-30 |doi=10.1177/014616702236869}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Ditto |first=Peter H. |first2= David F. |last2=Lopez |year=1992 |title=Motivated skepticism: use of differential decision criteria for preferred and nonpreferred conclusions |journal=Journal of personality and social psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=568<U+2013>584 |issn=0022-3514 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.568}}</ref> Although [[consistency]] is a desirable feature of attitudes, an excessive drive for consistency is another potential source of bias because it may prevent people from neutrally evaluating new, surprising information.<ref name=nick197 /> Social psychologist [[Ziva Kunda]] combines the cognitive and motivational theories, arguing that motivation creates the bias, but cognitive factors determine the size of the effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=198}}</ref>

Explanations in terms of [[cost-benefit analysis]] assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way, but assess the costs of different errors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oswald|Grosjean|2004|pp=91<U+2013>93}}</ref> Using ideas from [[evolutionary psychology]], James Friedrich suggests that people do not primarily aim at [[truth]] in testing hypotheses, but try to avoid the most costly errors. For example, employers might ask one-sided questions in job interviews because they are focused on weeding out unsuitable candidates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedrich|1993|pp=299, 316<U+2013>317}}</ref> Yaacov Trope and Akiva Liberman's refinement of this theory assumes that people compare the two different kinds of error: accepting a false hypothesis or rejecting a true hypothesis. For instance, someone who underestimates a friend's honesty might treat him or her suspiciously and so undermine the friendship. Overestimating the friend's honesty may also be costly, but less so. In this case, it would be rational to seek, evaluate or remember evidence of their honesty in a biased way.<ref>{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Y. |first2=A. |last2=Liberman |title=Social Psychology: Handbook of basic principles |editor1-first=E.

The connection between confirmation bias and social skills was corroborated by a study of how college students get to know other people. Highly [[self-monitoring]] students, who are more sensitive to their environment and to [[social norms]], asked more matching questions when interviewing a high-status staff member than when getting to know fellow students.<ref name="dardenne">{{Citation |last=Dardenne |first=Benoit |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Leyens |title=Confirmation Bias as a Social Skill |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1995 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1229<U+2013>1239 |doi=10.1177/01461672952111011 |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |issn=1552-7433}}</ref>

Psychologists [[Jennifer Lerner]] and [[Philip Tetlock]] distinguish two different kinds of thinking process. ''[[Exploratory thought]]'' neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position, while ''confirmatory thought'' seeks to justify a specific point of view. Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know, they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people, and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.<ref>{{cite book|editor= Sandra L.

=== In politics and law ===
[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A woman and a man reading a document in a courtroom|[[Mock trial]]s allow researchers to examine confirmation biases in a realistic setting.]]
Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=191<U+2013>193}}</ref> Since the evidence in a jury trial can be complex, and jurors often reach decisions about the verdict early on, it is reasonable to expect an attitude polarization effect.

Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position.<ref name="baron191">{{Harvnb|Baron|2000|pp=191,195}}</ref> On the other hand, confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict.

Kimmel]] showed confirmation bias when playing down the first signs of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name="sutherland" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Kida|2006|p=155}}</ref>

A two-decade study of political pundits by [[Philip E. Tetlock]] found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance. Tetlock divided experts into "foxes" who maintained multiple hypotheses, and "hedgehogs" who were more dogmatic. In general, the hedgehogs were much less accurate. Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias<U+2014>specifically, their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tetlock |first=Philip E. |title=Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It?

=== In the paranormal ===
One factor in the appeal of alleged [[psychic]] readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic's statements to their own lives.<ref name="toolkit">{{Citation |last=Smith |first= Jonathan C. |title=Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2009 |pages=149<U+2013>151 |isbn=978-1-4051-8122-8 |oclc=319499491}}</ref> By making a large number of ambiguous statements in each sitting, the psychic gives the client more opportunities to find a match. This is one of the techniques of [[cold reading]], with which a psychic can deliver a subjectively impressive reading without any prior information about the client.<ref name="toolkit" /> Investigator [[James Randi]] compared the transcript of a reading to the client's report of what the psychic had said, and found that the client showed a strong selective recall of the "hits".<ref>{{Citation |last=Randi |first=James |title=James Randi: psychic investigator |publisher=Boxtree |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-85283-144-8 |oclc= 26359284 |pages=58<U+2013>62}}</ref>

As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world, Nickerson mentions numerological [[pyramidology]]: the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids.<ref name= nick190 /> There are many different length measurements that can be made of, for example, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] and many ways to combine or manipulate them. Hence it is almost inevitable that people who look at these numbers selectively will find superficially impressive correspondences, for example with the dimensions of the Earth.<ref name="nick190">{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|p=190}}</ref>

=== In science ===
A distinguishing feature of [[science|scientific thinking]] is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence.<ref name=nick194 /> However, many times in the [[history of science]], scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or ignoring unfavorable data.<ref name="nick194">{{Harvnb|Nickerson|1998|pp=192<U+2013>194}}</ref> Previous research has shown that the assessment of the quality of scientific studies seems to be particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias.

=== In self-image ===
Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves.
