'''Kirill "Kirka" Babitzin''' ([[September 22]], [[1950]] &ndash; [[January 31]] [[2007]]) was one of [[Finland]]'s most famous popular [[musician]]s. 

==Biography==
Kirill Babitzin was born in [[Helsinki]] in 1950 to a [[Russian people|Russian]] emigrant family. He first got into music at the age of five when his grandmother gave him an [[accordion]]. He won an accordion competition at the age of ten, but soon ditched the squeezebox for [[rock and roll]] music. His first band was ''The Creatures'', which he joined in 1964 assuming [[stage name]] Kirka.

Kirka got his big break in 1967 when he joined the band ''The Islanders'', originally led by would-be pop stalwart [[Ilkka Lipsanen|Ilkka "Danny" Lipsanen]], and went on to become a household name in dance halls and festivals all over Finland. Kirka also recorded with [[Blues Section]]. His trademark was to be his powerful, throaty voice; simultaneously shrill and soulful, it is instantly recognizable to generations of Finnish music lovers.

Several Babitzin siblings are established musicians in their own right. In 1978, Kirka released a duet album with sister [[Anna Babitzin|Anna]]; the next year, another sister Marija ("[[Muska]]") joined in. Kirka's brother was popular rock musician [[Sammy Babitzin]], who was killed in a car crash in 1973. Eerily, Sammy's signature hit ''Daada daada'' tells a story of high-speed automotive cruising.

Kirka represented Finland in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], finishing a strong ninth with the song ''Hengaillaan''. Four years later, he got his greatest chart success with ''Surun pyyhit silmist<U+00E4>in'', a melancholic [[schlager|pop-schlager]]. True to his rock'n'roll roots, however, he never fully appreciated this success, repeatedly citing 60's breakthrough ''Hetki ly<U+00F6>'' (orig. ''Beat The Clock'' by [[Richard Gottehrer|Gottehrer]]-Stroll) with The Islanders as his greatest achievement.

Babitzin was awarded the [[Emma-gaala|Emma award]] for best male singer twice, first in 1984 and then in 2000. He died suddenly on [[January 31]] [[2007]] at his home of undisclosed acute illness. His widow Paula Nummela is a renowned jewellery designer.

==Discography==
Kirka Babitzin released 78 singles and almost 60 albums, including 15 collections. Kirka's album ''Surun pyyhit silmist<U+00E4>ni'' (1988) became the biggest selling album in Finnish history; it has now been relegated to all-time third place.
