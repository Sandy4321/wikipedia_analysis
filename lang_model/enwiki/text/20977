'''''Xerochrysum bracteatum''''', commonly known as the '''golden everlasting''', is a [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Asteraceae]] native to Australia. Described by [[<U+00C9>tienne Pierre Ventenat]] in 1803, it was known as ''Helichrysum bracteatum'' for many years before being transferred to a new genus ''[[Xerochrysum]]'' in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous [[Perennial plant|perennial]] or [[Annual plant|annual]] shrub up to a metre (3&nbsp;ft) tall with green or grey leafy [[foliage]]. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery [[bract]]s that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of [[habitat]]s across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and [[Subalpine zone|subalpine]] areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of [[lepidoptera]]ns (butterflies and moths), and adult butterflies, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], native bees, small beetles and grasshoppers visit the flower heads.

The golden everlasting has proven very adaptable to [[plant cultivation|cultivation]]. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual [[cultivar]]s in a host of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial [[shrubs]], which have become popular [[garden]] plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the [[cut flower industry]].

==Description==
[[File:Xerochrysum strawburst.jpg|thumb|left|"Strawburst Yellow", bred in [[California]], showing yellow bracts and orange central disc]]
The plant is an erect perennial, or occasionally annual, herb that is simple or rarely branched at its base.  It generally reaches 20 to 80&nbsp;cm (8<U+2013>32&nbsp;in) in height, but can have a [[Prostrate shrub|prostrate]] habit in exposed areas such as coastal cliffs. The green stems are rough and covered with fine hairs, and are robust compared with those of other members of the genus. The leaves are [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]], [[wikt:elliptical|elliptic]] or [[wikt:oblanceolate|oblanceolate]] in [[leaf shape|shape]] and measure anywhere from 1.5 to 10&nbsp;cm (0.6<U+2013>4&nbsp;in) long and from 0.5 to 2&nbsp;cm (0.2<U+2013>0.8&nbsp;in) wide. They are also covered with cobwebby hairs. Sitting atop tall stems above the foliage, the flower heads range from 3 to 7&nbsp;cm (1.2<U+2013>2.8&nbsp;in) in diameter. Occasionally multiple heads arise from the one stem.<ref name=EDoA57/><!-- cites previous two sentences--> Like the flowers of all [[Asteraceae]], they are composed of a central disc which contains a number of tiny individual flowers, known as [[floret]]s; these sit directly on an enlarged part of the stem known as the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].

Around the disc is an [[Involucral bract|involucre]] of modified leaves, the [[bract]]s, which in ''Xerochrysum'', as in most Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering.<ref name=EDoA1>Australian Daisy Study Group, p. 1.</ref><!-- cites previous three sentences --> They create the impression of a shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in [[cultivar]]s).<ref name="PlantNET: Xerochrysum bracteatum" /> These bracts are papery and dry, or ''scarious'', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin [[Cell_wall#Layers|primary]] and a thick [[secondary cell wall]], a feature only found in [[Ground tissue#sclerenchyma|sclerenchyma]], or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1093/aob/mcn058}}</ref>

The individual florets are yellow.<ref name="PlantNET: Xerochrysum bracteatum" /> Those on the outer regions of the disc are female, while those in the centre are bisexual. Female flowers lack [[stamen]]s and have only a very short tube-shaped corolla surrounding a [[pistil]] that splits to form two stigmas, while [[Plant sexuality#Individual reproductive unit (a flower in angiosperms)|bisexual or hermaphrodite]] flowers have a longer corolla, and (as in virtually all members of the family) five stamens fused at the anthers, with the pistil emerging from the center. The yellow corolla and pistil are located above an ovary with a single [[ovule]], and surrounded by the [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]], the highly modified [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of Asteraceae. It comprises a number of bristles radiating around the florets.<ref name=EDoA2>Australian Daisy Study Group, pp.&nbsp;2<U+2013>3.</ref> Yellow in colour, they persist and are thought to aid in the [[wind dispersal]] of the 0.3&nbsp;cm (0.1&nbsp;in) long [[Asteraceae#Fruits_and_Seeds|fruit]].<ref name=EDoA2>Australian Daisy Study Group, pp. 4, 57.</ref> The smooth brown fruit, known as a [[Asteraceae#Fruits_and_seeds|cypsela]], is 2 to 3&nbsp;mm long with the pappus radiating from one end.<ref name=EDoA58/>

In the wild, ''X.&nbsp;bracteatum'' can be distinguished from ''X.&nbsp;bicolor'' in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from ''[[Xerochrysum macranthum|X.&nbsp;macranthum]]'' in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of ''X.&nbsp;bracteatum'' are golden yellow. ''[[Xerochrysum subundulatum]]'' from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] and [[Subalpine zone|subalpine]] areas of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania is [[rhizome|rhizomatous]], and has markedly pointed orange bracts.<ref name=EDoA58>Australian Daisy Study Group, p. 58.</ref><!-- cites para --> The eastern Australian species ''Xerochrysum viscosum'' can be distinguished by its rough and sticky leaves.<ref name=EDoA65>Australian Daisy Study Group, p. 65.</ref>

Experimentation at the [[Waite Institute]] of the [[University of Adelaide]] showed that flower production was related to increasing day length, and in general, plants produced the most flowers from December to March. Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production of flowers outside these months.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sharman, K.

The water mould ([[oomycete]]) ''[[Bremia lactucae]]'' has infected commercial crops in Italy and California.

Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many bracts), although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals.<ref name=enc>{{Cite book|author=Elliot, Rodger W.; Jones, David L.; Blake, Trevor |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation: Vol. 5|year=1990|pages=267<U+2013>68|publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=0-85091-285-7}}</ref> Some coloured forms of South African ''Helichrysum'' are thought to have been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours.

He applied to the [[Australian Cultivar Registration Authority]] (ACRA) for registration, which was granted in 1980. It is a dense perennial shrub which reaches around a metre (3&nbsp;ft) high and wide. The oblanceolate leaves measure 6 to 12&nbsp;cm (2.4<U+2013>4.8&nbsp;in) long and are covered with fine hairs that give them a greyish cast. Fine hairs also cover the stems. The flower heads have light lemon-yellow bracts and orange discs and average 7&nbsp;cm (2.8&nbsp;in) in diameter.  They are held on long stems around 12<U+2013>15&nbsp;cm (5<U+2013>6&nbsp;in) above the foliage. Like all forms, it prefers full sun. Although a perennial, it loses vigour after a few years, at which time it is best replaced. The name 'Cockatoo' was chosen as the shape and colour of the ray florets are reminiscent of the wing feathers of the [[Sulphur-crested Cockatoo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc189.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Cockatoo'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|location=Canberra, ACT|accessdate=18 Sep 2010}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Golden Bowerbird'''' is a hybrid, bred by a deliberate [[backcrossing|backcross]] of 'Cockatoo' to 'Dargan Hill Monarch' by Doug McKenzie, who applied for registration with the ACRA in 1980. (It was granted in 1981.) It has much larger flower heads than both parents, yet is a smaller shrub, which reaches 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;in) high by 70&nbsp;cm (28&nbsp;in) wide. Denser than that of other forms, the foliage is covered in fine grey hair. On stalks around 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) above the foliage, the flower heads measure up to 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;in) in diameter, although larger ones up to 10&nbsp;cm are occasionally seen. They have around 300 bracts per flower head, compared with 80 for 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and 200 in 'Cockatoo', giving them a "doubled" look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc226.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Golden Bowerbird'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|location=Canberra, ACT|accessdate=18 Sep 2010}}</ref> It is reported as producing fewer flower heads than 'Princess of Wales'.<ref name=AP124b>{{Cite journal|author=Foster, Toney; Kirby, Neil|year=1990|title=Our Favourite Everlastings |journal=[[Australian Plants]]|volume=15|issue=124|page=343}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Princess of Wales'''' is a spontaneous hybrid, arising from a cross between 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and an annual form. Arising in the [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] in [[Canberra]], it was selected by employee Peter Ollerenshaw in summer 1983. He applied to register the cultivar with ACRA in March 1985.<ref name=ACRAPoW/> It was named in honour of a visit by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] to the gardens in November 1985,<ref name=AP124/> the same month registration was granted.<ref name=ACRAPoW/> With compact foliage, this form reaches 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) high and wide. Unlike its parent 'Dargan Hill Monarch', its foliage has hair only on the midrib on the leaf underside.<ref name=ACRAPoW/> It flowers very profusely,<ref name=AP124b/> and the large flower heads are borne on stalks 5<U+2013>9&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>3.6&nbsp;in) above the foliage. Unlike other forms, the stems wither and die naturally after flowering, making way for more new growth and flowers.<ref name=ACRAPoW>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc359.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Princess of Wales'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|location=Canberra, ACT|accessdate=23 Sep 2010}}</ref> The flower heads are golden yellow and measure 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;in) across.<ref name=AP124/>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Diamond Head'''' was a natural form collected around Diamond Head in New South Wales, where it is quite common on bluffs and cliffs. [[John Wrigley]], curator of the Australian National Botanic Gardens at the time, applied to the ACRA to have it registered, which it was in February 1977.<ref name=AP124/> Found on an exposed headland in nature, it grows as a low mat-like perennial shrub 8&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;in) high and 60&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft) across. The foliage is green and rough and the flowers are 3&nbsp;cm in diameter and yellow in colour with an orange disc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc107.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Diamond Head'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|location=Canberra, ACT|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=17 Sep 2010}}</ref> It makes an ideal plant for [[rockery|rockeries]], and strikes easily from cuttings during the spring growing period.<ref name=AP73>{{Cite journal|author=Hewett, Max|year=1977|title=''Helichrysum bracteatum'' "Diamond Head" |journal=[[Australian Plants]]|volume=9|issue=73|page=205}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Hastings Gold'''' was a natural form from Hastings Point to the east of [[Murwillumbah, New South Wales|Murwillumbah]] on the New South Wales far north coast. It is a perennial herb with green bushy foliage reaching 25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) high and 70&nbsp;cm (28&nbsp;in) wide. The golden yellow flower heads measure 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) across and are held on stalks 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) above the foliage. It is smaller than the similarly coloured 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and larger than 'Diamond Head'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc159.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Hastings Gold'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|location=Canberra, ACT|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=23 Sep 2010}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Nullarbor Flame'''' was a selection introduced into cultivation in 1997 that produces abundant red flowers with yellow discs and a diameter of 4.5&nbsp;cm (1.8&nbsp;in). The plant grows to 50<U+2013>70&nbsp;cm (20<U+2013>28&nbsp;in) tall and 50<U+2013>80&nbsp;cm (20<U+2013>32&nbsp;in) wide.<ref name=AP153>{{Cite journal|author=Payne, Bill|year=1997|title=New Cultivars now Released for Horticulture |journal=[[Australian Plants]]|volume=19|issue=153|pages=201<U+2013>02}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Pink Sunrise'''' was developed by Goldup Nurseries in Victoria in 1986, of unknown origin, presumably a hybrid. It is a compact perennial that reaches 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) high and 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) wide. The flower heads are pink in bud, before opening as cream with orange discs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc492.html|title=''Xerochrysum'' 'Pink Sunrise'|author=Australian Cultivar Registration Authority|location=Canberra, ACT|work=Descriptions of Registered Cultivars, ANBG website|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=17 Sep 2010}}</ref>

*'''''Xerochrysum'' 'Strawburst Yellow'''', patented as 'Stabur Yel', is a form with large bright yellow flower heads averaging around 6.3&nbsp;cm (2.5&nbsp;in) in diameter. The result of a planned [[breeding program]] in [[Gilroy, California]], it was bred by Jason Jandrew of Goldsmith Seeds from a lemon yellow-flowered form crossed with a yellow-flowered form in 2005. The pollination occurred in May, the resultant seed was sown in September, and what was to become the [[clone]] was chosen in December for its large flower size, colour and compact foliage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/plaveg/pbrpov/cropreport/stfl/app00006621e.shtml|title=Stabur Yel|author=|work=Canadian Food Inspection Agency website|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>
