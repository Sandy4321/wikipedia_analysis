'''Ippolito Ciera''' (fl. 1546 <U+2013> 1561) was an [[Italy|Italian]] composer of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], active at [[Treviso]] and [[Venice]].

Little is yet known about his life, for neither his biography nor his works have yet been the subject of a scholarly study.  He was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and sang at Treviso Cathedral: the earliest documentary record of his life is a payment in 1546 for his salary there.  In addition to singing, he taught music to the novices at the convent of San Nicol<U+00F2>.  By 1561 he had become ''maestro di cappella'', the choirmaster, at the church of San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, a much more prestigious position, and incidentally in one of the musical centers of Europe.  He probably knew [[Adrian Willaert]], the founder of the [[Venetian School]], and may have studied with him, as did many of the musicians in Venice at that time; his veneration for the elder master is shown in a laudatory [[sonnet]] he wrote and set to music for him.  It is No. 12 in his first book of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s.<ref>Jackson, Grove online</ref><ref>Einstein, Vol. 1 p. 321</ref>

All of Ciera's known music is vocal.  His complete surviving output amounts to a single setting of the [[mass (music)|mass]], four [[motet]]s, and two published collections of madrigals.  Dates of the works range from 1554 to 1561, with the two books of madrigals <U+2013> the first for four voices, and the second for five <U+2013> published in 1554 and 1561, respectively.  Ciera's style in his sacred music (the motets and mass) was akin to that of the [[Franco-Flemish school|Netherlanders]], with dense pervading [[imitation (music)|imitation]].  His madrigals, on the other hand, use chordal harmonies, and occasionally what was referred to as the "note nere" technique ("black note" for "filled in notes" <U+2013> i.e. quick note values, running passages, alternating with other textures).  Some of the madrigals are [[antiphon|antiphonal]] in places, reminiscent of the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] style of the Venetian School.<ref>Jackson, Grove online</ref>
