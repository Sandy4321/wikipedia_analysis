"'''Black Tears'''" is a song by [[Australian]] [[alternative rock]] [[band (music)|band]] [[Powderfinger]], from their sixth studio album ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]''. The release of the album was delayed when on [[2 May]], [[2007]] claims alleged that the song's lyrics could interfere with the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]] case. The song is an [[acoustic]] [[ballad]] in a [[folk music]] style, beginning with one guitar and a lead vocal, later introducing a guitar with a synthesised effect from the first chorus. Following the ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' release, live versions of the song have been released on other recordings.

==Controversy==
On [[2 May]] [[2007]], ''[[The Courier Mail]]'' announced that the defense team for Senior Sergeant [[Chris Hurley]] would be reporting the song to Queensland Attorney-General [[Kerry Shine]], due to concerns that the song's lyrics could prejudice the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]], where Hurley had been charged for [[manslaughter]]. On [[2 May]] Hurley's [[lawyer]] Glen Cranny said "The content and proposed timing of the song<U+2019>s release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley<U+2019>s trial."<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21659128-952,00.html |title=Powderfinger faces album ban|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|date=[[2 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> It was claimed by the defense team that the song's lyrics were similar to the events that took place surrounding the death of [[Mulrunji]]. This was denied by the band's manager, [[Paul Piticco]], who said that the lyrics were not about the case in particular, although he conceded they did discuss [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]].<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/powderfinger-album-faces-delay/2007/05/02/1177788210404.html |title=Powderfinger album faces delay|date=[[2 May]] [[2007]]|publisher=[[The Brisbane Times]]|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

The next day, on [[3 May]], Cranny continued to express concern, stating "The content and proposed timing of the song<U+2019>s release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley<U+2019>s trial". It was also noted that the album was set to be released 10 days before Hurley would face [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] [[Supreme Court]], on [[12 June]]. There were concerns that the case's [[jury]] could potentially be biased by the lyrical content.<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21659164-1702,00.html |title=Powderfinger facing lyrics ban|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Australian]]|date=[[3 May]] [[2007]]|author=Patrick Lion |accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref><ref name=Bulletin />

Due to the concerns raised, Powderfinger sought legal advice. Then [[premier of Queensland|Queensland premier]], [[Peter Beattie]], who had legal experience, said the song was likely to be protected by [[free speech]] laws, noting "The matter would have to go pertain specifically to the issues of the trial" for a "prejudice" argument to be raised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200705/s1913264.htm |title=Powderfinger calls in the lawyers over 'black deaths' lyrics|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|date=[[3 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

Several days after the initial threats of legal action, Powderfinger laywers sent Shine a copy of the new, altered lyrics. It was then reported that an analysis of the new lyrics found they were safe to release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/powderfinger-in-clear/2007/05/06/1178390129606.html |title=Powderfinger in clear|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=[[6 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> This was the version that would later be used on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21674216-5001028,00.html?from=public_rss |title=Powderfinger amends 'prejudicial' song|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Roberta Mancuso|date=[[4 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> A statement from Shine's office stated that "Crown Law has examined the lyrics.

Later, in a June 2007 interview, Fanning noted that Powderfinger hoped to re-release the original version of the song some time in the future, after the end of the case. He also said that he was not angry about having to change his lyrics, but lamented the lack of Australian musicians willing to challenge the status quo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black tears|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21838719-5005368,00.html|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]] from PerthNow.com|date=[[3 June]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-12|author=Adams, Cameron}}</ref>

The legal threats against the song were attacked heavily by some writers, including Andrew Stafford of ''[[The Bulletin]]''. He noted that it was highly unlikely "Black Tears" would be released as a [[single (music)|single]], so potential jurors would need to "buy a copy of ''Dream Days'' in the ten days between its release and Hurley's trial just to hear the song". He also noted that Piticco had stated the lyrics could just as easily refer to a death in [[Brisbane]], not on Palm Island.<ref name=Bulletin>{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=265101 |title=Pressure on Powderfinger absurd|publisher=[[NineMSN]]|work=[[The Bulletin]]|author=Andrew Stafford|date=[[4 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

==Musical content==
In a media statement published on the band's [[MySpace]], [[Bernard Fanning]], who originally wrote the song, said the inspiration came to him after "a trip that I took last year to [[Uluru]]." He said it discussed the issue of people climbing the rock, which is sacred in Aboriginal folklore, despite "the prevalence of literature and signage" asking people not to. Fanning compared climbing Uluru to climbing [[the Vatican]], which he noted would be highly offensive to [[catholic]]s. Fanning said the second part of the song, which contained the controversial lyrics, was written following the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions passing down its finding in the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody|death in custody case]]. He said that the band believed the song would have no bearing on the legal procedure, they would nonetheless include an altnerative version of the song on ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.<ref name=Pariah>{{cite web|url=http://www.pariahnt.org/news/content/view/32/1/|title=Media statement from Powderfinger|date=[[7 May]] [[2007]]|publisher=PARIAH - People Against Racism In Aboriginal Homelands|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref><Ref name=medrelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.generationq.net/articles/POWDERFINGER-ANNOUNCE-DREAM-DAYS-AT-THE-HOTEL-EXISTENCE-ALBUM-LAUNCH-PARTIES-00001.html?PHPSESSID=703d2349d19fdd5140cd75a50a2365dd |title=Powderfinger - Media Release|author=[[Bernard Fanning]]|publisher=GenerationQ|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

The original song was said to contain the lyrics;
{{cquote|1=An island watchhouse bed/A black man's lying dead.<ref name=ABCBacksDown>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/05/04/1914873.htm |title=Powderfinger backs down on 'Black Tears' lyrics|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=[[4 May]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>}}
Upon announcing that the album would contain an alternate version of, Fanning also noted his initial reasons for the song, stating "to bring attention to the obvious disadvantage that is still being suffered by Aboriginal people in this country", which he said included the issue of "Indigenous deaths in custody".<ref name=ABCBacksDown /> Despite the claimed lyrical change, some early versions of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' were shipped with a version of "Black Tears" that included the controversial lyrics, which were also published on the band's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/site.php?lyrics&track=black_tears |title=Black Tears|publisher=[[Powderfinger]]|work=Lyrics|accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>
