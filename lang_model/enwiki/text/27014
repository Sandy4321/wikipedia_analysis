Auden grew up in [[Birmingham]] in a professional middle-class family and read English Literature at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. His early poems, in the late 1920s and 1930s, alternated between obscure modern styles and accessible traditional ones, were written in an intense and dramatic tone, and established his reputation as a left-wing political poet and prophet. He became uncomfortable in this role in the later 1930s, and abandoned it after he moved to the United States in 1939. His poems in the 1940s explored religious and ethical themes in a less dramatic manner than his earlier works, but still combined new forms devised by Auden himself with traditional forms and styles. In the 1950s and 1960s many of his poems focused on the ways in which words revealed and concealed emotions, and he took a particular interest in writing opera librettos, a form ideally suited to direct expression of strong feelings. <ref name="FullerNoPage">{{cite book

He was also a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological, and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential. After his death, some of his poems, notably "[[Funeral Blues]]" ("Stop all the clocks") and "[[September 1, 1939]]", became widely known through films, broadcasts, and popular media.<ref name="Companion"/>

=== Childhood and education, 1907-1927 ===
==== Childhood ====

Wystan Hugh Auden was born in [[York]], [[England]], where his father [[George Augustus Auden]] was a physician.  Wystan was the third of three children, all sons; the oldest, George Bernard Auden, became a farmer; the second, [[John Bicknell Auden]], became a geologist. His mother, Constance Rosalie Bicknell Auden, had trained as a missionary nurse. Auden's grandfathers were both [[Church of England]] clergymen; his household was [[Anglo-Catholic]], following a "[[High church|High]]" form of [[Anglicanism]] with doctrine and ritual resembling that of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Auden traced his love of music and language partly to the church services of his childhood.<ref name="DNB"/> He believed he was of Icelandic descent, and his lifelong fascination with Icelandic legends and sagas is visible throughout his work.<ref>In "Letter to Lord Byron" he names the saga character Au<U+00F0>un Sk<U+00F6>kull as one of his ancestors.</ref>

In 1908 his family moved to [[Harborne]], [[Birmingham]], where his father had been appointed the School Medical Officer and Lecturer (later Professor) of Public Health; Auden's lifelong psychoanalytic interests began in his father's library. From the age of eight he attended boarding schools, returning home for holidays.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

From the ages six to twelve, "I spent a great many of my waking hours in the fabrication of a private secondary sacred world, the basic elements of which were (a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the North of England, and (b) an industry - lead mining".<ref>{{cite book

Until he was fifteen he expected to become a mining engineer, but his "passion for words" had already begun. He wrote later: "words so excite me that a pornographic story, for example, excites me sexually more than a living person can do".<ref>{{cite book

==== Education ====

Auden's first school was [[St. Edmund's School (Hindhead)]], [[Surrey]], where he met [[Christopher Isherwood]], later famous as a novelist. At thirteen he went to [[Gresham's School]] in [[Norfolk]], where, in 1922, his friend [[Robert Medley]] first suggested that he might write poetry. In the same year he "discover[ed] that he has lost his faith" (through a gradual realization that he had lost interest in religion, not through any decisive change of views).<ref>{{cite book

In 1925 he went to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], with a scholarship in biology, but he switched to English by his second year. Friends he met at Oxford included [[Cecil Day Lewis]], [[Louis MacNeice]], and [[Stephen Spender]]; these four were commonly though misleadingly identified in the 1930s as the "[[Auden Group]]" for their shared (but not identical) left-wing views. He left Oxford in 1928 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third-class]] degree.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

He was reintroduced to [[Christopher Isherwood]] in 1925; for the next few years Isherwood was his literary mentor to whom he sent poems for comments and criticism. Auden probably fell in love with Isherwood (who was unaware of the intensity of Auden's feelings) and in the 1930s they maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between their relations with others. In 1935-39 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book.<ref>{{cite book

From his Oxford years onward, his friends uniformly described him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.<ref name="RDH-NoPage"/>

===Britain and Europe, 1928-1938===
In the autumn of 1928 Auden left Britain for nine months in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]], partly to rebel against English repressiveness in a city where homosexuality was widely tolerated. In Berlin, he said, he first experienced the political and economic unrest that became one of his central subjects.<ref name="DNB"/>

On returning to Britain in 1929, he worked briefly as a tutor. In 1930 his first published book, ''Poems'' (1930), was accepted by [[T. S. Eliot]] for [[Faber and Faber]]; the firm also published all his later books. In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys' schools: two years at the [[Larchfield Academy]], in [[Helensburgh]], Scotland, then three years at the [[The Downs School (Worcestershire)|The Downs School]], near [[Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he was a much-loved teacher. At the Downs, in June 1933, he experienced what he later described as a "Vision of [[Agape]]," when, while sitting with three fellow-teachers at the school, he suddenly found that he loved them for themselves, that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience, he said, later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.<ref>{{cite book

His relations (and his unsuccessful courtships) tended to be unequal either in age or intelligence; his sexual relations were transient, although some evolved into long friendships. He contrasted these relations with what he regarded as the "marriage" (his word) of equals that he began with [[Chester Kallman]] in 1939 (see below), based on the unique individuality of both partners.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

[[Image:NightMailCrewe.jpg|left|thumb|200px|From the G.P.O. Film Unit's ''[[Night Mail]]''; scene possibly directed by Auden]]

From 1935 until he left Britain early in 1939, Auden worked as freelance reviewer, essayist, and lecturer, first with the [[G.P.O. Film Unit]], a documentary film-making branch of the post office,  headed by [[John Grierson]]. He collaborated there with [[Benjamin Britten]], with whom he also worked on plays, song cycles, and a libretto. Auden's plays in the 1930s were performed by the [[Group Theatre (London)|Group Theatre]], in productions that he supervised to varying degrees.<ref name="DNB"/>

His work now reflected his belief that any good artist must be "more than a bit of a reporting journalist".<ref>{{cite book

In 1937 he went to [[Spain]] intending to drive an ambulance for the Republic in the [[Spanish Civil War]], but was put to work broadcasting propaganda, a job he left in order to visit the front. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply, and his social views grew more complex as he found political realities to be more ambiguous and troubling than he had imagined. Again attempting to combine reportage and art, he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], working on their book ''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939). On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent the autumn of 1938 partly in England, partly in [[Brussels]].<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

Many of his poems during the 1930s and afterward were inspired by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarized his emotional life in a famous couplet: "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me" ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; in a letter to his friend [[James Stern]] he called marriage "the ''only'' subject".<ref>{{cite book

===United States and Europe, 1939-1973===
Auden and Isherwood sailed to New York in January 1939, entering on temporary visas. Their departure from Britain was later seen by many there as a betrayal and Auden's reputation suffered. In April 1939 Isherwood moved to California, and he and Auden saw each other only intermittently in later years. Around this time, Auden met an eighteen-year old poet [[Chester Kallman]], who became his lover for the next two years (Auden described their relation as a "marriage" that began with a cross-country "honeymoon" journey).<ref>{{cite book

In 1940-41, Auden lived in a house in [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] which he shared with [[Carson McCullers]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and others, and which became a famous center of artistic life.<ref>{{cite book

In 1941-42 he taught English at the [[University of Michigan]]. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1942, but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at [[Swarthmore College]] in 1942-45. In the summer of 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was in Germany with the [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)|U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey]], studying the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return, he settled in [[Manhattan]], working as a freelance writer and as a visiting professor at [[Bennington College|Bennington]], [[Smith College|Smith]], and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the US.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

His theology in his later years evolved from a highly inward and psychologically oriented [[Protestantism]] in the early 1940s to a more [[Roman Catholic]]-oriented interest in the significance of the body and in collective ritual in the later 1940s and 1950s, and finally to the theology of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] which rejected "childish" conceptions of God for an adult religion that focused on the significance of human suffering.<ref name="Kirsch"/> 

Auden began summering in Europe in 1948, first in [[Ischia]], Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting 1958, in [[Kirchstetten]], Austria where he bought a farmhouse, and, he said, shed tears of joy at owning a home for the first time.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

In 1951, shortly before the two British spies [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean]] fled to the USSR, Burgess attempted to phone Auden to arrange a vacation visit to Ischia that he had earlier discussed with Auden; Auden never returned the call and had no further contact with either spy, but a media frenzy ensued in which his name was mistakenly associated with their escape. The frenzy was repeated when the [[MI5]] documents on the incident were released in 2007.<ref>{{cite web

In 1956-61, Auden was [[Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]] where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to spend most of his time in New York and his summer home. He now earned his income mostly by readings and lecture tours, and by writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and other magazines.<ref name="DNB"/>

During his last years, his conversation became repetitive, to the disappointment of friends who had known him earlier as a witty and wide-ranging conversationalist.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/> In 1972, he moved his winter home from New York to Oxford, where his old college, Christ Church, offered him a cottage, but he continued to summer in Austria. He died in [[Vienna]] in 1973 and was buried in [[Kirchstetten]].<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

H. Auden''.<ref name="Companion"/></small>

===Overview===
Auden published about four hundred poems, including seven long poems (two of them book-length). His poetry was encyclopedic in scope and method, ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as ballads and limericks, from doggerel through haiku and villanelles to a "Christmas Oratorio" and a [[baroque]] eclogue in Anglo-Saxon meters. The tone and content of his poems ranged the pop-song clich<U+00E9>s to complex philosophical meditations, from the corns on his toes to atoms and stars, from contemporary crises to the evolution of society.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

He also wrote more than four hundred essays and reviews about literature, history, politics, music, religion, and many other subjects. He collaborated on plays with [[Christopher Isherwood]] and on opera libretti with [[Chester Kallman]], worked with a group of artists and filmmakers on documentary films in the 1930s and with the [[New York Pro Musica]] early music group in the 1950s and 1960s. About collaboration he wrote in 1964: "collaboration has brought me greater erotic joy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. than any sexual relations I have had".<ref>{{cite book

Auden controversially rewrote or discarded some of his most famous poems when he prepared his later collected editions. He wrote that he rejected poems that he found "boring" or "dishonest" in the sense that they expressed views that he had never held but had used only because he felt they would be rhetorically effective.<ref>{{cite book

=== Early work, 1922-1939 ===
[[Image:Poems1928.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Cover of the privately-printed ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928)]]
==== Through 1930 ====

Auden began writing poems at thirteen, mostly in the styles of 19th-century romantic poets, especially [[Wordsworth]], and later poets with rural interests, especially [[Thomas Hardy]]. At eighteen he discovered [[T. S. Eliot]] and adopted an extreme version of Eliot's style. He found his own voice at twenty, when he wrote the first poem later included in his collected work, "From the very first coming down". This and other poems of the late 1920s tended to be in a clipped, elusive style that alluded to, but did not directly state, their themes of loneliness and loss. Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928), a pamphlet hand-printed by [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book

In 1928 he wrote his first dramatic work, ''[[Paid on Both Sides]]'', subtitled "A Charade," which combined style and content from the Icelandic [[sagas]] with jokes from English school life. This mixture of tragedy and farce, with a dream play-within-the-play, introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work. This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1930, 2nd edition with seven poems replaced, 1933); the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic mediations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal, social, and seasonal renewal; among these poems were "It was Easter as I walked," "Doom is dark," "Sir, no man's enemy," and "This lunar beauty."<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

A recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of "family ghosts", Auden's term for the powerful, unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life (and the title of a poem). A parallel theme, present throughout his work, is the contrast between biological evolution (unchosen and involuntary) and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals (voluntary and deliberate even in its subconscious aspects).<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

==== 1931 through 1935 ====

Auden's next large-scale work was ''[[The Orators]]: An English Study'' (1932; revised editions, 1934, 1966), in verse and prose, largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems, his style became more open and accessible, and the exuberant "Six Odes" in ''The Orators'' reflect his new interest in Robert Burns. During the next few years, many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs, and also from expansive classical forms like the Odes of [[Horace]], which he seems to have discovered through the German poet [[H<U+00F6>lderlin]]. Around this time his main influences were [[Dante]], [[William Langland]], and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref>{{cite book

During these years, much of his work expressed left-wing views, and he became widely known as a political poet, although his work was more politically ambivalent than many reviewers recognized. He generally wrote about revolutionary change in terms of a "change of heart", a transformation of a society from a closed-off psychology of fear to an open psychology of love. His verse drama ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'' (1933) was a political extravaganza in the style of a theatrical revue, which Auden later called "a nihilistic leg-pull".<ref>{{cite book

''[[The Ascent of F6]]'' (1937), another play written with Isherwood, was partly an anti-imperialist satire, partly (in the character of the self-destroying climber Michael Ransom) an examination of Auden's own motives in taking on a public role as a political poet. This play included the first version of "[[Funeral Blues]]" ("Stop all the clocks"), written as a satiric eulogy for a politician; Auden later rewrote the poem as a "Cabaret Song" about lost love (written to be sung by the soprano [[Hedli Anderson]] for whom he wrote many lyrics in the 1930s). In 1935, he worked briefly on documentary films with the [[G.P.O. Film Unit]], writing his famous verse commentary for ''[[Night Mail]]'' and lyrics for other films that were among his attempts in the 1930s to create a widely-accessible, socially-conscious art.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

==== 1936 through 1939 ====

These tendencies in style and content culminate in his collection ''Look, Stranger!'' (1936; his British publisher chose the title; Auden retitled the 1937 US edition ''[[On This  Island]]''). This book included political odes, love poems, comic songs, meditative lyrics, and a variety of intellectually intense but emotionally accessible verse. Among the poems included in the book, connected by themes of personal, social, and evolutionary change and of the possibilities and problems of personal love, were "Hearing of harvests", "Out on the lawn I lie in bed", "O what is that sound", "Look, stranger, on this island now", and "Our hunting fathers."<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

[[Image:MuseeDesBeauxArtsMS.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Manuscript of "[[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux Arts]]", 1938 (Library of Congress)]]

Auden was now arguing that an artist should be a kind of journalist, and he put this view into practice in ''[[Letters from Iceland]]'' (1937) a travel book in prose and verse written with [[Louis MacNeice]], which included his long social, literary, and autobiographical commentary "Letter to Lord Byron". In 1937, after observing the [[Spanish Civil War]] he wrote a politically-engaged pamphlet poem ''[[Spain (Auden)|Spain]]'' (1937); he later discarded it from his collected works. ''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939) a travel book in prose and verse, was written with Isherwood after their visit to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. Auden's last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play, ''[[On the Frontier]]'', an anti-war satire written in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] styles.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

Auden's themes in his shorter poems now included the fragility and transience of personal love ("Danse Macabre", "The Dream", "Lay your sleeping head"), a theme he treated with ironic wit in his "Four Cabaret Songs for Miss [[Hedli Anderson]]" (which included "O Tell Me the Truth About Love" and the revised version of "[[Funeral Blues]]"), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives ("Casino", "School Children", "Dover"). In 1938 he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure ("Miss Gee", "James Honeyman", "Victor"). All these appeared in his next book of verse, ''[[Another Time]]'' (1940),  together with other famous poems such as "Dover", "As He Is", and "[[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux Arts]]" (all written before he moved to America in 1939), and "In Memory of W. B. Yeats", "[[The Unknown Citizen]]", "[[Law Like Love]]", "[[September 1, 1939]]", and "In Memory of Sigmund Freud" (written in America). The elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly statements of Auden's anti-heroic theme, in which great deeds are performed, not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate, but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were "silly like us" (Yeats) or of whom it could be said "he wasn't clever at all" (Freud), and who became teachers of others, not awe-inspiring heroes.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

=== Middle period, 1940-1957 ===
==== 1940 through 1946 ====

In 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem "New Year Letter", which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in ''[[The Double Man]]'' (1941). At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes, such as "Canzone" and "Kairos and Logos". Around 1942, as he became more comfortable with religious themes, his verse became more open and relaxed, and he increasingly used the [[syllabic verse]] he learned from the poetry of [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

His recurring themes in this period included the artist's temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves ("Prospero to Ariel") and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognizing the temptation to break them ("In Sickness and Health").<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

[[Image:AgeOfAnxietyTitlePage.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Title page of ''[[The Age of Anxiety (poem)|The Age of Anxiety]]'' (1947); Auden specified the typography for this book.]]

From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form, each differing from the others in form and content: "[[For the Time Being]]: A Christmas Oratorio", "[[The Sea and the Mirror]]: A Commentary on Shakespeare's ''The Tempest''" (both published in ''For the Time Being'', 1944), and ''[[The Age of Anxiety (poem)|The Age of Anxiety]]: A Baroque Eclogue'' (published separately 1947). The first two, with Auden's other new poems from 1940-44, were included in his first collected edition, ''The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden'' (1945), with most of his earlier poems, many in revised versions.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

==== 1947 through 1957 ====

After completing ''The Age of Anxiety'' in 1946 he focused again on shorter poems, notably "A Walk After Dark," "The Love Feast", and "The Fall of Rome." Many of these evoked the Italian village where he summered in 1948-57, and his next book, ''[[Nones]]'' (1951), had a Mediterranean atmosphere new to his work. A new theme was the "sacred importance" of the human body<ref>{{cite book

In 1949 Auden and Kallman wrote the libretto for [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', and later collaborated on two libretti for operas by [[Hans Werner Henze]].<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

Auden's first separate prose book was ''[[The Enchaf<U+00E8>d Flood]]: The Romantic Iconography of the Sea'' (1950), based on a series of lectures on the image of the sea in romantic literature.

In 1949-54 he worked on a sequence of seven [[Good Friday]] poems, "Horae Canonicae", an encyclopedic survey of geological, biological, cultural, and personal history, focused on the irreversible act of murder; the poem was also a study in cyclical and linear ideas of time. While writing this, he also wrote a sequence of seven poems about man's relation to nature, "Bucolics". Both sequences appeared in his next book, ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1955), with other short poems, including the book's title poem, "Fleet Visit", and "Epitaph for the Unknown Soldier".<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

Extending the themes of "Horae Canonicae", in 1955-56 he wrote a group of poems about "history," a word he used to mean the set of unique events made by human choices, as opposed to "nature," the set of involuntary events created by natural processes, statistics, and anonymous forces such as crowds. These poems included "T the Great", "The Maker", and the title poem of his next collection ''[[Homage to Clio]]'' (1960).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

===Later work, 1958-1973===
In the late 1950s Auden's style became less rhetorical while its range of styles increased. In 1958, having moved his summer home from Italy to Austria, he wrote "Good-bye to the Mezzogiorno"; other poems from this period include "Dichtung und Wahrheit: An Unwritten Poem", a prose poem about the relation between love and personal and poetic language, and the contrasting "Dame Kind", about the anonymous impersonal reproductive instinct. These and other poems, including his 1955-66 poems about history, appeared in ''[[Homage to Clio]]'' (1960).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

His prose book ''[[The Dyer's Hand]]'' (1962) gathered many of the lectures he gave in Oxford as Professor of Poetry in 1956-61, together with revised versions of essays and notes written since the mid-1940s.

While translating the haiku and other verse in [[Dag Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld]]'s ''Markings'', Auden began using haiku for many of his poems. A sequence of fifteen poems about his house in Austria, "Thanksgiving for a Habitat", appeared in ''[[About the House]]'' (1965), with other poems that included  his reflections on his lecture tours, "On the Circuit". In the late 1960s he wrote some of his most vigorous poems, including "River Profile" and two poems that looked back over his life, "Prologue at Sixty" and "Forty Years On". All these appeared in ''[[City Without Walls]]'' (1969). His lifelong passion for Icelandic legend culminated in his verse translation of ''The [[Elder Edda]]'' (1969).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

''[[A Certain World]]: A Commonplace Book'' (1970) was a kind of self-portrait made up of favorite quotations with commentary, arranged in alphabetical order by subject. His last prose book was a selection of essays and reviews, ''Forewords and Afterwords'' (1973).

His last books of verse, ''[[Epistle to a Godson]]'' (1972) and the unfinished ''[[Thank You, Fog]]'' (1974) include reflective poems about language ("Natural Linguistics") and about his own aging ("A New Year Greeting", "Talking to Myself", "A Lullaby" ["The din of work is subdued"]). His last completed poem, in haiku form, was "Archeology", about ritual and timelessness, two recurring themes in his later years.<ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

===Reputation and influence===
Auden<U+2019>s stature in modern literature is much disputed, with opinions ranging from that of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], who called him "a complete wash-out", to the obituarist in the ''Times'' (London), who wrote: "W.&nbsp;H. Auden, for long the ''enfant terrible'' of English poetry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. emerges as its undisputed master".<ref name="SansomChapter">{{cite book

 | pages = pp. 226-39
 | isbn = 0-521-82962-3}}</ref>

In his ''enfant terrible'' stage in the 1930s he was both praised and dismissed as a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to the politically nostalgic and poetically obscure voice of [[T. S. Eliot]]. His departure for America in 1939 was hotly debated in Britain (once even in Parliament), with some critics treating it as a betrayal, and the role of influential young poet passed to [[Dylan Thomas]], although defenders such as [[Geoffrey Grigson]], in an introduction to a 1949 anthology of modern poetry, wrote that Auden "arches over all". His stature was suggested by book titles such as ''Auden and After'' by [[Francis Scarfe]] (1942) and ''The Auden Generation'' by Samuel Hynes (1972).<ref name="Companion"/>

In the US, starting in the late 1930s, the detached, ironic tone of Auden<U+2019>s regular stanzas set the style for a whole generation of poets; [[John Ashbery]] recalled that in the 1940s Auden "was ''the'' modern poet". His manner was so pervasive in American poetry that the ecstatic style of the [[Beat Generation]] was partly a reaction against his influence. In the 1950s and 1960s, some British writers (notably [[Philip Larkin]]) lamented that Auden<U+2019>s work had declined from its earlier promise.<ref name="CriticalHeritage">{{cite book

By the time of Auden<U+2019>s death in 1973 he had attained the status of a respected elder statesman. With some exceptions, British critics tended to treat his early work as his best, while American critics tended to favor his middle and later work. Unlike other modern poets, his reputation did not decline after his death, and [[Joseph Brodsky]] wrote that his was "the greatest mind of the twentieth century".<ref name="Brodsky"/>

Auden<U+2019>s popularity and familiarity suddenly increased after his "[[Funeral Blues]]" ("Stop all the clocks") was read aloud in the film ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994); subsequently, a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems, ''Tell Me the Truth About Love'', sold more than 275,000 copies. After September 11, 2001, his poem "[[September 1, 1939]]" was widely circulated.<ref name="SansomChapter"/> Public readings and broadcast tributes in the UK and US in 2007 marked his centenary year.<ref>{{cite web
