==History==
With some variation due to realignments over time, the original [[1918]] routing this highway followed much of today's STH 13, beginning at what was then Kilbourn (present-day Wisconsin Dells), travelling north through Adams, Grand Rapids (now Wisconsin Rapids), Marshfield, Prentice and Ashland, ending in Bayfield. It was later that STH 13 was routed around the Bayfield Peninsula and westerly to Superior.

The route of STH 13 previously ran the length of the state from [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] on the [[Illinois]] state line to the [[Minnesota]] state line. From Beloit, Highway 13 followed the roads that are now [[U.S. Highway 51 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 51]], [[U.S. Highway 14 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 14]], [[U.S. Highway 12 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 12]] through [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]] and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. Additionally, STH 13 was extended westerly from Bayfield first to Port Wing, then into Superior then across the border to [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. In the 1920s, The southern end of highway 13 was realigned from [[Evansville, Wisconsin|Evansville]] to Beloit along what is now [[Highway 213 (Wisconsin)|WIS 213]] after US 14 was commissioned.

Highway 13 was truncated to its present southern terminus in [[1961]] after I-90 and I-94 were commissioned.<ref name="WH1">{{cite web | last = Bessert | first = Chris | title =Wisconsin Highways: Highways 10-19 (Highway 13) | work =Wisconsin Highways | url =http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys10-19.html#STH-013 | accessdate = 3/20/2007}}</ref>

==Current status==
Highway 13 is 2-lane road along the entire length with exceptions of urban multi-lane highways in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin Rapids, Marshfield, Abbotsford and Ashland.  It only has one expressway interchange - with [[U.S. Highway 8 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 8]], 1 mile west of Prentice - as a Super-2.

The 4-lane road in Marshfield is also known as the Veteran's Parkway.  This section was built to alleviate congestion in downtown Marshfield along Central Ave.  Further, the city and WisDOT are reconstructing Central Avenue in [[2009]] before handing it over to city control.<ref name="WH2">[http://ci.marshfield.wi.us/ma/South%20Central.htm City of Marshfield - South Central Ave Reconstruction]</ref>
