'''Snowbird''' is a human-powered [[ornithopter]]. It was the first man-powered ornithopter to fly straight and level.<ref name=metro-2010-10-01>'''Hayden Smith''', [http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/841925-snowbird-the-first-man-powered-plane-with-flapping-wings "Snowbird: The first man-powered plane with flapping wings"], ''Metro.co.uk'', (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref><ref name=PopSci-2010-09-22>'''Rebecca Boyle''', [http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-09/video-canadian-student-flies-bird-first-time-using-record-setting-ornithopter "First Human to Fly Under Own Power, By Flapping Wings"], ''Popular Science'', ''22 September 2010'' (accessed 10-10-10) </ref><ref name=Jerusalem-2010-10-17>'''Judy Siegel-Itzkovich''', [http://www.jpost.com/HealthAndSci-Tech/ScienceAndEnvironment/Article.aspx?id=191641 "Leonardo's Model Flies"], ''Jerusalem Post'', ''10/17/2010'' (accessed 10/20/2010) </ref> The first human-powered aircraft to successfully fly was the [[Gossamer Condor]], in 1977, a fixed-wing airplane with a propeller.<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-24> '''Allan Dowd''', [http://www.allvoices.com/s/event-6828614/aHR0cDovL256LnJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Jzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LypodHRwOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYS8tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvODAwNTg1Mi9jYW5hZGlhbi1vcm5pdGhvcHRlci1hY2hpZXZlcy1kYS12aW5jaXMtZHJlYW0v "Canadian ornithopter achieves Da Vinci's dream"], ''Reuters'', ''24 September 2010'' (accessed 10-10-10) </ref> Although others have claimed to have flown like a bird under human power, those claims have never been confirmed.<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-24/>

==Design and development==
===Background===
There have been several attempts throughout history of humans attempting to fly like a bird, under their own power. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is frequently credited with creating the first design for a human-powered ornithopter in 1485.<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-28/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27/> Since that time, many people have tried to make human-powered flight like a bird happen.<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-28/><ref name=CSM-2010-09-27/> 

In 1991, the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]] (FAI) awarded a <U+201C>Dipl<U+00F4>me d<U+2019>Honneur<U+201D> for the first remotely-operated engine-powered ornithopter, which was developed by Professor DeLaurier and [[UTIAS]].<ref name=HPO-history> HPO Project, [http://hpo.ornithopter.net/?q=content/a-brief-history-human-powered-aviation-and-ornithopters History](accessed 15 October 2010) </ref>

A previous attempt at UofT, in 2006, resulted in the [[UTIAS Ornithopter No.1]], which could only maintain flight with the assistance of a jet engine, but whose flapping wings were human-powered.<ref> [http://www.amazingworldrecords.com/2010/09/snowbird-claims-record-for-sustained.html "The Snowbird on its record-breaking flight"], ''AmazingWorldRecords.com'', '''gizmag''' (accessed 10-10-10) </ref> This programme was also the most recent prior attempt at trying to get a human-powered ornithopter off the ground.<ref> '''Vivian Chang''', [http://thetartan.org/2010/9/27/scitech/stb "First human-powered flight recorded"], ''The Tartan'', ''27 September 2010'' (accessed 10-10-10) </ref>

===Ornithopter Project===
The Human-Powered Ornithopter Project (HPO) started in the summer of 2006, as a spin-off of the [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]] (UTIAS) flapping wing research program.<ref name=HPO-project> HPO Project, [http://hpo.ornithopter.net/?q=content/the-project Project] (accessed 15 October 2010) </ref><ref name=NTD-2010-10-14> NTDtv, [http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/ns_na/2010-10-14/990839619086.html "Flapping Wings Make Aviation History"], ''2010-10-14'' (accessed 20-10-2010) </ref>

The aircraft has a wingspan of {{convert|32|m|ft}}<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26> '''Jennifer Green''', [http://www.ottawacitizen.com/dreams+flies/3581043/story.html "He dreams, he flies!"], ''Ottawa Citizen'', ''26 September 2010'' (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref> (comparable to a [[Boeing 737]])<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-28/><ref name=metro-2010-10-01/>, and weighs {{convert|43|kg|lb}}<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/><ref name=Reuters-2010-09-28/><ref name=metro-2010-10-01/>. It cost $200,000 [[Canadian dollar|Cdn]]<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> (approx. $200,000 USD), not including donated material and time.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> It was built primarily with [[carbon fibre]], [[balsa wood]], [[basswood]] and foam.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27> '''Naveen Kar''', [http://seerpress.com/ornithopter-%E2%80%93-da-vinci-conceived-canadian-student-realizes-the-engineless-flying-machine/8043/ "Ornithopter <U+2013> Da Vinci conceived, Canadian student realizes the engineless flying machine"], ''Seer Press'', ''27 September 2010'' (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref> The pedals are connected to the wings through a system of pumps and pulleys.<ref name=Mail-2010-09-27/> Snowbird does not have a launch runup equipment, due to the need to keep off weight, and requires a tow-assist at launch.<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-24/> The downward flap required {{convert|700|lbf|N}}. It was built under the supervision of professor James DeLaurier, a NASA alumnus.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> The craft was built under the [[University of Toronto]]'s '''Human Powered Ornithopter Project'''.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> The team that built it was composed of five students.<ref name=Mail-2010-09-27> '''Leah Roach, Chris Leadbeater''', [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1315656/Just-like-Icarus-First-successful-man-power-flight-achieved.html?ito=feeds-newsxml "Just like Icarus: First successful man-power flight is achieved"], ''Daily Mail'' (UK), ''27 September 2010'' </ref> The name came about when during testing on a snowy field, the cockpit became filled with snow.<ref name=CSM-2010-09-27> '''Charles Q. Choi''', [http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/0927/Plane-that-flies-by-flapping-its-wings-makes-historic-first-flight "Plane that flies by flapping its wings makes historic first flight"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', ''27 September 2010'' (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref>

The team expects that revised iterations of the aircraft with greater performance will be made.<ref name=HPO-2010-09-22/>

==Operational history==
===Record run===
For its aviation-first flight, it was piloted by [[Todd Reichert]], 28-year old PhD graduate student of the [[University of Toronto]]'s Institute for Aerospace Studies.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/><ref name=CNN-2010-09-27> '''Janet Dirks''', [http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/studentnews/09/27/transcript.tue/ "CNN Student News Transcript: September 28, 2010"], ''CNN'', 28 September 2010 (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref> The record flight was observed by a certified official from the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]] (FAI),<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> and [[Global positioning system|GPS]] data surrounding the altitude and length of flight were given to the organization for certification.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> Snowbird flew for 19.3 seconds in a straight-and-level powered flight run under human power alone.<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27/> It averaged {{convert|25.6|kph|mph}},<ref name=Reuters-2010-09-28> '''Jo Borras''', [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS161728911820100928 "World's First Human-Powered Ornithopter Takes Flight"], ''Reuters'', 28 September 2010 (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref><ref name=metro-2010-10-01/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27/> over a length of {{convert|145|m|ft}}.<ref name=metro-2010-10-01/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27/> Take-off was assisted with a tow from a car to get the aircraft up to speed, before flapping for lift-off.<ref name=metro-2010-10-01/> A total of 16 flaps were used on the run to maintain height.<ref name=metro-2010-10-01/> At the start of the flight, data indicates that Snowbird was able to gain height, while maintaining speed, indicating that there was more power than necessary to maintain straight-and-level flight.<ref name=AWST-2010-09-23> '''Graham Warwick''', [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/aviation_week/on_space_and_technology/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&newspaperUserId=a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9c&plckPostId=Blog:a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9cPost:a2ef8e7d-8aec-40aa-bdd1-fc57be8e693f&plckScript=blogScript&plckElementId=blogDest "Snowbird Flies on Flapping Wings - and Human Power"], ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', ''23 September 2010'' (accessed 10-10-10) </ref> The run occurred at the [[Great Lakes Gliding Club]],<ref name=metro-2010-10-01/><ref name=Seer-2010-09-27/><ref name=Witness-2010-09-27/> in [[Tottenham, Ontario]],<ref name=Witness-2010-09-27> '''Sapa-AFP''', http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global[_id]=48001 , "Da Vinci's ornithopter flies 145m", ''The Witness'', 27 September 2010 (accessed 1 October 2010) </ref> on 2 August 2010,<ref name=OttawaCitizen-2010-09-26/> at around 6:45am.<ref name=CSM-2010-09-27/> Reichert estimates that each stroke needed {{convert|600|-|700|W|bhp}}, with {{convert|700|-|800|lbf|N}} on each stroke.<ref name=CSM-2010-09-27/> Analysis of the flight afterward indicated that 15-20 power strokes is the limit of endurance for the pilot.<ref name=AWST-2010-09-23/>

===Fate===
On the last flight of 2 August 2010, a main drive line failed. Fatigue wear was noted on many components. With training of the pilot, with the intent of peaking for the record attempt, it was decided to end flights for the season.<ref name=HPO-2010-09-22> HPO Project, [http://hpo.ornithopter.net/?q=content/successful-flight-snowbird "Successful Flight of the Snowbird!!!!"], ''11:22am 22 September 2010'' (accessed 15 October 2010) </ref>

The team hopes to find a home in a museum for the aircraft and have an entry in the [[Guiness Book of World Records]].<ref name=HPO-2010-09-22/>
