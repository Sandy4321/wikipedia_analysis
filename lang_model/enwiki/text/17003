The '''31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment''' (31 RQR) was a [[Australian Army Reserve|Reserve]] [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Australian Army]]. Although it was officially formed as 31 RQR in 1965 the battalion has a very long history, and can trace its lineage back to units formed in 1881 as part of the colonial defence forces of the state of [[Queensland]]. 

Over the course of the unit's 127 year history, the unit has largely been used for home service. During the [[Second Boer War]] members from the battalion went to South Africa as part of the Queensland contingent, for which the battalion received its first battle honour. In 1914 the battalion was the first Australian infantry unit mobilised for service during [[World War I]] when it was sent to garrison [[Thursday Island]] after fears of possible German military action in the Pacific. Later many members of the battalion enlisted in the AIF. During [[World War II]], the battalion was amalgamated with the [[Far North Queensland Regiment|51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment]], initially serving as garrison troops in Dutch New Guinea before taking an active part in the fighting against the Japanese in the Bougainville campaign in 1944&ndash;45.

After the war the battalion underwent a number of changes in organisation and designation before 1965 when it was redesignated as the 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment. Since then the battalion has formed part of the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th Brigade]]. In 1976 due to manpower shortages, the battalion was reduced to an independent rifle company before being re-raised as a full battalion again in 1986. 

In January 2008 the battalion was amalgamated with the [[42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment]] (42 RQR) to form the [[31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment]] (31/42 RQR).

==History==
===Formation===
31 RQR can trace its lineage back to units that were formed in Queensland in the mid to late 19th century.<ref name=11bde>{{cite web |title=11th Brigade History |publisher=Department of Defence |date= |url= http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/HQ11BDE/History1|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> Around this time Queensland was separated from [[New South Wales]] and when British forces were withdrawn from Australia in the 1870s there was a need for the state to take responsibility for its defence.<ref name=Jezzine>{{cite web |title=Jezzine Barracks Museum Proposal |publisher=North Australian Military Heritage Association |date=2008-11-30 |url= http://www.jezzinetrust.com.au/lib/pdf/081103%20Neil%20Weekes,%20Nth%20Aust.Military%20Heritage%20AssocProposal.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> In 1886 a number of Volunteer Independent Rifle Companies were raised at [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]], Townsville and [[Ravenswood, Queensland|Ravenswood]]. In 1886 these companies were brought together to form the 3rd Queensland (Kennedy) Regiment, consisting of a number of volunteer companies and partially paid militia based in the North Military Region with its headquarters and two rifle companies based in Townsville, and three more rifle companies in Charters Towers, Ravenswood and then later at Mackay.<ref name=11bde/>   

===Early 20th century===
1899 the battalion was reorganised and the company at Mackay was converted to a mounted infantry unit.<ref name=11bde/> At the same time the 3rd Queensland (Kennedy) Regiment was brought up to an establishment of six companies, one each at Townsville, Ravenshoe and Cairns and three more at Charters Towers collocated with the battalion headquarters.<ref name=Digger>{{cite web |title=31 RQR |publisher=Digger History |date= |url= http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-army-today/state-regts/31rqr.htm|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> At the same time Queensland raised a contingent to send to South Africa to contribute to the other Australian colonial forces being sent there to assist the British in fighting against the Boers. As a part of this force, many members of the 3rd Queensland (Kennedy) Regiment served as part of the first and second contingents of the [[Queensland Mounted Infantry]].<ref name=11bde/> Due to their contribution to the Boer War, the Kennedy Regiment received its first battle honour and was presented with the King's Banner.<ref name=11bde/>

In 1903 the Queensland Defence Force was disbanded and the colonial units were transferred to the Commonwealth Military Force under the control of the Federal government.<ref name=11bde/> At the same time the unit was reorganised as the 1st Battalion, Kennedy Regiment, with an establishment of four rifle companies. In 1912, with the establishment of a [[Conscription in Australia|national compulsory service scheme]] the establishment was raised to include six companies and the unit's designation was changed once again, this time to the 2nd Infantry Battalion, Kennedy Regiment.<ref name=Digger/>

===World War I===
With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Kennedy Regiment was the first Australian military unit mobilised when 500 men volunteered for overseas service and were sent to garrison Thursday Island due to concerns of German military action in the Pacific.<ref name=11bde/><ref name=Scott196198>Scott 1941, pp. 196<U+2013>198.</ref> This force then joined the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] for the invasion of German New Guinea, however, when the task force reached [[Port Moresby]], their commander, Colonel [[William Holmes (General)]] decided to leave them there as garrison troops as it was felt that they were not ready for combat.<ref name=Grey87>Grey 2008, p. 87.</ref>       

The detachment was subsequently sent back to Townsville and subsequently played no further part in the war as it was decided not to deploy the militia units overseas, but rather to raise a separate force for overseas service known as the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. Despite this, many members of the Kennedy Regiment enlisted in the AIF, most of them, including the battalion<U+2019>s commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Toll, joining the 31st Battalion which was raised at [[Enoggera Barracks|Enoggera]] in Brisbane as part of the [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Brigade]] in August 1915.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web |title=AWM Unit Information <U+2014> 31st Battalion, AIF, World War I|publisher=Australian War Memorial |date= |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11218.asp
|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref><ref name=11bde/> 

The 31st Battalion, AIF, was formed with two companies from Queensland and two companies from Victoria and concentrated at Broadmeadows in Victoria before departing from [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] in October 1915.<ref name=AWM/> Initially it was sent to [[Egypt]] where it was involved in the defence of the [[Suez Canal]] against the Turks, thus earning another battle honour <U+2014> Egypt 1915<U+2013>1917. In July 1916 the battalion arrived in [[France]] where its first involvement of war on the Western Front was the [[Battle of Fromelles]], during which it suffered over 500 casualties and was so badly mauled that it undertook no more offensive action for the rest of the year.<ref name=AWM/> In 1917 the battalion was involved in the Allied advance towards the [[Hindenburg Line]], although because it was employed in the flank protection role in this time, the only major fighting that it was involved in was at Polygon Wood during the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in the [[Ypres]] sector September 1917.<ref name=AWM/> It was here that Private [[Patrick Joseph Bugden]], an original member of the Kennedy Regiment, performed the actions that led to him receiving the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=Digger/><ref name=11bde/> 

Later, in August 1918, the 31st Battalion was involved in the last [[Hundred Days Offensive|Allied offensive of the war]] when it took part in the fighting that resulted in the capture of [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux |Villers Bretonneux]] and then [[Battle of Amiens|Bullecourt]].<ref name=Digger/> Later, in September, the battalion was involved in the attack on the [[Battle of St. Quentin Canal|St Quentin Canal]]. This proved to be their last involvement in the war as they were out of the line when the [[Armistice]] occurred on 11 November. The 31st Battalion, AIF, was disbanded in March 1919 whilst in France awaiting repatriation to Australia.<ref name=AWM/>

===Inter War Years===
In April 1921 the AIF was officially disbanded and the following month the militia was reformed to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of the AIF.<ref name=Grey125>Grey 2008, p. 125.</ref> Consequently the Kennedy Regiment was redesignated as the 31st Battalion (Kennedy Regiment) as part of the Citizens Military Force.<ref name=11bde/>

During the interwar years the battalion's area of responsibility and organisation underwent a number of changes. Due to the impact of the [[Great Depression]] and a general complacency towards matters relating to defence little was spent on the military and there were only a limited number of volunteers.<ref name=AWM2>{{cite web |title=AWM Unit Information <U+2014> 31st/51st Battalion (Kennedy and Far North Queensland Regiment), World War II|publisher=Australian War Memorial |date= |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11316.asp|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> As a result, by 1939, many of the battalion's subunits had been disbanded, although the unit managed to maintain its status as a battalion even though many other units were merged in this time.<ref name=11bde/>

===World War II===
Upon the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the 31st Battalion had subunits based all around northern Queensland including Townsville, Ayr, Home Hill, Bowen, Proserpine, Charters Towers and Ingham.<ref name=11bde/> As had been the case during World War I, it was decided to raise a separate force for overseas service, this time called the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] and once again many members of the battalion volunteered, whilst others continued to serve on a part time basis.<ref name=11bde/> In this time, as part of the 2nd AIF, the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] was raised, although this unit was considered separate from the 31st Battalion (Kennedy Regiment).<ref name=AWM3>{{cite web |title=AWM Unit Information <U+2014> 2/31st Battalion, AIF, World War II|publisher=Australian War Memorial |date= |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11282.asp
|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

In 1940 the battalion, along with the other units of the 11th Brigade <U+2014> then composed of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th]], 31st and 51st Battalions <U+2014> was called up for a short period of training as a compulsory military service scheme as part of Australia's mobilisation during World War II and they went into camp near [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]].<ref name=AWM2/> Following Japan's entry in to the war in late 1941 the militia were called up on to full time service and the 11th Brigade began defensive duties in north Queensland.<ref name=11bde/> In early 1943, however, it was decided to release a certain number of men serving in the militia from their compulsory service due to a civilian manpower shortage that was threatening to impact upon the needs of the wartime economy.<ref name=AWM2/> Consequently when a large number of rural workers were released from the 31st and 51st Battalions, it was decided to amalgamate the two in April 1943.<ref name=AWM2/>   

In June 1943, after undertaking amphibious training with the Americans, the 31st/51st Battalion (Kennedy and Far North Queensland Regiment) became a part of [[Merauke Force]] and were sent to Dutch [[Western New Guinea]] to carry out garrison duties, earning the distinction of being the first Australian militia unit to serve outside of Australian territory.{{note label|Note1|a|a}} In August 1944, after being deployed for over a year, the 31st/51st Battalion was withdrawn back to Australia where it became part of the AIF. After a period of leave and re-organisation, the 11th Brigade was deployed to [[Bougainville]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], arriving there in December 1944.<ref name=AWM2/>

For the next ten months until Japan's surrender the 31st/51st Battalion took part in a long and costly campaign and suffered a total of 229 casualties, including 61 killed in action.<ref name=AWM2/> Responsible for the northern and central sectors of the island, the battalion initially advanced along the north-east coast, occupying a number of villages, however they did not experience their first action until they crossed the Genga River and attempted to move up the Tsimba Ridge on 17 January 1944 that they came in contact with the Japanese.<ref name=AWM2/> The Japanese had dug in along the ridge and heavily fortified it with bunkers and mutually supporting machine gun pits and it was only after twenty-one days of continuous fighting that the 31st/51st finally carried the position.<ref name=AWM2/>

After this the battalion carried out a number of patrols throughout the northern sector, before being relieved for a rest out of the line. This rest did not last very long, however, as a company from the 31st/51st were called upon to carry out an amphibious landing at Porton, as the rest of the battalion advanced further north from the line that had been set up at Ratsua<U+2013>Ruri.<ref name=AWM2/> The landing occurred on 7 June, however, the company was quickly surrounded by the Japanese and as the rest of the battalion attempted to break through to them, they were  evacuated by sea.<ref name=AWM2/> This brief second campaign on Bougainville lasted until 28 June when the 11th Brigade was relieved by the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]]. During this time the 31st/51st had suffered 100 casualties, consisting of seven missing, 14 killed and 79 wounded.<ref name=AWM2/>

The battalion took no further part in the fighting and after the Japanese surrender the battalion was moved to [[Nauru]] and [[Ocean Island]] to carry out garrison duties where they remained until December 1945 when they were transferred to [[Rabaul]] on [[New Britain]].<ref name=11bde/><ref name=AWM2/> They remained there as an occupation force until May 1946 when the unit returned to Australia, where the 31st/51st Battalion (Kennedy and Far North Queensland Regiment) was disbanded on 4 July 1946.<ref name=AWM2/>   

For their involvement during World War II, members of the 31st/51st Battalion received 43 decorations, including: 1 [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], 1 [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]], 3 [[Military Cross|MCs]], 10 [[Military Medal|MMs]], 1 [[British Empire Medal|BEM]] and 27 [[Mention in Dispatches|MIDs]].<ref name=AWM2/>

===Post World War II===
After World War II the militia units were re-formed as part of the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and subsequently the battalion was re-raised, this time as the 31st Battalion, North Queensland Regiment.<ref name=11bde/> In 1960 this designation was changed once again when it was decided to introduce the [[Pentropic organisation]] into the Australian Army, a part of which required the reorganisation of the regionally-based CMF battalions into six State based regiments.<ref name=Grey227228>Grey 2008, pp. 227<U+2013>228.</ref> As a result of this the battalion became the 2nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment.<ref name=11bde/> In 1965 the Australian Army moved away from the Pentropic organisation and returned to the previous establishment and it was decided to return to the CMF battalions to their previous numerical designations.<ref name=Grey239>Grey 2008, p. 239.</ref> This saw the battalion finally become the 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment.<ref name=11bde/>  

During this time the battalion's numbers fluctuated as [[national service]] was suspended in 1960, reintroduced in 1965 and then finally abolished in late 1972. Finally the strength of the unit declined to the extent that it was reduced to a company sized element and was subsequently renamed as the 31st Independent Rifle Company in 1976.<ref name=11bde/> On 30 October 1986 the unit regained battalion status and it was reformed once more as the 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment.<ref name=11bde/>  

In 2006 the decision was made to re-organise the Brisbane-based [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]] to make it a fully Regular unit. Subsequently the two Reserve infantry battalions based at Enoggera, the [[9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|9th]] and [[25th/49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|25th/49th Battalions, Royal Queensland Regiment]], were re-allocated to the 11th Brigade in July 2007. As a result of this, it was decided to amalgamate the two existing battalions of the 11th Brigade, so that the brigade in order to maintain the traditional three battalion structure. As such, on 1 January 2008, 31 RQR was amalgamated with 42 RQR to form the 31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment.<ref name=11bde/>

==Battle honours==
The 31st Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, received 47 battle honours. The first battle honour of South Africa 1899<U+2013>1902 was bestowed upon the Regiment due to the involvement of many men from the Kennedy Regiment in the first and second contingents of the Queensland Mounted Infantry.<ref name=11bde/> During World War I, the 31st Battalion, AIF, received 19 battle honours, which were later passed to the 31st Battalion when it was re-raised as a militia battalion in 1921.{{note label|Note2|b|b}}<ref name=11bde/> The 31st/51st Battalion earned five battle honours during World War II, whilst the 2/31st Battalion earned another 22, which were later passed to the Kennedy Regiment in 1948.{{note label|Note3|c|c}}<ref name=11bde/>

==Notes==
===Footnotes===
*{{note label|Note1|a|a}} Due to provisions of the ''Defence Act 1903'' the government was not allowed to send militia units outside of Australian territory, which at the time included New Guinea as it had become an Australian mandated territory following the end of World War I. This was later changed, by the '' [[Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943]] '' to allow militia units to be serve throughout the South West Pacific Area.
*{{note label|Note2|b|b}} The 31st Battalion receive 19 battle honours for its involvement in World War I, however, in actuality the battalion only received 17 distinct honours, as they were awarded duplicate honours for Hindenburg and St Quentin due to the battalions involvement in multiple actions in these battles. 
*{{note label|Note3|c|c}} Of the 22 battle honours earned by the 2/31st Battalion, one (Liberation of Australian New Guinea) was a battle honour that the 31st/51st had also earned, hence the discrepancy.
