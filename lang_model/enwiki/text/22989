'''''The Boy with the Leaking Boot''''' (sometimes known as '''''The Boy with the Leaky Boot''''') is a statue showing a young boy, with a bare right foot, holding up his right boot and looking at it.  The statue is about {{convert|4|ft}} tall, and in many cases forms a fountain, with water emerging from the toe of the boot. There are at least 24,<ref name=roadside>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/boot.html|title=The boy and the Boot|work=RoadsideAmerica.com|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> and reportedly "hundreds"<ref name="shawangunk">{{cite web|url=http://www.gunkguide.com/09Nov/09034-boot.html|title=That Mysterious Boy with the Boot|last=Rubin|first=Brian|date=November 2009|work=Shawangunk Mountain Guide|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> of examples.  The origins of the statue are obscure.  The boy is reported to be a young [[Italy|Italian]] newspaper seller who drowned, or an American army drummer-boy who carried water in his leaking boot to help fallen comrades,<ref name=piebirds>{{cite web|url=http://www.piebirds.co.uk/Leaking%20Boot.htm|title=Leaking Boot|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> or a young fire-fighter either using his boot in a [[Bucket brigade|bucket chain]] or emptying his boot after an incident,<ref name=shawangunk /> or possibly none of these.   The statue has also been called '''''Boy Immigrant''''' and '''''Unfortunate Boot'''''.<ref name=ellenville />

== Statues ==
Among the earliest statues is that in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], [[Ohio]], United States, where it stood in front of the Porter House hotel on the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. The original zinc statue was brought from Germany in 1876 by a prominent local couple, Mr and Mrs Voltaire Scott.  After cyclone damage and vandalism the statue was moved to the lobby of the local City Hall, and a replacement bronze was installed in a fountain in Washington Park.<ref name="roadside"/>

In [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], [[Montana]], United States, a statue stood in front of the "Natatorium", built in 1889 and housing the then largest indoor plunge pool in the world, as part of the Broadwater Hotel complex. The statue is now in the former First National Bank Building on Last Chance Gulch in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifelikecharm.com/Broadwater_today.htm|title=The Broadwater today|work=The Hotel Broadwater and natatorium|accessdate=2009-07-15}} - includes images c.1890 and recent</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifelikecharm.com/Broadwater_natatorium.htm|title=The Natatorium|work=The Broadwater Hotel and natatorium|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref>

One of the statues was erected in Courthouse Park [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], United States in 1895. It was a drinking fountain, funded by public subscription organised by Sergeant Nichols of the [[Salvation Army]].  Tin cups hung from the statue, and the pipes were cooled by blocks of ice. The statue was purchased from the [[J. L. Mott Iron Works]] of New York. The statue was moved, vandalised and repaired on various occasions, recast in bronze in 1947, and again recast in 1995. It is currently in the Fresno County Plaza on Tulare Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rehart|first=Catherine Morison|title=The Valley's Legends & Legacies|publisher=Quill Driver Books|year=1996|pages=28|chapter=The Boy with the Leaking Boot|isbn=978-1-884995-12-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cCpk_P3d-h0C&dq=boy+with+leaking+boot&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>

The statue erected in 1895 in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]], [[Wisconsin]], United States, had a similarly chequered existence, being damaged by a horse-drawn vehicle in 1910 and thereafter cared for by the local fire department, outside whose station he stood with various incidents of damage and restoration including being decapitated in 1998 (the head was handed in to the police three days later).  A concrete casting of the statue was made and erected in 2009. The original statue, restored, was in 2010 still in the possession of the fire department and it was reported that "An idea which seems to be gathering support is to install him in a glass case inside Fire Station #1."<ref name="stevens">{{cite web|url=http://ci.stevens-point.wi.us/fire/boy_w_boot.html|title=Fire Department Boy With The Boot Statue|work=City of Stevens Point:, Wisconsin|accessdate=2010-08-26 | date=15 March 2010 | last=Menzel | first=Dan}}</ref>  

A statue in [[Assiniboine Park]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada was originally donated to the city by the Young Peoples<U+2019> Christian Endeavour Society and the Trades and Labour Council in honour of [[Queen Victoria]]'s golden jubilee in 1897.   It formed part of a fountain outside the old city hall, and was moved to the park in 1953 with funding from [[Rotary International|Order of Rotary International Fellowship]].<ref name=piebirds />

A statue of the boy highlights a fountain on Main Street and School Street in [[Wallingford, Vermont|Wallingford]], [[Vermont]], United States, and has been a centerpiece in the town since 1898.<ref name="roadside"/> 

There have been five statues in five different locations in [[New Orleans]], United States, since 1898 when the first was erected at the Milliken Children's Hospital of Charity. The boot, all that remained after this statue was vandalised in 1961, is reported to grace the present day hospital administrator's desk.  The latest statue stands in a pool at the Children's Hospital.<ref name="stall">{{cite book|last=Stall|first=Buddy|title=Buddy Stall's New Orleans|year=1990|publisher=Pelican Publishing|pages=145<U+2013>147|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b0_gRpiHCXQC&lpg=PP1&vq=145&dq=boy%20boot%20statue&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q=unfortunate%20boot&f=false|chapter=Statuary: Unfortunate Boot |coauthors=Gaspar Stall|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref>

The village of [[Ellenville, New York|Ellenville]], [[Wawarsing, New York|Wawarsing]], [[New York]], United States, claims to have three of these statues: a 1997 model in the village's Liberty Square, a statue purchased in 1925 now in the Public Library, and one presumed to date from before 1908 and currently awaiting restoration.  This last statue was made by [[J. L. Mott Iron Works]] and was erected on the lawn of the house then occupied by Henry Brodhead, who was paymaster for the Mott Iron Works until the company moved from New York to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in 1908.  It was used by sculptor Matt Pozorski when creating the 1997 version.<ref name=ellenville>{{cite web|url=http://www.wawarsing.net/01/COPDF/18-19-Boyboot.pdf|title=The Boy With The Boot|last=Dumond|first=Marion M.|date=December 2002|work=Wawarsing.net|pages=18<U+2013>19|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> The statue is described as "an important icon of Ellenville".<ref name=shawangunk />

In [[Penrose, Colorado|Penrose]], [[Colorado]], United States, a bronze statue was erected in 1915, presented to the town by Spencer and Julie Penrose.

It is the property of the Senior Citizens of Penrose.<ref name="Penrose">{{cite web|title=The Boy With the Boot|url=http://www.penrosechamber.com/LocalInformation/History/TheBoywiththeBoot.aspx|work=Penrose Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref>

A statue was erected at High Point Mansion, [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States, then the home of [[Milton S.
