He enrolled at Albany Teachers College upon graduation (now known as [[University at Albany, The State University of New York|University at Albany, SUNY]]), and studied to become a social studies or English teacher. After two years in college Gould enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]], during [[World War II]], and saw combat in [[France]] in a [[chemical mortar battalion|mortar company]]. <ref name="albany"/> He developed [[trenchfoot]], and was sent to England to recover. After convalescence, Gould served in a [[rail transport]] unit in France. <ref name="what"> [http://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=982796220 Harold Gould], What A Character!.

After the war, Gould returned to Albany Teachers College to study drama, and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1947. <ref name="filmbug">[http://www.filmbug.com/db/292690  Harold Gould @ Filmbug], Misja.com, retrieved on 2006-08-13.</ref> He performed in [[summer stock theatre]] on [[Cape Cod]], then decided to enroll at [[Cornell University]] to study drama and speech. Gould earned a master of arts degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. in theatre in 1953 from Cornell, and also met his future wife, Lea Vernon.

==Early career==
Upon graduation, Gould accepted a position at [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], and spent three years there teaching and doing stage work.  <ref name="what"/> He made his professional theatre debut in 1955 as [[Thomas Jefferson]] in ''The Common Glory'' in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. <ref name="yahoo"> [http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800012754/bio Harold Gould biography], Yahoo! Movies. Retrieved on 2006-08-13.</ref> 

In 1956, Gould was offered a professorship in the drama department at the [[University of California, Riverside]], <ref name="filmbug"/>, which he accepted. He taught there until 1960, when he decided to try professional acting himself. <ref name="what"/> He had difficulty finding acting jobs at first, and had to take work as a security guard and as a part-time acting teacher at [[UCLA]]. <ref name="albany"/> Gould made his film debut in ''Two for the Seesaw'' but was not credited for his work; his first credited role was a small part in ''The Coach'' in 1962. He gradually found more work and got roles in'' [[The Yellow Canary]]'', a [[Rod Serling]] movie with [[Pat Boone]], [[Jack Klugman]], and [[Barbara Eden]],  ''[[The Satan Bug]]'', ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'', and ''[[Harper]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]]. 

Gould had steady work in television in the 1960s and early 1970s, including roles in ''[[Dennis the Menace (TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'', ''[[The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''.  Gould originated the role of [[Marlo Thomas]]'s father Lou, in the 1965 pilot for ''[[That Girl]]'', but the series role went to Lew Parker.<ref name="IMDb"> Ray Hamel, [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332390/ Biography for Harold Gould].

When [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] turned that episode into a series called ''[[Happy Days]]'', Gould was unavailable, and the series role went to [[Tom Bosley]]. <ref name="NYT" > Hal Erickson, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=27975&mod=bio Harold Gould biography].

==Character actor==
Gould had worked in television and film for almost 15 years before his career really took off with his portrayal of Kid Twist in ''[[The Sting]]''. Twist's dignified, dapper appearance and manner put Gould into the ranks of memorable [[character actor]]s, but he did not seem to be [[typecast]] and never lacked for work. He had parts in the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Love and Death]]'', as a villain in ''[[Silent Movie]]'', (directed by [[Mel Brooks]]), and made guest appearances on television shows such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Soap]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. 

In 1972, Gould was cast as Martin Morganstern, the father of Mary's best friend Rhoda, in an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. He reprised the role the following year and was hired as a regular when ''[[Rhoda]]'' was made into a [[spin-off]] in 1974. After ''Rhoda'' ended, Gould appeared in short-lived series such as ''[[The Feather and Father Gang]]'' and ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]''. In the 1980 NBC miniseries ''[[Moviola]]'', he portrayed [[Louis B. Mayer]] and earned an [[Emmy]] nomination. He appeared as [[Chad Lowe]]'s grandfather in ''[[Spencer]]'', and played a Jewish widower wooing the Christian [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry]]''. Other interesting roles included a married man having an affair with another member of his [[Yiddish|Yiddish-speaking]] club in an episode of the [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]] series ''The Sunset Years'', and as the owner of a deli grooming two African-American men to inherit his business in ''[[Singer & Sons]]''. <ref name="yahoo"/> Gould received [[Emmy award|Emmy]] nominations for his roles in ''Rhoda'', ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'', and ''Moviola''. Gould also played Miles Webber, the steadfast boyfriend of [[Rose Nylund]] ([[Betty White]]) on the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' (he also played a different boyfriend of Rose's in the show's first season). 

Gould's stage credits include [[Broadway theatre]] plays such as [[Jules Feiffer]]'s ''Grown Ups'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Fools (play)|Fools]]'', Richard Baer's ''Mixed Emotions'', and [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''Artist Descending a Staircase''. Gould won an [[Obie Award]] in 1969 for his work in ''The Increased Difficulty of Concentration'', written by [[Vaclav Havel]], and reprised the role for a 1988 PBS version of the play. <ref name="albany"/>
