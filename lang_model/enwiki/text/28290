'''Volume 2''' of ''The X-Files Mythology'' collection is the second DVD release containing selected episodes from the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third]] to the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth]] seasons of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episodes collected in the release form the middle of the series' [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], and are centered on the discovery of a mind-altering extraterrestrial "[[Colonist (The X-Files)#Black oil|black oil]]".

The collection contains five episodes from the third season, eight from the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]], and two from the fifth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or X-Files, by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the assassination of a secretive informant, Scully's diagnosis with cancer and Mulder's apparent suicide.

Production for many of the episode's included in the collection required extensive effects. The titular black oil's on-screen appearance was achieved through visual effects; the shimmering oil effect was digitally placed over the actors' corneas in post-production.  [[Steven Williams]], [[William B. Davis]], [[Mitch Pileggi]] and [[Laurie Holden]] all play supporting roles in the collection. Released on  August 2, 2005, the collection received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot summary==

The collection opens with the two-part episodes "[[Nisei (The X-Files)|Nisei]]" and "[[731 (The X-Files)|731]]". Investigating evidence of an [[alien autopsy]], FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien-human hybrid. Mulder is almost killed by a [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant [[X (The X-Files)|X]] ([[Steven Williams]]). X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by the agent's partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to [[Ascension (The X-Files)|her own]], and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the [[List of The X-Files characters#First Elder|First Elder]] ([[Don S. Williams]]), who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.<ref name="nisei">{{cite episode| episodelink=Nisei (The X-Files) | title=Nisei| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 9 |airdate=November 24, 1995}}</ref><ref name="seventhreeone">{{cite episode| episodelink=731 (The X-Files) | title=731 | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[David Nutter]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Howard Gordon]]  [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 10 |airdate=December 1, 1995}}</ref><ref>Lovece, pp.204<U+2013>208</ref>

The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a Word War II-era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns<U+2014>except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic [[Colonist (The X-Files)#Black oil|black oil]] discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken [[Alex Krycek]] ([[Nicholas Lea]]), who Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down [[Luis Cardinal]], the man responsible for killing [[Melissa Scully|her sister]].<ref name="piper">{{cite episode| title=[[Piper Maru]] | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 15 |airdate=February 9, 1996}}</ref><ref name="apocrypha">{{cite episode| episodelink=Apocrypha (The X-Files) | title=Apocrypha| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 16 |airdate=February 16, 1996}}</ref><ref>Lovece, pp.211<U+2013>212</ref>

When the Syndicate suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organise a [[canary trap]] to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait.

==Background==

During the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] the black oil was introduced, an alien entity that invaded bodies and made them into living hosts. The black oil was able to enter through a victim's mouth, eyes or nose; it would leave a victim's body to revert to its original form or find a new host. The oil is revealed to be a tool used by the [[Colonist (The X-Files)|Colonists]], brought to Earth by meteorites to create hosts of the human population living there. The [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]] episodes "[[Tunguska (The X-Files)|Tunguska]]" and "[[Terma (The X-Files)|Terma]]" were conceived by the writers when they were trying to conceive a "big and fun canvas" to tell stories. They decided to create a story which had connections to the Russian [[gulag]]s, which led to the "natural" idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the black oil. Writer [[John Shiban]] felt it was natural creating an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being that the [[Cold War]] had ended a few years earlier.<ref name="Threadsof">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], Dave Gauthier, [[Howard Gordon]], [[Kim Manners]], [[John Shiban]] and [[Frank Spotnitz]] |date=2005 |title=Threads of Mythology |medium= DVD |work=The X-Files Mythology, Volume 2 <U+2013> Black Oil |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]}}</ref> The inspiration for the oil-containing rocks was [[NASA]]'s announcement of possible evidence of extraterrestrial life in the [[Allan Hills 84001]] meteorite; while the gulag scenes were based on [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s books ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' and ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''<ref name="prod3">Meisler (1998), p.102</ref>

The on-screen appearance of the black oil was achieved through visual effects; the shimmering oil effect was digitally placed over the actors' corneas in post-production. The crew went through various iterations to find the two "right" types of fluids. According to physical effects crewman David Gauthier, they used a mix of oil and [[acetone]], which he believed gave the substance a more globular look.<ref name="Threadsof"/> During the filming of "Apocrypha", Nicholas Lea was fitted with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene was horrible, and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later.<ref name="prod1"/> A similar scene from the start of the episode with the submarine captain was accomplished using a dummy head.<ref name="prod1">Lowry, pp.171<U+2013>172</ref>

The decision to have the character of X killed off in "Herrenvolk" was made at the end of the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]]. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Mulder.<ref name="Prod2">Meisler (1998), pp.25<U+2013>27</ref> The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]]. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal.<ref name="prod1">Meisler (1998), p. 164</ref> Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as "a cheap TV thing". However, [[Frank Spotnitz]] felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an "obligatory" move to have Scully follow suit.<ref>{{cite video|title=Introduction to Memento Mori |work=The X-Files: Essentials |titleyear=2008 |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (narrators) |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref>

==Reception==

Released on August 2, 2005, the collection has received generally positive reviews from critics. [[Slant Magazine]]'s Keith Uhlich rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that there is "an unabashed confidence to these episodes", although this "comes with something of a price as the thrill and surprise of season two mythology stories like "Colony" and "End Game" are replaced by a nagging suspicion that the writers are starting to tread water". Uhlich singles out "Talitha Cumi" as the collection's highlight, calling it "an overall mindblower".<ref name="slantrev">{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/the-x-files-mythology-black-oil/716 |title=The X-Files Mythology: Black Oil {{!}} DVD Review |first=Keith |last=Uhlich |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=August 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> Writing for [[DVD Talk]], Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, calling it "highly recommended". However, he felt that the cohesion between the episodes was lacking somewhat, and that the two-part episodes "Tempus Fugit" and "Max" did not add much to the overall storyline.<ref name="dvdtalkrev">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17194/x-files-mythology-vol-2-black-oil-the/?___rd=1 |title=The X-Files Mythology, Vol. 2 <U+2013> Black Oil: DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |first=Jeffrey |last=Robinson |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |date=August 14, 2005 |accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Exclaim!]]''{{'s}} Monica S. Kuebler, on the other hand,  felt negatively about the collection. She too felt that the interrupted nature of the episodes caused a lack of "believable" pacing, and noted that the release "feels like a blatant cash grab by Fox to milk an old franchise while they still can".<ref name="exclaim">{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Dvd/x-files_black_oil-x-files_black_oil |title=The X-Files: Black Oil<U+00B7> DVD Reviews |publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]'' |first=Monica S. |last=Kuebler |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |date=September 2005}}</ref>
