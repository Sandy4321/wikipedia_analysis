'''Roberto Mart<U+00ED>nez Montoli<U+00FA>''' (born 13 July 1973) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] former [[Association football|footballer]] who is the current [[manager (association football)|manager]] of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].

Mart<U+00ED>nez played as a [[defensive midfielder]] and began his career at lower league Spanish side [[CF Balaguer]]. Two years later he signed for [[Football League Third Division|English Third Division]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Becoming part of a small Spanish contingent at the club known as "the three amigos" <U+2013> alongside [[Jes<U+00FA>s Seba]] and [[Isidro D<U+00ED>az]] <U+2013> he was a regular first team player for six years, the longest period of time he spent at one club. In 2001, he moved to Scottish side [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on a free transfer, but he was unable to break into the first team. He switched clubs the following year, this time to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], but again he played infrequently. This prompted a move to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 2003, where he was selected as club captain and helped the Welsh side to avoid relegation from the [[Football League]]. He was an important part of the team from 2003 to 2006, making 123 league appearances and captaining them to promotion to [[Football League One|League One]] in 2005. He moved to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 2006, and was again chosen to be captain.

In 2007, Swansea contacted Mart<U+00ED>nez to offer him the position of manager. He accepted the offer and retired from playing, soon bringing success to Swansea. He won the [[LMA Manager of the Year|League One Manager of the Year Award]] in his first season as Swansea were crowned [[Football League One|League One Champions]], which took the club back to [[Football League Championship|England's second-tier division]] after a 24-year absence. Mart<U+00ED>nez became the manager of [[Premier League]] side Wigan Athletic in June 2009, who he helped successfully avoid relegation for three seasons in a row.

==Early life==
Born in [[Balaguer]], Mart<U+00ED>nez began his career at his home-town club [[CF Balaguer]] in the [[Spanish Third Division]], playing his first competitive game for the club's youth team when he was nine years old. He played at every level of youth football for the club before moving to [[Real Zaragoza]] at the age of 16.<ref name="learning">{{cite news

===Swansea City===
With Mart<U+00ED>nez in charge, Swansea lost just once in 11 games, giving them a chance of clinching a play-off place on the final day of the [[2006|2006<U+2013>07 season]], but missed out following a 6<U+2013>3 defeat at home against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].<ref>{{cite news

He was also nominated for the February prize but lost out to [[John Ward (footballer)|John Ward]], manager of [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]. In April 2008, Mart<U+00ED>nez signed a new contract with Swansea as the club became [[Football League One|League One Champions]], securing promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], and in May 2008, he was awarded the [[LMA Manager of the Year|League One Manager of the Year Award]] for leading Swansea to the title.<ref>{{cite news

The [[2008|2008<U+2013>09 season]] saw Mart<U+00ED>nez preside over Swansea's first game in [[English football league system#Structure|England's second-tier division]] in 24 years, which began poorly with a 2<U+2013>0 defeat away at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Subsequently, Swansea's form improved and they lost only 4 games out of the next 30, including a number of key league victories against opponents such as [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Mart<U+00ED>nez also guided his team to a 2<U+2013>0 [[FA Cup]] win against [[Premier League]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], who were the defending cup holders.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7842637.stm Portsmouth 0<U+2013>2 Swansea] BBC Sport, 24 January 2009; Retrieved 30 January 2009</ref>

Throughout his time at Swansea, Mart<U+00ED>nez was often linked with other managerial jobs, but he repeatedly stated that he would only leave Swansea as manager if he was "forced out".<ref>{{cite news

===Wigan Athletic===
Mart<U+00ED>nez's move to Wigan was not without controversy. Many Swansea fans were upset that he had chosen to leave the club despite his previous comments that he would have to be "forced out" to leave the club, and he was subsequently nicknamed "[[Judas Iscariot|El Judas]]" by some fans.<ref name="walesonline1">{{cite web | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2009/06/18/roberto-martinez-is-the-fallen-hero-with-swansea-city-fans-91466-23907412/ | title=Roberto Martinez is the fallen hero with Swansea City fans | publisher=WalesOnline |date= | accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=eljudas>{{cite web | url=http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2010/10/26/Wigan-v-Swansea/gnid-79856/ | title='El Judas' has the last laugh | publisher=Setanta Sports | date=26 October 2010 | accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref> Mart<U+00ED>nez explained that his decision had been a difficult one to make, but felt the opportunity to manage in the [[Premier League]] at the club where he began his English footballing career was too good to turn down.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/8103690.stm | title=Martinez pleads for forgiveness | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 June 2009 | accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref> His first league game as Wigan manager was an away fixture against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 15 August 2009.

However, in his first home game, the team slumped to a 1<U+2013>0 defeat to newly-promoted [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], and this was followed by a 5<U+2013>0 defeat against [[Manchester United]], despite being 0<U+2013>0 at half time. This inconsistency set the tone for Mart<U+00ED>nez's first season in charge, with home wins against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], but also a series of heavy defeats. This included a 9<U+2013>1 defeat away to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 22 November 2009, a club record defeat for Wigan, and the first time that a Premier League side had scored nine goals in a single match since [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 9<U+2013>0 in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8365091.stm|title=Tottenham   9 <U+2013> 1   Wigan|accessdate=23 November 2009|date=22 November 2009 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref> On the final day of the season Wigan suffered another heavy defeat losing 8<U+2013>0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], a result which gave their opponents the [[2009-10 Premier League|Premier League]] title.

After a good start to the [[2011<U+2013>12 Premier League|2011<U+2013>12]] campaign, Wigan suffered eight straight defeats to leave them at the bottom of the league.<ref name=MOTM0412/> Between August and February, Wigan won a mere four games, leading to predictions that relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] would be inevitable for Wigan.<ref name=MOTM0412>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2012/05/04/3080679/roberto-martinez-wins-barclays-manager-of-the-month-for|title=Roberto Martinez made Manager of the Month|accessdate=25 May 2012 |date=4 May 2012|publisher=Goal.com}}</ref> However, as the end of the season approached, Wigan's form improved dramatically as they recorded wins against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] among others.

On 17 May 2012, Wigan Chairman [[Dave Whelan]] confirmed that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] had been given permission to discuss their managerial vacancy with Mart<U+00ED>nez.
