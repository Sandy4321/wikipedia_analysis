The '''3<sup>rd</sup> Battalion''' of the Royal Canadian Regiment is, in most regards one of the most active service units in the Canadian military. It has been an active participant in almost every engagement that Canadian armed forces have been committed to. 3RCR distinguished itself when making the first push into Afghanistan on the first rotation in-theater. After seeing the unit in the reconstitution phase of the army training operations framework cycle, it was prepared once again for deployment. It was assigned the designation: TF 3-06 (Task Force 3, rotation 6.), and was prepared for Battle group deployment. They were deployed in September 2007. The current deployment is set for Spring 2009.
