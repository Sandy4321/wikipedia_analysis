'''Season 2009&ndash;10''' for [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] will be their eleventh consecutive season of play in the [[Scottish Premier League]]. The SPL season began on 15 August 2009, with a 2&ndash;1 win against [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] at [[Easter Road|home]]. Hibs will also compete in the [[Scottish Cup 2009&ndash;10|Scottish Cup]], but were knocked out of the [[Scottish League Cup 2009&ndash;10|Scottish League Cup]] in the third round by [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]].

Hibs also lost their only pre-season game at [[Easter Road]], 3&ndash;1 against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 1 August. The game was a rematch of sorts for a match played in 1887 dubbed the ''Championship of the World'' by [[the Football Association]] and the [[Scottish Football Association]], as both clubs had won their respective national cup competitions that year.<ref>[http://www.hibs.co.uk/news/more.php?id=3472_0_1_0_C World Championship Re-Match], [[Hibernian F.C.]] official website.</ref>

== Scottish Premier League ==
Hibs began the [[Scottish Premier League 2009&ndash;10|2009&ndash;10 league season]] with a 2&ndash;1 win against [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]], who had [[Steven Thomson]] sent off early in the match.<ref name = "stm21"/> Although Hibs conceded the first goal due to a series of defensive errors, [[David Wotherspoon]] scored a quick equaliser on his senior debut and [[Abdessalam Benjelloun]] scored a late winner.<ref name = "stm21">[http://www.sundayherald.com/sport/shfootball/display.var.2525711.0.capital_gains_for_happy_hughes.php Capital gains for happy Hughes], ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', 16 August 2009.</ref> Inconsistent form in the early part of the season saw Hibs win their first two games, lose the next two, but then win the following two league matches.<ref name = "een early">[http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Motherwell-13-Hibs-First-goal.5683467.jp Motherwell 1&ndash;3 Hibs: First goal for Hughes is hard work], ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 28 September 2009.</ref> These results put Hibs tied with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on points for second place in the league, but manager [[John Hughes (footballer born 1964)|John Hughes]] commented that it would be a position that Hibs would be unlikely to hold for the rest of the season.<ref name = "een early"/> Hughes put this inconsistency down to the team's failure to work hard enough in the games they had lost.<ref name = "een early"/>

Four points from the two following home games against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] left Hibs clear in third place, just behind the [[Old Firm]], after 8 games. Poor performances by the Old Firm, particularly in [[UEFA|European competition]], led some writers to comment that there was an opportunity for Hibs to challenge the Old Firm in a way not seen since the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]]'s success in the 1980s.<ref>[http://sport.stv.tv/football/131719-hibs-must-seize-the-initiative-against-weak-old-firm/ Hibs must seize the initiative against weak Old Firm], [[stv]], 21 October 2009.</ref> John Hughes again tried to play down these expectations, stating that Hibs were "miles away" from challenging the Old Firm.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/8321266.stm Hibs have long way to go - Hughes], [[BBC Sport]], 22 October 2009.</ref>

==Transfers==
Hibs' first significant move in the close season was to part company with manager [[Mixu Paatelainen]], becoming the third [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] club to change manager in the space of a week.<ref name = "mixu">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/8074794.stm Paatelainen parts with Hibernian], [[BBC Sport]], 29 May 2009.</ref> [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] manager [[John Hughes (footballer born 1964)|John Hughes]] was immediately linked with the vacancy,<ref name = "mixu"/> and he was appointed Hibs manager 10 days later.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/8089954.stm Hughes appointed Hibernian boss], [[BBC Sport]], 8 June 2009.</ref>

Paatelainen had already begun making changes to the squad for the new season before he left, by releasing [[Fabi<U+00E1>n Yantorno]], [[Damon Gray]] and [[Andrew McNeil]].<ref name = "Hibs release"/><ref name = "released by Hibs"/> [[Grzegorz Szamotulski]]'s departure under free agency meant that Hughes needed to sign a new goalkeeper,<ref name = "released by Hibs"/> which he addressed by signing [[Graham Stack (footballer)|Graham Stack]]. Paatelainen had also done much of the work leading to the signing of [[Danny Galbraith]], which Hughes completed after he was appointed.<ref name = "aob"/>

There were two significant departures early in the summer, with Scotland international [[Steven Fletcher (footballer)|Steven Fletcher]] moving to newly promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and club captain [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1979)|Rob Jones]] signing for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].<ref name = "guardian">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/aug/28/hibernian-john-hughes-anthony-stokes John Hughes' resurgent Hibernian face early test from Celtic], ''[[The Guardian]]'' Sport Blog.</ref> Both buying clubs broke their transfer fee record to secure their services.<ref name = "jones"/><ref name = "fletcher"/>

Hughes went back to his former club to sign [[midfielder]]s [[Patrick Cregg]] and [[Kevin McBride (footballer)|Kevin McBride]], with Cregg being his first signing as Hibs manager.<ref name = "cregg"/><ref name = "mcbride"/> Towards the end of the window, he made the "notable" signing of [[Anthony Stokes]], with the move going against a trend of SPL players moving to English clubs.<ref name = "guardian"/> Stokes had previously enjoyed a successful loan spell at Falkirk, where Hughes had also been his manager.
