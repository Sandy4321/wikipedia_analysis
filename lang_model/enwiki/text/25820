[[Cricket (sport)|Cricket]] is a global [[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball]] team [[sport]] that originated in England and is now played in more than 100 countries.  A cricket match is contested by two teams, usually of eleven players each.    

Cricket is essentially an outdoor sport, certainly at major level, and some games are played under floodlights.  It cannot be played in poor weather due to the risk of accidents and so it is a seasonal sport.  For example, it is played during the summer months in Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  Paradoxically, it is played during the winter months in the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to escape the hurricane and monsoon seasons.

Governance rests primarily with the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) which organises the sport worldwide via the domestic controlling bodies of the member countries.  The ICC administers both men's and [[women's cricket]], both versions being played at international level.  Although men cannot play [[women's cricket]], the rules do not disqualify women from playing in a men's team.

==The game of cricket and its objectives==
A cricket match is played between two teams (or sides) of eleven players each on a field of variable size and shape.  Field diameters of 140-160 yards are usual.  The perimeter of the field is known as the "boundary" and this is sometimes marked by a rope that encircles the outer edge of the field with spectator seating beyond.  The field may be round, square or oval &ndash; one of cricket's most famous venues is called [[The Oval]].   

In simple terms, the object of each team is to score more "runs" than the other team and so win the game.  However, in certain types of cricket, it is also necessary to completely "dismiss" the other team in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn.  

The key action takes place in a specially prepared area of the field (generally in the centre) that is called the "pitch".  At either end of the pitch, 22 yards apart, are placed the "wickets".  These serve as a target for the "bowling" ''aka'' "fielding" side and are defended by the "batting" side which seeks to accumulate runs.  Basically, a run is scored when the "batsman" has literally run the length of the pitch after hitting the ball with his bat, although as explained below there are many ways of scoring runs.

The bowling side seeks to dismiss the batsmen by various means until the batting side is "all out", whereupon the side that was bowling takes its turn to bat and the side that was batting must "take the field".  

In normal circumstances, there are 15 people on the field while a match is in play.  Two of these are the "umpires" who regulate all on-field activity.  Two are the batsmen, one of whom is the "striker" as he is facing the bowling; the other is called the "non-striker".  The roles of the batsmen are interchangeable as runs are scored and "overs" are completed.  The fielding side has all 11 players on the field together.  One of them is the "bowler", another is the "wicketkeeper" and the other nine are called "fielders".  The wicketkeeper (or keeper) is nearly always a specialist but any of the fielders can be called upon to bowl.  

Before play commences, the two captains toss a coin to decide which team shall bat or bowl first.  The captain who wins the toss makes his decision on the basis of tactical considerations including the current and expected pitch and weather conditions.  Tactics play a much greater part in cricket than in most other sports.

===Pitch, wickets and creases===
The pitch is 22 yards long between the wickets and is 10 feet wide.  It is a flat surface and has very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses.  The "condition" of the pitch has a significant bearing on the match and team tactics are always determined with the state of the pitch, both current and anticipated, as a deciding factor.

Each wicket consists of three wooden stumps placed in a straight line and surmounted by two wooden bails; the total height of the wicket including bails is 28.5 inches and the combined width of the three stumps is 9 inches.  

Four lines (''aka'' creases) are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's "safe territory" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach.  These are called the "popping" (or batting) crease, the bowling crease and two "return" creases.  

The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these must be 22 yards apart.  A bowling crease is 8 feet 8 inches long with the middle stump placed dead centre.  The popping crease has the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is four feet in front of the wicket.  The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least eight feet.

When bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his "delivery stride" must land within the two return creases while his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease.  If he breaks this rule, the umpire calls "No ball".

The batsman uses the popping crease at his end to stand when facing the bowler but it is more important to him that because it marks the limit of his safe territory and he can be stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is "out of his ground".

===Bat and ball===
The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the "batsman" who, armed with a "bat", is "on strike" at the other end. 

The bat is made of wood and takes the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle.  The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches. 

The bowler must employ a straight-armed action to "bowl" the ball, which is a hard leather seamed spheroid projectile with a circumference limit of 9 inches.  

The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90mph, is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including "pads" (designed to protect the knees and shins), "batting gloves" for the hands, a helmet for the head and a "box" inside the trousers (for the more delicate part of the anatomy).  Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads.

===Umpires and scorers===
The game on the field is regulated by two "umpires", one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is several yards behind the batsman on strike.  When the bowler delivers the ball, the umpire at the wicket is between the bowler and the non-striker.

Off the field, the match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by "scorers".  In televised matches, particularly those played at international level, there is often a "third umpire" who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence.

===Innings===
In theory, all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but an "innings" can end before they all do so.  The innings (always used in the plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side.  Each team has one or two innings each depending on the type of contest being played.  The term innings also applies to a batsman's individual performance and it is often said that a batsman had an innings (meaning score) of so many runs.

The main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman.  A batsman when dismissed is said to be "out" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team.  When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over.  The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen "in".  This batsman is termed "not out".  

If an innings should end before ten batsmen have been dismissed, there are two "not out" batsmen.  An innings can end early because the batting side's captain has chosen to "declare" the innings closed, which is a tactical decision; or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game; or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time.  In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still "in" when the last overs has been bowled.

===Overs===
The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or "balls") and each set of six balls is called an over.  This name came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled.  At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side changes ends.  A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs.  The batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa.  The umpires also change positions so that the one was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.

===Fielding===
All eleven players on the fielding side take the field together.  One of them is the wicketkeeper who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike.  Besides the one currently bowling, the other fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field.  These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as "slip", "third man", "silly mid on" and "long leg".  The captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for "setting the field", though usually in consultation with the bowler.  

===Bowling===
The bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling.  A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so.

The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly to a ball that reaches him in an instant.

Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile.  Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it "curves" or "swings" in flight and this type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.

At the other end of the bowling scale is the "spinner" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman.  A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" to lure the batsman into making an adventurous shot.  The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out.

In between the pacemen and the spinners are the "medium pacers" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration. 

All bowlers are classified according to their pace or style.  The classifications, as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing.  Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a "leg break" and a "googly"!

''Perhaps include a list of all the bowling classifications''.

===Batting===
At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area.  One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible.  His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.  

If a batsman "retires" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually "not out" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over.  Substitute batsmen are not allowed, although substitute fielders are.

A skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode.  The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade.  Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.  

Cricket is very fond of naming things, as with the field placings, and each shot or stroke in the batsman's repertoire has a name too: e.g., "cut", "drive", "hook", "pull", etc.

Note that a batsman does not have to play a shot and can "leave" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper, providing he thinks it will not hit his wicket.  Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat.  He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby "pad it away" but this is risky because of the lbw rule.

===Runs===
The primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e., the "striker") is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball.  Each completed run increments the score.  More than one run can be scored from a single hit but, while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.  To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground ''en route'' to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary on the full.  Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball.  If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was non-striker is now the striker.  Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team's total.

===Extras===
Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as "extras" or "sundries" by courtesy of the fielding side.  This is achieved in four ways:
#'''No ball''' &ndash; a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease
#'''Wide''' &ndash; a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach 
#'''Bye''' &ndash; extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that the mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum)
#'''Leg bye''' &ndash; extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's leg, but not his bat, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.  

When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.  

The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.

===Dismissals===
There are several ways in which a batsman can be dismissed and some are so unusual that only a few instances of them exist in the whole history of the game.  The most common forms of dismissal are "bowled", "caught", "leg before wicket" (lbw), "run out", "stumped" and "hit wicket".  The unusual methods are "hit the ball twice", "obstructed the field", "handled the ball" and "timed out".  

Before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must "appeal".  This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) the term "Owzat?" which means, simply enough, "How is that?"  If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say "Out!".  Otherwise he will shake his head and say "Not out".  Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.

#'''Bowled''' &ndash; the bowler has hit the wicket with the ball and the wicket has "broken" with at least one bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out)
#'''Caught''' &ndash; the batsman has hit the ball with his bat or with his hand and the ball was caught on the full by a member of the fielding side  
#'''Leg before wicket (lbw)''' &ndash; is complex but basically means that the batsman would have been bowled if the ball had not hit his leg first  
#'''Run out''' &ndash; a fielder has broken the wicket with the ball while a batsman was out of his ground; this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run  
#'''Stumped''' &ndash; is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground; the keeper must break the wicket with the ball in his hand for a stumping (if the keeper ''throws'' the ball at the wicket, it is a run out) 
#'''Hit wicket''' &ndash; means simply that a batsman did just that, often by hitting the wicket with his bat or by falling onto it or running into it  
#'''Hit the ball twice''' &ndash; is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders, although when it does occur it is usually because the batsman has tried to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it
#'''Obstructed the field''' &ndash; another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way of a fielder
#'''Handled the ball''' &ndash; a batsman must not ''deliberately'' use his hand to protect his wicket (note that the bowled ball often hits the batsman's hand but this is not intentional by the batsman and so is not out; though he can of course be caught off his hand) 
#'''Timed out''' &ndash; usually means that the next batsman did not arrive at the wicket within two minutes of the previous one being dismissed.

Note that it is usually the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs but the non-striker can be dismissed, invariably by being run out.

==Types of match and competition==
Cricket is a multi-faceted sport whose rules are maintained by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and are in the form of a code known as The [[Laws of Cricket]].  

In very broad terms, cricket can be divided into [[major cricket]] and minor cricket based on playing standards.  A more pertinent division, particularly in terms of major cricket, is between matches in which the teams have two innings apiece and those in which they have a single innings each.  The former, known as [[first-class cricket]], has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of "timeless" matches too); the latter, known as [[limited overs cricket]] because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.).  

Historically, a form of cricket known as [[single wicket]] has been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches.  Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. 

===Test cricket===
''[[Test cricket]] is the highest standard of cricket.  A Test match is an international fixture, etc.  Test cricket began with Australia ''versus'' England in 1877.  Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889), West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932), Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000).  And so on''.

===Limited overs===
''Overview including Twenty20.  Mention internationals and main domestic competitions.  Point out the key differences between limited overs and double innings; say why Twenty20 differs from conventional limited overs''.

===National championships===
''Mention the [[County Championship]]; [[Sheffield Shield]]; [[Ranji Trophy]]; [[Currie Cup]]; and so on''.

===Minor Cricket===
''Various leagues, often organised on a state, county or regional basis, that include clubs which are classed as "minor" although in many cases the playing standards are anything but minor.  Give examples like Australia's grade structure and the [[Minor Counties Championship]]''.

''Village cricket and significant local leagues like the Lancashire League''.

''Schools cricket''.

===Other types of cricket===
There are numerous informal variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket, French cricket, beach cricket, Kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket.

''Keep this brief and refer to [[Forms of cricket]]''.

==Origin and development of cricket==
{{main|History of cricket}}
Cricket is ''a club striking a ball ''(like) ''the ancient games of club-ball, stool-ball, trap-ball, stob-ball'' <ref name=MTG>[[John Major]], ''More Than A Game'', HarperCollins, 2007</ref>.  Each of these have at times been described as "early cricket".

Cricket can definitely be traced back to Tudor times in 16th century England but it may have originated much earlier than that. The most common theory of origin is that it was invented by children of the farming and metalworking communities in the Weald between Kent and Sussex during the medieval period.  Written evidence exists of a game known as ''creag'' being played by [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]], the son of [[Edward I of England|Edward I (Longshanks)]], at Newenden, Kent in 1300 <ref name=HSA/> and there has been speculation, but no evidence, that this was a form of cricket.     

A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term "cricket". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598 (''see below''), it is called ''creckett''.  The name may have been derived from the [[Flemish language|Flemish]], ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff <ref name=DB>[[Derek Birley]], ''A Social History of English Cricket'', Aurum, 1999</ref>.  Another likely source is the Flemish word ''krickstoel'', meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in [[Church (building)|church]] and which resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.

According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Flemish ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., "with the stick chase"), which also suggests a Flemish connection in the game's origin.  It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south east England at the time and, given trade connections with Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, many Flemish words found their way into southern English dialects <ref name=RB>[[Rowland Bowen]], ''Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development'', Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970</ref>.

In 1598, a court case referred to a sport called ''creckett'' being played by boys at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]] around 1550. This is the sport's earliest definite mention.  It is believed that it was originally a children's game but references around 1610 <ref name=HSA>[[Harry Altham|H S Altham]], ''A History of Cricket'', Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin, 1962</ref> indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or [[village cricket]] occurs soon afterwards in tragic circumstances.  In 1624, a player called [[Jasper Vinall]] was killed when he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex <ref name=TJM>[[Timothy J McCann]], ''Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century'', Sussex Record Society, 2004</ref>.

During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England.  By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the [[Restoration]] in 1660.  A newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.

[[Image:England in North America 1859.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The first English touring team pictured on board ship at Liverpool in 1859]]
The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England.  Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own "select XIs".  Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the [[Artillery Ground]] in Finsbury.  The [[single wicket]] form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match.  Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman.  This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape.  The [[Hambledon Club]] was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's Old Ground]] in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.  MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the [[Laws of Cricket]].  New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).

The 19th century saw [[underarm bowling]] replaced by first [[roundarm bowling|roundarm]] and then [[overarm bowling]].  Both developments were controversial.  Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with [[Sussex CCC]] in 1839, which ultimately formed the official [[County Championship]] in 1890.  

Meanwhile, the  British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  In 1844, the first ever international cricket match took place between the [[United States national cricket team|United States]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] (although neither has ever been ranked as a Test-playing nation). 

In 1859, a team of [[English cricket team|England]] players went on the first overseas tour (to North America) and in 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.  In 1876-77, an England team took part in the first-ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]].

[[Image:Donald Bradman australian cricket player pic.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Donald Bradman|Sir Don Bradman]] is by general consent the greatest batsman in the history of cricket.  He had a Test average of 99.94 and an overall first-class average of 95.14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4188.html |publisher=Cricinfo.com |work=Players and Officials |title=Sir Donald Bradman |accessdate=2006-04-27}}</ref>]]
The legendary [[W G Grace]] started his long career in 1865. It can fairly be said that he revolutionised the sport and did much to ensure its massive popularity.

The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to [[The Ashes]] in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most contest.  Test cricket began to expand in 1888-89 when South Africa played England.

The last two decades before the [[First World War]] have been called the "Golden Age of Cricket". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.

The inter-war years were dominated by one player: [[Don Bradman]], statistically the greatest batsman of all time.  It was the determination of the England team to overcome his skill that brought about the infamous [[Bodyline]] series in 1932/33.

Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of West Indies, India and New Zealand before the Second World War and then Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the post-war period.  However, South Africa was banned from  international cricket from 1970 to 1992 because of its government's apartheid policy. 

Cricket entered a new era in 1963, when English counties introduced the [[limited overs cricket|limited overs]] variant.  As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs was lucrative and the number of matches increased.  The first [[Limited Overs International]] was played in 1971. The governing [[International Cricket Council]] saw its potential and staged the first limited overs [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1975.  

In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, [[Twenty20]], has made an immediate impact.

==International structure of cricket==
The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.

The ICC has 104 members: 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members <ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/index.html full list of ICC members]</ref>. The ICC is responsible for the organization and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals.

Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country. The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team.
