The '''Schuylkill Expressway''', locally known simply as '''the Schuylkill''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20070316_Philadelphia_Weather__Accidents__delayed_flights_and_travel_headaches_across_the_region.html|title="Accidents, delayed flights and travel headaches across the region," ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', March 16, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> is a [[freeway]] through southeastern [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]] and the city of [[Philadelphia]], and the easternmost segment of [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] in the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. It extends from the Valley Forge exit of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], paralleling its namesake [[Schuylkill River]] for most of the route, to the [[Walt Whitman Bridge]] in [[South Philadelphia]]. It serves as the primary corridor into Philadelphia from points west.

Constructed over a period of ten years from 1949 to 1959, a large portion of the expressway predate the [[1956]] introduction of [[Interstate Highway System]]; many of these portions were not built to contemporary standards.<ref name="phillyroads"/> The rugged terrain and limited riverfront space covered by the route has largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway, despite the road being highly over-capacity; it has become notorious for its chronic congestion.<ref name="pahighways">{{cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/I76.html|title=Pennsylvania Highways: Interstate 76|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

The Schuylkill Expressway is the busiest road in Philadelphia, as well as in the entire state of [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="nytimes86">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DF1539F930A15751C0A960948260|title=''The New York Times'', "Schuylkill Expressway Work Entering Time of Worst Jams"|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> An estimated 175,000 motorists utilize the road daily.<ref name="aaroadsaadt">{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-076_aadt.html|title=Interstate 76 - Annual Average Daily Traffic @ Interstate-Guide.com|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

==Route description==
[[Image:Schuylkill Expressway Exit 332.JPG|thumb|250px|The Schuylkill Expressway near Conshohocken]]
The Schuylkill Expressway begins at the [[Valley Forge]] Interchange of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]]. The Interstate 76 designation continues west on the Turnpike from this point, while the Turnpike from this point east is designated [[Interstate 276]]. Immediately southeast of the interchange, the expressway interchanges with [[U.S. Route 202]], [[U.S. Route 422]], and the [[King of Prussia Mall]]. It continues eastward though [[Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Merion]], interchanging with [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] in [[Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Gulph Mills]]. It continues towards [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|Conshohocken]], where it interchanges with [[Interstate 476]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 23]].<ref name="pamap">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/MAPS/Statewide/otm/2006/otm_2006.PDF|title=Pennsylvania Official Tourism and Transportation Map 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

The highway then begins to run along a narrow cliff-top route high above its namesake [[Schuylkill River]], which it parallels from this point. East of Conshohocken, it curves sharply southeast in a 90-degree turn locally known as the "Conshohocken Curve".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.montcopa.org/montco/cwp/view,a,11,Q,1191.asp|title=Montgomery County: Montco Press Release #04-08|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> Continuing southeast, interchanges provide access to the [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] community of [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]] and the [[Philadelphia]] neighorhood of [[Manayunk]].<ref name="pamap"/>

The expressway then enters the city of [[Philadelphia]], interchanging with [[City Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 1]]); U.S. 1 briefly enters the expressway at this point. Entering [[Fairmount Park]], U.S. 1 splits off as the [[Roosevelt Expressway (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Expressway]] to the northeast. The Schuylkill Expressway continues south through the park towards [[Center City]], with [[Boathouse Row]] on the opposite bank of the river. At the southern end of the park, the Vine Street Expressway ([[Interstate 676]]) splits off to the east.<ref name="pamap"/>

The road then dips down below street level, running immediately adjacent to the river on the eastern edge of [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]]. It crosses the river and skirts the eastern edge of the [[Philadelphia Gas Works]] to an interchange with [[Pennsylvania Route 291]] and Oregon Avenue. South of the interchange, the expressway curves sharply east. It interchanges with [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] and [[Interstate 95]], and crosses the [[Delaware River]] on [[Walt Whitman Bridge]] into [[New Jersey]].<ref name="pamap"/>

==History==
Plans for a limited-access highway along the west bank of the [[Schuylkill River]] originated in [[1932]], as part of a proposed cars-only [[parkway]] system for the [[Philadelphia]] area similar to the contemporary system being built in [[New York City]]. The "Valley Forge Parkway" was to have run from [[Fairmount Park]] to [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|Valley Forge State Park]], with plans for a later extension to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] via [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown]]. However, planning for the proposed parkway system stalled and the plan was eventually abandoned.<ref name="phillyroads"/><ref name="pahighways"/>

[[Image:Toys for Tots parade Philadelphia 2002.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Approaching the South Street exit]]
Planning for today's expressway began in [[1947]], when the city of Philadelphia approved plans to develop a [[freeway]] connecting the city with the terminus of the planned Philadelphia Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] near Valley Forge. The highway was designed by engineers [[Michael Rapuano]], who had previously aided in the design of the [[Garden State Parkway]], and [[Bill Allen (engineer)|Bill Allen]] of [[Gannett Fleming Inc.|Gannett Fleming]]. The new expressway largely followed the earlier planned parkway route from Valley Forge to Fairmount Park, while also extending into southern Philadelphia and across the [[Delaware River]] into [[New Jersey]]. Two alternatives were proposed south of [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]]: one routing would continue along the west bank of the river into [[Southwest Philadelphia]] to its confluence near [[Philadelphia International Airport]], where it would tunnel underneath the Delaware to [[Paulsboro, New Jersey]]; the other would cross the Schuylkill south of University City and bisect [[South Philadelphia]], crossing the Delaware into [[Gloucester City, New Jersey]]. Planned expansions of the airport in the path of the former proposal led to adoption of the routing through South Philadelphia.<ref name="phillyroads"/><ref name="pahighways"/>

Construction of the road began in [[1949]]. The road was completed in stages, with a short segment near [[King of Prussia]] opening in [[1951]] along with the Turnpike's Philadelphia Extension, with the section from King of Prussia to [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|Conshohocken]] opening a year later. The section between Conshohocken and [[City Avenue]] opened in [[1954]]. The [[Walt Whitman Bridge]] opened in [[1957]]. The expressway was completed through Fairmount Park in [[1959]], and in [[1960]] the entire expressway was complete with the opening of the segment through University City.<ref name="pahighways"/>

[[Image:Schuylkill Expressway.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Approaching [[Center City Philadelphia]] from the south]]
Immediately after its completion, operational studies performed on the Schuylkill Expressway found that the route would be unable to cope with the area's growing traffic demands, due to the many substandard design elements and compromises incorporated to cope with the rugged, difficult routing of the road. In [[1962]], plans were announced for a parallel expressway along the east bank of the Schuylkill, known as the [[Manayunk Expressway]]; however, these plans were quickly withdrawn due to substantial opposition.<ref name="phillyroads"/> An alternative plan was then introduced to widen the entire highway to eight lanes in time for the [[United States Bicentennial]] in [[1976]]; however, these plans were also shelved due to local disapproval. A scaled-down widening project was successfully undertaken from 1969 to 1972 to widen a short section of the road to six lanes through Fairmount Park.<ref name="phillyroads"/>

In the decades since its opening, congestion on the expressway has steadily increased. Plans to expand the expressway to eight lanes by building an upper deck, including [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes, were advocated by former [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Pennsylvania House Speaker]] [[John Perzel]], but have not come to fruition due to a lack of funding.<ref name="pahighways"/>
