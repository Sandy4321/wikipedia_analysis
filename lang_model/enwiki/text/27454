'''Adobe Illustrator''' is a [[vector graphics editor|vector-based drawing program]] developed and marketed by [[Adobe Systems]].

==History==
===Versions 1 - 88 ===
'''Adobe Illustrator''' was first developed for the [[Apple Macintosh]] in [[1986]] (shipping in January 1987) as a commercialization of Adobe's in-house [[Typeface|font]] development [[software]] and [[PostScript]] file format.  Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Photoshop is primarily geared toward [[digital photography|digital photo]] manipulation and [[photorealism|photorealistic]] styles of [[digital illustration|computer illustration]], while Illustrator provides superior results in the [[typesetting]] and [[logo]] graphic areas of [[graphic design|design]]. Early magazine ads (featured in graphic design trade magazines such as ''[[Communication Arts]]'') referred to the product as "the Adobe Illustrator". Illustrator 88 was released in 1988 and introduced many new tools and features.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNLFXKyCy0A Illustrator 88 demonstration video]</ref>

===Versions 2 <U+2013> 5 ===
Although Adobe developed Illustrator primarily for the Macintosh during its first decade, it sporadically supported other platforms. In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for [[NeXT]], [[Silicon Graphics]] [[IRIX]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] platforms, but they were discontinued due to poor market acceptance. The first version of Illustrator for [[Microsoft Windows]], version 2.0, was released in early 1989, but it was a flop. The next Windows version, version 4.0, was widely criticized as being too similar to Illustrator 1.1 instead of the Macintosh 3.0 version, and certainly not the equal of Windows' most popular illustration package [[CorelDraw]]. (Note that there were no versions 2.0 or 4.0 for the Macintosh - although the second release for the Mac was titled Illustrator 88 - the year of its release.) Version 4 was, however the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5.0 in 1993.

===Versions 6 <U+2013> 10 ===
With the introduction of Illustrator 6 in [[1996]], Adobe made critical changes in the user interface with regards to path editing (and also to converge on the same [[user interface]] as [[Adobe Photoshop]]), and many users opted not to upgrade. To this day, many users find the changes questionable. Illustrator also began to support [[TrueType]], making the "font wars" between PostScript [[Type 1 font|Type 1]] and TrueType largely moot. Like Photoshop, Illustrator also began supporting plug-ins, greatly and quickly extending its abilities.

With true ports of the Macintosh versions to Windows starting with version 7 in [[1997]], designers could finally standardize on Illustrator. [[Corel]] did port [[CorelDRAW]] 6.0 to the Macintosh in late 1996, but it was received as too little, too late. [[Aldus]] ported [[FreeHand]] to Windows but it was not the equal of Illustrator. Adobe bought Aldus in 1994 for PageMaker, and as part of the transaction it sold FreeHand to [[Macromedia]] (which was later acquired by Adobe). Clarifying difference in strengths between Photoshop and Illustrator
with the rise of the Internet, Illustrator was enhanced to support Web publishing, [[Rasterisation|rasterization]] previewing, [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Version 9 included a tracing feature, similar to that within Adobe's discontinued product [[Adobe Streamline|Streamline]].

===Versions CS-CS3===
Illustrator CS2 (version 12) to reflect its integration with the [[Adobe Creative Suite]], was available for both the [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on both [[Intel]] and [[PowerPC]] processors. Illustrator CS was the first version to include 3-dimensional capabilities allowing users to extrude or revolve shapes to create simple [[3D computer graphics|3D]] objects. 

Among the new features included in Illustrator CS2 were Live Trace, Live Paint, a control palette and custom workspaces. Live Trace allows for the [[Raster to vector|conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art]] and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap.

===Branding===
Starting with version 1.0, Adobe chose to license an image of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s "[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]" from the [[Bettmann Archive]] and use the portion containing Venus' face as Illustrator's branding image. Warnock desired a Renaissance image to evoke his vision of Postscript as a new Renaissance in publishing, and Adobe employee Luanne Seymour Cohen, who was responsible for the early marketing material, found Venus' flowing tresses a perfect vehicle for demonstrating Illustrator's strength in tracing smooth curves over bitmap source images. Over the years the rendition of this image on Illustrator's splash screen and packaging became more stylized to reflect features added in each version.

The image of Venus was replaced (albeit still accessible via [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]]) in Illustrator CS (11.0) and CS2 (12.0) by a stylized flower to conform to the Creative Suite's nature imagery.<ref>[http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html?cprose=8-01 Inside CS2: MetaDesign Shares Its Secrets | CreativePro.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In CS3, Adobe changed the suite branding once again, to simple colored blocks with two-letter abbreviations, resembling a [[periodic table of elements]].<ref>[http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding The new Adobe icons and branding | Veerle's blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Illustrator was represented by the letters '''Ai''' against an orange background (oranges and yellows were prominent color schemes in Illustrator branding going back as far as version 4.0).
