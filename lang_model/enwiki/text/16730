'''Harveys Lake''' (also known as '''Harvey Lake''' or '''Harvey's Lake'''<ref name = "gnis">{{Citation|author = [[Geographic Names Information System]]|url = http://gnis.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO::P3_FID,P3_TITLE:1200085,Harveys%20Lake|title = Feature Detail Report for: Harveys Lake|accessdate = February 2, 2015}}</ref>) is a natural [[lake]] in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], in the United States. It has a surface area of approximately 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of [[Harveys Lake, Pennsylvania|Harveys Lake]].<ref name = "nationalmap">{{Citation|author = [[United States Geological Survey]]|url = http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/|title = The National Map Viewer|accessdate = February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name = "tmdl"/> By volume, it is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania and by surface area, it is the second-largest. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of [[Harveys Creek]], a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone masonry dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself. The lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road.

Harveys Lake was affected by [[algae bloom]]s from the mid-20th century onward. These algae blooms were caused by pollution by nutrients, especially phosphorus. The lake was identified as impaired in 1994, with an annual phosphorus load of {{convert|1019|lb|kg}}. However, the phosphorus load has been reduced somewhat since then. The lake is listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. A number of rare or endangered plant species have been observed in its vicinity. Various species of [[fish]] inhabit the lake and a number of [[bird]] species have been observed in its vicinity.

Harveys Lake was accidentally discovered by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers arrived at the lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well-known as a summer resort in the latter part of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a [[total maximum daily load]] was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.

==Watershed==
Harveys Lake is situated in the [[United States Geological Survey]] quadrangles of Harveys Lake and Noxen.<ref name = "gnis"/> The [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the lake has an area of <!--3541 or 3629--> {{convert|3600|acre}}.<ref name = "tmdl"/><ref name = "epa"/> Most of the watershed is in Luzerne County, but its northeasternmost portion is in [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming County]].<ref name = "princetonhydro"/>

The vast majority ({{convert|2841|acre|disp=sqbr}}) of the watershed of Harveys Lake is [[forest]]ed land. Developed land and [[farmland]] comprise {{convert|499|acre}} and {{convert|154.7|acre}}, respectively. [[Unpaved road]]s make up {{convert|2.5|acre}} of the watershed.<ref name = "tmdl"/> The majority of the developed land in the watershed is directly on the shoreline and nearly all is within {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of the lake.<ref name = "princetonhydro"/><ref name = "villanova">{{Citation|author = Fred S.

==Hydrology==
Although Harveys Lake's waters were described as having "great purity" in 1893, the lake has experienced [[nutrient pollution]], especially from [[phosphorus]] since at least the mid-20th century.<ref name = "tmdl"/><ref name = "bradsby"/> Algae blooms occurred on the lake and caused a reduction in [[water quality]] throughout the latter half of the 20th century. A [[sewage]] system was installed in the borough of Harveys Lake in the summer of 1976, but this did not completely stop the algae blooms.<ref name = "princetonhydro"/> However, the phosphorus load in the lake has been reduced by 29 percent.<ref name = "epa"/> The lake was identified as impaired in 1994, with the cause of the impairment being large algae blooms and [[sedimentation]] in some areas. It is an [[anoxic]] lake.<ref name = "tmdl"/>

In the 1990s, the concentration of [[phosphorus]] in the waters of Harveys Lake was measured to be 0.031 milligrams per liter. The annual load of phosphorus was {{convert|1019|lb|kg}} per year. The lake's [[total maximum daily load]] for phosphorus is 0.024 milligrams per liter and {{convert|789|lb|kg}} per year.<ref name = "tmdl"/>

In the 1990s, {{convert|255|lb|kg}} of the annual phosphorus load of Harveys Lake came from [[internal loading]], {{convert|233|lb|kg}} came from [[groundwater]], {{convert|199|lb|kg}} came from developed land, and {{convert|150|lb|kg}} came from shorelines. Smaller sources of phosphorus included farmland ({{convert|95|lb|kg}} per year), forests ({{convert|51|lb|kg}} per year), [[septic system]]s ({{convert|33|lb|kg}} per year), and unpaved roads ({{convert|3.4|lb|kg}} per year).<ref name = "tmdl"/>

==History==
Harveys Lake was entered into the [[Geographic Names Information System]] on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1200085.<ref name = "gnis"/> [[Lake Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Lake Township]] is named after the lake.<ref name = "bradsby"/>

Harveys Lake is named after Benjamin Harvey, one of the [[Sons of Liberty]] and among the first settlers of the [[Wyoming Valley]]. Harvey inadvertently discovered the lake in 1781, while returning home after being held as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Fort Niagara]].<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> The first resident in the vicinity of the lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s. However, the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> It was first surveyed by Christopher Hurlbert in 1794. The first person of European descent to explore the lake by [[canoe]] was Andrew Bennett, in 1800.<ref name = "bradsby"/>

The early settlers in the vicinity of Harveys Lake mainly engaged in lumbering and farming. As was expected of them.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> At one point during the 1800s, the mills of Hollenback & Urquhart were cutting more than a million [[board feet]] of lumber annually at the lake.<ref name = "bradsby"/> However, by 1853, summer resorts used by Wyoming Valley residents began appearing near the lake. Hotels such as the Lake House Hotel and later the Rhoads Hotel, the Lake Grove Hotel, and the Grand Hotel Oneonta were among the hotels on the lake in the late 1800s.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> Grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s, and former United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited it in August 1912.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/><ref name = "backmountain">{{Citation|author = Harrison Wick|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lQy3U1_PissC&pg=PA118|title = Pennsylvania's Back Mountain|pages = 116&ndash;119|year = 2009}}</ref> In the early 1900s, there were three [[hotel]]s, two hundred cottages, and sixty [[boathouse]]s on the lake, most of them at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the water line.<ref name = "waterresources"/>

The [[Harvey Lake and Towanda Branch]] of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] was constructed in the late 1800s. It ran directly from [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] to Harveys Lake. In the 1890s, railroad lines were constructed from the lake to the communities of [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]].<ref name = "bradsby"/>

Harveys Lake has been popular for recreational purposes since the late 1800s.<ref name = "tmdl"/> Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> Around this time period, there were four [[streamboat]]s on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight.<ref name = "waterresources"/> Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> A 60-foot (18-meter) high [[Shoot the Chute]] was built in the area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity.<ref name = "backmountain"/> A [[casino]] near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest [[bowling alley]] in [[northeast Pennsylvania]] near the lake.<ref name = "backmountain"/> Throughout the 20th century, until after [[World War II]], the lake received thousands of visitors every summer.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> 

In the early 1900s, Harveys Lake was used as a [[water supply]] for [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], as a private [[ice]] supply, and as a [[summer resort]].<ref name = "waterresources"/> 

Harveys Lake has been the subject of scientific studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted [[limnology|limnological]] studies on it.<ref name = "princetonhydro"/> By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was [[eutrophic]]. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990.<ref name = "tmdl"/> The [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.<ref name = "princetonhydro"/>

In modern times, the main recreational uses of Harveys Lake include swimming, fishing, and boating.<ref name = "tmdl"/> However, it lacks public access locations for [[SCUBA diving]].<ref name = "scuba"/> According to its [[TMDL]] document, the lake is "one of the most heavily used lakes in the area".<ref name = "tmdl"/> It has been situated within the borough of [[Harveys Lake, Pennsylvania|Harveys Lake]] since January 1, 1968, when the borough was incorporated.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> In 2004, a plan to dredge and develop a patch of [[wetland]] for 30 [[boat slip]]s near the lake was opposed due to safety concerns (poor visibility) as well as environmental concerns.<ref>{{Citation|author = Camille Fioti|url = http://archives.timesleader.com/2004/2004_18/2004_11_23_DREDGING_PLAN_HITS_OPPOSITION_DEP_HEARS_PUBLIC_INPUT_ON_THE_PROP.html|title = Dredging plan hits opposition: Dep hears public input on the proposed developing of a wetlands area in Harveys Lake|work=Times Leader|date = November 23, 2004|accessdate = February 3, 2015}}</ref>

Numerous rare or endangered plant species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake. Plants in the vicinity of the lake include [[Vasey's Pondweed]], [[Flat-leaved Pondweed]], [[grassy pondweed]], [[Broad-leaved Water-milfoil]], and [[Beck's Water-marigold]]. However, exotic and [[invasive plant|invasive]] plants such as [[fanwort]] and [[aquatic coontail]] also inhabit the area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake.<ref name = "inventory"/> [[Second-growth forest]]s occur in the area surrounding the lake.<ref name = "waterresources"/>

[[Algae bloom]]s have occurred on Harveys Lake due to high levels of nutrients in the water.<ref name = "epa"/>

Harveys Lake is inhabited by various species of native [[fish]] of Pennsylvania.<ref name = "harveyslakepa"/> In 1972, ''[[Field and Stream]]'' noted that the lake was inhabited by [[rainbow trout]], [[sockeye salmon]], and some [[lake trout]].<ref>{{Citation|work=[[Field and Stream]] |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=An3yh2NrzhAC&pg=PA117|title = Field & Stream|page = 117|date = February 1972}}</ref> As the basin of Harveys Creek upstream of the tributary [[Pikes Creek]] is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, the lake itself has the same designation.<ref name = "princetonhydro"/> Harveys Lake has regulations permitting a [[creel limit]] of three trout per day, with only one being allowed to be more than {{convert|18|in|cm}} long.<ref>{{Citation|author = [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]|url = http://fishandboat.com/pafish/trout/trout_plan/troutplan2010.pdf|title = Strategic Plan for Management of Trout Fisheries in Pennsylvania 2010 - 2014|page = 50|date = October 2009|accessdate = February 3, 2015}}</ref>

Various [[bird]] species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake. These include [[surf scoter]]s and [[black scoter]]s, which have been observed there in the winter. Although [[Greater Scaup]]s are rare in Pennsylvania away from [[Lake Erie]], one was observed at the lake in July 1992. [[Franklin's Gull]]s have also been observed near the lake, as have [[snow bunting]]s and [[Black-legged Kittiwake]]s, and [[ruddy duck]]s.
