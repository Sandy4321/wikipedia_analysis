{{italic title}}
'''''Silent Alarm Remixed''''' is the [[remix album]] to ''[[Silent Alarm]]'', the debut album by British [[indie rock]] band [[Bloc Party]]. It was released on 29 August 2005 in the British Isles by [[Wichita Recordings]], the band's primary label, and on 13 September 2005 in the United States through [[Vice Records]] to coincide with Bloc Party's worldwide touring schedule. The record peaked at number 54 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In the U.S., it achieved a peak of number four on the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums]].

Bloc Party commissioned ''Silent Alarm Remixed'' to show that [[remixes]] and [[dance music]] were relevant to the band and to the rock landscape at large. The band members gave each of the original tracks to a number of musicians from different genres; [[Ladytron]], [[Four Tet]], and [[Nick Zinner]] were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers treated it as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.

== Origins and promotion ==

Bloc Party's critically acclaimed debut album ''Silent Alarm'' charted in 18 countries on four continents by the end of April 2005.<ref name="ind">{{Cite news |author = Cripps, Charlotte|title=Rock around the Bloc|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|page=49|date=27 April 2005}}</ref> The Japanese edition included three bonus tracks that later appeared on ''Silent Alarm Remixed'': "So Here We Are (Four Tet Remix)", "Plans ([[Mogwai]] Remix)", and "Pioneers ([[M83 (band)|M83]] Remix)".<ref>{{jp icon}} {{cite web |url=http://ranking.oricon.co.jp/free_contents/search/detail.asp?itemcd=578738&samecd=1|title= <U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30EC><U+30F3><U+30C8><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30E9><U+30FC><U+30E0> : <U+30D6><U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30FC> (Silent Alarm: Bloc Party)|publisher=[[Oricon]] |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}</ref> During the month of May, several musical acts were asked to remix other songs from the band's work.<ref name=NMEN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/bloc-party/19893|title=Kele's Heroes|publisher=''[[NME]]''|date=7 May 2005 |accessdate=29 July 2009 }}</ref> [[Frontman]] [[Kele Okereke]] has stated that the decision was taken because the band members wanted to show that dance music was significant to them as a rock band.<ref name="pitchforkint">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6128-bloc-party/ |title=Bloc Party (Interview)|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |author=Warren, Jamin |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=29 July 2009 }}</ref> Fellow [[Vice Records]] band [[Death from Above 1979]] were the first act to be asked and [[cover version|covered]] "Luno" as a [[B-side]] to their June 2005 single "[[Black History Month (song)|Black History Month]]".<ref name=NMEN/> 

Automato were asked to remix "Price of Gas" after releasing their debut album on Bloc Party's [[vinyl record|vinyl]] U.S. label [[Dim Mak Records]].<ref name=pressrelease /> [[Pretty Girls Make Graves]] and [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]] had supported the band at several concerts during the first half of 2005.<ref name=pressrelease />  Before their fame, Okereke and lead guitarist [[Russell Lissack]] were regular visitors to [[Erol Alkan]]'s [[Trash (nightclub)|Trash]] club in London; the early contact with the band led Alkan to rework Bloc Party's first single "[[She's Hearing Voices]]".<ref name=alkan>{{cite web |url=http://www.erolalkan.co.uk/?p=110 |title=Bloc Party <U+2013> She<U+2019>s Hearing Voice (Erol Alkan<U+2019>s Calling Your Name Dub & Vocal Re-Works) |author=Alkan, Erol|publisher=erolalkan.co.uk|accessdate=23 August 2009 }}</ref>  The band had also performed at Dave Pianka's Philadelphia club and the gig inspired the club owner to remix "This Modern Love" with Adam Sparkle into something more suited to a disco.<ref name=pressrelease />  Ladytron were early fans of the band and invited the quartet for a performance at their Liverpool club before reworking "Like Eating Glass" for the release.<ref name=pressrelease />

== Critical reviews ==

Media response to ''Silent Alarm Remixed'' was mixed, but generally positive.<ref>See infobox rating.</ref> [[Allmusic]]'s Heather Phares described the album as more consistent than most remix collections and noted that it functions well as a record in its own right.<ref name=AMG/> Priya Elan of ''[[NME]]'' explained that "the results are pretty much all quality" and that some of the tracks are better than the original songs on ''Silent Alarm''.<ref name=NME/> [[Rockfeedback]]'s Thomas Hannan stated, "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing about it is that it makes you think about the original in a completely altered way."<ref name=rockfeed/> [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Nitsuh Adebe gave the album a rating of eight out of ten by indicating that it is "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".<ref name=pitchfork/>

Christian Hoard of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was less receptive and commented that the tracks are flawed in conception, because Bloc Party are not a disco-oriented band despite their propulsive rhythm section.<ref name=RS/> Nick Southall of [[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]] suggested that the inherent problem with record is that the vocals have been removed from the "sympathetic stereo-treatment and layering" of ''Silent Alarm''.<ref name=stylus/> Liam Colle of [[PopMatters]] gave ''Silent Alarm Remixed'' four out of ten<U+2014>one of the lowest ratings that it received from notable publications<U+2014>and commented that "the new tricks aren't quite charming, or very tricky for that matter", because the album "reeks of a marketing brainstorm".<ref name=popm/> [[Drowned in Sound]]'s Mike Diver concluded that the disparate nature of the record's contributors denies it the coherency of the original.<ref name=DIS/>

== Composition ==

Ladytron's mix of "Like Eating Glass" replaces the lead and rhythm guitars with [[loop (music)|looped]] [[synthesiser]]s and adds a large amount of [[reverberation]] to the [[singing|vocals]];<ref name=AMG>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kjfrxqlsld0e~T1 |title=Silent Alarm Remixed: Bloc Party|author=Phares, Heather |publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=29 July 2009 }}</ref> the resulting effect was described by Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe as "walking out of your apartment and thinking you can hear Bloc Party playing a festival six blocks over".<ref name=pitchfork>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1131-silent-alarm-remixed/ |title=Bloc Party: Silent Alarm Remixed|author=Abebe, Nitsuh |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=30 August 2005 |accessdate=29 July 2009 }}</ref> Whitey reworked "[[Helicopter (song)|Helicopter]]" in a minimalist fashion and introduced wolf howls and a [[xylophone]] [[staccato]] to the song.<ref name=AMG /><ref name=DIS />  The musician's effects gave the track a rawer sound than the original version according to Heather Phares of Allmusic.<ref name=AMG />  "[[So Here We Are/Positive Tension|Positive Tension]]" was remixed by Jason Clark of [[art punk]] band Pretty Girls Make Graves under the pseudonym "Blackbox".<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web |url=http://www.blocparty.com/news.php?newsID=153 |title=Silent Alarm Remixed |author=Bloc Party|publisher=blocparty.com|accessdate=30 July 2009 }}</ref>  The song includes elements of [[oldschool jungle]].<ref name=RS /> The Paul Epworth edit of single "Banquet", under his "Phones" moniker, is more sparse than the original and is closer to dance music than indie rock.<ref name=NME /><ref name=pitchfork />

[[File:Engineers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Three guitarists, a keyboard player, and a drummer are performing a song live on a stage lit by blue background sheets.|Bloc Party's former tour support act Engineers reworked "Blue Light" by reducing its [[tempo]] and by keeping its basic elemental structure intact.]]

Engineers' "Blue Light" was dubbed the 'Anti-Gravity' mix and resulted in an [[ambient music|ambient]] track which Nick Southall of Stylus considered as good as Bloc Party's version.<ref name=stylus /><ref name=pressrelease /> Erol Alkan's reworking of debut single "[[She's Hearing Voices]]" is a [[dubbing (music)|dub]] version over twice the  length of the blueprint.<ref name=pressrelease /> The song accentuates the [[punk funk]] elements in Bloc Party's work.<ref name=beats /> Alkan has noted that his priority was to get more out of the track's [[groove (music)|groove]] and melody since "the original is so fast it kind of flies by without you being able to recognise [its] beauty".<ref name=alkan /> Dave Pianka and Adam Sparkle's work on "This Modern Love" resulted in a musical construction akin to 1980s [[New Wave music|New Wave]] bands [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[The Cure]].<ref name=pitchfork /><ref name=stylus /> M83 used several studio effects to create an ambient version of single "[[Pioneers (song)|Pioneers]]" by adding [[strings (music)|strings]] and synthesisers to the original composition.<ref name=pitchfork /> Automato's remix of "Price of Gas" infuses Bloc Party's blueprint with [[electronica]] elements.<ref name=AMG />  

Solo act [[Kieran Hebden]], under his Four Tet alias, provided the remix for "[[So Here We Are]]" and created a [[folktronica]] version of the original,<ref name=sputnik /> reminiscent of the music once produced by [[Windham Hill Records]] according to Christian Hoard of ''Rolling Stone''.<ref name=RS /> [[Death From Above 1979]]'s version of "Luno" is the only re-recording on ''Silent Alarm Remixed'' and is wholly in the [[dance-punk]] genre.<ref name=pressrelease />  Bloc Party drummer Matt Tong has stated, "It's a really aggressive take on our music."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1506109/20050721/50_cent.jhtml?headlines=true |title=For The Record: Quick News On Carrie Underwood, 50 Cent, Just Blaze, Saigon, Bloc Party, Nada Surf & More|publisher=[[MTV]] |date=21 July 2005 |accessdate=31 July 2009 }}</ref> Mogwai's mix of "Plans" adds an extensive use of [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]] to the original song,<ref name=rockfeed/> while Nick Zinner's remix of "Compliments" created in [[Shibuya, Tokyo]] accentuates Okereke's whispers to create vocal effects similar to those of The Cure's [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] according to Adebe.<ref name=pitchfork />
