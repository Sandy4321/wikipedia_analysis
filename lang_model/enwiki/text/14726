The '''Sip 'n Dip Lounge''' is a [[tiki bar]] in [[Great Falls, Montana]] opened in 1962, when  [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] themes were popular, and it has survived to the present day with its tiki theme intact.  Located inside a local [[motel]] that was considered modern and trendy at the time it was built, the Sip 'n Dip is known for having women dressed up as "[[mermaid]]s" swimming underwater in an indoor [[swimming pool]] visible through a window in the bar.  Decorated with a [[bamboo]] ceiling and a [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] theme, the bar also features "Piano Pat" Sponheim, who has played piano there since 1963 and is noted for her unique "jazzy" style.

The mermaid concept was introduced in 1995, when there was a revival of the tiki fad, and it was the brainchild of the bar's current owner, who wanted to add a "fun factor" to the bar.  It became very popular, particularly for Montana, a landlocked northern state where a tropical tiki theme is unexpected. Beginning in 2003, the bar began to gain prominence outside of Montana, when ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine listed the lounge in its list of the  top 10 bars in the world, ranking it as the #1 bar "worth flying for".  The bar employs six women, who wear mermaid outfits designed and hand-made by the bar's manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares.

Celebrity patrons of the Sip n' Dip have included [[Nick Nolte]], star of ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'', and [[Daryl Hannah]], who had portrayed a mermaid in ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' and swam in the pool while wearing a mermaid tail.  Both actors signed the glass window, thought their autographs were lost two years later when the window cracked, forcing the pool to be drained, repaired and the double-paned glass replaced with a triple-paned version.

==History and design==

The establishment features a glass wall behind the bar looking into an indoor swimming pool where swimmers can be seen under water.<ref name="CNN"/> It is located inside the O'Haire Motor Inn, which was built in 1962.  The concept of a swimming pool designed so underwater swimmers can be viewed from inside the bar was original to the building, as the person who built the O'Haire had been inspired by a similar design he saw when visiting the [[Playboy Club]] in Chicago.<ref name=KULR>{{cite web|author=Bender, Tori |url=http://www.kulr8.com/story/23974950/tori-takes-on-being-a-mermaid-at-the-sip-n-dip-lounge |title=Tori Takes On Being a Mermaid At the Sip N Dip Lounge - KULR-8 Television, Billings, MT |publisher=Kulr8.com |date=2014-02-15 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>  When built in the 1960s, the O'Haire Motor Inn was considered very "swank" and modern,<ref name=Missoulian/> and the [[Tiki culture|tiki]] concept was popular, in part due to the then-recent admission of [[Hawaii]] to the United States as a state.  The concept of a tropical theme was also viewed as a fun concept for Montana,<ref name=Melcher>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3KzJr5_U4egC&pg=PA34 |title=Montana Watering Holes: The Big Sky<U+2019>s Best Bars |author=Melcher, Joan | publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=9780762761623 | date=2009-10-14 }}</ref> a landlocked state with long, cold winters.<ref name=CBS/>  

Though tiki bars in general declined in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s until the revival of the style in the 1990s,<ref name=AmHeritage>{{cite journal|author=Curtis, Wayne |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/tiki?page=4 |title=Tiki |publisher=American Heritage |date=August/September 2006 | volume=57 |issue=4 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref> the Sip 'n Dip survived with very few changes.<ref name=Missoulian/>  During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a "fun factor."  It began with a single "mermaid" in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995.  Today,  Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and has stated, "I never in my life believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit. People are fascinated with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana."<ref name="CNN"/>

The bar features a bamboo ceiling,<ref name=Missoulian/> traditional cocktails, local Montana [[microbrew]]s, and specialty drinks such as the "fish bowl,"<ref name=manager/> a {{convert|64|usoz|L|abbr=on}} cocktail<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genuinemontana.com/page.aspx?p=82 |title=Great Falls Montana Hotel Guide |publisher=Genuinemontana.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> that features nine shots of different liquors.<ref name=manager>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20101003/SPECIALSECTION08/9300344/Manager-world-famous-Sip-N-Dip-Lounge-gives-tips-what-makes-great-bar | author=Skornogoski, Kim |title=Manager of world famous Sip-N-Dip Lounge gives tips on what makes a great bar |publisher=Great Falls Tribune |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>  It also has an outdoor patio open during the summer, from June to September.<ref name=OHaire/>

One of her most requested covers is "[[Sweet Caroline]]," where she often leads patrons in [[sing-along]]s.<ref name=CBS/><ref name=Melcher/><ref name=Missoulian/>  

Pat was originally from [[Rudyard, Montana]], where her family owned an auto supply store.  She began playing the piano at age five, when her mother would drive her on an {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} round  trip to [[Havre, Montana|Havre]] to take classical piano lessons.<ref name=Missoulian>{{cite web|last=Devlin|first=Vince|title=Song and a dip/'Piano Pat,' mermaids put bar on the map|url=http://missoulian.com/news/song-and-a-dip-piano-pat-mermaids-put-bar-on/article_50229419-bd3c-57b1-8352-ac9baa2934a2.html|work=Missoulian|accessdate=2014-04-17|date=2006-04-21}}</ref>   By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night.<ref name=CBS/> She began singing as well as playing the piano during a time in her life when she lived in [[Billings, Montana]]. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three<ref name=Missoulian/> when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children.<ref name=CBS/>  She simultaneously worked as a [[Medical transcription|medical transcriptionist]] for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000.<ref name=Missoulian/>  She celebrated 50 years of employment at the Sip 'n Dip in December 2013 and at that time she was featured on [[CBS Sunday Morning]].<ref name=CBS/>  She has released two albums, only for sale at the Sip 'n Dip,<ref name=CBS/><ref name=Melcher/> and though she takes requests, she refuses to play modern [[rock music]].<ref name=CBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/keyboard-virtuoso-piano-pat-rocks-the-sip-n-dip-lounge/ |title=Keyboard virtuoso Piano Pat rocks the Sip 'n Dip Lounge - Videos |publisher=CBS News |date=2013-12-15 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> She continues to work because it is not only a job but also her social life, "It's a chance to get out of the house. I enjoy the lounge, and it keeps me going."<ref name=Missoulian/>
  
===Mermaids and swimming pool===
The bar employs six women part-time to wear mermaid costumes and swim in the pool five evenings a week. They are local women from all walks of life.<ref name=CNN/>  The "mermaids" explain that it is fairly easy to stay afloat while wearing a mermaid tail, but the difficult part of the job is ''not'' floating; staying underwater as much as possible is necessary in order for patrons to see them through the window.  Because they cannot use their legs in a traditional manner, they must work harder with their arms to swim.<ref name=KULR/>

The bar's most famous patrons appeared in 2002, when Daryl Hannah, [[Anthony Edwards]] and Nick Nolte dropped by while working on the movie ''[[Northfork]]'',<ref name=Johannes/> which was filmed in the Great Falls area. The actors stopped by the bar and both Nolte, who had starred in ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'', and Hannah signed the glass window.  Then Hannah, who had portrayed a mermaid in ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', donned a mermaid tail and swam in the pool.<ref name=Larcombe/>

The pool is also open to motel guests,<ref name=ohaire2>{{cite web|title=Indoor Pool and Indoor Parking|url=http://ohairemotorinn.com/?p=ohaire-motor-inn&n=pool-and-parking|publisher=O'Haire Motor Inn|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref> and, in spite of signs warning swimmers that they can be viewed from the bar while swimming, people have been known to [[skinny dip]] in the pool, some accidentally, others deliberately.<ref name=Missoulian/>

==Recognition==

The Sip 'n Dip was called a "Polynesia on the Plains" in 2013 by CBS Sunday Morning.<ref name=CBS/> In 2003, ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine listed the lounge as one of the top 10 bars in the world,<ref name=Johannes>{{cite web|url=http://www.matr.net/article-5730.html |author=Johannes, Katie N.|title=Quirky Sip-N-Dip (Great Falls) makes splash on GQ magazine's top 10 bars in the world |work=Great Falls Tribune| publisher=MATR |date=2003-03-31 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> ranking it as the #1 bar "worth flying for".<ref name=CBS/><ref name=CNN>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/travel/mermaid-travel-destinations/ |author=  Bennett, Katherine Dorsett |title=Mermaids: Entertainers with a tail |publisher=CNN |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref name=Larcombe/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmt.com/listing/categories_NET/MoreInfo.aspx?IDRRecordID=18036|title=Sip 'n Dip Lounge|publisher=Montana Office of Tourism|accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> [[Frommer's]] travel guide calls it "one of the kitschiest, wackiest, and flat-out coolest nightspots, not just in Montana, but in the entire West."<ref name=Frommers/>

==Incidents==
The bar faced a major crisis in October 2004 when a crack developed in the glass wall between the bar and the pool, which could have resulted in {{convert|22000|USgal|L}} of water emptying into the bar. The bar was open when the crack occurred and so it was noticed right away.  Staff of the O'Haire Inn immediately began to drain the pool but it was four hours before the task was completed.  The fire department also kept their [[Fire apparatus|pumper truck]] standing by in case more rapid removal of water was needed.  The old double-paned glass was replaced with triple-paned glass, and while the repairs were performed the pool area was also given a new rubber coating.  The autographs of Nolte and Hannah were lost, as the bar's manager explained, "the crack went right through their signatures."<ref name=Larcombe>{{cite web|url=http://www.matr.net/article-12629.html |author= Larcombe, James E.|title=Great Falls watering hole, Sip and Dip, runs dry |work=Great Falls Tribune |publisher=MATR |date=2004-11-19 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>
