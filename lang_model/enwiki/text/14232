'''Charles Humphrey Keating Jr.''' (born December 4, 1923) is an [[United States|American]] [[sportsperson|athlete]], [[lawyer]], [[real estate developer]], [[banker]], and [[financier]], most known for his role in the [[savings and loan scandal]] of the late 1980s.

Keating was a champion swimmer for the [[University of Cincinnati]] in the 1940s.  From the late 1950s through the 1970s, he was a noted [[anti-pornography]] crusader, founding decency organizations and serving as a dissenting member on the [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]].

In the 1980s, Keating ran [[American Continental Corporation]] and the [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]], and took advantage of loosened restrictions on banking investments.  His enterprises began to suffer financial problems and were investigated by federal regulators.  His association with, and financial contributions to, five U.S. senators to argue for preferential treatment from the regulators led to them being dubbed the [[Keating Five]].  When Lincoln failed in 1989, it cost the federal government over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of [[fraud]], [[racketeering]], and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. He served four and a half years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of [[wire fraud]] and [[bankruptcy fraud]] counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served.

==Early life and military service==

==Marriage and family, early legal and business career==
In 1949, Keating married Mary Elaine Fette, who was an athletically-minded Catholic from an established Cincinnati family.<ref>Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', pp. 84<U+2013>85.</ref> They would have five daughters, including Kathleen, Mary, and Elizabeth, and a son, Charles Keating III.

==Anti-pornography crusading==
In 1956, Keating joined a priest leading a group of Catholic men in Cincinnati who were concerned about the dangers of [[pornography]], and he began giving fervent talks on the subject to parents and other groups.<ref name="trust-87">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', p. 87.</ref>  In 1958 he went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and testified before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on mail-order pornography, saying that it was "capable of poisoning any mind at any age and of perverting our entire younger generation", that it was closely tied to juvenile delinquency, and that it was "part of the Communist conspiracy".<ref name="trust-87"/>

Keating founded [[Citizens for Decent Literature]] in 1958, (later renamed a number of times, the best known of which is Citizens for Decency through Law),<ref name="ce020706"/> which advocated reading classics not "smut."<ref name="trust-88">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', p. 88.</ref>  It would grow to 300 chapters and 100,000 members nationwide and become the largest anti-pornography organization in the nation.<ref name="trust-88"/>  Over the following 20 years the organization mailed some 40 million letters on behalf of its position and had filed ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs.<ref name="cincmag-77">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iR0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 | title=Carnival Knowledge | author= | magazine=[[Cincinnati Magazine]] | date=July 1977}}</ref>  Keating gained the [[moniker]] "Mr. Clean".<ref name="carr">{{cite book | last=Carr | first=C. | authorlink=Cynthia Carr | title=

In 1964 &ndash; 1965, he produced the movie ''[[Perversion for Profit]]'' featuring announcer [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]]. It was a survey of then-available pornography, and asserted that pornography was linked to juvenile delinquency and decline in culture.

In 1969, Keating's national reputation on the issue led to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] appointing him to the [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]], which had been begun under his predecessor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref name="cincmag-89"/><ref name="nyt091370">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10B11F63F5810718EDDAA0994D1405B808BF1D3 | title=Sharp Conflict Over Report On Smut | author=Halloran, Richard | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1970-09-13 | format=fee required}}</ref>  The majority on the commission developed a controversial report which concluded that pornography does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime, and recommended that all federal, state, and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed.<ref name="nyt091370"/>  Keating, Nixon's only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissident against this report.<ref name="nyt091370"/><ref name="nyt091070"/>  In September 1970, Keating gained a temporary [[restraining order]] from the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|D.C.

Keating then filed his dissenting report, stating, "At a time when the spread of pornography has reached epidemic proportions in our country and when the moral fiber of our nation seems to be rapidly unravelling, the desperate need is for enlightenment and intelligent control of the poisons which threaten us <U+2013> not the declaration of moral bankruptcy inherent in the repeal of the laws which have been the defense of decent people against the pornographer for profit."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00F1FFD355A157493C3A9178BD95F448785F9 | title=Excerpts From Panel's Majority Report, Dissenting Opinions and Other Views | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1970-10-01 | format=fee required}}</ref>  Keating also wrote, "One can consult all the experts he chooses, can write reports, make studies, etc., but the fact that obscenity corrupts lies within the common sense, the reason, and the logic of every man."<ref>{{cite book | last=Zurcher | first=Louis A. | title=Citizens for Decency: Antipornography Crusades as Status Defense | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | year=1976 | isbn=0292710321}} p. 340.</ref> The Nixon administration tacitly supported Keating's legal efforts,<ref name="nyt091370"/> and Counsellor to the President [[John Ehrlichman]] assigned White House speechwriter [[Pat Buchanan]] to help draft the dissenting report.<ref name="nyt100270">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0910FB355A157493C0A9178BD95F448785F9 | title=Senate Leaders in Both Parties Denounce Findings of Pornography Panel | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1970-10-02 | format=fee required}}</ref>  The commission's majority report was denounced by congressional leaders of both parties as well as by the administration.<ref name="nyt100270"/>

By 1975 and 1976, several stockholder lawsuits were filed against American Financial, and Keating was under fire for aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and the sale of the ''Enquirer''.<ref name="fort-77"/>  The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating, and others with having defrauded investors for their own benefit and filing false SEC reports.<ref name="cincmag-89"/><ref name="nyt070379"/>  At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms.<ref name="day-130"/>

Keating moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in 1976<ref name="lat031388"/> to run the [[real estate]] firm [[American Continental Homes]], a struggling, millions-losing homebuilding spin-off of American Financial that was given over to Keating for $300,000 as part of his departure package.<ref name="day-130"/><ref name="cincmag-89"/><ref name="fort-77"/><ref name="trust-130"/>  The move was completed <!-- my attempt to make sense of conflicting sources on the date --> when his family followed him in 1978.<ref name="trust-130"/> In 1979 the SEC case with American Financial was settled,<ref name="cincmag-89"/> with Keating signing a consent agreement where he neither admitted nor denied guilt but agreed not to violate federal fraud and securities statutes.<ref name="nyt070379">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50C10F73D5C11728DDDAA0894DF405B898BF1D3 | title=S.E.C.

Meanwhile, Keating benefitted from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start.<ref name="trust-az">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', pp. 18<U+2013>19, 136<U+2013>138.</ref>  He turned the now-renamed [[American Continental Corporation]] around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial.<ref name="ct-part-1"/><ref name="cincmag-89"/>  As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions.<ref name="ct-part-1"/><ref name="cincmag-89"/>  His son Charles Keating III had an especially fast career rise within the company.<ref name="lat031388"/><ref name="ct-part-1"/>

Having won the 1980 election, President [[Ronald Reagan]] contacted Keating about becoming [[United States Ambassador to the Bahamas|U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas]], where Keating had spent considerable time.<ref name="cincmag-89"/>  When Keating's run-in with the SEC resurfaced in press reports, however, he was dropped from consideration.<ref name="day-130"/><ref name="cincmag-89"/>  This dismayed Keating, who subsequently said, "To keep people like me out of positions like that because of yellow journalism, I don't know what good it does."<ref name="day-130"/>

Still deeply religious, Keating became a heavy giver to charity when he moved to Phoenix, donating $100,000 to the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], more than $1 million to [[Covenant House]], and another more than $1 million to [[Mother Teresa]]'s operations, including lending her his helicopter when she was in Arizona so that she could visit remote Indian reservations in the state.<ref name="lat031388"/><ref name="ct-part-1"/>  Covenant House's Father [[Bruce Ritter]] said of Keating, "He makes you believe in Providence."<ref name="lat031388"/>

==Failure of Lincoln and American Continental==
Lincoln stayed in business; from mid-1987 to April 1989, its assets grew from $3.91 billion to $5.46 billion.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  Following Keating's past practices with Lindner, American Continental also amassed a large collection of confusingly connected subsidiaries in real estate, banking, and insurance businesses; these numbered at least 54, and there were some overseas ones that auditors were not aware of.<ref>Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref>  Keating was triumphant in having defeated the regulators, whom he despised as useless relics from an outmoded financial past, and defended his high salary and business practices.<ref name="ct-part-2"/><ref>Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', p. 42.</ref>  Keating spent about $500,000 on radio advertisements in the Phoenix area to improve his public image; the commercials stressed his real estate projects and his family-oriented values.<ref name="lat031388"/>  A 1988 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' profile assessed Keating as "a businessman without apparent peer in Arizona in terms of riches, clout and color."<ref name="lat031388"/>  While Keating had taken Citizens for Decency through Law with him,<ref name="ct-part-1"/> he had generally deemphasized his anti-pornography work when he moved to Arizona.<ref name="day-130"/>  Nevertheless, X-rated movies and ''Playboy'' magazine were banned from his hotels.<ref name="ct-part-1"/>

Asked in an interview if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots of time. ... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night.

In September 1989, Keating was hit with a $1.1 billion fraud and [[racketeering]] action, filed against him by the regulators.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/business/seidman-assails-regulator-in-lincoln-savings-case.html | title=Seidman Assails Regulator In Lincoln Savings Case | author=Nash, Nathaniel C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 18, 1989}}</ref>  He proclaimed that, "We've lost everything in this thing, my wife and I.

By November 1989, the estimated cost of the overall [[savings and loan crisis]] had reached $500 billion, and the media's coverage often highlighted Keating's role as part of what became a [[media feeding frenzy|feeding frenzy]].<ref name="kurtz">{{cite book | last=Kurtz | first=Howard | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | title=Media Circus: The Trouble with America's Newspapers | publisher=[[Times Books]] | year=1994 | format=paperback |isbn=0-8129-6356-3}} pp. 69<U+2013>72.</ref>  Indeed, Keating and Lincoln Savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society,<ref name="trust-389">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', pp. 388<U+2013>389.</ref> as well as for 1980s greed in general,<ref name="ce020706"/> and were featured in popular culture references.<ref name="trust-389"/><ref name="TV.com:Simpsons">{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/lisas-first-word/episode/1354/summary.html | title=The Simpsons: Lisa's First Word | publisher=[[TV.com]] | accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  A deck of [[playing cards]] would be marketed, called "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the Keating Five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers.<ref name="az-keating"/><ref name="trust-389"/>

==Legal consequences==
Keating blamed government regulators for the failure of Lincoln Savings and filed suit in order to regain control over the bank. The suit was dismissed in August 1990, with the judge calling the seizure fully justified because of the looting of the institution by Keating and his associates.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DF153BF937A1575BC0A966958260 | title= Judge Rejects Keating Suit; Sees 'Looting' of Lincoln | author=Labaton, Stephen | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1990-08-24}}</ref>  By then, Keating's legal fees were running at $1 million a month.<ref name="ct-part-1"/>

In September 1990, Keating and his associates were [[indictment|indicted]] by the [[State of California]] on 42 counts related to having duped Lincoln's customers into buying worthless [[junk bond]]s of American Continental Corporation; Keating went to jail when he could not post a $5 million bond.<ref name="nyt091990"/>  He was convicted in December 1991 of 17 counts of [[fraud]], [[racketeering]], and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].<ref name="nyt041192"/> [[Mother Teresa]] asked the court to show leniency to Keating, in recognition of the considerable sums he had donated to her charitable operations.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DF1030F933A25756C0A964958260 | title=The 90's Chain Gang, A la Mother Teresa | author=Billard, Mary | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1992-05-10}}</ref> However, in April 1992, California Superior Court Judge [[Lance Ito]] gave Keating the maximum 10-year prison sentence, quoting [[Woody Guthrie]]'s line that "More people have suffered from the point of a fountain pen than from a gun."<ref name="nyt041192">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D81E3EF932A25757C0A964958260 | title= Keating Is Sentenced to 10 Years For Defrauding S.& L.

In May 1992, Keating's son-in-law [[Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr.]] (married to his daughter Elizabeth), a senior vice president of American Continental, and chief executive of an investment firm owned by Lincoln Savings,<ref name="stevenson1992"/> was also implicated, pleaded guilty to three federal fraud counts in connection with the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and agreed to testify against Keating.<ref name="stevenson1992">{{cite news | author=Stevenson, Robert W. | date=1992-05-16 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DF173DF935A25756C0A964958260 | title=Keating In-Law Enters Plea And Will Assist Prosecutors | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  (In December 1993, Wurzelbacher was sentenced to a 40-month prison term.)<ref name="nytstaff1993">{{cite news | date=1993-12-13 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DE123CF930A25751C1A965958260 | title=Keating Son-in-Law to Serve Prison Term | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

In January 1993, a federal conviction followed, on 73 counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy.<ref name="nyt070993">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDD1E3DF93AA35754C0A965958260 | title= Keating Sentence: 12<U+00BD> Years | author=Adelson, Andrea | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1993-07-09}}</ref> In July 1993, Keating was given a 12<U+00BD> year sentence.<ref name="nyt070993"/> The judge also ordered Keating to pay restitution of $122 million to the government, but Keating said he was $10 million in debt and had no assets to sell.<ref name="nyt070993"/>

One case filed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] was settled in 1994: Keating claimed to be bankrupt but agreed to repay millions should any hidden assets be discovered.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E0DE103DF936A25750C0A962958260 | title= Keating Settles With the S.E.C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1994-03-15}}</ref> A third case filed by the Resolution Trust Corporation resulted in a [[summary judgment]] of $4.3 billion against Keating and his wife in 1994,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EFDB1730F93BA15757C0A962958260 | title=Keating Faces New Judgment | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1994-04-28}}</ref> the largest judgment ever against a private person.<ref name="ce020706"/>  (The judgment was overturned on [[appeal]] in 1999, on grounds that Keating could not be held personally liable to the government without a specific criminal conviction or some other decision at trial.)<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DA1230F934A3575BC0A96F958260 | title= Appeals Court Rules In Favor of Keating | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1999-08-07}}</ref>

Throughout his imprisonment, Keating maintained his innocence, saying he was a "[[political prisoner]]" of the U.S. government and a scapegoat for the largest banking scandal in the nation's history.<ref name="si051595"/>

In April 1996, the [[9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[San Francisco]] ruled that state trial judge Ito had mistakenly allowed the jury to convict Keating by giving them faulty instructions as the law as regarding fraud.<ref name="nyt040496">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDF1339F937A35757C0A960958260 | title= U.S. Judge Overturns State Conviction of Keating |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1996-04-04}}</ref> Thus, the conviction was overturned.<ref name="nyt040496"/> In December 1996, the same Court of Appeals ruled that some of the [[jury trial|jurors]] in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and discussion of the results of the state case, and threw out the federal conviction.<ref name="nyt120396">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907EED6103CF930A35751C1A960958260 | title=Judge Throws Out Keating's Verdict | author=Sterngold, James | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1996-12-03}}</ref> Keating was now a free man after having spent 4<U+00BD> years in prison;<ref name="nyt120396"/> he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the thing he was proudest of that he had done.<ref name="ce020706"/>

In April 1999, on the eve of the retrial of the federal case, Keating entered a [[plea bargain|plea agreement]]. He admitted to having committed four counts of [[wire fraud|wire]] and [[bankruptcy fraud]] by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp. while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later. In return, the federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son, Charles Keating III. He was sentenced to the over four years time he had already served.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pr/072.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990921172635/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pr/072.htm | archivedate=1999-09-21 | title=Charles Keating pleads guilty to federal fraud charges; four criminal convictions resolve 10-year-old case | date=April 6, 1999 | publisher=[[United States Attorney for the Central District of California]] | author=Mrozek, Thom}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s lengthy profile of Keating in 1990 said in summary:
<blockquote>
To say that Charles Keating is a complex man seems a gross understatement. Some see him as an aggressive man who got desperate when the real estate market bottomed out and crossed the line between "business as usual" and fraud. Others see him as a con artist who finally got caught, a hyprocrite who masked his greed with phony piety.<ref name="ct-part-1"/>
</blockquote>

Michael Binstein and [[Charles Bowden]]'s 1993 book, ''Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions'', also presents Keating as a complex individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:
<blockquote>
Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If he is simply a thief, why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply trying to make a profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith, why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy?<ref>Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', p. 411.</ref>
</blockquote>

Keating steadfastly maintains that it was not his mistakes or criminal deeds but regulators' actions that were responsible for the major losses.<ref name="ce020706"/>  A 2004 [[Milken Institute]] study also makes the claim that regulators' actions were responsible for the Lincoln failure and presents Keating's actions in a favorable light.<ref>{{cite book | author=Nichols, Lawrence T. | coauthors=Nolan II, James J. | chapter=The Lesson of Lincoln: Regulation and Narrative in the Savings and Loan Crisis | pages=143<U+2013>172 | editor=James R.

Some of Keating's 1980s judgement as a developer was later validated.  The Phoenician became a successful hotel in the luxury segment,<ref name="dmr032199"/><ref name="trust-406"/> and the Estrella project achieved at least some of Keating's vision and was acquired again in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/realestate/homevalues/articles/2007/10/10/20071010vhv-goodyear1014-ON.html | title=Goodyear - 85338 | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=2007-10-10 | accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/09/12/20080912wv-exploratorium0912.html | title=Estrella Exploratorium puts focus on area's rich history | author=Koerner, Claudia | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=2008-09-12 | accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref>
