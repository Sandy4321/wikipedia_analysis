'''Alfred Waterhouse''' (19 July 1830 <U+2013> 22 August 1905) was an [[England|English]] [[architect]], particularly associated with the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Gothic revival]]. He is perhaps best known for his design for the [[Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], although he also built a wide variety of other buildings throughout the country. Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. Though expert within Gothic and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] styles, Waterhouse never limited himself to a single architectural style.

== Early life ==
[[Image:Elliott & Fry12.jpg|thumb|Alfred Waterhouse]]Waterhouse was born on the [[July 19|19th July]] 1830 in [[Aigburth]], [[Liverpool]], the son of wealthy mill-owning [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parents. His brothers were [[accountant]] [[Edwin Waterhouse]], co-founder of the ''Price Waterhouse'' partnership that now forms part of [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]], and [[solicitor]] [[Theodore Waterhouse]], who founded the firm of [[Waterhouse & Co.]] that continues to practice in the [[City of London]].<ref name=bhaw>{{cite web | publisher = David Nash Ford | date = 2003 | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/awaterhouse.html | title = Royal Berkshire History <U+2014> Alfred Waterhouse (1830<U+2013>1905) | accessdate = 2005-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Edwin | last = Waterhouse | title = The Memoirs of Edwin Waterhouse | publisher = Batsford | date = 1988 | isbn = 0713455799 | editor = Edgar Jones | url = http://www.biography-clarebooks.co.uk/item5902.htm}}</ref>

Alfred Waterhouse was educated at the Quaker run [[Grove School (Tottenham)|Grove School]] in [[Tottenham]] near [[London]]. He studied architecture under [[Richard Lane (architect)|Richard Lane]] in [[Manchester]], and spent much of his youth travelling in [[Europe]] and studying in [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. Upon his return to England, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester.<ref name=bhaw>{{cite web | publisher = David Nash Ford | date = 2003 | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/awaterhouse.html | title = Royal Berkshire History <U+2014> Alfred Waterhouse (1830<U+2013>1905) | accessdate = 2005-06-29}}</ref>

Waterhouse continued to practice in Manchester for 12 years, until moving his practice to London in 1865. Waterhouse's earliest commissions were for domestic buildings, but his success as a designer of public buildings was assured in 1859 when he won the open competition for the [[Manchester assize courts|Manchester Assize Courts]] (now demolished). This work not only showed his ability to plan a complicated building on a large scale, but also marked him out as a champion of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cause.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

In 1860, he married Elizabeth Hodgkin (1834-1918), the sister of the historian [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]].<ref name=nharch>{{cite web | title = Natural History Museum Archive Catalogue - Alfred Waterhouse | publisher = Natural History Museum | accessdate = 2007-11-09 | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/library/library-archives/catalogue/DServe.exe?dsqServer=placid&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code=='PX686'&dsqCmd=Show.tcl }}</ref>

== Domestic Buildings in County Durham ==
Waterhouse had connections with wealthy Quaker industrialist through schooling, marriage and religious affiliation. Many of these Quaker connections commissioned him to design and build country mansions, especially in the areas near Darlington. In [[Hurworth-on-Tees]] Waterhouse built Pilmore Hall for Alfred Backhouse, as well as The Grange in Hurworth, which Alfred Backhouse had commissioned as a wedding gift for his nephew, James. E. Backhouse. This building is now known as [[Hurworth Grange Community Centre]]. Another Backhouse family mansion designed and built by Waterhouse was Dryderdale Hll, near Hamsterley, which many might recognize as the home of head gangster Cyril Kinnear in the movie "Get Carter."{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In 1865, Waterhouse was one of the architects selected to compete for the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. The new [[University Club of New York]] was undertaken in 1866. In 1868 and nine years after his work on the Manchester Assize Courts, another competition secured for Waterhouse the design of [[Manchester Town Hall]], where he was able to show a firmer and more original handling of the Gothic style. The same year he was involved in rebuilding part of [[Caius College, Cambridge]]; this was not his first university work, for he had already worked on [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1867, and the new buildings of the [[Cambridge Union]] Society, in 1866.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

At Caius, out of deference to the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] treatment of the older parts of the college, this Gothic element was intentionally mingled with classic detail, while Balliol and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], which followed in 1871, are typical of the style of his mid career with Gothic tradition tempered by individual taste and by adaptation to modern needs. [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], a building of simpler type, dates originally from the same period (1870), but has been periodically enlarged by further buildings. Two important domestic works were undertaken in 1870 and 1871 respectively <U+2014> [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]] in [[Cheshire]] for the [[Duke of Westminster]], and [[Heythrop Hall]], [[Oxfordshire]], the latter a restoration of a fairly strict classic type.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref> 

[[Image:BritNatural History Museum2.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Natural History Museum has an ornate [[terracotta]] facade typical of high [[Victorian architecture]].]]Waterhouse received, without competition, the commission to build the [[Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]] (1873<U+2013>1881), a design which marks an epoch in the modern use of [[architectural terracotta]] and which was to become his best known work. Waterhouse's other works in London included the [[National Liberal Club]] (a study in Renaissance composition), [[University College Hospital]], the Surveyors' Institution in London's Great George Street (1896), and the [[Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine|Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] (1895).<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

From the late 1860s, Waterhouse lived in the [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] area and was responsible for several significant buildings there. These included his own residences of [[Foxhill House]] (1868) and [[Yattendon Court]] (1877), together with [[Museum of Reading|Reading Town Hall]] (1875) and [[Reading School]] (1870). Foxhill House is still in use by the [[University of Reading]], as are his [[Whiteknights House]] (built for his father) and [[Museum of English Rural Life|East Thorpe House]] (built in 1880 for [[Alfred Palmer]]).<ref name=bhaw>{{cite web | publisher = David Nash Ford | date = 2003 | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/awaterhouse.html | title = Royal Berkshire History <U+2014> Alfred Waterhouse (1830<U+2013>1905) | accessdate = 2005-06-29}}</ref>

For the [[Prudential plc|Prudential Assurance Company]], Waterhouse designed many offices, including their Holborn Bars head office in [[Holborn]] and branch offices in [[Southampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Leeds]]. He also designed offices for the [[NatWest|National Provincial Bank]] in [[Piccadilly]] (1892) and in Manchester. The [[Liverpool Infirmary]] was Waterhouse's largest hospital; and [[St Mary's Hospital, Manchester|St. Mary's Hospital]] in Manchester, the [[Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Rhyl]], and extensive additions at the [[Nottingham General Hospital]], also involved him. He was involved in a series of works for the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], of which he was made LL.D. in 1895.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

[[Image:142 Holborn Bars, London.jpg|thumb|thumb|left|Holborn Bars]]Other educational buildings designed by Waterhouse include [[University of Leeds|Yorkshire College, Leeds]] (1878), the [[Victoria Building, Liverpool University|Victoria Building]] for the [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool University College]] (now University of Liverpool) (1885), [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in [[Hammersmith]] (1881); and the [[Central Technical College]] in London's [[Exhibition Road, London|Exhibition Road]] (1881).<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

Among works not already mentioned are the [[Cambridge Union]] building and subsequently a similar building for the [[Oxford Union]]; [[Manchester (HM Prison)|Strangeways Prison]]; [[St Margaret's School, Bushey]]; the [[Metropole Hotel]] in [[Brighton]]; [[Hove Town Hall]]; [[Knutsford]] town hall; [[Alloa Town Hall]]; [[St Elisabeth's Church, Reddish|St. Elisabeth's church]] in [[Reddish]]; Darlington town clock, covered market hall and Backhouse's Bank (now Barclay's Bank); the [[King's Weigh House]] chapel in [[Mayfair]], [[Hutton Hall]] in [[Yorkshire]], St. Mary's Church in [[Twyford]], [[Hampshire]] (1878) shows interestingly similar patterning to the [[Natural History Museum]] and was designed at the same time.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>

== Recognition ==
Waterhouse became a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1861, and was President from 1888 to 1891. He obtained a grand prix for architecture at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition of 1867]], and a "Rappel" in 1878. In the same year he received the [[Royal Gold Medal]] of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was made an associate of the [[Royal Academy]], of which body he became a full member in 1885 and treasurer in 1898. He was also a member of the academies of [[Vienna]] (1869), [[Brussels]] (1886), [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] (1887), [[Milan]] (1888) and [[Berlin]] (1889), and a corresponding member of the [[Institut de France]] (1893). After 1886 he was constantly called upon to act as assessor in architectural competitions, and was a member of the international jury appointed to adjudicate on the designs for the west front of [[Milan Cathedral]] in 1887. In 1890 he served as architectural member of the Royal Commission on the proposed enlargement of [[Westminster Abbey]] as a place of burial.<ref name=eb1911>{{1911}}</ref>
