'''Fort Lowell''' was a [[United States]] [[U.S. Army|Army]] post active from 1873 to 1891 on the outskirts of [[Tucson, Arizona]].  Fort Lowell was the successor to Camp Lowell, an earlier Army installation.<ref name="oflna.org">http://www.oflna.org/fort_lowell_museum/ftlowell.htm Fort Lowell, retrieved June 28, 2009</ref> The Army chose a location just south of the confluence of the [[Tanque Verde Creek|Tanque Verde]] and [[Pantano Creek|Pantano]] creeks, at the point where they form the [[Rillito Wash]], due to the year-round supply of [[water]]. The [[Hohokam]] natives had chosen the site centuries early, presumably for the same reason. To this day, [[shards]] of Hohokam [[pottery]] can still be found in the area. The Army claimed a military reservation that encompassed approximately eighty square miles and extended east toward the [[Rincon Mountains]].<ref>http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ftlowell/thefort.html The Fort, retrieved June 28, 2009</ref>

==History==
===Old West Era===
The fort played a pivotal role during the [[Apache Wars]], providing additional protection for the Tucson area.  Far too large and well-manned to be attacked directly, Fort Lowell provided supplies and manpower for outlying military installations.  During its eighteen years of operation, the fort averaged thirteen officers and 239 enlisted men.  Among the units present during this period were the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd]], [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th]], [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th]] and [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th]] [[Cavalry Regiment]]s, as well as the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st]], [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th]], and [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th]] [[Infantry Regiment]]s.<ref name="oflna.org"/>

The orientation of the post was set according to magnetic north.  It featured a large parade grounds, officers' quarters, [[quartermaster]] and [[commissary]] storehouses, [[corrals]], quarters for [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] men as well as for married [[non-commissioned officer]]s.  The most prominent building on post was the [[hospital]], the [[adobe]] remnants of which still stand under a protective structure. A lane lined with [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] trees, aptly named Cottonwood Lane, graced the area in front of the officers' houses.

Among the more well known officers to have served at Fort Lowell were the young [[Walter Reed]], the Army [[physician]] famous for his [[yellow fever]] research, and [[Charles Bendire]], the amateur [[ornithologist]] after whom [[Bendire's Thrasher]] is named.

After the Army decommissioned the post in 1891, [[Mexico|Mexican]] families from [[Sonora]] soon moved north to take advantage of the free housing.  This occupation has become known as the ''El Fuerte'' Period.<ref>http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ftlowell/elfuerte.html El Fuerte, retrieved June 28, 2009</ref>

==Fort Lowell Today==

Fort Lowell lay in ruins for many years, its adobe structures slowly melting back into the desert.  [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] eventually converted the bulk of the former post into Old Fort Lowell Park, which features ball fields, tennis and racquetball courts, a large public swimming pool, and the Fort Lowell Museum dedicated to Fort Lowell's days as an active military installation.  Ft. Lowell also includes a large pond.

The city of Tucson now owns the park.  Tucson recently purchased the former Adkins property immediately west of Craycroft Road on which the last of the original officers' quarters stand. Plans indicated that they would be open to the public as a museum.  However, high levels of [[lead paint]] were found and the buildings were not opened.  On the north end of the former Adkins parcel stands a pile of large stones that, according to local lore, formed a wall of the guardhouse in which [[Geronimo]] was kept prior to his removal from Arizona.

===Fort Lowell Museum===

The Fort Lowell Museum is a branch museum of the [[Arizona Historical Society]], and is located in the reconstructed Commanding Officer's quarters. Exhibits focus on military life on the Arizona frontier. The Fort Lowell Historic District is the neighborhood located on or near Fort Lowell.  It is set aside as a [[historic district]].
