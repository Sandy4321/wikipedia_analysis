'''Muhammad Yunus''' ([[Bangla]]: <U+09AE><U+09C1><U+09B9><U+09BE><U+09AE><U+09CD><U+09AE><U+09A6> <U+0987><U+0989><U+09A8><U+09C1><U+09B8>, pronounced {{lang|bn-Latn|''Muhamm<U+00F4>d Iunus''}}) (born 28 June 1940) is a [[Bangladesh]]i [[bank]]er and [[economist]]. He previously was a [[professor]] of [[economics]] where he developed the concept of [[microcredit]]. These loans are given to [[entrepreneur]]s too poor to qualify for traditional [[bank loan]]s. Yunus is also the founder of [[Grameen Bank]]. In 2006, Yunus and the bank were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], "''for their efforts to create economic and social development from below''."<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006|author=|publisher=NobelPrize.org|date=2006-10-13|accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref> Yunus himself has received several other national and international honors. He is the author of ''[[Banker to the Poor]]'' and a founding board member of [[Grameen America]] and [[Grameen Foundation]]. In early 2007 Yunus showed interest in launching a political party in Bangladesh named Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power), but later discarded the plan. He is one of the founding members of [[Global Elders]]. Yunus also serves on the board of directors of the [[United Nations Foundation]], a public charity created in 1998 with [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Ted Turner]]<U+2019>s historic $1 billion gift to support [[United Nations]] causes.

==Grameen Bank ==
[[Image:Grameen.JPG|thumb|right|Grameen Bank Head Office at Mirpur-2, [[Dhaka]]]]
{{Main|Grameen Bank}}
In 1976, during visits to the poorest households in the village of Jobra near [[Chittagong University]], Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a poor person. Jobra women who made [[bamboo]] furniture had to take out [[usury|usurious]] loans for buying bamboo, to pay their profits to the moneylenders. His first loan, consisting of [[USD]] 27.00 from his own pocket, was made to 42 women in the village, who made a net profit of [[Bangladeshi taka|BDT]] 0.50 (USD 0.02) each on the loan, thus vastly improving Bangladesh's ability to export and import as it did in the past, resulting in a greater form of globalization and economic status.<ref name="$27"/>

The concept of providing credit to the poor as a tool of poverty reduction was not unique. Dr. [[Akhtar Hameed Khan]], founder of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (now [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]]), is credited for [[pioneer]]ing the idea.<ref name="Hamid">{{cite web |url=http://www.akhtar-hameed-khan.8m.com/statesman-10-20-06.html |title=7th Death Anniversary <U+2013> A Tribute to Dr. Akhter Hameed Khan |accessdate=2007-08-20 |last=Yousaf |first=Nasim |date=2006-10-17 |publisher=Statesman  }}</ref> From his experience at Jobra, Yunus, an admirer of Dr. Hameed,<ref name="Hamid" /> realized that the creation of an institution was needed to lend to those who had nothing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yunus |first=Muhammad  |title=[[Banker to the Poor]]: micro-lending and the battle against world poverty |coauthors= Jolis, Alan |origdate=2003-09-25 |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=PublicAffairs hc |location=New York  |isbn=978-1-58648-198-8|pages=46<U+2013>49}}</ref> While traditional [[bank]]s were not interested in making tiny loans at reasonable interest rates to the poor due to high repayment risks,<ref name = "BBC Profile">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Profile: 'World banker to the poor'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6047234.stm |work= |publisher=BBC NEWS |id= |pages= |page= |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2006-10-16  |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> Yunus believed that given the chance the poor will repay the borrowed money and hence [[microcredit]] could be a viable [[business model]].

Yunus finally succeeded in securing a loan from the government [[Janata Bank]] to lend it to the poor in Jobra in December 1976. The institution continued to operate by securing loans from other banks for its projects. By 1982, the bank had 28,000 members. On 1 October 1983 the pilot project began operations as a full-fledged bank and was renamed the [[Grameen Bank]] (''Village Bank'') to make loans to poor Bangladeshis. Yunus and his colleagues encountered everything from violent radical leftists to the conservative clergy who told women that they would be denied a Muslim burial if they borrowed money from the Grameen Bank.<ref name=Hero/> As of July 2007, Grameen Bank has issued US$ 6.38 billion to 7.4 million borrowers.<ref>[http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=175 GB at a glance], Muhammad Yunus, Grameen Info;''Retrieved: 2007-09-09''</ref> To ensure repayment, the bank uses a system of "solidarity groups". These small informal groups apply together for loans and its members act as co-guarantors of repayment and support one another's efforts at economic self-advancement.<ref name="Ramon"/> 

The Grameen Bank started to diversify in the late 1980s when it started attending to unutilized or underutilized fishing ponds, as well as irrigation pumps like deep tubewells.<ref name="IntFam">[http://203.112.193.71/grameen/gc/gfly.htm Introduction], Muhammad Yunus, Grameen Family; ''Retrieved: 2007-09-07''</ref> In 1989, these diversified interests started growing into separate organizations, as the fisheries project became [[Grameen Motsho]] (Grameen Fisheries Foundation) and the irrigation project became [[Grameen Krishi]] (Grameen Agriculture Foundation).<ref name="IntFam"/> Over time, the Grameen initiative has grown into a multi-faceted group of profitable and non-profit ventures, including major projects like [[Grameen Trust]] and [[Grameen Fund]], which runs equity projects like [[Grameen Software Limited]], [[Grameen CyberNet Limited]], and [[Grameen Knitwear Limited]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grameen-info.org/grameen/gfund/venture.htm |title=Grameen Fund ventures on Grameen official website |publisher=Grameen-info.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-14}}{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> as well as [[Grameen Telecom]], which has a stake in [[Grameenphone]] (GP), biggest private sector phone company in Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grameenphone.com/index.php?id=64 |title=About Grameenphone |accessdate=2007-08-22 |date=2006-11-16  |publisher=Grameenphone  |quote=Grameenphone is now the leading telecommunications service provider in the country with more than 10 million subscribers as of November 2006.}}{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> The [[Village Phone]] (Polli Phone) project of GP has brought cell-phone ownership to 260,000 rural poor in over 50,000 villages since the beginning of the project in March 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grameenphone.com/index.php?id=64 |title=Village Phone |accessdate=2007-08-22 |year=2006  |work=About Grameenphone | publisher=Grameenphone }}{{dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> 

The success of the Grameen model of microfinancing has inspired similar efforts in a hundred countries throughout the [[developing world]] and even in [[industrialized]] nations, including the United States.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/biz/2006/10/23/stories/2006102301011600.htm Grameen Bank, a Nobel-winning concept], The Hindu, 2006-10-23;''Retrieved: 2007-09-09''</ref> Many, but not all, microcredit projects also retain its emphasis on lending specifically to women.

{{blockquote|Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other countries. Loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty.}}

Muhammad Yunus was the first [[Bangladesh]]i and third [[Bengali people|Bengali]] to ever get a Nobel Prize. After receiving the news of the important award, Yunus announced that he would use part of his share of the $1.4 million award money to create a company to make low-cost, high-nutrition food for the poor; while the rest would go toward setting up an eye hospital for the poor in Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite news | title = Yunus wins peace Nobel for anti-poverty efforts | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15246216/ | agency = Associated Press | date = 2006-10-13 | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}</ref>
