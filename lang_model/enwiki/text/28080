'''Toni Michele Braxton''' (born October 7, 1967)<ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Derrick Bryson|title=Happy 45th Birthday, Toni Braxton!|url=http://www.essence.com/2012/10/07/happy-45th-birthday-toni-braxton/|accessdate=December 2, 2013|newspaper=[[Essence (magazine){{!}}Essence]]|date=October 7, 2012}}</ref> is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[pianist]], [[musician]], [[record producer]], [[actress]], [[television personality]], and [[philanthropist]]. Braxton has won six [[Grammy Award]]s, seven [[American Music Awards]], and nine [[Billboard Music Awards]]. Throughout the years, she has sold over 66 million records worldwide establishing herself as an R&B icon. Braxton was one of the best-selling female artist of the 1990s, garnering her honorific titles such as the "Queen of R&B".

Braxton topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with her 1993 [[Toni Braxton (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] and its hit singles "[[Love Shoulda Brought You Home]]", "[[Another Sad Love Song]]", "[[Breathe Again]]" and "[[You Mean the World to Me]]". She continued that streak with her second studio album, ''[[Secrets (Toni Braxton album)|Secrets]]'', which spawned the number-one hits "[[You're Makin' Me High]]" and "[[Unbreak My Heart]]" in 1996. Although she had successful albums and singles, Braxton filed for bankruptcy in 1998, but then returned with her chart-topping third album, ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]'' in 2000, which included the international hit single "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]". In 2009, she returned to the spotlight with "[[Yesterday (Toni Braxton song)|Yesterday]]", a No. 12 R&B hit which served as the first single from her new album ''[[Pulse (Toni Braxton album)|Pulse]]'', released on May 4, 2010, which debuted at No. 1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B Album Chart.<ref name="radio1.gr">{{cite web|author=Praxis Media |url=http://www.radio1.gr/music/forthcoming_uk_albums.htm |title=Radio1 Rodos Greece ::: UK Forthcoming Albums ::: Charts, DJ Promos, Dance, Lyrics, Free Mp3 Samples Downloads |publisher=Radio1.gr |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref> Braxton was involved in the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 7)|7th season]] of the reality show ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''. Her professional partner was [[Alec Mazo]]. She was voted off in week five of the competition. It was announced on October 6, 2010 that Braxton had once again filed for bankruptcy and was reporting somewhere between $1<U+2013>$50 million in debts. Braxton was later discharged of her debt. A reality series entitled ''[[Braxton Family Values]]'', starring Toni and her sisters, debuted April 12, 2011 on [[WE tv]]. WE tv ordered a 13-episode second season of the show after the third episode of the first season. On September 18, 2011, Braxton was inducted into the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]]. Braxton released the single "Hurt You" from her upcoming duet album with [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] entitled ''[[Love, Marriage & Divorce]]'' and as of December 2013 it marks her seventh ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Adult R&B No. 1 on the chart.

==Early life==

But according to Braxton during her appearance on the 24 May 2014 broadcast of [[NPR]]'s [[Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me]], she was not singing to herself at the gas station. Pettaway, working as an attendant at the [[Annapolis]] service station where she was refueling, recognized her from local performances and introduced himself, saying he wanted to produce her. Though skeptical, Braxton decided to, in her words, "take a chance" and accepted.

==Career==

===1989<U+2013>95: ''The Braxtons'' and album debut ''Toni Braxton''===
{{Main|The Braxtons}}
Braxton and her four sisters (Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar) began performing as ''[[The Braxtons]]'' in the late 1980s and were signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1989. Their first single, "[[Good Life (The Braxtons song)|Good Life]]", was released in 1990.<ref name="vibe">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/music/search/artist.html?id=UCAgICAzNzU3Ng |title=Toni Braxton |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |work=VIBE.com }}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> Though the song was not successful, it attracted the attention of [[Antonio "L.A." Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]].<ref name="vibe"/> Reid and Babyface recruited her to record a demo of "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", a song that they had written for Anita Baker for the soundtrack of [[Eddie Murphy]]'s film, ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. Baker, who was pregnant at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/women/singer/8c_toni_braxton.html |title=Toni Braxton |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |work=AskMen }}</ref> did not record the song but suggested, that Braxton record it. Her recording was later included on the soundtrack along with "[[Give U My Heart]]", a duet by Braxton and Babyface. Braxton, meanwhile, was signed to Reid and Edmonds' Arista-distributed imprint, [[LaFace Records]], and immediately began recording her solo debut album.

On July 13, 1993, LaFace Records released Braxton's self-titled debut album, ''[[Toni Braxton (album)|Toni Braxton]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Toni-Braxton/dp/B0000013G5|title=''Toni Braxton'': Music: Toni Braxton |accessdate=December 18, 2006|format=|work=Amazon.com}}</ref> The album, which was primarily produced by Reid, [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], and [[Daryl Simmons]], peaked at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=30331&aid=146011|title=Discography&nbsp;<U+2014> Toni Braxton - ''Toni Braxton''|accessdate=December 18, 2006|format=|work=Billboard.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929141413/http://billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=30331&aid=146011 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> The first single, "[[Another Sad Love Song]]", peaked at number seven and number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|R&B Singles]] charts respectively.<ref name="billboard singles">{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=30331&model.vnuAlbumId=146011 |title=Artist Chart History&nbsp;<U+2014> Toni Braxton |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |work=Billboard.com}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> The album's second single, "[[Breathe Again]]" peaked in the top five of both the Hot 100 and R&B singles charts<ref name="billboard singles"/> and no 2 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com |title=UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts |publisher=Everyhit.com |date=March 16, 2000 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> More singles from ''Toni Braxton'' were released in 1994, including "[[You Mean the World to Me]]", "[[Seven Whole Days]]", "[[I Belong to You (Toni Braxton song)|I Belong to You]]", and "[[How Many Ways]]".<ref name="billboard singles"/>

By 1996, Braxton had sold more than 20 million records. She was still waiting on her financial rewards, eventually launching an unsuccessful lawsuit against Arista and LaFace Records. Soon after, she filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Public reaction to these events was very harsh, having been expressed most clearly in an interview on ''Oprah Winfrey Show''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLjr4CQcrQ</ref> Upon successfully filing for bankruptcy, Braxton relinquished the rights to many of her valued possessions, including the Grammys and American Music Awards she had previously been granted.

Braxton has appeared on two [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows:  She made her Broadway debut as Belle in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (theatrical production)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' beginning September 9, 1998 when she replaced Kim Huber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/40798-Braxton-Taylor-Barbour-Beast-to-Be-Unveiled-Sept-9-New-Menken-Song-to-Follow|title=Braxton-Taylor-Barbour Beast to Be Unveiled Sept. 9; New Menken Song to Follow|accessdate=June 27, 2010 |work=playbill}}</ref> During her run in the show [[Alan Menken]] wrote a new song for the musical called "A Change in Me", which was specially written for Braxton and was used in the musical ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/41311-Toni-Braxton-Premieres-Beauty-s-New-Song-Oct-7-On-Rosie |title=Toni Braxton Premieres Beauty 's New Song, Oct. 7 On 'Rosie' |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> She left the production on February 28, 1999 and was succeeded by [[Andrea McArdle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/43273-Bways-Beauty-Turns-2000-Sat-Matinee-Jan-30-McArdle-Arrives-March-3 |title=Bway's Beauty Turns 2,000 Sat.

It also marked the first time a black woman would star in a Disney musical on Broadway. In 1999, the lawsuit against LaFace Records was settled and Toni was given back all her possessions, giving her time to record her first album in 4 years: The Heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifetimetv.com/shows/ip/portraits/0223/0223_bio.html|title=Toni Braxton|accessdate=December 18, 2006|work=Lifetime's intimate portrait}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

===2000<U+2013>01: ''The Heat''===
Finally after a 3 year dispute with LaFace and Arista, it was all settled and Toni signed a new $20 million contract. In March 2000, LaFace Records released "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]", the first single from Braxton's third studio album, ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]''. By June 2000, the song peaked at number two on the Hot 100 chart. ''The Heat'' was released on April 25, 2000. Debuting at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart with first week sales of 194,448 copies sold,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht692 |title=Previous Album Sales Chart |publisher=HITS Daily Double |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref> it remained in the top 20 for fifteen consecutive weeks. Braxton again worked with producers Babyface and Foster; also included in the staple were [[Rodney Jerkins]], and new beau musician [[Keri Lewis]]. Braxton herself also took a more hands-on approach, co-writing and co-producing a handful of the tracks. "Gimme Some", a track on "The Heat", featured a rap verse from [[TLC (band)|TLC]] star [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]]. The album's second single, "[[Just Be a Man About It]]", peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100 and number six on the R&B Charts. The third single, "[[Spanish Guitar (song)|Spanish Guitar]]", peaked at number 98 on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Dance & Club charts. The fourth single, "Maybe", peaked at 74 on the R&B charts. ''The Heat'' was certified double platinum in the US with over three million copies sold worldwide.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

In 2002, while gearing up for the release of her fourth studio album, Braxton discovered she was pregnant with her second child. Knowing that she wouldn't be able to promote the album properly, she unsuccessfully lobbied [[Arista Records]] to get the label to postpone its release until after she was to give birth. [[Arista Records]] refused and the album was released as planned in November 2002. It received very little promotion from Arista and Braxton herself, due to a complicated pregnancy, that's  confined her to [[bed rest]]. Braxton accused the company of being unwilling to compromise and punishing her from not putting her career over family.

===2002<U+2013>06: ''More Than a Woman'', new label, and ''Libra''===
In November 2002, Braxton's fourth studio album ''[[More Than a Woman (album)|More Than a Woman]]'' was released.  Opening to an instant commercial disappointment, the album peaked at number 13.  The first single, [[The Neptunes]] -produced "[[Hit the Freeway]]", failed at radio and peaked at number 86 on the Hot 100. The two singles, that followed ("A Better Man", "Lies, Lies, Lies") were scrapped, failed to make a dent and missed the Hot 100 completely. ''More Than a Woman'' was certified gold by [[RIAA]] and sold more than 800,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="musicmp3.ru">{{cite web|url=http://musicmp3.ru/artist_toni-braxton.html |title=Toni Braxton mp3 music download |publisher=MusicMp3.Ru |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref> Prior to the release of the album, a dispute erupted between Braxton and [[Irv Gotti]], when he played a rough cut of "No More Love", a song that he produced for the album, that was to be the first single. Disapproving of Gotti broadcasting the unfinished track, Braxton withheld it from being released. The same year, Braxton was further annoyed, when [[Jay-Z]] used the same sample of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]]'s "Me and My Girlfriend", that she had already used on her track "Me & My Boyfriend" for his and Beyonc<U+00E9>'s "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]".

She then starred in ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' as Aida beginning June 30, 2003 when she replaced [[Simone (actress)|Simone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12037443|title=Toni Braxton Set To Return To Broadway|accessdate=December 19, 2006|format=|work=Yahoo!

In April 2003, Braxton abruptly left Arista Records, having been there for 14 years, and immediately signed with [[Blackground Records]], headed by [[Barry Hankerson]], her manager at the time. The change of scenery, however, did not ultimately help her recording career. As had been the case during her final years at Arista, Braxton's fifth album, and first release on Blackground, ''[[Libra (Toni Braxton album)|Libra]]'' (2005) was released.

In 2004, Braxton appeared as herself, voicing a singing character named Toni, in a special episode and DVD release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6760640|title=Blues Clues: Bluestock DVD Movie|accessdate=August 19, 2010|format=|work=CDUniverse.com}}</ref> of the children's television show ''[[Blue's Clues]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0527963/|title="Blue's Clues" Bluestock (2004)|accessdate=August 19, 2010|format=|work=IMDb}}</ref>

In September 2004, it was announced that Braxton would star in a half-hour [[sitcom]] pilot where she would play a version of herself for [[The WB Television Network]]'s fall 2006-07 line-up, though plans to put the show into full-production fell through once The WB announced it would cease to exist in fall 2006 (as part of a merger with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Development Update: September 29-30|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/09/30/development-update-september-29-30-17006/6747/|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=November 6, 2013|date=September 30, 2004}}</ref> She has also starred in the TV sitcom, ''Kevin Hill''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/toni.s%20tv%20deal|title=Toni's TV Deal|accessdate=January 24, 2007|format=|work=Contact Music|date=September 20, 2004}}</ref>

In April 2005, Braxton's new label, Blackground/Universal, released "[[Please (Toni Braxton song)|Please]]", the first single from her fifth album, ''[[Libra (Toni Braxton album)|Libra]]''. The album was originally planned for a June release, but it was pushed back several times and was finally issued on September 27. Unfortunately for Braxton, her troubles with weak album promotion and lack of label commitment weren't over. "Please" peaked at number 36 on ''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the Hot 100.

''Libra'' still managed to debut at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 selling 114,593 copies in the first week. ''Libra'' also peaked at number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Although that is strong for an album with little to no promotion, it became yet another commercial disappointment for Braxton. The album's second single, "[[Trippin' (That's the Way Love Works)]]", received less airplay and peaked at number 67 on the R&B chart. The failure was ascribed to the non-video presence of the single and lack of label support. The album was certified gold in late 2005 and has since sold 679,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="musicmp3.ru"/>

Braxton, meanwhile, recorded a song with [[Il Divo]] titled "[[The Time of Our Lives]]". The song was used as the official [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] anthem and was performed at the championship's opening day in [[Berlin, Germany]] on June 9. The song was also performed at the closing ceremonies making Braxton and Il Divo the first artists to be asked to perform for the opening and closing ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16862049&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=fiona--divo--name_page.html|title=FIONA: DIVO|accessdate=December 18, 2006 |work=Mirror.co.uk}}</ref>

The [[2013 Summer Tour]] kicked off in Las Vegas on August 9, 2013 and ended in Atlanta on August 31, 2013.

==Artistry==
Braxton has been recognized for her distinctive [[dramatic contralto]] voice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-03-24/entertainment/hc-toni-braxtons-concert-at-foxwoods-20120324_1_toni-braxton-angel-break-concert-review|title=Concert Review: Toni Braxton's Sultry Delivery Scores At Foxwoods|last=Kintner|first=Thomas|date=March 24, 2012|publisher=courant.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="books.google.ca">{{Cite book|title=Rock-N-Roll Gold Rush |last=Dean |first= Maury|authorlink= |year= 2003|publisher= Algora Publishing|location= |isbn= 0-87586-207-1|page= 34|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lJS4EArRBwoC&dq=Rock-N-Roll+Gold+Rush+mariah+carey&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&q=whitney+houston#PPA34,M1}}</ref> Her voice has been called "husky, sultry, elegant and sexy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myplay.com/artists/toni-braxton|title=My Play: Toni Braxton}}</ref> Due to the huskiness of her voice, Braxton often used male singers such as [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] as vocal style models.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/toni-braxton-mn0000935330 |title=Toni Braxton&nbsp;<U+2014> Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref> [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Anita Baker]] were two of the few female singers that she could stylize. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] cites a key to Braxton's success is the versatility of her voice, which he states as being "soulful enough for [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] audiences, but smooth enough for [[adult contemporary]]; sophisticated enough for adults, but sultry enough for younger listeners; strong enough in the face of heartbreak to appeal to women, but ravishing enough to nab the fellas."

Braxton began her career singing traditional R&B and adult contemporary ballads and love songs on her debut and second albums. However, [[hip-hop soul]] and [[dance music]] elements begun to get spun into her sound on ''The Heat'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-heat-mw0000256509|title=The Heat Review}}</ref> ''More Than a Woman'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/more-than-a-woman-mw0000224666|title=More Than A Woman}}</ref> and ''Pulse''. She also showcased her classical training while performing in Broadway plays ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Aida]]'' as well as her duet with [[Il Divo]], "The Time of Our Lives".

==Legacy==

Toni Braxton became an immediate R&B superstar after the release of her first album. LA Reid stated during an interview with [[Vh1]]: "We called her the first lady of LaFace. She was our Diva. [[Clive Davis|Clive]] had [[Whitney Houston|Whitney]], [[Tommy Mottola|Tommy]] had [[Mariah Carey|Mariah]] and we had Toni." BBC called the album "spiritedly, mature soul at its best <U+2013> and just urban enough to make it the bedroom album for the hip hop generation." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/j4fd |title=Music - Review of Toni Braxton - Toni Braxton |publisher=BBC |date=1993-07-13 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Braxton had the sound of R&B greats like [[Anita Baker]] and the sex appeal to compete with fellow superstars [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. Over the span of her career Braxton has sold over 66 million records worldwide.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Braxton's musical catalog contains many classics that have won her many accolades. Her greatest is "[[Un-Break My Heart]]", the [[Diane Warren]]-penned ballad that spent 11-weeks at number 1. Bob McCann, author of ''Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television'' (2010), considered it "simply one of the most haunting R&B records ever made." Reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R&B break-up songs and considered it Braxton's "finest moment". He further commented, "damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time." It's Braxton's ability to capture her audience that plays a factor in her continuous success.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Braxton is a recipient of six [[Grammy Award]]s, seven [[American Music Awards]], and nine [[Billboard Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Throughout Braxton's career she made several impacts on fashion mostly for her legendary high splits in her dresses. Her now famous [[Richard Tyler (designer)|Richard Tyler]] white satin gown has gone down in history as one of the most revealing and sexiest dresses. In 2011, Braxton topped the list for the [[Grammy Award]]'s best dressed of the decade.<ref>{{cite news|author=February 10, 2011, 7:54 PM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grammy-fashion-the-best-and-worst-of-the-decade/ |title=Grammy Fashion: The Best and Worst of the Decade |publisher=CBS News |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> "I've always gone a little risque with all my other award show outfits." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/racy-grammy-dresses-419267#2-toni-braxton |title=Racy Grammy Dresses |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2013-02-08 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |first=Emily |last=Helwig}}</ref> In 2012, Braxton made the list for [[VH1]'s] 50 Greatest Women in Music.

Braxton said: "I think it's a great element to the show. You have to have a little sprinkle of [[Liberace]] and this is my little sprinkle of that." Braxton's famous prop was made up of white gold and encrusted with 650 karats of diamonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/09/01/braxtons-million-dollar-baby/ |title=Braxton's Million Dollar Baby |publisher=TMZ.com |date=2006-01-09 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> The microphone reportedly cost $1 million.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Braxton's legacy has inspired countless other artists. For example, R&B artist [[Sevyn Streeter]] cites Braxton as an influence on her career. Streeter posted to her website after meeting Braxton at the [[Soul Train Awards]]: "Ran into this remarkable woman @tonibraxton backstage at the @soultrain awards!!!! yup, I freaked out .....can't tell in this pic but the freak out was real Lol!" R&B singer [[Fantasia Barrino|Fantasia]] confessed her admiration for Braxton in an interview with ''Singer's Room'': "I watched the Braxton show and I was listening to Toni Braxton...she was talking about how she lost the passion and the love for music, and I almost broke down and cried." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://singersroom.com/content/2013-05-15/EXCLUSIVE-Fantasia-Talks-Personal-Album-Almost-Quitting-Toni-Braxton-Not-Doing-Music-More/#jKu4mmstryprt8xj.99 |title=Videos &#124; EXCLUSIVE: Fantasia Talks Personal Album, Almost Quitting, Toni Braxton Not Doing Music, More |publisher=Singersroom |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Braxton has also been referenced by many of today's Hip-Hop/R&B artist such as [[Ludacris]] in the song "[[Wet the Bed]]", from [[Chris Brown]]'s album ''[[F.A.M.E. (album)|F.A.M.E.]]'' (2009).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Personal life==

Braxton met musician [[Keri Lewis]] when his group, [[Mint Condition]], opened for her on tour; they married on April 21, 2001. On December 2, 2001, she gave birth to their first child, a son named Denim Cole Braxton-Lewis. In 2002, while gearing up for the release of her fourth studio album, Braxton discovered she was pregnant with her second child; the complicated pregnancy confined her to [[bed rest]]. The couple's second son, Diezel Ky Braxton-Lewis, was born on March 31, 2003. As Diezel has been diagnosed with [[autism]], Braxton has become very involved with [[Autism Speaks]], serving as their International Spokesperson. In November 2009, through her attorney [[Antavius Weems]], Braxton announced that she and her husband had separated. On July 24, 2013, their divorce was finalized after four years of separation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Braxton's godsister is Toi Garcia, a former [[Auburn University]] gymnast.<ref>http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/w-gym/mtt/garcia_toi00.html</ref>

===Health problems===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2014}} 
As of August 2007, rumors surfaced that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Braxton stated to ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', that the breast cancer rumors were false and that her health is in great condition. However, in 2008, she had a [[Benign tumor|benign]] lump removed from her breast.

On April 8, 2008, near the end of her two-year run at the [[Flamingo Hotel]], Braxton was briefly hospitalized and the remaining dates on the show, which was scheduled to end on August 23, 2008, were canceled. Later, while appearing on Season 7 of ''Dancing with the Stars'', she stated, that she has been diagnosed with [[Microangiopathy|microvascular angina]] (small vessel disease).

On November 18, 2010, Braxton admitted to [[CBS News]] that she had been diagnosed with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), a potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. Braxton's brother is also a carrier of the disease, and her uncle died of complications from lupus. While taping her reality series ''[[Braxton Family Values]]'', she went in for surgery. Braxton was hospitalized in [[Los Angeles]] in December 2012 because of "minor health issues" related to [[lupus]].
