A '''conspiracy theory''' attempts to attribute the ultimate cause of an event or chain of events (usually [[political]], [[social]], or [[historical]] events), or the concealment of such causes from [[public]] knowledge, to a [[secrecy|secret]], and often [[deception|deceptive]] plot by a [[covert]] [[coalition|alliance]] of powerful or influential people or organizations. Many conspiracy theories claim that major events in history have been dominated by conspirators who manipulate political happenings from behind the scenes. 

==Terminology==

The term "conspiracy theory" may be a neutral descriptor for any [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] claim. To ''conspire'' means "to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end."<ref>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, p. 243 (8th ed. 1976).</ref> However, conspiracy ''theory'' is also used to indicate a [[narrative]] [[genre]] that includes a broad selection of (not necessarily related) arguments for the existence of grand conspiracies, any of which might have far-reaching social and political implications if true.

The first recorded use of the phrase "conspiracy theory" dates to the year 1909.  Originally a neutral term, the term from about the 1960's acquired its current and more specific meaning. <ref>"20th Century Words" (1999) John Ayto, Oxford University Press, page 15 </ref> It entered the supplement to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as late as 1997.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6213226.stm Plots, paranoia and blame] by Peter Knight, BBC News 7 Dec 2006</ref>

The term "conspiracy theory" is used by mainstream scholars and in [[popular culture]] to identify a type of [[folklore]] similar to an [[urban legend]], especially an explanatory narrative which is constructed with particular [[methodological]] flaws.<ref>Johnson, 1983</ref> The term is also used [[pejorative]]ly to dismiss claims that are  alleged by critics to be misconceived, paranoid, unfounded, outlandish, irrational, or otherwise unworthy of serious consideration. For example "Conspiracy nut" and "conspiracy theorist" are used as pejorative terms. Some whose theories or speculations are labeled a "conspiracy theory" reject the term as prejudicial.

Whether or not a particular conspiracy allegation may be impartially or neutrally labeled a conspiracy theory is subject to [[Conspiracy theory#Controversies|some controversy]]. Conspiracy theory has become a highly charged political term, and the broad critique of 'conspiracy theorists' by [[academics]], [[politicians]], [[psychologists]], and the [[mass media|media]] cuts across traditional left-right political lines.

The [[United States|US]] academic [[Noam Chomsky]] contrasts conspiracy theory as more or less the opposite of [[institutional analysis]], which focuses mostly on the public, long-term behaviour of publicly known institutions, as recorded in, e.g. scholarly documents or [[mainstream media]] reports, rather than secretive coalitions of individuals.<ref name="chomsky_inst_vs_conspiracy">{{cite web| last =Chomsky| first =Noam| authorlink =Noam Chomsky| coauthors =| title =9-11: Institutional Analysis vs. Conspiracy Theory| work =| publisher =[[Z Communications]]| date =2006-10-06| url =http://blog.zmag.org/node/2779 |format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-04-17}}</ref>

==Conspiracism==
Because conspiracy theories lack readily verifiable evidence, they are not taken seriously by most people.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} This raises the question of what mechanisms might exist in popular culture that lead to their invention and subsequent uptake. In pursuit of answers to that question, conspiracy theory has become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in folklore since at least the 1960s, when the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] eventually provoked an unprecedented public response directed against the official version of the case as expounded in the Report of the [[Warren Commission]].

A world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history is sometimes termed ''conspiracism''. The historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] addressed the role of [[paranoia]] and conspiracism throughout [[American history]] in his essay ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'', published in [[1964]]. The term ''conspiracism'' was popularized by academic [[Frank P. Mintz]] in the [[1980s]]. Academic work in conspiracy theories and conspiracism presents a range of hypotheses as a basis of studying the genre. Among the leading scholars of conspiracism are: Hofstadter, [[Karl Popper]], [[Michael Barkun]], [[Robert Alan Goldberg]], [[Daniel Pipes]], [[Mark Fenster]], Mintz, [[Carl Sagan]], [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]], and [[Gerald Posner]].

According to Mintz, conspiracism denotes: "belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history":<ref>{{cite book

<blockquote>"Conspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere. It identifies elites, blames them for economic and social catastrophes, and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power. As such, conspiracy theories do not typify a particular epoch or ideology".<ref>{{cite book

Throughout human history, political and economic leaders genuinely ''have'' been the cause of enormous amounts of death and misery, and they sometimes have engaged in conspiracies while at the same time promoting conspiracy theories about their targets. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would be merely the most prominent examples; there have been numerous others.<ref>{{cite book

<blockquote>"But if conspiracies exist, they rarely move history; they make a difference at the margins from time to time, but with the unforeseen consequences of a logic outside the control of their authors: and this is what is wrong with 'conspiracy theory.' History is moved by the broad forces and large structures of human collectivities."<ref>{{cite book

The term ''conspiracism'' is used in the work of [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], [[Chip Berlet]], and Matthew N. Lyons.

According to Berlet and Lyons, "Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm".<ref>{{cite book

==Arguments supporting conspiracy==
Conspiracy is argumented by using: 1) common logic 2) strong evidence 3) human experience. If all these elements are existing in any sequence of related events, a conspiracy existence is possible. During history, it has been proven many times over that all sorts of conspiracies have been planned, organized, and brought to completion. 

According to this basic and undeniable facts, it would be very unwise to apriori rule out or to apriory accept any conspiracy existence. The probability of conspiracy existence can be judged fair if and only if the arguments PRO and CONTRA are carefully compared and weighted against each other in all three categories above.

==General arguments against conspiracism==
Many people tend to respond to events or situations which have had an emotional impact upon them by trying to make sense of those events, typically in spiritual, moral, political, or scientific terms. 

Events which seem to resist such interpretation&mdash;for example, because they are, in fact, unexplainable&mdash;may provoke the inquirer to look harder for a meaning, until one is reached that is capable of offering the inquirer the required emotional satisfaction.  

At other times, the unfolding of complex sequences of events such as political phenomena are explainable, but not in simple terms. Conspiracy theories are often preferred by individuals as a way to understand what is happening around them without having to grasp the complexities of history and political interaction.

As sociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for the origins of [[World War I]]:

:''Those events that are most important are hardest to understand, because they attract the greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans.''

This normal process could be diverted by a number of influences. At the level of the individual, pressing psychological needs may influence the process, and certain of our universal mental tools may impose [[epistemology|epistemic]] 'blind spots'. At the group or sociological level, historic factors may make the process of assigning satisfactory meanings more or less problematic.

Alternatively, conspiracy theories may arise when evidence available in the public record does not correspond with the common or official version of events. In this regard, conspiracy theories may sometimes serve to highlight 'blind spots' in the common or official interpretations of events.(Fenster, 1999)

===Psychological origins===
According to some [[psychologist]]s, a person who believes in one conspiracy theory is often a believer in other conspiracy theories and conversely for a person who does not believe in one conspiracy theory there is a lower probability that he, or she, will believe in another one.<ref> {{cite journal

This may be attributable to differences in the information upon which parties rely in formulating their conclusions. Thus, a person who believes in a particular conspiracy theory may do so because of awareness of information, such as that a certain political leader was a member of an enigmatic [[secret society]], of which some who disbelieve the conspiracy theory may not be aware. In turn, awareness of such information may be correlated with awareness of other information which increases the likelihood that one will believe in other conspiracy theories. Conversely, the lack of awareness of such information may be correlated with the lack of awareness of other information which decreases the likelihood that one will believe in other conspiracy theories.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Psychologists believe that the search for meaningfulness features largely in conspiracism and the development of conspiracy theories. That desire alone may be powerful enough to lead to the initial formulation of the idea{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Once cognized, [[confirmation bias]] and avoidance of [[cognitive dissonance]] may reinforce the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become popular within a social group, [[communal reinforcement]] may equally play a part. 

Some research recently carried out at the [[University of Kent]], UK suggests that people may actually be influenced by conspiracy theories without being aware that their attitudes have changed.  After reading popular conspiracy theories about the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], participants in this study correctly estimated how much their peers' attitudes had changed, but significantly underestimated how much their own attitudes had changed to become more in favour of the conspiracy theories. The authors conclude that conspiracy theories may therefore have a 'hidden power' to influence people's beliefs.<ref> {{cite journal

[[Evolutionary psychology]] may also play a significant role. Paranoid tendencies are associated with an animal's ability to recognize danger{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Higher animals attempt to construct mental models of the thought processes of both rivals and predators in order to read their hidden intentions and to predict their future behavior. Such an ability is extremely valuable in sensing and avoiding danger in an animal community. If this danger-sensing ability should begin making false predictions, or be triggered by benign evidence, or otherwise become pathological, the result is paranoid delusions.

====Projection====

Some historians have pointed out the element of [[psychological projection]] in conspiracism; that is, the attribution to the supposed "conspirators" of undesirable characteristics of the self. [[Richard Hofstadter]], in his essay ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'', stated that:

<blockquote>...it is hard to resist the conclusion that this enemy is on many counts the projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. The enemy may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship... the Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through "front" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist "crusades" openly express their admiration for the dedication and discipline the Communist cause calls forth.</blockquote>

Hofstadter also noted that "sexual freedom" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that "very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments."<ref>Hofstadter, Richard. The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Harper's Magazine, November 1964, pp. 77-86.</ref>

====Epistemic bias?====
It is possible that certain basic human [[Epistemology|epistemic]] biases are projected onto the material under scrutiny. According to one study humans apply a 'rule of thumb' by which we expect a significant event to have a significant cause.<ref>"[http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/annual-conferences-1999-2004/who-shot-the-president$.cfm Who shot the president?]," The British Psychological Society, March 18, 2003 (accessed June 7, 2005).</ref> The study offered subjects four versions of events, in which a foreign president was (a) successfully assassinated, (b) wounded but survived, (c) survived with wounds but died of a heart attack at a later date, and (d) was unharmed. Subjects were significantly more likely to suspect conspiracy in the case of the 'major events'&mdash;in which the president died&mdash;than in the other cases, despite all other evidence available to them being equal. 

Another epistemic 'rule of thumb' that can be misapplied to a mystery involving other humans is [[cui bono]]? (who stands to gain?). This sensitivity to the hidden motives of other people might be either an evolved or an encultured feature of human consciousness, but either way it appears to be universal. If the inquirer lacks access to the relevant facts of the case, or if there are structural interests rather than personal motives involved, this method of inquiry will tend to produce a falsely conspiratorial account of an impersonal event{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The direct corollary of this epistemic bias in pre-scientific cultures is the tendency to imagine the world in terms of [[animism]]. Inanimate objects or substances of significance to humans are [[Fetishism|fetishised]] and supposed to harbor benign or malignant spirits.

====Clinical psychology====
For relatively rare individuals, an obsessive compulsion to believe, prove or re-tell a conspiracy theory may indicate one or more of several well-understood psychological conditions, and other hypothetical ones: [[paranoia]], [[denial]], [[schizophrenia]], [[mean world syndrome]].<ref>"[http://www.columbia.edu/~kw96/TopFive.html#Anchor-Media-54000 Top 5 New Diseases: Media Induced Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (MIPTSD)]," ''The New Disease: A Journal of Narrative Pathology'' 2 (2004), (accessed June 7, 2005).</ref>

===Socio-political origins===
[[Image:Viktor Yuschenko.jpg|thumb|Metamorphoses with [[Viktor Yushchenko|Yuschenko]] have been explained in 2004 by a plot of Russian [[KGB|KGB]] with the purpose of capture of Ukraine.]]

[[Christopher Hitchens]] represents conspiracy theories as the 'exhaust fumes of democracy', the unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large number of people. Other social commentators and sociologists argue that conspiracy theories are produced according to variables that may change within a democratic (or other type of) society. 

Conspiratorial accounts can be emotionally satisfying when they place events in a readily-understandable, moral context. The subscriber to the theory is able to assign moral responsibility for an emotionally troubling event or situation to a clearly-conceived group of individuals. Crucially, that group ''does not include'' the believer. The believer may then feel excused of any moral or political responsibility for remedying whatever institutional or societal flaw might be the actual source of the dissonance.<ref>{{cite news

}}"Conspiracy theories explain disturbing events or social phenomena in terms of the actions of specific, powerful individuals," said sociologist Theodore Sasson at Middlebury College in Vermont. By providing simple explanations of distressing events &mdash; the conspiracy theory in the Arab world, for example, that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were planned by the Israeli Mossad &mdash; they deflect responsibility or keep people from acknowledging that tragic events sometimes happen inexplicably."</ref>

Where responsible behavior is prevented by social conditions, or is simply beyond the ability of an individual, the conspiracy theory facilitates the emotional discharge or [[closure (psychology)|closure]] that such emotional ''challenges'' (after [[Erving Goffman]]){{Fact|date=June 2007}} require. Like [[moral panic]]s, conspiracy theories thus occur more frequently within communities that are experiencing [[Social alienation|social isolation]] or political dis-empowerment. 

Mark Fenster argues that "just because overarching conspiracy theories are wrong does not mean they are not on to something. Specifically, they ideologically address real structural inequities, and constitute a response to a withering civil society and the concentration of the ownership of the means of production, which together leave the political subject without the ability to be recognized or to signify in the public realm" (1999: 67). 

For example, the contemporary form of [[anti-Semitism]] is identified in Britannica 1911 as a conspiracy theory serving the self-understanding of the European [[aristocracy]], whose social power waned with the rise of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society.<ref>"[http://54.1911encyclopedia.org/A/AN/ANTI_SEMITISM.htm Anti-Semitism]," 1911 Online Encyclopedia, (accessed June 7, 2005).</ref> 

Throughout history, antisemitism is prominent in conspiracy theories. According to [[Kenneth S. Stern]], 
<blockquote>"Historically, Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories. Such ideas fuel anti-Semitism. The myths that Jews [[deicide|killed Christ]], or [[well poisoning|poisoned wells]], or [[blood libel against Jews|killed Christian children to bake matzo]], or [[Holocaust denial|"made up" the Holocaust]], or plot to control the world, do not succeed each other; rather, the list of anti-Semitic canards gets longer. The militia movement today believes in the conspiracy theory of the ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols]]'', even if some call it something else and never mention Jews. From the perspective of history, we know that this is the type of climate in which anti-Semitism can grow."<ref>Kenneth Stern (1997): ''A Force upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate''. University of Oklahoma Press. p.247</ref></blockquote>

====Disillusionment====
In the late 20th century, falling election participation and declines in other key metrics of social engagement were noted by several observers. For a prominent example, see [[Robert Putnam|Robert D. Putnam's]] ''[[Bowling Alone]]'' thesis. Those who were most influenced by this period, the so-called "[[Generation X]]," are characterized by their [[cynicism]] towards traditional institutions and authorities, offering a case example of the context of political dis-empowerment detailed above.

In that context, a typical individual will tend to be more isolated from the kinds of peer networks that grant access to broad sources of information, and may instinctively distrust any statement or claim made by certain people, media, and other authority-bearing institutions. For some individuals, the consequence may be a tendency to attribute anything bad that happens to the distrusted authority. For example, some people attribute the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] to a conspiracy involving the U.S. government (or disfavored politicians) instead of or along with [[Islamist terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] associated with [[Al-Qaeda]] (see [[9/11 conspiracy theories]].) Such charges may also be colored with political motivation. Similar charges (in some circles) were made that the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration was in some way culpable for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941.

====The "Rationality Theorem"====

Another criticism of conspiracy theories is that they rely on a certain worldview which may or may not be correct. [[Graham Allison]], a [[political scientist]], developed this argument in his book, ''[[Essence of Decision]]'', and informally named it the "[[rationality theorem]]".

Basically, Allison argued: 

* Many theories - including conspiracy theories - rely on the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. Under this assumption, events and decisions are explained by the rational responses of groups and individuals.
* However, Allison pointed out that groups and individuals do not always act in a rational manner.
* Allison argued that by using rationalistic thinking, individuals automatically take a "[[black box]]" approach to problems, meaning that they concentrate on data that was available and the results, but failed to consider other factors, such as [[bureaucracy]], misunderstandings, disagreements, etc.
* Finally, Allison argued that rationalistic thinking in general violates the scientific law of [[falsifiability]], as according to the rationality theorem, there exists no event or groups of events that cannot be explained in a rational and purposeful manner.

Although Allison primarily studied the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], in ''Essence'', he illustrated the rationality theorem by making reference to the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], specifically the theory that U.S. decisionmakers must have purposefully allowed the attack to be pulled off.

Allison argued that, for this specific conspiracy theory to hold, analysts must first make the ''assumption'' that officials act in a rational manner, and that these officials had full access to all information that indicated the attack was imminent.

However, by examining additional internal evidence, Allison argued that while, from a black-box perspective, the U.S. had enough evidence of the Pearl Harbor attack, a combination of bureaucracy and misunderstandings was the real reason why the attack succeeded. For example, Allison noted that evidence of the upcoming attack was scattered among different governmental departments, and was not immediately combined to create an entire picture. Likewise, some decisionmakers misinterpreted the data at hand - on [[December 7]], [[1941]], the base at Pearl Harbor actually was on alert, but the alert was for possible Japanese [[sabotage]], not an all-out aerial attack.

====Media tropes====
Media commentators regularly note a tendency in news media and wider culture to understand events through the prism of individual agents, as opposed to more complex structural or institutional accounts.<ref>Ivan Emke, "[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=585&layout=html Agents and Structures: Journalists and the Constraints on AIDS Coverage]," ''Canadian Journal of Communication'' 25, no. 3 (2000), (accessed June 7, 2005).</ref> If this is a true observation, it may be expected that the audience which both demands and consumes this emphasis itself is more receptive to personalized, [[drama]]tic accounts of social phenomena.

A second, perhaps related, media trope is the effort to allocate individual responsibility for negative events. The media have a tendency to start to seek culprits if an event occurs that is of such significance that it does not drop off the news agenda within a few days. Of this trend, it has been said that the concept of a pure accident is no longer permitted in a news item [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4217024.stm]. Again, if this is a true observation, it may reflect a real change in how the media consumer perceives negative events.

==Controversies==<!-- This section is linked from [[Conspiracy theory]] -->
Aside from [[controversies]] over the merits of particular conspiracy claims (see [[#Conspiracy theories by topic or main figure|catalog]] below), and the various differing academic opinions (above), the general category of conspiracy theory is ''itself'' a matter of some public contestation.

===Usage===
The term "conspiracy theory" is considered by different observers to be a neutral description for a conspiracy claim, a pejorative term used to dismiss such a claim, and a term that can be positively embraced by proponents of such a claim. The term may be used by some for arguments they might not wholly believe but consider radical and exciting. The most widely accepted sense of the term is that which popular culture and academic usage share, certainly having negative implications for a narrative's probable truth value. 

Given this popular understanding of the term, it is conceivable that the term might be used illegitimately and inappropriately, as a means to dismiss what are in fact substantial and well-evidenced accusations. The legitimacy of each such usage will therefore be a matter of some controversy. Disinterested observers will compare an allegation's features with those of the category listed above, in order to determine whether a given usage is legitimate or prejudicial.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Certain proponents of conspiracy claims and their supporters argue that the term is entirely illegitimate, and should be considered just as politically manipulative as the Soviet practice of treating political dissidents as clinically insane.  Critics of this view claim that the argument bears little weight and that the claim itself serves to expose the paranoia common with conspiracy theorists.  In any case, it's worth noting that the term "conspiracy" itself well predates the term "conspiracy theory," which point illustrates the fact that conspiracy is and long has been a very real human behavior, while the legitimacy of the very recent concept of "conspiracy theory" remains much more open to debate.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} A similar complication occurs for terms such as ''[[UFO]]'', which literally means "unidentified flying object" but connotes [[alien spacecraft]], a concept also associated with some conspiracy theories, and thus possessing a certain [[social stigma]].

The term "conspiracy theory" is itself the object of a type of conspiracy theory, which argues that those using the term are manipulating their audience to disregard the topic under discussion, either in a deliberate attempt to conceal the truth, or as dupes of more deliberate conspirators.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

When conspiracy theories are offered as official claims (e.g. originating from a governmental authority, such as an intelligence agency) they are not usually considered as conspiracy theories. For example, certain activities of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] may be considered to have been an official attempt to promote a conspiracy theory, yet its claims are seldom referred to as such. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Further difficulties arise from ambiguity regarding the term [[theory]]. In popular usage, this term is often used to refer to unfounded or weakly-based speculation, leading to the idea that "It's not a conspiracy theory if it's actually true" [http://talldarkandmysterious.ca/archives/2005/11/24/its-not-a-conspiracy-theory-if-its-actually-true/]

===Testing the validity of conspiracy theories===
Perhaps the most contentious aspect of a conspiracy theory is the problem of settling a particular theory's truth to the satisfaction of both its proponents and its opponents. Particular accusations of conspiracy vary widely in their plausibility, but some common standards for assessing their likely truth value may be applied in each case:
* [[Occam's razor]] - is the alternative story more, or less, probable than the mainstream story? 
* [[Methodology]] - are the "proofs" offered for the argument well constructed, i.e., using sound methodology? Is there any clear standard to determine what evidence would prove or disprove the theory?
* [[Whistleblower]]s - how many people&mdash;and what kind&mdash;have to be loyal conspirators?

Some of these tests can have a downside as well. For instance, overeager application of "Occam's razor" can lead to acceptance of ''over''simplified views of history.

====Real conspiracies====
On some occasions particular conspiracy allegations turn out to be readily verifiable, as in the French government's attempted cover-up following [[<U+00C9>mile Zola|Emile Zola's]] accusations in the [[Dreyfus Affair]], or <s>in the efforts by the Tsar's secret police to foment anti-Semitism by presenting ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as an authentic text.</s><ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.hoover.org/hila/judaica3.htm | title = Jews and Politics in the Twentieth Century: From the Bund to the Rise of the Nazis | work = Judaica in the Collections of the Hoover Institution Archives | publisher = Hoover Institution, Stanford University | accessdate = 2006-04-28}}
</ref> 

Some argue that the reality of such conspiracies should caution against any casual dismissal of conspiracy theory. Many "conspiracy theory" authors and publishers, such as [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Disinfo]], use proven conspiracies as evidence of what a secret plot can accomplish. In doing so, they attempt to rebut the assumption that conspiracies don't exist, or that any "conspiracy theory" is necessarily false. A number of true or possibly true conspiracies are cited in making this case; the [[Mafia]], the [[Business Plot]], [[Project MKULTRA|MKULTRA]], various [[CIA]] involvements in overseas [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coups d'<U+00E9>tat]], [[Operation Northwoods]], the 1991 Testimony of [[Nayirah]] before the US Congress, the [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]], the [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] and the [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate]], among others.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The argument is often advanced that the non-existence of any given conspiracy is shown by the lack of leakers or whistle blowers. Given the success of the British government in getting thousands of people to keep the [[ULTRA]] secret -- and thereby ensuring that no reliable history of [[World War II]] could be published until the 1970s -- it is apparent that this is not necessarily a reliable indicator.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  

[[Machiavelli]] stated in ''[[The Discourses on Livy]]'' that conspiracies rarely achieve their objectives.

== Popper's use of the term "conspiracy theory" ==

In his two volume work, ''The Open Society & Its Enemies, 1938&ndash;1943'' Popper used the term "conspiracy theory" to criticize the ideologies driving [[fascism]], [[Nazism]] and [[communism]]. Popper argued that totalitarianism was founded on "conspiracy theories" which drew on imaginary plots driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism, racism or classism. Popper did not argue against the existence of everyday conspiracies (as incorrectly suggested in much of the later literature). Popper even uses the term "conspiracy" to describe ordinary political activity in the [[History of Athens|classical Athens]] of [[Plato]] (who was the principal target of his attack in ''The Open Society & Its Enemies'').

In his critique of Marx and the twentieth century totalitarians, Popper wrote, "I do not wish to imply that conspiracies never happen. On the contrary, they are typical social phenomena."[http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/books/popper_open_society.html ]

He reiterated his point, "Conspiracies occur, it must be admitted. But the striking fact which, in spite of their occurrence, disproved the conspiracy theory is that few of these conspiracies are ultimately successful. Conspirators rarely consummate their conspiracy." [http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/books/popper_open_society.html]

It may be worth noting that this could itself be considered an extraordinary claim, as any truly successful conspiracy might, by virtue of its success, very possibly never become widely known and accepted as ever having occurred.

====Falsifiability====
Popper proposed the term, "the conspiracy theory of society" to criticize the methodology of Marx, Hitler and others whom he deemed to be deluded by "historicism" - the reduction of history to an overt and naive distortion via a crude formulaic analysis usually predicated on an agenda replete with unsound presuppositions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper | first=Karl |authorlink = Karl Popper |title=The Open Society and Its Enemies | |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=1966 }}</ref>

Karl Popper argued that [[science]] is written as a set of [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[hypothesis|hypotheses]]; [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] or unscientific theories and claims are those which do not admit any possibility for falsification. Critics of conspiracy theories sometimes argue that many of them are not falsifiable and so cannot be scientific. This accusation is often accurate, and is a necessary consequence of the logical structure of certain kinds of conspiracy theories. These take the form of uncircumscribed [[existential quantification|existential statements]], alleging the ''existence'' of some action or object without specifying the ''place or time'' at which it can be observed. Failure to observe the phenomenon can then always be the result of looking in the wrong place or looking at the wrong time &mdash; that is, having been duped by the conspiracy. This makes impossible any demonstration that the conspiracy does not exist.

However, the use of falsifiability as a criterion to distinguish science from non-science has been criticised by a number of scholars, notably Popper's former students [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], and [[Imre Lakatos]], who argue that no theory is falsifiable in Poppers sense, and that as a consequence Popper misrepresents the actual process of scientific discovery.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Kuhn  | first = Thomas  | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn  | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  | publisher = [[Chicago University Press]]  | date = 1996  | pages = 146-7}} {{cite book  | last = Lakatos  | first = Imre  | authorlink = Imre Lakatos  | title = Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]  | date = 1970 }}</ref>

==Conspiracy theories in fiction==
{{main|Conspiracy theories (fictional)}}

Because of their dramatic potential, conspiracies are a popular theme in [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s and [[science fiction]]. Complex history is recast as a [[morality play]] in which bad people cause bad events, and good people identify and defeat them. Fictional conspiracy theories offer neat, intuitive narratives, in which the conspirators' plot fits closely the dramatic needs of the story's plot. As mentioned above, the ''cui bono?'' aspect of conspiracy theories resembles one element of mystery stories: the search for a possibly hidden motive.

''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' is a 1997 thriller about a taxi driver (played by [[Mel Gibson]]) who publishes a newsletter in which he discusses what he suspects are government conspiracies, and it turns out that one of them is true.

''[[The X-Files]]'' was a popular television show during the 1990s and early 2000s, which followed the investigations of two intrepid FBI agents, [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]], who were sometimes helped by a group of conspiracy theorists known as [[The Lone Gunmen]]. Many of the episodes dealt with a plot for alien invasion overseen by elements of the [[United States|U.S.]] government, led by an individual known only as the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] and an even more mysterious international "Syndicate". The famous tag line of the series, "The Truth Is Out There", can be interpreted as reference to the meaning-seeking nature of the genre [[Conspiracy theory#Psychological origins|discussed above]].

[[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' is a broad satire on conspiracism in which the characters attempt to construct an all-embracing conspiracy theory starting with the [[Templar (disambiguation)|Templars]] and including the [[Bavarian Illuminati]], the [[Rosicrucian]]s, [[hollow Earth]] enthusiasts, the [[Cathar]]s, and even the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] explores a similar theme, without the satire and with religion as its focus: a conspiracy by the Catholic Church has attempted to cover up the "true" story of Jesus.
