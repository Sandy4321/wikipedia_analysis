'''Airbus Executive and Private Aviation''' is a producer of large corporate aircraft. It is a part of [[Airbus S.A.S.]], an [[EADS]] company, and had a model range that parallels the commercial aircraft offered by the company, ranging from the [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] Elite to the double/triple-decked [[Airbus A380]] Prestige. Following the entry of the 737 based [[Boeing Business Jet]], Airbus joined the business jet market with the A319 Corporate Jet in 1997. Although the term Airbus Corporate jet was initially used only for the A319, it is now often used for all models, including the VIP widebodies. As of december 2008, 121 corporate and private jets are operating, 164 aircraft have been ordered, including an A380 Prestige and 107 A320 family Corporate Jet.<ref>[http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/executive_aviation/ Airbus Executive and Private Aviation]</ref>
