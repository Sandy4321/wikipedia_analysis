"'''Start Me Up'''" is a song by [[The Rolling Stones]] featured on the 1981 album ''[[Tattoo You]]''.

==Recording==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2008}}
"Start Me Up" was first recorded in [[Munich]] during the [[1975]] ''[[Black and Blue]]'' sessions, and later in the [[1978]] ''[[Some Girls]]'' sessions under the working titles "Never Stop" and "Start It Up." The song was originally recorded as a [[reggae]]-rock track, but after dozens of takes the band stopped recording it, as it reminded them of something currently on the radio. In [[1981]], with the band looking to tour, producer [[Chris Kimsey]] proposed to lead singer [[Mick Jagger]] that archived songs could comprise the set. While searching through the archives, Kimsey found two takes of the song with a more rock vibe among some fifty reggae versions. Overdubs were done on the track in early 1981. The infectious "thump" to the song was achieved using mixer [[Bob Clearmountain]]'s famed "bathroom reverb," a process involving the recording of some of the song's vocal and drum tracks with a miked speaker in the bathroom of the [[Power Station recording studio]] in [[New York City]]. It was there where final touches were added to the song, including Jagger's switch of the main lyrics from "start it up" to "start me up."<ref>Jackson, Blair. [http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_rolling_stones_start/ The Rolling Stones "Start Me Up"]. ''Mix Magazine Online''. [[1 June]] [[2002]] (accessed [[12 April]] [[2007]]).</ref> 

The song opens with what has since become a trademark [[riff]] for [[Keith Richards]]. It is this, coupled with [[Charlie Watts|Charlie Watts']] steady [[backbeat]] and [[Bill Wyman|Bill Wyman's]] echoing bass, that comprises most of the song. Lead guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]] can clearly be heard playing a [[Multiple guitar players#Ancient Form of Weaving|layered variation]] of Richards' main riff. Throughout the song Jagger breaks in with a repeated bridge of "You make a grown man cry," followed by various pronouncements of his and his partner's sexual nature;

{{cquote|''You make a grown man cry (x2); Ride like the wind at double speed; I'll take you places that you've never, never seen''.}}

Often live versions of the song are lengthened by giving Wood a solo near the middle of the song, pieces of which can be heard throughout the original recording.

==Release==

The song reached No. 2 in the US and No. 7 on the [[UK Singles Charts]] in August 1981. It remains a significant single as the Stones have not been back into the UK Top 10 since. It was #1 during 13 weeks on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. The B-Side was a slow blues number called "No Use In Crying" which also featured on the ''[[Tattoo You]]'' album. A popular music video was produced for the single, directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]].

"Start Me Up" is often used to open the Stones' live shows and has been featured on the live albums ''[[Still Life (American Concert 1981)|Still Life]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', ''[[Live Licks]]'', and ''[[Shine a Light (album)|Shine a Light]]''. It has been included on every major compilation since its release, including ''[[Rewind (1971-1984)]]'', ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'', and ''[[Forty Licks]]''.

==Pop culture==
*The song was one of three played by the Rolling Stones at half time during the [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[2006]]. It was speculated that some of the more objectionable lyrics along with those in "[[Rough Justice (The Rolling Stones song)|Rough Justice]]" and "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" had been censored without the singer's consent. It was later discovered that Mick Jagger had agreed prior to leave out the lyrics.<ref>[http://salon.com/ent/video_dog/media/2006/02/06/stones_self_censor/index.html salon.com]</ref>
