'''Peter Sauber''' (born 13 October 1943 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]) is the retired team principal and owner of various motorsports teams, most visibly the eponymous [[Sauber|Sauber Formula One]] team.

== Motorsport career ==

After being trained as an [[electrician]] Peter Sauber became a [[car]] salesman in [[Hinwil]], Switzerland.<ref>Swiss News - http://www.swissnews.ch/fileadmin/daten_Swissnews/PDF_Archiv/2011/11/A127983_SN11__014_017_.pdf</ref> This was Sauber's first real association with automobiles and it proved to be the catalyst for his involvement in motor-racing. 

Sauber's [[motorsport]] connection was somewhat paradoxical, given that racing in his native land had been banned after the [[24 hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] [[1955 Le Mans disaster|tragedy of 1955]].<ref>GrandPrix.com (Swiss look into motorsports ban of 1958) http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19754.html</ref> However, he still managed to compete in hillclimbing events in the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] he had purchased and thus the foundations for his first project as a team owner were laid.

=== Team Sauber ===

After opting not to run the family traffic light business, Peter built the Sauber C1 (the C stands for Christiane, the name of Peter Sauber's wife) in his parents' basement. It was a car of tubular frame, powered by a 1-litre Ford Cosworth engine. He subsequently drove it to the 1970 Swiss [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] championship. It also remained in racing for ten years in the hands of other drivers, notably Friedrich H<U+00FC>rzeler, who took the 1974 crown in the car. 

In 1971, Sauber handed over the driver's seat to Hans Kunis, who drove the new Sauber C2 model in the same series, as Peter himself had done so the year before.

Sauber had started to gain a portfolio of customers and in 1973, Sauber built three C3 spec chassis for different customers. Designed by Guy Boisson, the car was used predominantly in the Swiss Sports Car Championship. 

The C4 of 1975 heralded the first [[aluminium]] chassis developed by the team, and Boisson was joined by Edy Wiss in designing it. Only one C4 was ever produced. 

The most successful of the early Sauber cars, the C5 was used to great effect in conjunction with its 2 litre [[BMW]] engine&mdash;taking the 1976 Interserie Championship in the hands of Herbert Muller. 

Being a group six sports car, the car was allowed to take part in the legendary Le Mans 24 heures race, and Sauber entered the C5 in both 1977 and 1978. In '77 the car led its class before retiring; the same thing happened in '78.

1979 marked the end of Sauber's first foray into sports car building <U+2013> and the start of preparing chassis for Lola F2 cars. The drivers finished 1<U+2013>2<U+2013>4 in the championship that year <U+2013> one of them was [[Max Welti]], who subsequently joined the team as team manager. 

In 1980, and 1981, Sauber and Welti turned their attentions to developing BMW M1 sportscars, in the latter year it won the [[1000km N<U+00FC>rburgring]].

In 1982, with BASF sponsorship, Sauber returned to sports car racing. The C6 was the first car to be tested in a wind tunnel by Sauber. It was during these tests that Sauber built up a strong relationship with Leo Ress, who would later become instrumental in the F1 project. 

In 1985, the team's relationship with [[Mercedes-Benz]] began. This sports car partnership culminated in November 1991 <U+2013> having ignited the career of the legendary [[Michael Schumacher]] and Sauber's own prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>, [[Karl Wendlinger]].

=== Formula One ===

Sauber now began to look seriously at launching an F1 team. In the summer of 1991 [[Harvey Postlethwaite]] joined the team to design an F1 car and Mercedes funded a vast new factory at [[Hinwil]].

==== First Sauber Team (1991<U+2013>2005) ====

In November 1991 Mercedes decided against direct involvement and so Sauber entered F1 by itself in 1993, with drivers [[JJ Lehto]] and [[Karl Wendlinger]] powered by engines built by [[Ilmor]] but rebadged as Saubers. Sauber did convince Mercedes to enter F1 in 1994 but a year later the German company did a deal with [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]], leaving Sauber to become the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] F1 works team. This was followed by a deal with the [[Malaysia]]n oil company [[Petronas]] in 1995 and the establishment of an engineering company called Sauber Petronas Engineering to design and build V10 engines. The company began buying old [[Ferrari]] engines and rebadging them as Sauber Petronas V10s but the F1 engine program itself was scrapped in 1998. In recent years Sauber has been very successful with the team finishing fourth in the World Championship in 2001 and fifth in 2002 despite having a much smaller budget than many of its rivals. The team however never scored a race win.

==== The sale to BMW (2005<U+2013>2009)====

In June 2005, [[BMW]] acquired the major shareholding stake in the Sauber team from [[Credit Suisse]],<ref>Bloomberg News - http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000100&sid=a44R7lJ_dD50&refer=germany</ref> which owned more than 60% of the team from an annual deal Peter Sauber initiated in 1994<ref>GrandPrix.com - "The Sale of Sauber" (discusses shareholder ownership within team) http://grandprix.com/ns/ns14214.html</ref> selling a majority stake of his team to his major sponsor.<ref>[[Autosport]] - http://atlasf1.autosport.com/news/2002/jan/report.php/id/6180/.html</ref> It was done with Peter Sauber's blessing, the team was known as [[BMW Sauber]] and Peter took a background advisory role within it, retaining a 20% stake in the team.

==== Return to Peter Sauber (2009<U+2013>present) ====

In July 2009, BMW announced its withdrawal from Formula One at the end of the season. Peter Sauber worked with BMW to develop a rescue package that would allow the team to continue in the sport without the manufacturer's backing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Strang|first=Simon|author2=Rencken, Dieter|title=Sauber working on team rescue deal|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/77496|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> [[Qadbak Investments Ltd]] were thought to have purchased the team,<ref>[http://www.f1network.net/main/s491/st149363.htm BMW Finds A Buyer For The Team] F1Network.net 15 September 2009</ref> but on 27 November 2009 it was announced that the Qadbak deal had fallen through and BMW had instead reached an agreement to sell the entire F1 operation back to Peter Sauber.
