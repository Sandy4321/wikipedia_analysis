'''''Kaleidoscope Dream''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], released on September 25, 2012, by [[RCA Records]]. After attaining commercial standing with his 2010 debut album ''[[All I Want Is You (album)|All I Want Is You]]'', Miguel wanted to play a larger creative role in his music and principally produced and wrote ''Kaleidoscope Dream''. He recorded most of the album at [[Platinum Sound Recording Studios]] in New York City and MJP Studios in Los Angeles, and worked with producers [[Oak (producer)|Warren "Oak" Felder]], [[Jerry Duplessis|Jerry "Wonda" Duplessis]], and [[Salaam Remi]], among others.

An idiosyncratic album, ''Kaleidoscope Dream'' features sparse production, eccentric details, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Its music incorporates R&B, [[pop music|pop]], [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[soul music|soul]] styles, as well as [[electronic music|electronic]] flourishes, [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] textures, and [[funk rock]] guitar. Lyrically, the album generally discusses sexual and romantic themes, with existential subject matter on some songs. Miguel titled ''Kaleidoscope Dream'' as a metaphor for life and sought to represent his own lifestyle and personality with its music and lyrics.

Prior to its release, the album's songs were previewed [[viral marketing|virally]] through a series of free [[music download|digital]] [[extended play|EPs]] released by Miguel. It was subsequently promoted with two singles, including Miguel's highest charting single "[[Adorn (song)|Adorn]]", and his touring in North America and Europe during 2012 to 2013. Upon its release, ''Kaleidoscope Dream'' received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its eccentric style and Miguel's singing and songwriting. It debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 71,000 copies in its first week. As of November 14, 2012, the album has sold 169,600 copies in the United States.

{{Quote box
 |quote = The album's title works: on ''Kaleidoscope Dream'' images and sounds repeat, refract and coalesce ... It's made up of love songs, but they are more specifically songs arguing for love, acting casual, wishing and hoping and then imagining what it would be like to consummate. Early days and misadventures. It's soul-baring, but mirrored and fairly guarded.

[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref> Allmusic editor Andy Kellman cited it as "2012's most pleasurable pop-R&B album" and commented that, although the lyrics occasionally come "too close to 'artsy' teenage erotic poetry," each song has "an attractive quality, whether it's a heavenly melody, a riveting rhythm, or a boggling production nuance."<ref name="Kellman"/> Alex Macpherson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that Miguel's occasional "appeal to [[indie rock|indie]] tropes ... is balanced by genuinely thoughtful songwriting" and commended him for using his previous commercial breakthrough "as a springboard to radically change course".<ref name="Macpherson"/> [[Greg Kot]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' complimented both his "left turns" and references to older influences, writing that Miguel "creates a fluid, dreamscape environment that floats across eras with a connoisseur's discerning feel for the telling detail."<ref name="Kot"/> 

Rob Tannenbaum of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that "Miguel proves that he is, easily, uninhibited enough to inherit the tradition of eccentric R&B freakiness handed down from Marvin Gaye to Prince to [[R. Kelly]]."<ref name="Tannenbaum"/> Evan Rytlewski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' compared Miguel's "pop instincts" to those of Prince and stated, "Few, if any, of [Miguel's] contemporaries have demonstrated this much control over their aesthetic."<ref name="Rytlewski"/> Maura Johnston of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised Miguel's "command" of his "impeccable songwriting chops" and "deceptively supple voice", and called the album "startling and invigorating, a fully formed statement from an artist hungrily surging toward the front of pop music's creative pack."<ref name="Johnston"/> Sean McCarthy of [[PopMatters]] called it a "thrilling listen" and viewed that, along with Frank Ocean's ''[[Channel Orange]]'', it "shows that in terms of mainstream music, the trailblazers of 2012 are firmly entrenched in the R&B community."<ref name="McCarthy"/> 

In a mixed review, Ken Capobianco of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' felt that "some tracks are simply [[overproduction (music)|overproduced]]" and found Miguel "too remote for a true soul singer."<ref name="Capobianco"/> Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the album to be "purposefully, a little washed-out, a blend of Prince-isms and slurry grooves", and stated, "Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's on the verge."<ref name="Caramanica"/> Frannie Kelley of [[NPR]] critiqued that the album "requires a few twists to bring Miguel's vision into focus", but commended his effort as a "perfectionist" and found him comparable to "[[Stevie Wonder]], Prince and [[Van Morrison]]."<ref name="Kelley"/> Pitchfork Media's Andrew Ryce found the album to be "respectful of tradition, quietly ambitious, and deeply personal", and cited Miguel as "the rare vocalist who makes you ''feel'' what he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent."<ref name="Ryce"/> Alfred Soto of The Quietus was pleasantly surprised by "the range of sonic ideas, fully realized songs, and prodigious vocal talent" by Miguel after a "tentative" debut and commented that he "articulates how a love man can be louche without being a douche."<ref name="Soto"/>
