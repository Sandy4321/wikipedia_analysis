'''''Danseuse au caf<U+00E9>''''' (also known as '''''Dancer in a caf<U+00E9>''''' or '''''Au Caf<U+00E9> Concert''''') is a large oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist and theorist '''[[Jean Metzinger]]''' (1883<U+2013>1956). It was exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912, entitled ''Danseuse''. The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created a controversy in the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des D<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>s about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such 'barbaric' art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat.<ref>Patrick F.

==Description==
''Danseuse au caf<U+00E9>'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 146.1 x 114.3&nbsp;cm (57.5 x 45 in). As the title indicates the painting represents a woman dancing in a caf<U+00E9>. She is shown on the right half of the canvas wearing an elaborate gown and holding in her right hand a bouquet of flowers. In the caf<U+00E9> scene, four others, two women and two men, can be observed on the left of the painting, three of whom are seated in front of a table upon which various items are placed (including beverages), and one of whom is placed seemingly in the background (upper left). 

Metzinger's "enchanting" ''Dancer in a Caf<U+00E9>'', writes Daniel Robbins, "exults in the exoticism of the moment, playing off the feathers or plumes of fashionable dressed Parisian women in their Worth gowns against an Amerindian pattern on the costume of the dancer, wittily comparing the height of European fashion with the anthropologically arcane."<ref name="Daniel Robbins">Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: ''At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, exhibition catalogue: ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art</ref>

As in other works by Meztinger of the same period, there are elements to be found of the real world, e.g., lighting fixtures, flowers, feathers and lace. The rest of the canvas consists of a series of crescendos and diminuendos of greater of lesser abstraction, of convex and concave forms, of hyperbolic and spherical surfaces, that stem from the teachings of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne]]. The [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in his Neo-Impressionst phase (circa 1903 through 1907) has returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.<ref>[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century, [[Louis Vauxcelles]], 1907, describes the brushwork of Delaunay and Metzinger as mosaic-like 'cubes']</ref>

''Dancer in a caf<U+00E9>'' depicts strikingly fashionable women and men, at the height of Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a ''directoire-style'' beaded and embroidered green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the caf<U+00E9> scene simultaneously. This can be seen in the deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of [[chiaroscuro]], of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.<ref name="David Cottington">[http://books.google.es/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&pg=PR11&lpg=PR11&dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&source=bl&ots=rm0CrcbXtN&sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&hl=en#v=onepage&q=horse&f=false David Cottington, 2004, Cubism and its Histories], Manchester University Press</ref>

"The style of the clothes is meticulously up-to-the-minute" writes Cottington of Metzinger's three entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, "the cut of the dresses, and the relatively uncorseted silhouettes they permitted their weavers to display, owe much more to Poiret than to Worth<U+2014>indeed the check of one figure in the ''Dancer'' and the polka dots of the ''Woman with a Fan'' anticipate the post-war geometries, if not the colour harmonies, of [[Sonia Delaunay]]'s fabrics, while the open-collared sportiness of the dress and cloche-style hat in ''The Yellow Feather'' look forward to the 1920s."<ref name="David Cottington" />

==Paul Poiret, Isadora Duncan and the art world==

The French fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]] actually worked for the [[House of Worth]] early in the 20th century, however, the "brazen modernity of his designs" proved too much for Worth's conservative clientele. Poiret established his own house in 1903 and threw spectacular parties to promote his work.<ref>[[Hamish Bowles]], ''Fashioning the Century'', ''Vogue'' (May 2007): 236<U+2013>250.

In June 1911 Poiret unveiled <U+201C>Parfums de Rosine" in a grand soir<U+00E9>e held at his palatial home (a ''h<U+00F4>tel particulier'' avenue d'Antin), a costume ball christened ''<U+201C>la mille et deuxi<U+00E8>me nuit,<U+201D>'' (the thousand and second night), attended by the Parisian high-society and the artistic world.

Mazzeo, ''The Secret of Chanel No. 5'', HarperCollins, 2010, pp. 25-26</ref>

In 1911, the photographer [[Edward Steichen]] was challenged by publisher [[:fr:Lucien Vogel|Lucien Vogel]] to promote fashion as a fine art by the use of photography.<ref>Penelope Niven, 1997, ''Steichen: A Biography'', New York: Clarkson Potter, ISBN 0-517-59373-4, p. 352</ref> The photographs of Poiret's gowns, published in the April 1911 issue of the magazine ''Art et D<U+00E9>coration'', are now considered to be the first modern fashion photography shoot.<ref>Jesse Alexander, ''Edward Steichen: Lives in Photography,'' HotShoe magazine, no.151, December/January 2008, pp.66 <U+2013> 67</ref> In 1912, Vogel began his renowned fashion journal [[La Gazette du Bon Ton]], showcasing Poiret's designs, along with other leading Paris designers such as the House of [[Charles Worth]], [[Madeleine Ch<U+00E9>ruit]], [[Georges Doeuillet]], [[Jeanne Paquin]], [[Redfern (couture)|Redfern & Sons]] and [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (the [[Post-Impressionist]] and [[Cubist]] art collector who purchased ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', directly from Picasso's studio).

Paul Poiret had a lifelong interest in modern art for the purposes of self-promotion and the bene<U+FB01>t of his diverse commercial enterprises.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/20168287/Couture-Culture Nancy J. Troy, ''Couture Culture: A Study in Modern Art and Fashion'', Cambridge, Mass., MIT Press, 2003]</ref> In 1911 he rented and restored a mansion built by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] for [[Louis XV]], 1750, called [[Pavillon du Butard]] in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]] (not far from Albert Gleizes' studio and close to the Duchamp residence, where the [[Section d'Or]] group gathered) and threw lavish parties, including one of the more famous ''grandes f<U+00EA>tes'' dated 20 June 1912, ''La f<U+00EA>te de Bacchus'' (re-created the [[Bacchanalia]] hosted by [[Louis XIV]] at Versailles). Guy-Pierre Fauconnet (1882-1920) designed the invitation. [[Isadora Duncan]], wearing a Hellenic evening gown designed by Poiret,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1625930,00.html Rachel Aydt, ''Rediscovered'', Life in Paris during the Belle Epoque...

Isadora Duncan, a girl for California said to have posed for [[Eadweard Muybridge]],<ref>[http://www.gettyimages.es/detail/fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/dancer-isadora-duncan-fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/2642539 Dancer Isadora Duncan, Photo by Eadweard Muybridge, Getty Images]</ref> placed an emphasis on "evolutionary" dance motion, insisting that each movement was born from the one that preceded it, that each movement gave rise to the next, and so on in organic succession. Her dancing defined the force of progress, change, abstraction and liberation. In France too Duncan delighted her audience.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=bpRU8A9AS30C&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=Eadweard+Muybridge,+isadora+duncan&source=bl&ots=IecSuP-nJr&sig=mr0WtvSX0hE6hL1_ltjOd_zeYGQ&hl=en Ann Daly, ''Done Into Dance: Isadora Duncan in America]'', Weslyan University Press, Middletown CT. 1995, ISBN 0-8195-6560-1</ref>

By 1912, [[Marie Laurencin]] had entered into an intimate [[lesbian]] relationship with the fashion designer [[:fr:Nicole Groult|Nicole Groult]], born Nicole Poiret (the sister of Paul Poiret).<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=3cjNTzDadisC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=marie+laurencin,+paul+poiret&source=bl&ots=hCpLRJSRxl&sig=mCfs-baZlpyMpvlIxDbgs_2uCjw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iR4YUYOnItS10QWwtYGwCw&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=marie%20laurencin%2C%20paul%20poiret&f=false Elizabeth Louise Kahn, ''Marie Laurencin, Une femme inadapt<U+00E9>e, in feminist histories of art'', Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2003]</ref> In 1906 Nicole Poiret, with her brother Paul and friend Isadora Duncan fought a tense battle for the liberation of women, which began by the abolition of the corset.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=IEb_Zna0KPEC&pg=PA15&dq=%22nicole+groult%22&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false Sonia Schoonejans, ''La danse de l'avenir'', from ''Regards sur Isadora Duncan'', [[Isadora Duncan]], <U+00C9>ditions Complexe, 2003, p. 15]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=9J47XkVscTAC&pg=PA1884&dq=%22nicole+groult%22&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false [[:fr:Florence Montreynaud|Florence Montreynaud]], ''L'Aventure des femmes, XXe-XXIe si<U+00E8>cle: 1912, Guerre au corset'', <U+00C9>ditis, 2011]</ref> Laurencin had shown together with Metzinger and other Cubists in Room 41 of the 1911 [[Salon des Ind<U+00E9>pendants]] (at the suggestion of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]), which provoked the 'scandal' out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris, France, Europe and so on. In the company of her friend Marie Laurencin, Nicole Poiret frequented the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] world of [[Montmartre]], [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and the Cubists.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=cvlDG-VB7lIC&pg=PT46&dq=%22nicole+groult%22&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false Beno<U+00EE>te Groult, ''Mon <U+00E9>vasion'', <U+00C9>ditions Grasset & Fasquelle, 2008]</ref>

Metzinger's interest in fashion was mirrored by Poiret's interest in modern art. On 18 November 1925 works from the art collection of Paul Poiret were exhibited and sold at a public auction in Paris. Artists in his collection included Derain, van Dongen, Dufresne, Dufy, de La Fresnaye, Othon Friesz, Matisse, Modigliani (''Portrait de Max Jacob''), Picabia, Picasso, Rouault and Dunoyer de Segonzac.<ref>[http://www.diktats.com/catalog/product/view/id/229/category/53/ Catalogue des Tableaux Modernes... de la Collection de M. Paul Poiret, Hotel Drouot, Wednesday 18 November 1925]</ref>

Though it is unclear wether Metzinger attended these parties it would be very unlikely that he and a selected few of his fellow Cubists did not<U+2014>considering the celebrity status he enjoyed at the forefront of the avant-garde. Three months after ''La f<U+00EA>te de Bacchus'' Metzinger exhibited ''Dancer in a caf<U+00E9>'' at the Salon d'Automne, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November 1912.

Interestingly, despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting<U+2014>the reflexive function of complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types<U+2014>there does manifest itself in ''Danseuse'' a certain spatial depth or perspective reminiscent of the optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too the man at the upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground. Interesting because it shows that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not imply the absolute destruction of classical perspective, or that simply, the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. 

There are, however, objective factors that prevent the illusion from succeeding completely: (1) the canvas is two-dimensional while reality is three-dimensional, (2) the uniqueness of the view-point (humans have two eyes). Metzinger compensates for the missing spatiality in his two-dimensional representation by giving other cues for depth, in addition to relative size: shading and shadows, source of light, occlusion (e.g., the stage or table upon which the woman dances cuts 'in front' of the woman sitting at the table). Metzinger represents a subjective effect objectively on the canvas, imitating subjective phenomena (of vision) objectively. [[Henri Poincar<U+00E9>]], in ''Science and Hypothesis'', 1902, discusses 'representative' space (visual, tactile and motor space) versus 'geometrical' space.<ref>[http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/aar/862/accueil.asp?id=862 Helmholtz on Space and Painting, Michael Heidelberger, University of T<U+00FC>bingen]. Translation from Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) lectures, 1871-1873 on ''Optisches <U+00FC>ber Malerei'' (''On the Relation of Optics to Painting''), publ. 1876</ref>

The painting inscribes an ambivalence in that it expresses both contemporary and classical, modern and traditional, avant-garde and academic connotations, simultaneously. The "busy geometry of planar fragmentation and juxtaposed perspectives has a more than reflexive function," notes Cottington, "for the symmetrical patterning of its reticulations (as in the dancer's ''d<U+00E9>colletage'') and their rhythmic parallel repetitions suggest not only movement and diagrams but also, metonymically, the mechanised object-world of modernity."<ref name="David Cottington" /> 

Two works entitled ''Nu'' and ''Landscape'', circa 1908 and 1909 respectively, indicate that Metzinger had already departed from his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] brand of [[Divisionism]] by 1908. Turning his attention fully towards the [[geometric abstraction]] of form, Metzinger allowed the viewer to reconstruct the original volume mentally and to imagine the object depicted within space. But this wasn't the space of [[Euclidean geometry]] and its associated classical one-point perspective in use and unquestioned since the onset of the Renaissance. This was an all-out multi-frontal attack on the narrow limitations of academicism, on pre-20th century empiricism, on [[positivism]], [[determinism]] and the untenable notions of [[absolute space]], [[absolute time]] and absolute truth. It was a revolt inline with those leveled by the mathematician [[Henri Poincar<U+00E9>]] and the philosophers [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Henri Bergson]]. This was an embrace of [[Riemannian geometry]], of the relativity of knowledge, of realities hidden by human vision, an embrace of the world that surpassed material appearances. Poincar<U+00E9>, in ''Science & Method, The Relativity of Space'' (1897), wrote: "Absolute space exists no longer; there is only space relative to a certain initial position of the body."<ref name="Henri Poincar<U+00E9> 1897">[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/poincare.htm Henri Poincar<U+00E9>, 1897, Science & Method, The Relativity of Space]</ref>

<blockquote>Thus the characteristic property of space, that of having three dimensions, is only a property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to speak, in the human intelligence. The destruction of some of these connections that is to say of these associations of ideas, would be sufficient to give us a different distribution board, and that might be enough to endow space with a fourth dimension. [...] It quite seems, indeed, that it would be possible to translate our physics into the language of geometry of four dimensions. (Henri Poincar<U+00E9>, 1897)<ref name="Henri Poincar<U+00E9> 1897" /></blockquote>

Albert Gleizes, writing on Metzinger's Cubism in September 1911 (almost a year before the completion of ''Danseuse au caf<U+00E9>''), identified Metzinger as a follower of Nietzsche who 'invents his own truth' by destroying 'old values'.<ref name="Antliff and Leighten">Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames & Hudson, 2001</ref><ref>Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983</ref>

His concerns for color that had assumed a primary role both as a decorative and expressive device before 1908 had given way to the primacy of form. But his monochromatic tonalities would last only until 1912, when both color and form would boldly combine to produce such works as ''Danseuse au caf<U+00E9>''. "The works of Jean Metzinger" [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] writes in 1912 "have purity. His meditations take on beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach sublimity. The new structures he is composing are stripped of everything that was known before him."<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&pg=PA88-IA9&dq=%22femme+au+cheval%22+%22jean+metzinger%22&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22femme%20au%20cheval%22%20%22jean%20metzinger%22&f=false Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, ''The Cubist Painters'', translated, with commentary by Peter F. Read, 2002]</ref>

As a resident of la Butte [[Montmartre]] in Paris, Metzinger entered the circle of Picasso and Braque (in 1908). "It is to the credit of Jean Metzinger, at the time, to have been the first to recognize the commencement of the Cubist Movement as such" writes S. E. Johnson, "Metzinger's portrait of Apollinaire, the poet of the Cubist Movement, was executed in 1909 and, as Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book The Cubist Painters (written in 1912 and published in 1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.<ref name="S.

With the overthrow of classical perspective and its implicit staticity quasi-complete, the new concept of ''mobile perspective'', first propounded by Metzinger in his 1910 publication ''Note sur la peinture'',<ref>Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October<U+2013>November 1910</ref> implied explicitly the dynamism of motion within multiple-spatial dimensions. In the article Metzinger notes the similarities between [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], stressing the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, with Metzinger flanked between, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.<ref name="Antliff and Leighten" />

Apollinaire, possibly with the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in mind, wrote a year later of this ''state of motion'' as akin to ''cinematic'' movement around an object, revealing a ''plastic truth'' compatible with reality by showing the spectator "all its facets." Gleizes again in 1911 remarks Metzinger is "haunted by the desire to inscribe a total image [...] He will put down the greatest number of possible planes: to purely objective truth he wishes to add a new truth, born from what his intelligence permits him to know. Thus<U+2014>and he said himself: to space he will join time. [...] he wishes to develop the visual field by multiplying it, to inscribe them all in the space of the same canvas: it is then that the cube will play a role, for Metzinger will utilize this means to reestablish the equilibrium that these audacious inscriptions will have momentarily broken."<ref name="Daniel Robbins" />

Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the artist became free to explore notions of ''simultaneity'', whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single painting.<ref name="Antliff and Leighten" />

This picture plane, write Metzinger and Gleizes (in ''Du "Cubisme"'', 1912), "reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces." The forms situated within this space, they continue, "spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility."<ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes">Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Paris, 1912, in Robert L. Herbert, ''Modern Artists on Art'', Englewood Cliffs, 1964.</ref>

There are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, (1) "all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention", giving the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed (or towards which they tend), creating spaces of maximum or minimum intensity. (2) "The spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade."

<blockquote>"There is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard to the images which they produce in the mind." (Metzinger and Gleizes, 1912)<ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes" /></blockquote>

According the founders of Cubist theory, objects possess no absolute or essential form. "There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it."<ref name="Metzinger and Gleizes" />

==Theoretical underpinnings==
The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated in ''Du "Cubisme"'' (1912). It was also a central idea of Jean Metzinger's ''Note sur la Peinture'', 1910; Indeed, prior to Cubsim painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. And it was Metzinger for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' who enunciated the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. It was then that Metzinger discarded traditional perspective and granted himself the liberty of moving around objects. This is the concept of "mobile perspective" that would tend towards the representation of the "total image."<ref name="Daniel Robbins" />

Though at first the idea would shock the general public some eventually came to accept it, as they came to accept the '[[atomist]]' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors within the context of Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of 'mobile perspective' is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in [[Paul Signac]]'s ''D'Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix au n<U+00E9>o-impressionisme'', with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form within the context of both space and time.<ref>Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R.

==Salon d'Automne, 1912==
[[File:L'Excelsior, Au Salon d'Automne, Les Ind<U+00E9>pendants, October 1912, Metzinger, Gleizes, Kupka reproduced.jpg|thumb|left|L'Excelsior, ''Au Salon d'Automne, Les Ind<U+00E9>pendants'', 2 October 1912, with works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Kupka and de La Fresnaye]]
The Salon d'Automne of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November, saw the Cubists (listed below) regrouped into the same room XI. For the occasion, ''Danseuse au caf<U+00E9>'' was reproduced in a photograph published in an article entitled ''Au Salon d'Automne "Les Ind<U+00E9>pendants"'' in the French newspaper ''Excelsior'', 2 Octobre 1912.<ref>[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne 1912, page from ''Excelsior'' reproduced]</ref> [[:fr:Excelsior (journal)|Excelsior]] was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such ''L'Excelsior'' was a pioneer of [[photojournalism]].

The history of the Salon d'Automne is marked by two important dates: 1905, bore witness to the birth of [[Fauvism]] (with the participation of Metzinger), and 1912, the xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel. The 1912 polemic leveled against both the French and non-French avant-garde artists originated in ''Salle XI'' where the Cubists exhibited their works. The resistance to foreigners (dubbed "apaches") and avant-garde artists was just the visible face of a more profound crises: that of defining modern French art, and the dwindling of an artistic system crystallized around the heritage of [[Impressionism]] centered in Paris. Burgeoning was a new avant-garde system, the international logic of which<U+2014>''mercantile'' and ''m<U+00E9>diatique''<U+2014>put into question the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of ''aesthetics'' quickly turned ''political'', and as in the 1905 Salon d'Automne, with his infamous "Donatello parmi les fauves", the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] (Les Arts..., 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. Recall too, it was Vauxcelles who, on the occasion of the 1910 Salon d'Automne, wrote disparagingly of 'pallid' cubes with reference to the paintings of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, L<U+00E9>ger and Delaunay. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the [[Chambre des d<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>s]] (and was debated at the Assembl<U+00E9>e Nationale in Paris).<ref name="B<U+00E9>atrice Joyeux-Prunel" />

This exhibition also featured ''La Maison cubiste''. [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] designed facade of a 10 meter by 3 meter house, which included a hall, a living room and a bedroom. This installation was placed in the Art D<U+00E9>coratif section of the Salon d'Automne. The major contributors were [[Andr<U+00E9> Mare]], a decorative designer, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]. In the house were hung cubist paintings by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand L<U+00E9>ger]], Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger (Woman with a Fan, 1912).

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] commended Metzinger's 'finesse and distinction of palette'. Maurice Raynal noted the seductive charm and sureness of execution of Metzinger's entries, the refined sensibility of Metzinger himself, the playfulness and grace of whom he compares to [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], while singling out Metzinger as 'certainly ... the man of our time who knows best how to paint'.<ref name="David Cottington" />
