Due to financial problems, however, the project was put on hold only to be revived a few years later. Initially scheduled for launch in 2012,<ref name="fed">{{citeweb|title=Fundamental Space Studies|url=http://www.federalspace.ru/science0615E.asp|publisher=''[[Russian Federal Space Agency]]''|accessdate=2008-06-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407195935/http://www.federalspace.ru/science0615E.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-07}}</ref> the mission has been brought forward twice, first to 2010 and then to 2009. However, as of late 2008, the plan is again to meet the original 2012 launch date. 

Luna-Glob is the first of four missions planned before the creation of a fully robotic lunar base scheduled for after 2015.

'''Luna-Glob 1''' is an unmanned mission to the [[Moon]] planned by [[Russia]] including an orbiter with ground penetrating sensors.<ref name="Aviation Week">{{citeweb|title=Russia Plans Ambitious Robotic Lunar Mission|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news/aw060506p2.xml|publisher=''[[Aviation Week]]''|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> Four Japanese-built penetrators inherited from the [[Lunar-A]] will be used, each weighing 45&nbsp;kg (100 lb), including 14&nbsp;kg (31 lb) for the penetrator proper. 

Luna-Glob is slated to be launched in 2012 by a [[Soyuz 2 rocket]] <ref>{{citeweb|title=Lavochkin begins phase B work for Luna-Glob 1 orbiter|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/14/317424/lavochkin-begins-phase-b-work-for-luna-glob-1-orbiter.html|publisher=''[[www.flightglobal.com]]''|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> Furthermore, [[seismology|seismic]] experiments are planned, including the use of 4 penetrators, which will slam into the lunar surface equipped to detect seismic signals. These experiments are expected to help clarify the origin of [[Earth]]'s moon whereas two of the penetrators are planned to land near the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 12]] landing sites, taking advantage of seismic data gathered there from 1969 to 1974.

The payload of the orbiter will total 120&nbsp;kg and include astrophysics experiments, dust monitors, plasma sensors, including the [[LORD]] astronomy payload, designed to study ultra-high-energy [[cosmic rays]]<ref>http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/luna-glob.htm</ref>.

The [[Luna-Glob 2]]<ref name="Aviation Week"/> joint orbiter-rover mission (the orbiter will be the Indian [[Chandrayaan-2]]) is planned for 2013 and will feature a 58&nbsp;kg Russian [[Polar Moon Rover]] and lander, as part of the [[International Lunar Network]]. This mission will land in Moon's south pole, examine a crater and operate for up to one year. The six wheeled, solar powered rover will land near one of the poles and will survive for a year, roving up to 150&nbsp;km at a speed of 360 m/h.

The next two missions,<ref>{{citeweb|title=Program of the Moon Exploration by Automatic Space Complexes|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/doc.cfm?fobjectid=41978|publisher=''[[ESA]]''|accessdate=2008-10-21}}</ref> to be called [[Luna-Grunt]], will launch in 2014, featuring an orbiter and a lander. The lander carries a large 400&nbsp;kg rover capable of in-situ soil analysis.
Later, in 2015, a second lander with a 400&nbsp;kg [[ascent stage]] will return up to 1&nbsp;kg of surface and rock samples.
