"'''The Trap'''" is the seventh episode of the [[Supermarionation]] television series ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''. It was first broadcast in the [[UK]] on {{Start date|1967|11|10}} on [[ATV Midlands]], was written by Alan Pattillo and directed by Alan Perry. In this episode, the [[Mysteron]]s plot to cause disaster at a secret International Air Conference.

"The Trap" is the only contribution to ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' from Pattillo, who was a major scriptwriter for ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''. The episode features several [[special effects]] sequences and models, and its production included some challenges for the effects departments. Footage from "The Trap" is used as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in the [[clip show]] episode, "[[The Inquisition (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Inquisition]]".

==Plot==
An International Air Conference has been organised to discuss anti-[[Mysteron]] defence. However, Commodore Goddard and his pilot, Holt, are killed ''en route'' to [[Cloudbase]] to finalise arrangements when their XQR plane is struck by storm [[lightning]] and crashes. The XQR's escort, Melody Angel, is uncertain what happened due to poor [[visibility]]. On arrival at Cloudbase, a Mysteron reconstruction of Goddard announces that, for secrecy, the conference will be held at the remote Glen Garry Castle in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The Mysterons cryptically warn that the "wings of the world will be clipped" the next morning.

Checking security at Glen Garry, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] encounters the reconstruction of Holt, who has mounted a [[machine gun]] in a secret passage leading off the conference hall that is concealed by a slide-up portrait. Goddard holds Scarlet [[at gunpoint]], revealing that the next morning the conference delegates will be massacred. When Symphony Angel arrives in a Magnacopter with the delegates, she too is captured and is gagged and manacled in the [[dungeon]] with Scarlet. Melody Angel launches from Cloudbase to search for proof that the original XQR was destroyed and soon sights wreckage. [[Colonel White]] realises that the [[air force]] leaders are at the mercy of Mysteron reconstructions and, with Scarlet and Symphony out of contact, dispatches [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] to [[Scotland]].

Scarlet and Symphony are released by Morton, the caretaker, after prodding a [[lance]] at a ceiling [[grille]] to attract attention. As Holt prepares to open fire, Scarlet bursts into the conference hall and shoots the Mysteron agent through the wall portrait, despite sustaining a bullet himself. Blue arrives at Glen Garry in a [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]] and warns Symphony, in the Magnacopter with Morton and the escaped delegates, that Goddard is on the battlements and prepared to open fire with another machine gun as soon as she lifts off. The injured Scarlet arrives and, gliding up to Goddard in a [[jet pack]], draws his fire so that the Magnacopter can clear the area. Scarlet is eventually shot down by Goddard, who is also killed when Blue blasts the battlements with the SPV gun. 

==Production==
[[Script editor]] for ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'', [[Tony Barwick]], was determined for Alan Pattillo to produce material for the series due to his experience as a script editor and writer for ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 264">Drake and Bassett, 264.</ref> However, commitments to other projects meant that Pattillo was able to submit only one script.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 264"/> For "The Trap", the castle setting was prescribed by [[Gerry Anderson]]<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 265">Drake and Bassett, 265.</ref> whom, Pattillo states, "always liked to have a Scottish subject in his series."<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 265"/> Previous [[Supermarionation]] adventures set partly in Scottish castles include ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]'' episode "The Loch Ness Monster" and ''Thunderbirds'' episode "30 Minutes after Noon", which both feature a miniature model that would make a reappearance in "The Trap" as Glen Garry Castle.<ref name="Bentley, 71">Bentley, 71.</ref>

In the [[Cold open|opening sequence]] depicting the XQR's destruction, the visual effect of the [[Lightning discharge|lightning bolt]] striking the aircraft would have been too much of a challenge to create live,<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 267">Drake and Bassett, 267.</ref> and was therefore [[superimposed]] over the recorded film in [[post-production]].<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 267"/> Flames and smoke issuing from the crippled XQR were produced by [[Jetex engine|Jetex]] fuel pellets attached to the side of the model turned away from the camera.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 267"/> Making its only appearance in "The Trap" is the Spectrum Magnacopter, the model of which was designed by [[Michael Trim|Mike Trim]].<ref name="Bentley, 22">Bentley, 22.</ref> The scale interior sets, however, were the responsbility of the [[art department]], which made use of mainly "flat sheet" rather than malleable materials in their designs:<ref name="Bentley, 22"/> as a result, there are discrepancies between Trim's streamlined model and the art department's more angular puppet sets.<ref name="Bentley, 22"/>

Alan Pattillo's script included challenging camera sequences which called for all ten "revamp puppets" that would portray the World Air Force leaders to appear in one shot.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 265">Drake and Bassett, 265.</ref><ref name="Drake and Bassett, 266">Drake and Bassett, 266.</ref> The character of Morton is portrayed by a puppet which had previously appeared in the episode "[[Point 783]]" as Colonel Storm, and which was modelled on American actor [[Robert Mitchum]].<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 266"/> ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' writers Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett also note the mixture of [[live action]] with Supermarionation puppetry in the dungeon scenes with the restrained Scarlet and Symphony, and their rescue by Morton.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 249">Drake and Bassett, 249.</ref>

The [[Shootout|gun battle]] between [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] and Goddard which forms the climax to "The Trap" posed a number of [[special effects]] challenges. In one shot, Goddard fires a line of bullets at the wall behind which Scarlet is concealed: to realise this effect, a strip of [[Cordtex]] explosive was lit at one end,<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 271">Drake and Bassett, 271.</ref> resulting in a succession of miniature blasts as the flame travelled to the far end.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 271"/> The Glen Garry model was filled with [[petrol]] [[gel]] which, ignited, created an explosion to portray the destruction of the castle.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 271"/> Making only its second appearance in all of ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' in the climax to "The Trap" is the Captain Scarlet "grimacing head",<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 271"/> which first features in the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|pilot episode]] when the character is similarly shot down by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]].<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 271"/>
