'''Standard & Poor's''' ('''S&P''') is a United States<U+2013>based [[Financial services|financial-services]] company. It is a division of [[McGraw-Hill|the McGraw-Hill Companies]] that publishes financial research and analysis on [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. It is well known for its [[stock market index|stock-market indices]], the US-based [[S&P 500]], the Australian [[S&P/ASX 200]], the Canadian [[S&P/TSX Composite|S&P/TSX]], the Italian [[S&P/MIB]] and India's [[S&P CNX Nifty]]. The company is one of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] [[credit rating agency|credit-rating agencies]], which also includes [[Moody's|Moody's Investor Service]] and [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blumenthal |first=Richard |url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/050509/opi_436594375.shtml |title=Three credit rating agencies hold too much of the power |publisher=Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper|date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref>

==Corporate history==
The company traces its history back to 1860, with the publication by [[Henry Varnum Poor]] of ''History of Railroads and Canals in the United States''. This book was an attempt to compile comprehensive information about the financial and operational state of U.S. railroad companies. Henry Varnum went on to establish '''H.V. and H.W. Poor Co.''' with his son, [[Henry William Poor|Henry William]], and published annually updated versions of this book. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1906, [[Luther Lee Blake]] founded the '''Standard Statistics Bureau''', with the view to providing financial information on non-railroad companies. Instead of an annually published book, Standard Statistics would use 5" x 7" cards, allowing for more frequent updates. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1941, Poor and Standard Statistics merged to become '''Standard & Poor's Corp.''' In 1966, the company was acquired by [[McGraw-Hill|The McGraw-Hill Companies]], and now encompasses the Financial Services division.<ref name="snphistory">{{cite web| title=A History of Standard & Poor's | url=http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/html/media/SP_TimeLine_2006.html | accessdate=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>

==Credit ratings==
As a credit-rating agency (CRA), the company issues credit ratings for the debt of public and private corporations. It is one of several CRAs that have been designated a [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]] by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

It issues both short-term and long-term [[credit rating]]s.

===Long-term credit ratings===
[[File:World countries Standard & Poor's ratings.png|thumb|300px|Sovereigns listings by Standard & Poor's as of August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/sovereigns/ratings-list/en/us |title=S&P &#124; Ratings Sovereigns Ratings List &#124; Americas |publisher=Standardandpoors.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref><ref name=ResearchUpdate>Reference for the United States: {{cite web|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobheadername1=content-type&blobwhere=1243942957443&blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 |title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered To 'AA+' On Political Risks And Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative |publisher=standardandpoors.com |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

The company rates borrowers on a scale from AAA to D. Intermediate ratings are offered at each level between AA and CCC (e.g., BBB+, BBB and BBB-). For some borrowers, the company may also offer guidance (termed a "credit watch") as to whether it is likely to be upgraded (positive), downgraded (negative) or uncertain (neutral).

'''Investment Grade'''
*'''AAA''': best-quality borrowers, reliable and stable (many of them sovereign governments)
*'''AA''':  quality borrowers, a bit higher risk than AAA. Includes:
**'''AA+''': equivalent to [[Moody's#Long-term obligation ratings|Moody's]] Aa1 (high quality, with very low credit risk, but susceptibility to long-term risks appears somewhat greater)
**'''AA''':  equivalent to Aa2
**'''AA-''': equivalent to Aa3
*'''A''':   quality borrowers whose financial stability could be affected by certain economic situations
**'''A+''': equivalent to A1
**'''A''':  equivalent to A2
*'''BBB''': medium-class borrowers, which are satisfactory at the moment
'''Non-Investment Grade''' (also known as [[junk bonds]])
*'''BB''':  more prone to changes in the economy
*'''B''':   financial situation varies noticeably
*'''CCC''': currently vulnerable and dependent on favorable economic conditions to meet its commitments
*'''CC''':  highly vulnerable, very speculative bonds
*'''C''':   highly vulnerable, perhaps in bankruptcy or in arrears but still continuing to pay out on obligations
*'''CI''':  past due on interest
*'''R''':   under regulatory supervision due to its financial situation
*'''SD''':  has selectively defaulted on some obligations
*'''D''':   has defaulted on obligations and S&P believes that it will generally default on most or all obligations
*'''NR''':  not rated

===Short-term issue credit ratings===
The company rates specific issues on a scale from A-1 to D. Within the A-1 category it can be designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the issuer's commitment to meet its obligation is very strong. [[Country risk]] and currency of repayment of the obligor to meet the issue obligation are factored into the credit analysis and reflected in the issue rating.

*'''A-1''': obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong
*'''A-2''': is susceptible to adverse economic conditions however the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory
*'''A-3''': adverse economic conditions are likely to weaken the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation
*'''B''':   has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial obligation but faces major ongoing uncertainties that could impact its financial commitment on the obligation
*'''C''':   currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation
*'''D''':   is in payment default. Obligation not made on due date and grace period may not have expired. The rating is also used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.

==Stock market indices==
It publishes a large number of stock market indices, covering every region of the world, [[market capitalization]] level and type of investment (e.g., indices for [[REIT]]s and [[preferred stock]]s)

These indices include:
* [[S&P 500]] <U+2013> free-float capitalization-weighted index of the prices of 500 large-capitalization common stocks actively traded in the US.
* [[S&P 400|S&P 400 MidCap Index]]

==Governance Scores (GAMMA)==
A [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/ap/page.product/equityresearch_gamma/2,5,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.html GAMMA score] reflects S&P's opinion of the relative strength of a company's [[corporate governance|corporate-governance]] practices as an investor protection against potential governance-related losses of value or failure to create value. GAMMA is designed for equity investors in emerging markets and is focused on non-financial-risk assessment, and in particular, assessment of corporate- governance risk.

===History of CGS and GAMMA Scores===
S&P has developed criteria and methodology for assessing corporate governance since 1998 and has been actively assessing companies' corporate-governance practices since 2000.

In 2007, the methodology of stand-alone governance analysis underwent a major overhaul to strengthen the risk focus of the analysis based on the group's experience assigning governance scores. GAMMA analysis focuses on a number of risks that vary in probability and expected impact on shareholder value. Accordingly, S&P's analysis seeks to determine the most vulnerable areas prompt to potential losses in value attributable to governance deficiencies. Recent developments in the international financial markets emphasize the relevance of [[enterprise risk management]] and the strategic process to governance quality. GAMMA methodology incorporates two new elements, addressing these areas of investor concern. It also promotes the culture of risk management and long-term strategic thinking among companies.

===GAMMA methodology components===
# Shareholder influence
# Shareholder rights
# Transparency, audit, and enterprise risk management
# Board effectiveness, strategic process and incentives

===GAMMA scale===
For the GAMMA score, the S&P uses a numeric scale from one to ten (with ten being the best possible score). At the S&P's discretion, a GAMMA score can be publicly disseminated or used privately.

* ''GAMMA-10 and GAMMA-9''&nbsp;&ndash; in S&P's opinion, the corporate-governance processes and practices at the company provide a very strong protection against potential governance related losses in value. A company in these scoring categories has, in S&P's opinion, few weaknesses in any of the major areas of governance analysis.

* ''GAMMA-8 and GAMMA-7''&nbsp;&ndash; in S&P's opinion, the corporate-governance processes and practices at the company provide strong protection against potential governance related losses in value. A company in these scoring categories has, in S&P's opinion, some weaknesses in certain of the major areas of governance analysis.

* ''GAMMA-6 and GAMMA-5''&nbsp;&ndash; in S&P's opinion, the corporate-governance processes and practices at the company provide moderate protection against potential governance related losses in value. A company in these scoring categories has, in S&P's opinion, weaknesses in several of the major areas of governance analysis.

* ''GAMMA-4 and GAMMA-3''&nbsp;&ndash; in S&P's opinion, the corporate-governance processes and practices provide weak protection against potential governance related losses in value. A company in these scoring categories has, in S&P's opinion, significant weaknesses in a number of the major areas of governance analysis.

* ''GAMMA-2 and GAMMA-1''&nbsp;&ndash; in S&P's opinion, the corporate-governance processes and practices provide very weak protection against potential governance related losses in value. A company in these scoring categories has, in S&P's opinion, significant weaknesses in most of the major areas of analysis.

==Downgrade of US long-term credit rating==
On August 5, 2011, S&P lowered the US's sovereign long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+.<ref name=Swann>{{cite press release|author=Swann, Nikola G et. al|title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered To 'AA+' Due To Political Risks, Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316529563|date=August 5, 2011|publisher=Standard & Poor's|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> The press release sent with the decision said, in part:<blockquote>
* "The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics.
* "More broadly, the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011.
* "Since then, we have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy, which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of Congress and the Administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government's debt dynamics any time soon."<ref name=Swann /></blockquote>
The following day, S&P acknowleged in writing a USD$2 trillion error in its calculations, saying the error "had no impact on the rating decision" and:<ref name=clarifyUS>{{cite press release|title=Standard & Poor's Clarifies Assumption Used on Discretionary Spending Growth|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DPressReleaseAug6.pdf&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobheadername1=content-type&blobwhere=1243943612380&blobheadervalue3=UTF-8|publisher = Standard & Poor's|date=August 6, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>"In taking a longer term horizon of 10 years, the U.S. net general government debt level with the current assumptions would be $20.1 trillion (85% of 2021 GDP).  With the original assumptions, the debt level was projected to be $22.1 trillion (93% of 2021 GDP)."<ref name=clarifyUS /></blockquote>

==Publications==
The company publishes ''[[The Outlook (newsletter)|The Outlook]]'', a near-weekly (48 times a year) [[stock market]] analysis newsletter, which is issued both in print and online to subscribers.

Standard & Poor's Governance Services analysts issue a monthly ''[http://www.standardandpoors.ru/page.php?path=gsubeng GAMMA Newsletter]'' containing comments and views on [[corporate governance]]-related matters in emerging markets (BRIC and beyond).

==Criticism==
{{See also|Credit rating agency#Criticism}}
CRAs such as S&P have been subject to criticism in the wake of large losses beginning in 2007 in the [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO) market that occurred despite being assigned top ratings by the CRAs.

Credit ratings of AAA (the highest rating available) were given to large portions of even the riskiest pools of loans. Investors, trusting the low-risk profile that AAA implies, purchased large amounts of CDOs that later became unsellable. Those that could be sold often took staggering losses. For instance, losses on $340.7&nbsp;million worth of CDOs issued by [[Credit Suisse Group]] added up to about $125&nbsp;million, despite being rated AAA by S&P.<ref name="cdo">{{Cite news

Companies pay S&P to rate their debt issues. As a result, some critics have contended that S&P is beholden to these issuers and that its ratings are not as objective as they should be.

In April 2009, the company called for "new faces" in the [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]], which was seen as interfering in the democratic process. In a subsequent statement they said they were "misunderstood".<ref>{{cite web|author=GAA Video: |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cowen-attacks-call-for-new-faces-in-cabinet-1693290.html |title=Cowen attacks call for 'new faces' in Cabinet - National News, Frontpage |publisher=Independent.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref>

Some critics have pointed out that the company and other rating agencies were part of the cause of the global financial crisis of 2008&ndash;2009, for example when [[Moody's]] downgraded [[Freddie Mac]]<ref name=AP-20080922>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title= Freddie Mac Courts Investors, Buffett Passes|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/22/business/NA-US-Mortgage-Giants-Crisis.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080915032759/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/22/business/NA-US-Mortgage-Giants-Crisis.php|archivedate=2008-09-15|date=August 22, 2008|publisher= ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' (via [[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> or, to quote ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', when "both agencies granted AAA rating to Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) that were chock-full-of crap mortgages, thereby helping to precipitate the 2008 financial collapse"<ref name=Klein>{{cite news|author=[[Joe Klein|Klein, Joe]]|title=Standard & Poor's Downgrades Itself|url=http://swampland.time.com/2011/08/06/u-s-downgrades-standard-and-poors/|date=August 6, 2011|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>). [[Ezra Klein]] wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that "Standard Poor's didn't just miss the bubble. They helped cause it." but he said S&P took the right action to downgrade the U.S.<ref name=Ezra>{{cite news|author=[[Ezra Klein|Klein, Ezra]]|title=Standard & Poor's Has Been Wrong Before.

With the US downgrade some have accused S&P of causing further damage for its own agenda. S&P acknowledged making a USD$2 trillion error in its justification for downgrading the US credit rating,<ref>{{cite news|author=Paletta, Damian|title=U.S. Debt Rating in Limbo as Treasury Finds Math Mistake by S&P in Downgrade Warning|date=August 5, 2011|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2011/08/05/u-s-debt-rating-in-limbo-as-treasury-finds-math-mistake-by-sp-in-downgrade-warning/|work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> but stated that it "had no impact on the rating decision".<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Richard |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/aug/06/us-credit-rating-downgrade-debt |title="US Stripped of AAA Credit Rating by S&P over Political Weakness" |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> "A judgment flawed by a $2 trillion error speaks for itself,"<ref>{{cite news|author=Goldfarb, Zachary A.|title=S&P Downgrades U.S. Credit Rating for First Time|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sandp-considering-first-downgrade-of-us-credit-rating/2011/08/05/gIQAqKeIxI_story.html|date=August 5, 2011|work= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> said a spokesman for the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].

Another issue that has concerned commentators is that an S&P rating&nbsp;&ndash; for example, of the US government or any other world government&nbsp&ndash; can have, and has had, a distinct effect on a truly global scale. But the decision on these ratings are made by the company's employees who are not elected by the public, and are not accountable for their decision making process. There is no appeals process against a credit-rating decision.

==Antitrust Review==
In November 2009, ten months after launching an investigation, the [[European Commission]] (EC) formally charged S&P with abusing its position as the sole provider of international securities identification codes for U.S. [[securities]] by requiring European [[financial firm]]s and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. "This behavior amounts to unfair pricing," the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&P. "The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out&nbsp;&ndash; for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement&nbsp;&ndash; and cannot be substituted.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/news/-24275-1.html
|title=EC Charges S&P With Monopoly Abuse
|year=2009
|editor=Securities Technology Monitor}}</ref>

S&P has run the [[CUSIP|CUSIP Service Bureau]], the only [[International Securities Identification Number]] (ISIN) issuer in the US, on behalf of the [[American Bankers Association]]. In its formal statement of objections, the European Commission alleges "that S&P is abusing this monopoly position by enforcing the payment of licence fees for the use of US ISINs by (a) banks and other financial services providers in the EEA and (b) information service providers in the EEA." It claims that comparable agencies elsewhere in the world either do not charge fees at all, or do so on the basis of distribution cost, rather than usage.<ref>
