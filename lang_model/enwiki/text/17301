According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Timothy''' was the son of [[Nephi, son of Helaman]], and brother of [[Nephi the Disciple]].  At one point while preaching as a missionary, he was stoned to death but was raised from the dead by his brother.  After the appearance of the resurrected [[Jesus Christ]] to the [[Nephites]], he along with Nephi was chosen by Christ to be one of [[Twelve Disciples]].

Timothy is relatively unusual in the Book of Mormon for having a Greek name.  (See also [[Mulek]]ites.)
