==History== 

The history of Yale-New Haven Hospital extends back to 1826 when the General Hospital Society of Connecticut was chartered as the first hospital in Connecticut and the fourth voluntary hospital in the nation.

The hospital rented temporary quarters and raised US$5,000 toward the purchase of land and construction.  A new 13-bed hospital opened in 1833 on seven and a half acres of land bordered by Cedar Street and Howard, Davenport and Congress avenues. The original building, called the '''State Hospital''', was designed by prominent New Haven architect [[Ithiel Town]] and cost US$13,000.

In 1862, the State Hospital was converted to a military hospital to care for [[Union (American Civil War)| Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]].  The hospital was renamed to the '''Knight United States Army General Hospital''' in honor of Jonathan Knight, the president of the board of trustees.  Some attending physicians moved with the civilian patients to temporary quarters on Whitney Avenue.

After the Civil War, the hospital was turned over to the General Society of Connecticut in 1865.  The hospital converted back to its original name of '''State Hospital'''.  The Connecticut Training School, the third training school for nurses in the United States, was opened by the hospital in 1873.  In 1884, the hospital's name was changed to '''New Haven Hospital''' to reflect the name that was widely being used by the residents of New Haven.

Yale School of Medicine and New Haven Hospital formalized their relationship in 1913.  U.S. medical education, which had begun as a simple apprenticeship system, evolved to become a formal educational plan based on alliances between medical schools and hospitals.  This was the start of what is now known as the Yale-New Haven Medical Center.  The first motorized ambulance was purchased by New Haven Hospital in 1914. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynhh.org/general/history/timeline.html| title=Historical timeline - Yale-New Haven Hospital|publisher=Yale-New Haven Hospital|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>.

In 1945 the hospital changed its name to '''Grace-New Haven Hospital''' after it affiliated itself with nearby Grace Hospital.  On July 6, 1946 George W. Bush was born at the hospital.  In 1951, the New Haven Dispensary formally merged with Grace-New Haven Hospital.  The New Haven Dispensary had opened in 1871 as the city<U+2019>s first outpatient clinic.  In 1965, a more formal agreement with the Yale School of Medicine resulted in another name change to '''Yale-New Haven Hospital'''.

1993 saw the opening of the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital becoming the first full-service children's hospital in Connecticut, including the first children's emergency department.  The Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital was opened in 2000, after the purchase of the Yale Psychiatric Institute.

Today, YNHH is a 944-bed private, nonprofit facility that ranks among the premier medical centers in the nation. Yale-New Haven is the largest acute care provider in southern Connecticut and one of the Northeast's major referral centers.

== Physical plant ==
The main patient campus of Yale-New Haven Hospital comprises three inpatient pavilions bounded by South Frontage Road, Park Street, Howard Avenue and York Street. The East Pavilion, originally called the Memorial Unit, was opened in 1950 (designed by [[Douglas Orr]]).  The South Pavilion was opened in 1982 and followed by the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital (West Pavilion) in 1993.  All three pavilions are connected by a central atrium. In 2000, Yale-New Haven Hospital acquired the nearby Yale Psychiatric Institute (designed by architect [[Frank Gehry]] in 1989) and opened Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. In 2004, the Yale-New Haven Shoreline Medical Center in Guilford, Connecticut was opened.  The New Haven Pavilion houses outpatient clinics, clinical laboratories and administration, among other departments.  Located across the street from the inpatient pavilions, it occupies land that the original hospital was built on in 1833.  The New Haven Pavilion connects directly to facilities of Yale School of Medicine.  Taking into account nearby outpatient and primary care facilities, along with administrative offices, Yale-New Haven Hospital covers {{convert|1900000|sqft|m2}} and growing.

==Smilow Cancer Hospital==
In 2004, Yale-New Haven Hospital proposed building a new 430-million-dollar building for [http://www.yalecancercenter.org Yale Cancer Center,]southern New England's only designated [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|Comprehensive Cancer Center]] and only one of 39 centers in the United States.  The Smilow Cancer Hospital will integrate all oncology patient services at the Hospital and Yale School of Medicine in one building specifically designed for the delivery of cancer care. 

While construction was scheduled to begin in September 2005, the project was delayed by disputes with unions and the city.  On March 22, 2006, the unions and the hospital reached an agreement.  Construction on the new Yale-New Haven Cancer Hospital started on May 18, 2006 with the demolition of the Grace Building and site preparation.  Groundbreaking occurred on Wednesday, September 6, 2006.

This new Cancer Center building will be named the Smilow Cancer Hospital in honor of Joel E. and Joan Smilow<U+2019>s overwhelmingly generous gift to the cancer hospital.  Joel E. Smilow is an alumnus of Yale University class of '54 and the former chair, chief executive officer and president of Playtex Products Inc.  Smilow Cancer Hospital will also be will also be known as the North Pavilion and will be connected to the other facilities via the atrium.  The 14-story facility is scheduled to open in late 2009 and projected to cost $37 million dollars more than the 2004 estimate.

The Cancer Center will also include an adjacent, six-story building at 55 Park Street. The building is currently being designed by [[Barry Svigals]] of Svigals + Partners and the [[Behnisch Architects]] California office.  The 55 Park building will house a large atrium connecting the main parking garage with the Smilow Cancer Hospital as well as clinical laboratories, the main hospital pharmacy and other support functions for the hospital.  The City of New Haven approved 55 Park on November 15, 2007.<ref>[http://www.svigals.com/article_detail.php?ID=39 M. E.
