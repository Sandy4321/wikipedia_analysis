Under international law, no country currently owns the [[North Pole]] or the region of the [[Arctic Ocean]] surrounding it. The five surrounding [[Arctic]] states, [[Russia]], the [[United States]] (via [[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] (via [[Greenland]]), are limited to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of {{convert|200|nmi|lk=in}} adjacent to their coasts.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070802/ts_nm/russia_arctic_dc news.yahoo.com]</ref>

Upon ratification of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), a country has a ten year period to make claims to an extended continental shelf which, if approved, gives it exclusive rights to resources on or below the seabed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex2.htm|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Annex 2, Article 4)|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Due to this, Norway (ratified the convention in 1996<ref name="ratif">http://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/status2007.pdf</ref>), Russia (ratified in 1997<ref name="ratif"/>), Canada (ratified in 2003<ref name="ratif"/>) and Denmark (ratified in 2004<ref name="ratif"/>) launched projects to base claims that they have exclusive right to certain portions of the Arctic seabed. The United States has signed, but [[United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS|not yet ratified]] this treaty, although [[George W.

The status of certain portions of the Arctic sea region are in dispute for various reasons.  Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States all regard parts of the Arctic seas as "national waters" (territorial waters out to 12 nautical miles) or "[[internal waters]]".  Further, all countries officially regard all waters beyond the 12-mile territorial sea limit as [[international waters]].  There also are disputes regarding rights to passage along "international seaways" (see [[Northwest Passage]]).

==North Pole and the Arctic Ocean==
===National Sectors: 1925&ndash;2005===
In 1925, based upon the Sector Principle, Canada became the first country to extend its boundaries northward to the North Pole, at least on paper, between 60<U+00B0>W and 141<U+00B0>W [[longitude]], a claim that is not universally recognized (there are in fact {{convert|415|nmi|abbr=on}} nautical miles of ocean between the Pole and Canada's northernmost land point)<ref name="links.jstor.org">T. E. M. McKitterick, "The Validity of Territorial and Other Claims in Polar Regions," ''Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law,'' 3rd Ser., Vol. 21, No. 1.

In 1926 Russia fixed its claim in Soviet law (32<U+00B0>04'35"E to 168<U+00B0>49'30"W)<ref>Sobranie Zakonov SSSR, 1926 (Russian)</ref>.  Norway (5<U+00B0>E to 35<U+00B0>E) made similar sector claims <U+2014> as did the United States (170<U+00B0>W to 141<U+00B0>W), but that sector contained only a few islands so the claim was not pressed. Denmark's sovereignty over all of Greenland was recognized by the United States in 1916 and by an international court in 1933. Denmark could also conceivably claim an Arctic sector (60<U+00B0>W to 10<U+00B0>W).<ref name="links.jstor.org"/>

In the context of the [[Cold War]], Canada sent [[Inuit]] families to the far north in the [[High Arctic relocation]], partly to establish territoriality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In addition, Canada claims the water within the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] as its [[Canadian Internal Waters|own internal waters]]. The United States is one of the countries which does not recognize Canada's, or any other countries', Arctic water claims, and has allegedly sent nuclear [[submarine]]s under the ice near Canadian islands without requesting permission.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

On April 15, 1926, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] declared the territory between two lines (35<U+00B0>E and 170<U+00B0>W) drawn from [[Murmansk]] to the North Pole and from the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] to the North Pole to be Soviet territory.<ref>George Ginsburgs, The Soviet Union and International Cooperation in Legal Matters, Martinus Nijhoff

Otherwise, until 1999 the North Pole and the major part of the Arctic Ocean had been generally considered international waters. However, due to [[Arctic shrinkage]] the [[Polar ice cap|polar ice]] has begun to recede at a rate higher than expected due to [[global warming]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Several countries have made moves to claim or to reinforce pre-existing claims to the waters or seabed at the Pole.

In response to the Russian ''Arktika 2007'' expedition, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister]] said the following:
{{cquote|This is posturing. This is the true north strong and free, and they're fooling themselves if they think dropping a flag on the ocean floor is going to change anything. There is no question over Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic. We've made that very clear. We've established - a long time ago - that these are Canadian waters and this is Canadian property.

In response to MacKay's comments, [[Sergey Lavrov]], the Russian [[List of Russian foreign ministers|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], stated:
{{cquote|I read reports of the statements made by my Canadian colleague, Peter MacKay. I know him quite well <U+2013> it<U+2019>s very unlike him. I was sincerely astonished by "flag planting." No one engages in flag planting. When pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way.
As to the legal aspect of the matter, we from the outset said that this expedition was part of the big work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the international authority where Russia<U+2019>s claim to submerged ridges which we believe to be an extension of our shelf is being considered. We know that this has to be proved.

The Danish autonomous province of [[Greenland]] has the nearest coastline to the North Pole, and Denmark argues that the [[Lomonosov Ridge]] is in fact an extension of Greenland.

On November 27, 2006, Norway also made an official submission into the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (article 76, paragraph 8). There are provided arguments to extend the Norwegian seabed claim beyond the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} EEZ in three areas of the northeastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the Arctic: the "Loop Hole" in the [[Barents Sea]], the Western Nansen Basin in the Arctic Ocean, and the "Banana Hole" in the [[Norwegian Sea]]. The submission also states that an additional submission for continental shelf limits in other areas may be posted later.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_nor.htm Outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines: Submissions to the Commission: Submission by Norway] [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf|CLCS]].

* {{Flagicon|Russia}} '''[[Russia]]'''
Russia is claiming a large extended continental shelf as far as the North Pole based on the Lomonosov Ridge within their Arctic sector. [[Moscow]] believes the eastern Lomonosov Ridge is an extension of the [[Siberia]]n [[continental shelf]].  The Russian claim does not cross the Russia-US Arctic sector demarcation line, nor does it extend into the Arctic sector of any other Arctic coastal state.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

On December 20, 2001, Russia made an official submission into the [[UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (article 76, paragraph 8).

[[Image:Mir front.jpg|thumb||[[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersible]].]]
On August 2, 2007, a Russian expedition called [[Arktika 2007]], composed of six explorers led by [[Artur Chilingarov]], employing [[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersibles]], for the first time in history descended to the [[seabed]] below the North Pole. Here they planted the [[flag of Russia]] and took water and [[soil]] [[sample (material)|samples]] for analysis, continuing a mission to provide additional evidence related to the Russian claim of the mineral riches of the Arctic.<ref>[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/comment_0807-3.pdf The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons], by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, August 2007</ref> This was part of the ongoing 2007 Russian North Pole expedition within the program of the 2007&ndash;2008 [[International Polar Year]].

The expedition aims to establish that the eastern section of seabed passing close to the pole, known as the Lomonosov Ridge, is in fact an extension of Russia's landmass. The expedition came as several countries are trying to extend their rights over sections of the Arctic Ocean floor. Both Norway and Denmark are carrying out surveys to this end. [[Vladimir Putin]] made a speech on a nuclear icebreaker on 3 May 2007, urging greater efforts to secure Russia's "strategic, economic, scientific and defence interests" in the Arctic<ref>ITAR-TASS (English) 0602 GMT 03 May 2009</ref>.

In mid-September 2007, Russia's Natural Resources Ministry issued a statement:
{{cquote|Preliminary results of an analysis of the earth crust model examined by the Arktika 2007 expedition, obtained on September 20, have confirmed that the crust structure of the Lomonosov Ridge corresponds to the world analogues of the continental crust, and it is therefore part of the Russian Federation's adjacent continental shelf.<ref name=Interfax>

In August 2007, an American [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] icebreaker, the [[USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)|USCGC ''Healy'']], headed to the Arctic Ocean to map the sea floor off Alaska. Larry Mayer, director of the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the [[University of New Hampshire]], stated the trip had been planned for months, having nothing to do with the Russians planting their flag. The purpose of the mapping work aboard the ''Healy'' is to determine the extent of the continental shelf north of Alaska.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070811/ap_on_sc/arctic_claims news.yahoo.com]</ref>

===Future===
It was stated by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] on March 25, 2007, that riches are awaiting the shipping industry due to Arctic [[climate change]]. This economic sector could be transformed similar to the way the [[Middle East]] was by the [[Suez Canal]] in the 19th century. There will be a race among nations for oil, fish, diamonds and shipping routes, accelerated by the impact of global warming.<ref>[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/series/thebigmelt The Big Melt], ''The New York Times'', October 2005</ref>
{{wikinews|Arctic ice levels at record low opening Northwest Passage}}
The potential value of the North Pole and the surrounding area resides not so much in shipping itself but in the possibility that lucrative [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves exist below the sea floor. Such reserves are known to exist under the [[Beaufort Sea]]. On September 14, 2007 the [[European Space Agency]] reported ice loss had opened up the Northwest Passage "for the first time since records began in 1978", and the extreme loss in 2007 rendered the passage "fully navigable".<ref name="esa">{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMYTC13J6F_index_0.html | title=Satellites witness lowest Arctic ice coverage in history | accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref><ref name="Beeb">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6995999.stm|title=Warming 'opens Northwest Passage'|accessdate=2007-09-14 | work=BBC News | date=2007-09-14}}</ref> Further exploration for petroleum reserves elsewhere in the Arctic may now become more feasible, and the passage may become a regular channel of international shipping and commerce if Canada is not able to enforce its claim to it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p363540_index.html |title=The Scramble for the Arctic: The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas and Extending Seabed Claims |date=2009-04-02 |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association 67th Annual National Conference, The Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, IL Online |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>

==Hans Island==
[[Image:Nares strait border (Kennedy channel).png|thumb|300px|Map of part of [[Kennedy Channel]], with the disputed Island.]]
{{main|Hans Island}}
Hans Island is situated in the [[Nares Strait]], a [[waterway]] that runs between [[Ellesmere Island]] (the northernmost part of [[Nunavut]], Canada) and Greenland. The island was named for Greenlandic Arctic traveller [[Hans Hendrik]].

In 1973, Canada and Denmark negotiated the geographic coordinates of the continental shelf, and settled on a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] treaty that was ratified by the [[United Nations]] on December 17, 1973, and has been in force since March 13, 1974. The treaty lists 127 points (by [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) from [[Davis Strait]] to the end of [[Robeson Channel]], where Nares Strait runs into [[Lincoln Sea]]; the border is defined by [[geodesic]] lines between these points. The treaty does not, however, draw a line from point 122 (80<U+00B0> 49' 2 - 66<U+00B0> 29' 0) to point 123 (80<U+00B0> 49' 8 - 66<U+00B0> 26' 3)<U+2014>a distance of {{convert|875|m|mi|abbr=on|2}}. Hans Island is situated in the centre of this area.

[[Flag of Denmark|Danish flag]]s were planted on Hans Island in 1984, 1988, 1995 and 2003. The Canadian government formally protested these actions. In July 2005, former [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Canadian defence minister]] [[Bill Graham]] made an unannounced stop on Hans Island during a trip to the Arctic; this launched yet another diplomatic quarrel between the governments, and a truce was called that September.

Canada had claimed Hans Island was clearly in their territory, as topographic maps originally used in 1967 to determine the island's coordinates clearly showed the entire island on Canada's side of the delimitation line. However, federal officials reviewed the latest satellite imagery in July 2007, and conceded that the line went roughly through the middle of the island. This presently leaves ownership of the island disputed, with claims over fishing grounds and future access to the Northwest Passage possibly at stake as well.<ref>{{cite news

==Beaufort Sea==
[[File:Arctic management area and disputed waters.jpg|thumb|The cross-hatched wedge-shaped region in the east is claimed by both Canada and the USA.]]

There is an ongoing dispute involving a wedge-shaped slice on the [[Canada <U+2013> United States border|International Boundary]] in the [[Beaufort Sea]], between the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Territory]] of [[Yukon]]  and the American [[U.S. state|state]] of Alaska.<ref name=CIAfactIssues>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#Issues Transnational Issues CIA World Fact Book]</ref>

The Canadian position is that the maritime boundary should follow the land boundary. The American position is that the maritime boundary should extend along a path equidistant from the coasts of the two nations. The disputed area may hold significant [[hydrocarbon]] reserves. The US has already leased eight [[Scientific visualization|plots]] of terrain below the water to search for and possibly exploit [[oil reserves]] that may exist there. Canada has protested diplomatically in response.<ref name=InstituteNorth>[http://www.institutenorth.org/servlet/download?id=35 Sea Changes]</ref>

No settlement has been reached to date, because the US has signed but has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. If the treaty is ratified, the issue would likely be settled at a tribunal.<ref name=CIAfactIssues/>

On August 20, 2009 [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] [[Gary Locke]] announced a [[moratorium on fishing the Beaufort Sea]] north of Alaska, including the disputed waters.<ref name=Fish2009-08-20>

Randy Boswell, of ''[[Canada.com]]'' wrote that the disputed area covered a {{convert|21436|km2|mi2}} section of the Beaufort Sea (smaller than [[Israel]], larger than [[El Salvador]]).
He wrote that Canada had filed a "[[diplomatic note]]" with the USA in April when the USA first announced plans for the moratorium.
