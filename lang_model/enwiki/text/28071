'''Vangjel Meksi''' (1770<U+2013>1821) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] physician, writer, and translator. One-time personal physician to [[Ali Pasha]], the 19th-century Albanian ruler of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]], Meksi produced the first translation of the [[New Testament]] into [[Albanian language|Albanian]] with the help and sponsorship of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS). Meksi did not live to see his work's publication however, which was supervised by [[Gregory IV of Athens]]. As a member ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]'', a secret society whose purpose was to establish an independent Greek state, Meksi joined the Greeks in the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]] during their [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and died shortly afterwards.

As well as its value to Albanian Christians, who could for the first time read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work advanced the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, [[August Schleicher]], and [[Johann Georg von Hahn]]. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.

==Early life==
Meksi was born in 1770 in [[Labov<U+00EB>]], a village near [[Gjirokast<U+00EB>r]], and pursued secondary studies in [[Yanina]], then an important [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] provincial centre but now in [[Greece]].<ref name=l112>Lloshi, p. 112</ref> His first employment was as a [[Folk medicine|folk physician]] to the court of [[Ali Pasha]], the [[Albanians|Albanian]] ruler of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]], a position he held until 1803. Armed with a [[letter of recommendation]] from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the [[University of Naples]] in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of [[San Giovanni a Carbonara]].<ref name=Monti>{{cite journal |last=Monti |first=Gennaro |year=1941 |journal=Rivista d'Albania |volume=II|pages=48<U+2013>50|accessdate=2010-06-20 }}</ref> After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians.<ref name=Monti/> His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the [[University of Paris]]), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the [[University of Vienna]]), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of [[Thanasis Vagias]], with a degree in medicine from [[Leipzig University]]).<ref name=Monti/><ref>Lloshi p. 113</ref>

==Philological activity== 
After falling out of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe.<ref name=l112/> During a brief stay in [[Venice]] he began to develop an interest in the Albanian alphabet and grammar.<ref name=l112/> He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abb<U+00E9> [[Claude Fleury]] (1640<U+2013>1723).<ref name=k516>Kastrati, p. 516</ref>

Meksi also wrote a grammar of the [[Albanian language]] in Albanian.<ref name=l117>Lloshi, p. 117</ref> It too has been lost, but it is mentioned in many letters reporting Meksi's work as an Albanian [[philology|philologist]] written by Robert Pinkerton to his superiors at the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS), which subsequently sponsored the translation of the New Testament into Albanian.<ref name=l117/> The work must have been written before 1819 and may be either the first Albanian grammar or the second, after that of [[Jani Evstrat Vithkuqari]]; it is not known which was published first.<ref name=k516/>

In this period Meksi also created a new Albanian alphabet, rationalizing and consolidating the many different [[Albanian_alphabet#List_of_alphabets_used_for_written_Albanian|pre-existing alphabets]],<ref name=m46>Meksi, p. 46</ref> employing a mix of Greek and Latin characters.<ref name=m46/> Using his new alphabet, he wrote a book called ''Orthography of the Albanian language'', ({{lang-sq|Drejtshkrimi i gjuh<U+00EB>s shqipe}}).<ref name=m46/>

==Translation of the New Testament==

Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's representative in Moscow, had met that year with a community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the [[Austrian Empire]]. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible.<ref name=c181>Clayers, p. 181</ref> In a letter to his superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied a large part of the ancient [[Illyria]], that they spoke a language completely different from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Latin language|Latin]], and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the [[Ionian islands]] under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.<ref name=c181/>

In 1819, apparently with the blessing of his superiors at the BFBS, Pinkerton met with Meksi in Istanbul.<ref name=c182>Clayers, p. 182</ref>  Meksi, who was then a teacher in [[Serres]], had been recommended to Pinkerton because of his Albanian grammar book.<ref name=c181/> Pinkerton also relates in one of his letters to the BFBS that Meksi was well-regarded by the Albanian community, the Greek Orthodox Church, and by [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople]].<ref name=l117/> Gregory, according to Pinkerton, also offered to find two suitable clergymen to assist Meksi in his endeavor.<ref name=l117/> Lastly, Pinkerton recommended that the Greek alphabet be used as the most suitable for the Albanian language.<ref name=l117/> On October 19, 1819, Pinkerton and Meksi concluded a contract to translate the New Testament into Albanian on behalf of the society. It was agreed that the Bible would have to be translated into the Albanian dialect of Yanina.<ref name=c182/> Meksi completed the work in two years,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Elsie |first=Robert |year=1991 |title=Albanian Literature in Greek Script: The Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Century Orthodox Tradition In Albanian Writing |journal=Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies |volume=15 |pages=20<U+2013>34 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/86997/Albanian-literature-in-Greek-script-?secret_password=&autodown=pdf |accessdate=2010-06-20 |quote=}}</ref> ten&nbsp;months earlier than the contract's deadline.<ref>Lloshi pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref>

Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited [[Thessaloniki]] to supervise the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, and that the only outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task.<ref name=l118>Lloshi p. 118</ref> In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to [[Malta]] to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in [[Corfu]] the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian.<ref name=l118/> Meanwhile the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the [[Archimandrite]] of [[Euboea]], [[Grigor Gjirokastriti]], an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop [[Gregory IV of Athens]].<ref name=l118/> Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than [[Koine]].<ref name=l119>Lloshi p. 119</ref>

On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's secretary in Corfu, sent a letter to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 [[Two Sicilies piastra|piastras]] and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]].<ref name=l119/> On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of [[Messolonghi]] was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian.<ref name=ll28>Lloshi, p. 128</ref> In July 1827 the form in which the first 500&nbsp;copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London.<ref name=ll32>Lloshi, p. 132</ref> The entire edition amounted to 2,000&nbsp;copies.<ref name=l142>Lloshi, p. 142</ref>

Although Gjirokastriti's edition of the New Testament was written in Albanian, it used the Greek alphabet.<ref name=l23>Lloshi, p. 23</ref> It is not known which alphabet Meksi used in his own manuscript.<ref name=l23/>

The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] was not against the work of Meksi or the Bible Society at that time. On the contrary, for the translation  the British missionaries successfully appealed to Gregory V and enlisted the help of an Orthodox bishop, Gjirokastriti, for the final edition of the New Testament in Albanian.<ref name=c182/>

==Greek War of Independence==
Meksi was a member of the ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]'',<ref name=c182>Clayers, p. 182</ref> a secret society whose purpose was to overthrow [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over the [[Balkans]] and to establish an independent Greek state. When the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]].<ref name=c182/> Despite suffering from a serious bout of [[pneumonia]], he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] to end the fighting between the Albanians on the Ottoman side and those on the Greek side during the siege,<ref name=m56>Meksi, p. 56</ref> an arrangement that helped the Greeks to victory.<ref name=m56/>

==Legacy==
Meksi did not live to see the 1827 publication of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51.<ref name=c182/> The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language,<ref name=c183/> it ran to 2,000&nbsp;copies, a huge number for the time.<ref name=l142/> It preceded the modern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] version by two years and the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] translation by twenty.<ref name=k519>Kastrati p. 519</ref> A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens,<ref name=c183>Clayers 183</ref> but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.<ref name=l142/>

Meksi's work was important for the development of written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable [[Albanian alphabet]] had to be created.<ref name=l142/> His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a [[Tatar language|Tatar]] origin.<ref name=l142/> Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root.<ref name=l142/>

Two other international scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi's translation of the New Testament: [[August Schleicher]], who stated that his knowledge of the conjugation of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi's work,<ref name=l143-144>Lloshi, pp. 143-144</ref> and [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] an Austrian diplomat, [[Philology|philologist]], and specialist in [[Albania]]n history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into [[Gheg Albanian]] with the help of [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]].<ref name=l144>Lloshi, p. 144</ref>
