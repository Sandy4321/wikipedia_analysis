==Plot summary==
The heroine, Elizabeth Cabot, is the head of a venture capital firm.  She begins a relationship with Jack Fairfax, who specializes in turning around failing businesses.  After a single night together, she learns information that turns her against him, and she ends the relationship.  Six months later, they are forced to work together when a new product is stolen from a company in which she has invested, that Jack is attempting to bring back to profitability.  

Together, they trail the thief to a [[film noir]] festival in Colorado.  As they work to solve the mystery, they fall in love.

==Themes==
Critic Erin Young believes this novel, along with Krentz's other novels ''[[Flash (Krentz novel)|Flash]]'' and ''Sharp Edges'', are carving out a new subgenre of the [[romance novel]], the corporate romance.<ref name=young>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Erin S.|title=Escaping the "Time Bend": Negotiations of Love and Work in Jayne Ann Krentz's "Corporate Romances"|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=33|issue=2|date=June 2010|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>  In these works, the hero and heroine are professional equals. In ''Soft Focus'', the protagonists each own their own successful companies.   Unlike in many earlier contemporary romance novels, the central conflict is a battle for control of work-related endeavors.  They form a partnership not because they like each other, but because they cannot achieve their professional goals alone.<ref name=young/>

As in ''Flash'', Krentz uses the theme of family ties helping to ease business life. Unlike in ''Flash'', heroine Elizabeth is not working directly with her family members, yet her secretary Louise is described as such a close friend that she is family-like.  Louise uses her personal connections to help Elizabeth and Jack enter a closed location, so that they could pursue their business goals. This reiterates Krentz's frequent plot point that family, or those considered so, can be an asset at work.<ref name=young/>

The novel is partially set at a film noir festival.  Krentz brings this theme through the novel.<ref name=smith/>  The book references many classic noir films,<ref name=kirkus/> and the plotting essentially puts the characters in a real film noir situation.<ref name=smith/>
