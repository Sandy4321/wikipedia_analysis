"'''Blink'''" is the tenth episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 3)|third series]] of the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was first broadcast on 9 June 2007 on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC). The episode was directed by [[Hettie MacDonald]] and is the only episode in the 2007 series written by [[Steven Moffat]]. The episode is based on a previous short story written by Moffat for the 2006 ''Doctor Who Annual'', entitled "'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' By Sally Sparrow".

In the episode, [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]<U+2014>a [[time travel in fiction|time travelling]] alien played by [[David Tennant]]<U+2014>and his [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]) are trapped in the past and try to warn a young woman, Sally Sparrow ([[Carey Mulligan]]), how to prevent the [[Weeping Angels]] from taking control of the [[TARDIS]]. In order to solve the case, Sparrow, along with her best friend's brother Larry Nightingale (Finlay Robertson), must make the connection between seventeen separate DVD titles, each with unique [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] hidden in them.

Due to the Doctor and his companion have very little screen time, allowing another episode to be filmed simultaneously, "Blink" is consequently referred to as a "Doctor-lite" episode. The scenes at Wester Drumlins were actually shot in a derelict house in [[Newport, Shropshire]]. To create the angels, two actresses wore makeup and prosthetics. The episode was seen by 6.62 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. Moffat won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Craft]] and [[BAFTA Cymru]] awards for Best Writer, and the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]]. For her single performance in the series, [[Carey Mulligan]] won the [[Constellation Awards|Constellation Award]] for Best Female Performance in a 2007 Science Fiction Television Episode. In 2009 the episode was voted the second best ''Doctor Who'' story in history by readers of ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]''.

==Plot==
In 2007, Sally Sparrow ([[Carey Mulligan]]) enters the dilapidated house, Wester Drumlins, to look for subjects to photograph but instead finds eerie angel-like statues and messages from [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) behind the peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her of the "[[Weeping Angels]]". Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale ([[Lucy Gaskell]]) to explore further; Kathy disappears as at the same time a young man claiming to be Kathy's grandson delivers a letter to Sally.  The letter from Kathy explains, just moments ago from Sally's perspective, that Kathy suddenly found herself in the 1920s in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Kathy settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and, in the letter, requests Sally to let her closest relative, her brother Larry, know of her disappearance. Sally finds a [[yale key]] hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.

Sally visits Larry (Finlay Robertson) at a DVD rental shop and finds that he has documented a series of "[[easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]]" across seventeen unrelated DVDs, each with the same man calling himself "The Doctor" having half of a conversation with the viewer.  Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs as she leaves for the police station.  There, she meets [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Inspector]] Billy Shipton ([[Michael Obiora]]), who explains that there have been several disappearances at the Drumlins and shows her an [[Impounded vehicle auction|impound]] lot containing vehicles abandoned near the Drumlins, including a locked [[TARDIS|fake police box]].  Sally leaves, but remembers the key she found and returns to find that Billy and the phonebox have disappeared.  She immediately receives a call from a much older Billy ([[Louis Mahoney]]) on his death bed at the hospital and visits him.  Billy explains that after she left the lot, he discovered the Angels trying to retrieve the police box.  Billy then suddenly found himself in 1969 and met the Doctor, who asked him to relay a message to Sally decades later; Billy subsequently married and started a video production house and was responsible for putting the easter eggs on the DVDs.  Before Billy dies, he tells Sally the Doctor's message to her; the message is to look at the list of DVDs containing the easter eggs.  Sally discovers that the list is her own DVD collection and realises the easter eggs are meant for her.

Sally and Larry return to the Drumlins with a portable DVD player and watch the entirety of the easter egg. Sally discovers she can "converse" with the Doctor as, in the past, he possesses a complete version of the transcript that is currently being compiled in the present by Larry as he watches. The Doctor explains that he and [[Martha Jones]] were transported to the past by the Weeping Angels, beings that feed off the potential time energy of others. The Angels are "[[Quantum Zeno effect|quantum locked]]", allowing them to move incredibly fast when unobserved but when they are seen, they literally turn to stone. They cover their eyes to avoid looking at each other, giving them their "weeping" appearance. He warns Sally not to look away or even blink when they are around. The Doctor tells them they are seeking his TARDIS&mdash;the fake police box&mdash;to acquire its potential power, which could have catastrophic results. When the Doctor comes to the end of the transcript, Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room and the two quickly escape to the basement. There, they discover the Angels have brought the TARDIS and Sally and Larry take shelter inside it as the Angels surround them. Inside, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that the TARDIS has detected a control disc&mdash;the DVD they have just watched&mdash;which can activate it for one journey; upon doing so the TARDIS dematerialises, leaving the two of them behind. However, with the TARDIS gone, the Angels have been tricked into observing each other, permanently frozen as statues staring at each other.

A year later, Sally and Larry have opened a DVD and book store together, though Sally's insistence on keeping a folder of the events for the Doctor worries Larry. Larry longs for a romantic relationship, but Sally insists their relationship is defined as "just a shop."  As Larry steps out for an errand, Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop, carrying a bow and quiver of arrows and goes to meet them.  When they do not recognise her, she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past and hands over her folder of information, warning the Doctor he may need it in his future, thus completing the [[ontological paradox]].  The Doctor and Sally say their goodbyes as Larry returns, surprised to see the man from the easter egg.  Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship.  The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's warning to Sally, this time [[fourth wall|directed at the viewer]], overlaid with flashes of famous bronze and stone statues.

 |quote = You have to remember that being scared of the dark and being scared of monsters is basically a childish impulse. There's always something of the nursery about horror....Adults never quite grow out of their childhood fears.  They just belong in a different part of our heads. ''Doctor Who'' isn't a childish programme, but it is childlike: it's a programme for children. And many, many adults who watch and love it watch it as that: as something like [[Harry Potter]].

"Blink" was written by [[Steven Moffat]]. Part of the story for "Blink" is based on Moffat's own [[Ninth Doctor]] short story from the ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'' called "'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow".<ref name="factfile"/> The shot story is presented as a homework essay from Sally, though only 12 years old, who encounters evidence of the Doctor's presence from the past in her aunt's house while visiting. "What I Did" includes several elements that are reused in "Blink", including messages under the wallpaper and an ontological paradox involving a conversation between Sally and the Doctor, prerecorded on a [[VHS|video cassette]], based on a written transcript<U+2014>the essay itself; however, instead of the Angels, "What I Did" features the Doctor and the TARDIS inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine, and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring it back to him in the past.<ref name=thstory>{{cite web|last=Moffat|first=Steven|title='What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/blink_annual.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=7 August 2012|date=2006}}</ref> Moffat was also inspired to write the episode based on the popular children's game [[Statues (game)|Statues]],<ref name=whoisthedoctor>Burk and Smith, p. 166</ref> which he always found "frightening".<ref name="confidential"/>

"Blink" is the third story of the revived series to be adapted for television by the same writer from a piece of their spin-off writing. It follows the "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]" and "[[The Family of Blood]]" story arc, which was adapted by [[Paul Cornell]] from his 1995 novel ''[[Human Nature (Doctor Who novel)|Human Nature]]'';<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Allen|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/tubetalk/a224345/gareth-roberts-talks-who-sarah-jane.html|title=Gareth Roberts talks 'Who', 'Sarah Jane'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> and "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]", which used the basic premise as well as several scenes and lines of dialogue adapted by [[Robert Shearman]] from his 2003 audio drama ''[[Jubilee (Doctor Who audio)|Jubilee]]''.<ref name="Cavern">{{cite web| title = Doctor Who at the Cavern Club&nbsp;<U+2013> A Great Success |publisher = The Mind Robber | year = 2007 |url=http://www.themindrobber.co.uk/dr-who-at-cavern.html |accessdate = 19 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Carey Mulligan 2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=A woman stands and smiles, holding a microphone|Actress [[Carey Mulligan]] appeared in the episode as Sally Sparrow.]]
"Blink" was directed by [[Hettie MacDonald]], making her the first female director of a ''Doctor Who'' episode since the [[Sixth Doctor]] serial ''[[The Mark of the Rani]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jusino|first=Teresa|title=Moffat's Woman #3 <U+2013> Sally|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/01/moffats-women-3-sally|work=''[[Tor Books{{!}}Tor.com]]''|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|accessdate=7 August 2012|date=27 January 2010}}</ref> [[Russell T Davis]], the series' executive producer, later noted that, due to MacDonald's work, the episode included some of "the most beautiful [visuals] we've ever had".<ref name="commentary"/> British actress [[Carey Mulligan]] was chosen to play Sally Sparrow; Mulligan was reportedly ecstatic to have been cast in the series. She initially was concerned due to the fact that Tennant would have little screen time. After the episode aired, however, was very pleased with the final result.<ref name="confidential"/>

Location shooting for scenes set at the Police Station Garage took place at the [[Coal Exchange]] and Mount Stuart Square, [[Cardiff Bay]] on 21 November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/cardiff-coal-exchange-mount-stuart-square|title= Walesarts, Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay|work=BBC <U+2013> Wales|publisher = [[BBC]]|accessdate = 30 May 2010}}</ref> Fields House, located in [[Newport, Shropshire]], filled in for Wester Drumlins.<ref name="confidential"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Fields House|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/locations/fieldshouse|publisher=Doctor Who <U+2013> The Locations Guide|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> The house was already abandoned and falling into despair when the filming crews arrived.

Originally, the producers considered having [[Michael Obiora]] play both the young and old version of Billy Shipton. However, it was decided that Obiora in makeup would look too fake, and so [[Louis Mahoney]] was cast to play the older version.

To create the effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson through themselves around the ship's set. The camera's operator than shook the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves.<ref name="confidential"/> The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more "authentic".<ref name="commentary"/> Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that he can hear her in the DVD shop, because he knew the lines that appeared would have to play "double duty later on" and be authentic and fresh both times.<ref name="commentary"/> [[Murray Gold]], the composer for the series, called the sequences "the heart of the [[Chinese puzzle]]".<ref name="commentary"/>
