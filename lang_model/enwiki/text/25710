===Heat Rejection System===
The temperatures in the potential areas at which the MSL may land can vary from +30 to <U+2212>127<U+00B0>C (+86<U+00B0>F to <U+2212>197<U+00B0>F). Therefore, the Heat Rejection System (HRS) uses fluid pumped through 60m (200&nbsp;feet) of tubes in the MSL body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/images/20081209_msl.html |title=Keeping it Cool (...or Warm!) |date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2009-08-09 |publisher=NASA/JPL}}</ref> Other methods of heating the internal components include using radiated heat generated from the components in the craft itself, as well as excess heat from the MMRTG unit. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/technology/tech_serv_env.html |title=In-situ Exploration and Sample Return: Technologies for Severe Environments |accessdate=2008-12-11 |publisher=NASA/JPL}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Landing system==
[[Image:20090428MSLEntry1.jpg|right|thumb|MSL landing diagram for outside Martian atmosphere and for entry.]]
[[Image:20090428MSLEntry2.jpg|right|thumb|MSL landing diagram for parachute descent, powered descent, and sky crane.]]

Landing a large mass on Mars is a difficult challenge: the atmosphere is thick enough to prevent rockets being used to provide significant deceleration, but too thin for [[parachute]]s and [[aerobraking]] alone to be effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2007/07/17/the-mars-landing-approach-getting-large-payloads-to-the-surface-of-the-red-planet/ |title=The Mars Landing Approach: Getting Large Payloads to the Surface of the Red Planet |accessdate=2008-10-21|work=Universe Today }}</ref> Although some previous missions have used [[Airbag#Aerospace and military applications|airbags]] to cushion the shock of landing, the MSL is too large for this to be an option.

The MSL will be set down on the Martian surface using a new high-precision entry, descent, and landing (EDL) system that will place it in a 20 [[kilometer]] (12 mile) landing ellipse, in contrast to the 150 kilometer by 20 kilometer (about 93 miles by 12 miles) landing ellipse of the landing systems used by the Mars Exploration Rovers.<ref name="EntryDescentLanding">{{cite web |url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/timeline/edl/index.html |title=Entry, Descent, and Landing |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=2009-09-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

For this, the MSL will employ a combination of several systems in a precise order, where the entry, descent and landing sequence will break down into four parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/tl_edl.html |title=Mission Timeline: Entry, Descent, and Landing |accessdate=2008-10-07 |publisher=NASA and JPL |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080619055613/http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/tl_edl.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04161341 |title=Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent, and Landing Triggers |accessdate=2008-10-21 |coauthors=Kipp D., San Martin M., Essmiller J., Way D. |publisher=IEEE }}</ref>

*'''Guided entry''' -  The rover is folded up within an [[aeroshell]] which protects it during the travel through space and during the [[atmospheric reentry|atmospheric entry]] at Mars.  [[Atmospheric entry]] is accomplished using a [[Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator|Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA)]] heat shield.  The 4.5-m (14-ft, 9-in.) diameter heat shield, which will be the largest heat shield ever flown in space,<ref>NASA, [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/msl-20090710.html Large Heat Shield for Mars Science Laboratory], 07.10.09 (accessed Mar 26 2010)</ref> reduces the velocity of the spacecraft by ablation against the Martian atmosphere, from the interplanetary transit velocity of 5.3 to 6&nbsp;km/sec down to approximately [[Mach number|Mach]]-2, where parachute deployment is possible.  Much of the reduction of the landing precision error is accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, similar to that used by the astronauts returning to Earth in the [[Apollo space program]].  This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to "fly out" any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline which results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight, again similar to the [[Apollo Command Module]]. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast masses. The lift vector is controlled by four sets of two [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters that produce approximately 500&nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allows the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone.
[[Image:20090422MSLtestparachute.jpg|right|thumb|The MSL test parachute. Note the people in the lower-right corner of the image.]]
*'''Parachute descent''' - Like [[Viking program|Viking]], [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], the Mars Science Laboratory will be slowed by a large [[parachute]].<ref name="EntryDescentLanding"/> After the entry phase is complete and the capsule has slowed to Mach 2, a supersonic parachute is deployed.  The entry vehicle must first eject the ballast mass such that the [[center of gravity]] offset is removed. In March and April 2009 the parachute for the MSL was tested in [[NASA Ames Research Center#Wind tunnels|the world's largest wind tunnel]] and passed flight-qualification testing.<ref name="ParaTest">{{cite web |url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&NewsID=90 |title=Mars Science Laboratory Parachute Qualification Testing |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> The parachute has 80 suspension lines, is over 165 feet (50 meters) long, and is about 51 feet (16 meters) in diameter.<ref name="ParaTest"/> The parachute is capable of being deployed at Mach 2.2 and can generate up to 289&nbsp;kN (65,000 pounds) of drag force in the Martian atmosphere.<ref name="ParaTest"/>
*'''Powered descent''' - Following the parachute braking, the rover and descent stage drop out of the aeroshell.<ref name="EntryDescentLanding"/> The descent stage is a platform above the rover with variable thrust mono propellant [[hydrazine]] rocket thrusters on arms extending around this platform to slow the descent. Meanwhile, the rover will transform from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while being lowered beneath the descent stage by the "Sky Crane" system.
*'''Sky Crane''' - The Sky Crane system will lower the rover to a "soft landing" <U+2013>wheels down<U+2013> on the surface of Mars.<ref name="EntryDescentLanding"/> This consists of 3 bridles lowering the rover and an umbilical cable carrying electrical signals between the descent stage and rover.  At roughly 7.5 meters below the descent stage the "sky crane" system slows to a halt and the rover touches down. After the rover touches down it waits 2 seconds to confirm that it is on solid ground and fires several [[pyrotechnics|pyros]] (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage.  The descent stage promptly flies away to a crash landing, and the rover gets ready to roam Mars. The planned "Sky Crane" powered descent landing system has never been used in actual missions before.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noy8o0lN1fE&feature=related Sky crane concept video]</ref>

==Proposed landing sites==
The essential issue when selecting an optimum landing site is to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support microbial life. To mitigate the risk of disappointment and ensure the greatest chance for science success, interest is placed at the greatest number of possible science objectives at a chosen landing site.  Thus, a landing site with morphologic and mineralogic evidence for past water, is better than a site with just one of these criteria. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] is preferred; [[clay minerals]] and [[sulfate]] salts would constitute a rich site. [[Hematite]], other [[iron oxide]]s, sulfate minerals, [[silicate minerals]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], and possibly [[chloride]] minerals have all been suggested as possible substrates for [[Fossil formation|fossil preservation]]. Indeed, all are known to facilitate the preservation of fossil morphologies and molecules on Earth.<ref>{{Cite journal| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Landing&nbsp;<U+2014> Discussion Points and Science Criteria | title=MSL&nbsp;<U+2014> Landing Sites Workshop| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=July 15| year=2008| id= | contribution-url=http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/msl2009/memoranda/sites_jul08/Discussion%20Points-Science%20Criteria.doc| format=Microsoft Word| accessdate=2008-10-21 }}</ref> Difficult terrain is the best candidate for finding evidence of livable conditions, and engineers must be sure the rover can safely reach the site and drive within it.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Survivor: Mars&nbsp;<U+2014> Seven Possible MSL Landing Sites | date=18 September 2008 | publisher=NASA | url =http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/spotlight/20080918.html | work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |pages= |accessdate=2008-10-21 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
