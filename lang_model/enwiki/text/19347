'''Stephen James Strasburg''' (born July 20, 1988, in {{city-state|San Diego|California}}) is a right-handed pitcher for the [[Washington Nationals]], who selected him with the first pick in the [[2009 Major League Baseball Draft]]. He signed a record $15.1 million contract with the Nationals on August 17, 2009, just 77 seconds before the deadline, breaking a record previously held by [[Mark Prior]], who had signed for $10.5 million in 2001.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/18/AR2009081800095.html | title=It's a Deal: Strasburg, Nationals Agree | last=Harlan | first=Chico | accessdate=June 4, 2010 | date=August 18, 2009 | publisher=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> He was called the "most-hyped pick in draft history" by [[ESPN]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&page=starting9/10601 | first=Jerry | last=Crasnick | accessdate=June 4,2010 | date=June 2, 2010 | title=Bryce Harper, you're next: Will soon join Strasburg, Prior and A-Rod on list of most-hyped draft picks of all time | publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> and the "most hyped and closely watched pitching prospect in the history of baseball" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://m.si.com/news/archive/archive/detail/2620334;jsessionid=FA48114DED35EA9A57CD015DEED9B327.cnnsi2b | title=Nationals taking safe road with Strasburg but is it right one? | first=Tom | last=Verducci | accessdate=June 4, 2010 | date=May 18, 2010}}</ref>

==San Diego State==
In 2008, as a sophomore at [[San Diego State University]], Strasburg went 8<U+2013>3 with a 1.57 [[earned run average]] and 133 [[strikeout]]s in 97<U+2153> [[inning]]s for the [[San Diego State Aztecs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings|title=NCAA Statistics}}</ref> Four of his thirteen starts in 2008 were complete games, two of which were shutouts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final 2008 Season Statistics |publisher=San Diego State Aztec Athletics official website |url=http://goaztecs.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/archive/061108aab.html |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>  On April 11 of that year, he struck out a Mountain West Conference record 23 batters in a game versus the [[University of Utah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/2.7442/baseball-strasburg-strikes-out-23-utes-1.793677|title=BASEBALL: Strasburg strikes out 23 Utes |publisher=The Daily Aztec | first=Edward | last=Lewis | date=April 13, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref>

==International play==
Strasburg was the lone collegiate player selected for the [[United States national baseball team|U.S. Baseball]] team at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. He had previously pitched for the USA Baseball National Team (College) when he was selected to the Olympic Team.

In his first start at the Olympics, Strasburg one-hit the [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands]] over seven innings, striking out five of the first six batters he faced. The lone hit Strasburg allowed was a seventh-inning single to [[Sharnol Adriana]]. There were two rain delays each lasting at least 90 minutes, and the game was called off after eight innings following the second wait. 

With the U.S. having already secured a spot in the semifinals medal round, Team USA Manager [[Davey Johnson]] held Strasburg from what should have been his second start on August 20 in order to pitch him in the first round of the semifinals against Cuban [[Norge Luis Vera]]. The strategy did not work, as Vera outdueled Strasburg with six innings pitched and only two runs (one earned). Strasburg, meanwhile, lasted only four innings while giving up three runs (two earned). Cuba won the game 10<U+2013>2.

Strasburg ended up with a 1<U+2013>1 record, a 1.67 ERA, and a bronze medal for the Olympics, as Team USA won its following contest against [[Japan national baseball team|Japan]] 8<U+2013>4.<ref name="biostat">{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/st/stephen-strasburg-1.html|title=Stephen Strasburg Biography and Statistics|accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>
