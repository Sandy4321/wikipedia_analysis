'''Patriarch Sergius I''' (Ivan Stragorodsky) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+0421><U+0435><U+0440><U+0433><U+0438><U+0439> (<U+0421><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0418><U+043E><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447>)) (January 11, [[1867]] <U+2013> May 15, [[1944]]), 12th  [[Patriarch of Moscow]] and all of Russia from [[September 8]],[[1943]] until his death. He was also the ''de facto'' head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] as Patriarchal [[locum tenens]] in [[1925]]-[[1943]]. 

Ivan Stragorodsky was born in the town of [[Arzamas]] near Nizhny Novgorod in a deeply religious family of an [[archpriest]]. Named Sergius after becoming a monk he studied in Nizhny Novgorod [[seminary]] and later in [[Saint-Petersburg]] [[Theological]] Academy. In 1890 Sergius was sent with an Orthodox Christian mission to [[Japan]] and became fluent in Japanese (he already knew Greek, Latin and Hebrew languages). In 1899 he returned to Saint-Petersburg Theological Academy and was appointed its [[rector]]. In 1901 Sergius was appointed [[archbishop]] of [[Finland]] and [[Vyborg]], and in 1911 he became member of the Russian [[Holy Synod]]. On [[August 10]], [[1917]] he was transferred to the see of [[Vladimir]] and [[Shuya]] and on [[November 28]] of the same year, [[Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]] elevated him to the rank of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]. [[Bolsheviks]] arrested Metropolitan Sergius in January of 1921, after months in jail he was exiled from [[Moscow]] to [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. From [[June 16]], [[1922]] to [[August 27]], [[1923]] Sergius participated in the so-called [[Living Church]] (or Renovationist [[schism]]), but later publicly repented of his actions and was forgiven by Patriarch Tikhon. He was appointed the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] on [[March 18]], [[1924]]. 

Knowing that it would not be possible to conduct proper elections of the [[Patriarch]] upon his death, [[Patriarch Tikhon]] made a will where he appointed three candidates, one of whom would assume the leadership of the Church after Tikhon's passing away. On [[April 12]], [[1925]], one of the candidates, Metropolitan [[Peter of Krutitsy]] and Kolomna was elected as the Patriarchal ''Locum Tenens'' (''<U+041C><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0431><U+043B><U+044E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0442><U+0440><U+0438><U+0430><U+0440><U+0448><U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430>''). However, only 8 months later, on [[December 10]], [[1925]] he was arrested. Foreseeing his imminent arrest, he followed [[Tikhon]]'s example, likewise appointing three candidates to succeed him. After Peter's arrest, Sergius of Nizhny Novgorod was the only bishop from Peter's "list" who was not in prison or exile at the time. He assumed leadership of the Church with the title ''Deputy Patriarchal Locum Tenens'', presuming that [[Peter of Krutitsy]] remained the ''de jure'' [[locum tenens]] and would return to his duties upon his release (which never happened). However, Sergius himself also was again in prison from [[November 30]], [[1926]] till [[March 27]], [[1927]]. 

Seeking to convince [[Soviet]] authorities to stop the campaign of terror and persecution against the Church, Sergius tried to look for ways of peaceful reconciliation with the government. On [[July 29]], [[1927]], he issued his famous ''Declaration'' where he professed absolute loyalty of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]] and to its government's interests.  The ''Declaration'', albeit well-intended, sparked an immediate controversy among the Russian churchmen, many of whom (including many notable and respected [[bishops]] in prisons and exile) broke [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with Sergius. Later, some of these bishops reconciled with Sergius, but many still remained in opposition to the "official Church" until the election of [[Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Alexius I|Alexius I]] in [[1945]]. 

Sergius also formed the ''Temporary Patriarchal Council'' (later called ''Synod'') which received recognition from [[Soviet]] government.  In [[1934]], Sergius assumed a more elevated title of "''His Beatitude'', [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Moscow]] and [[Kolomna]]" and in [[1936]], following a false report of [[Peter of Krutitsy|Metropolitan Peter]]'s death in prison (in fact, he was still alive until his execution in [[1937]]), Sergius assumed the position of ''Patriarchal Locum Tenens''. Despite his pledges that ROC will not interfere in secular affairs and will be loyal to the state, the arrests and executions of Orthodox clergy by [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] and later [[NKVD]], destruction of Orthodox cathedrals, churches, icons, seminaries and so on were common place throughout 1920s and 1930s. Before the beginning of the [[Great Patriotic War]], on the entire [[USSR]] territory, only 4 [[bishops]] remained who were not imprisoned or exiled.

Only after the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, [[Joseph Stalin]] finally started to scale down the campaign of militant [[atheism]], seeking moral and financial support of the Church in the war.  On [[September 4]], [[1943]], [[Stalin]] met with three chief hierarchs of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and promised some concessions to religion in exchange for their loyalty and assistance. Among the concessions were the permission to open the [[Moscow]] [[Theological]] Seminary and Academy, the release of imprisoned clerics, the return of many church property, including the famous [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]]. In return, the [[Soviet]] government has put the Church under minute control of its secret services.

However, the most important concession was the permission to gather the episcopal [[council]] and to elect a new [[Patriarch]]. On [[September 8]], [[1943]], at a formal meeting of bishops, Sergius was elected unopposed to the see of the [[Patriarch of Moscow]]. He was enthroned on [[September 12]] of the same year, already being advanced in age (76 years old) and with declining health. He died in Moscow eight months later, on [[May 15]], [[1944]].
