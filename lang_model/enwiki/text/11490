'''Andreas Scholl''' (born [[November 10]] [[1967]]) is a German [[countertenor]], a male classical singer in the [[alto]] vocal range. He specialises in [[Baroque music]]. His range is the same as that of the celebrated 18th century alto [[castrato]], [[Senesino]], for whom [[Handel]] wrote his greatest alto roles. ''Fanfare'' magazine says: "There are more excellent countertenors before the public today than ever before, but one stands out above all others, as [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] among tenors a century ago: Andreas Scholl". In 2005, Scholl was the first countertenor ever to be invited to sing solo at ''[[The Proms|The Last Night of the Proms]]'' in [[London]].

==Childhood==
Scholl was born on [[November 10]] [[1967]] in [[Eltville]], [[Germany]], and grew up in neighboring [[Kiedrich]]. All of his family members were singers. He was enrolled at the age of seven into the Kiedricher Chorbuben (Kiedrich Boys Choir) <U+2014> which was first documented in [[1333]] as "a schola of men assisting the priests on all Sundays, singing the [[Gregorian chant]]s." At age 13, Andreas Scholl sang the second boy (his sister sang first boy) in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Die Zauberfl<U+00F6>te]]'' at the Wiesbaden Staatstheater. That same year, he was one of 20,000 choristers from all over the world gathered in [[Rome]] for a festival where Scholl was chosen to sing [[Solo (music)|solo]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[January 4]] [[1981]] and met Pope [[John Paul II]]. Along with his fellow choristers, Andreas Scholl was an extra in the film ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', playing a young monk standing alongside [[Sean Connery]] in scenes shot at Kloster [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]], near Kiedrich.

==Musical education==
Scholl was 17 when his gifts were identified by the ''Chorbuben's'' voice coach from the [[Darmstadt Music Academy]], and he then sang for the tenor/countertenor [[Herbert Klein]], who advised him that there were only two places he should study: either in [[London]] or at the [[early music]] conservatoire in [[Basel]], the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]]. Since an uncle had introduced Scholl to the voices of [[Paul Esswood]] and [[James Bowman]], the leading European countertenors of the day, he took Bowman as his role model. Scholl then sent a tape to [[Ren<U+00E9> Jacobs]] asking whether he had talent, and Jacobs invited him to come and see him at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Scholl had no first degree and could not even read music, having always learned by heart as a chorister, and the conservatory only offered post-graduate courses. 

Scholl nevertheless sang a [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] song for the admissions board <U+2014> which included Jacobs <U+2014> and was offered a place on the strength of his exceptional voice. At the Schola, Andreas Scholl's teacher was Richard Levitt, and he studied with Jacobs beginning his second year. Violinist [[Chiara Banchini]] and soprano [[Emma Kirkby]] were major influences, as Scholl began to specialise in the music of the Baroque; he studied as well with soprano [[Evelyn Tubb]] and lutenist [[Anthony Rooley]]. In addition to the Diploma of Ancient Music, for which his external examiner was James Bowman, Andreas Scholl garnered prizes from the [[Council of Europe]] and the Foundation Claude Nicolas Ledoux, and awards from Switzerland's Association Migros and Ernst G<U+00F6>hner Foundation. 

Andreas Scholl now teaches interpretation in the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt, and is in much demand for master classes.

==Professonal debut==
In [[1993]], Scholl stood in for Ren<U+00E9> Jacobs at Jacobs' request at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Gr<U+00E9>vin in [[Paris]], where he caused a sensation. This ''[[St John Passion]]'' was broadcast on Good Friday to a radio audience which included [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]]. A little later, Christie met Scholl on a train. The 1994 recording of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with Les Arts Florissants resulted directly from this meeting.

==Recordings==
The bulk of Scholl's recording career has been with [[Harmonia Mundi]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]]. By 1998 his CDs dominated Harmonia Mundi's hit list at numbers one, three, four, five and ten, and they are still among Harmonia Mundi's best sellers. His discography amounts to more than sixty CDs, all but two being music of the European Baroque or Renaissance. Recordings in which he has collaborated, including all but one of his solo recordings, have won awards. His personal accolades include the Diapason d'Or, multiple Gramophone Awards, 10 de Repertoire, ffff Telerama and Choc du Mond de la Musique, the ECHO award and Prix de l'Union de la Presse Musicale Belge. In an extremely rare departure from its normally austere approach, ''Fanfare'' magazine described his recording of Dowland's ''A Musicall Banquet'' as 'perfect'. The recording of the ''St John Passion'' of J S [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] conducted by Philippe Herreweghe on which Andreas Scholl sings was nominated for a Cannes Classical Award in 2003. He was Germany's Kultur Radio Artist of the Year in 1998. He has revealed, to German audiences in particular, some little-known masterworks of the German Baroque composers and has thereby made a significant contribution to the modern rediscovery of the Baroque repertoire as a whole. His 2001 album of folksongs, ''Wayfaring Stranger'', was a personal project, well-received by the CD-buying public but not universally acclaimed by his fellow musicians, some of whom regarded it as an inappropriate departure.

==Collaborations==
Andreas Scholl has worked with most of the important Baroque specialists of the day including Chiara Banchini, William Christie, Christophe Coin, Michel Corboz, Paul Dyer, [[John Eliot Gardiner]], Reinhardt Goebel, Philippe Herreweghe, Christopher Hogwood, Ren<U+00E9> Jacobs, Konrad Jungh<U+00E4>nel, Robert King, [[Ton Koopman]], Paul McCreesh, Nicholas McGegan, [[Roger Norrington]], Christophe Rousset, Jos van Veldhoven, Dominique Veillard and Roland Wilson. His regular solo partners include cemballist Markus M<U+00E4>rkl and the virtuoso lutenist Edin Karamazov. Ensembles with whom he performs include the Netherlands Bach Choir, Cantus Coelln, the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], Musica Antiqua K<U+00F6>ln, the Berlin Akademie f<U+00FC>r Alte Musik, the Freiburg Barockorchester, the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]] and Accademia Bizantina.

The composer Marco Rosano has created a new [[Stabat Mater]] for Andreas Scholl; he sang the first complete performance of this work on {{Date|2008-02-22}} at the [[City Recital Hall]], Angel Place, accompanied by the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra under Paul Dyer.<ref>{{cite web

==Opera==
Scholl describes himself as a singer who does [[opera]]. His major roles have been those written for the 18th century [[alto]] [[castrato]] [[Senesino]]: Bertarido in [[Handel]]'s ''Rodelinda'' ([[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]], 1998, 1999, 2002) and the title role in Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' in the Royal Danish Opera production (2002, 2005). ''Rodelinda'' was a huge success and he 'stopped the show' (''Sunday Times''). According to James Bowman, who describes himself as an unqualified admirer, 'people went into a kind of trance' when he sang ''Dove Sei''. ''[[The Financial Times]]'' said of his ''Vivi tiranno'': '<U+2026> such intelligent virtuosity <U+2026> time stands still and you feel he is speaking to you.' In February 2002, ''[[Le Monde]]'' called him 'Le Roi Scholl' after his reprise of the role of King Bertarido in the Paris production of the [[Glyndebourne]] ''Rodelinda''.

==Popular music==
Scholl has always written songs as well as music for ballet and theatre and has his own professional sound studio in [[Basel]], Switzerland, where he now resides. His ''White as Lilies'', based on ideas of [[John Dowland]], is on the 1995 CD ''The Countertenors'' (with [[Dominique Visse]] and Pascal Bertin). It was a hit in Korea when used in a TV commercial and was later released there in an orchestrated version. In December 2003, he gave his first public performance in popular music, an eclectic programme of electronic and orchestral works which included his own compositions. Alongside Andreas Scholl was fellow Baroque countertenor, Roland Kunz, who specialises in setting Elizabethan English poems to his own electronic music. The two countertenors duetted in Scholl's and Kunz's songs, backed by Kunz's band ''die Unerl<U+00F6>sten'' and the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester [[Saarbr<U+00FC>cken]] under Rick Steng<U+00E5>rds.
