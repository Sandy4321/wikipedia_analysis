{{Taoism}}
'''Taoism''', or '''Daoism''', is a philosophical, ethical, and religious tradition of Chinese origin that emphasizes  living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized as ''Dao'']]). The term ''Tao'' means "way", "path" or "principle", and can also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes something that is both the source and the driving force behind everything that exists.

While Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the tenets of the [[School of Yin Yang]], the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', a compact and ambiguous book containing teachings attributed to [[Laozi]] ({{zh|c=<U+8001><U+5B50>| p=L<U+01CE>oz<U+01D0>| w=Lao Tzu}}), is widely considered its keystone work. Together with the [[Zhuangzi (book)|writings of Zhuangzi]], these two texts build the philosophical foundation of Taoism.

Taoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize [[wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Taoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries, and [[Daoshi|clerics of institutionalised Taoism]] ({{zh|c=<U+9053><U+58EB>|p=d<U+00E0>oshi}}) usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the customs and practices found in [[Chinese folk religion]] as these distinctions sometimes appear blurred. [[Chinese alchemy]] (especially [[neidan]]), [[Chinese astrology]], Chan (Zen) [[Zen|Buddhism]], several [[Neijia|martial arts]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], [[feng shui]], and many styles of [[qigong]] have been intertwined with Taoism throughout history. Beyond China, Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia.

After Laozi and Zhuangzi, the literature of Taoism grew steadily and was compiled in form of a canon<U+2014>the [[Daozang]]<U+2014>which was published at the behest of the [[Emperor of China|emperor]]. Throughout Chinese history, Taoism was several times nominated as a [[state religion]]. After the 17th century, however, it fell from favor.

Like other religious activity, Taoism was suppressed in the first decades of the [[People's Republic of China]] (and even persecuted during the [[Cultural Revolution]]). Today, it is one of [[Religion in China#Modern history|five religions recognized in the PRC]], and although it does not travel readily from its Asian roots, claims adherents in a number of societies.<ref>''The Ancient Chinese Super State of Primary Societies: Taoist Philosophy for the 21st Century'', You-Sheng Li, June 2010, p. 300</ref>  Taoism also has sizable communities in Taiwan and in Southeast Asia.

A Chinese philosopher defines Daoism as <U+201C>early forms comes from understanding and experience of the dao. Experience of the dao is an irreducible element of the formation and transformation of Chinese experience of the ultimate<U+201D>.<ref name="Routledge">{{cite book|last1=Meister|first1=edited by Chad|last2=Copan|first2=Paul|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of religion|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415435536|edition=1st paperback ed.}}</ref>

==Spelling and pronunciation==
{{Main|Daoism<U+2013>Taoism romanization issue}}
[[File:Dai Temple (1489).JPG|thumb|The Dai Temple at [[Mount Tai]], one of the holiest mountains in China]]
English-speakers continue to debate the preferred [[romanization]] of the words "Daoism" and "Taoism". The root [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word {{lang|zh|[[Wikt:<U+9053>|<U+9053>]]}} "way, path" is romanized ''[[tao]]'' in the older [[Wade<U+2013>Giles]] system and ''[[Tao|d<U+00E0>o]]'' in the modern [[Pinyin]] system. In [[linguist]]ic terminology, English ''Taoism''/''Daoism'' is formed from the Chinese [[loanword]] ''tao''/''dao'' {{lang|zh|[[Wikt:<U+9053>|<U+9053>]]}} "way; route; principle" and the native [[suffix]] ''-ism''. The debate over ''Taoism'' vs. ''Daoism'' involves [[sinology]], [[phoneme]]s, [[loanword]]s, and politics&nbsp;<U+2013> not to mention whether ''Taoism'' should be pronounced {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|t|a<U+028A>|.|<U+026A>|z|<U+0259>m}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|d|a<U+028A>|.|<U+026A>|z|<U+0259>m}}.

''Daoism'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|d|a<U+028A>|.|<U+026A>|z|<U+0259>m}}, but English speakers disagree whether ''Taoism'' should be {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|d|a<U+028A>|.|<U+026A>|z|<U+0259>m}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|t|a<U+028A>|.|<U+026A>|z|<U+0259>m}}. In theory, both Wade<U+2013>Giles ''tao'' and Pinyin ''dao'' are articulated identically, as are ''Taoism'' and ''Daoism''. An investment book titled ''The Tao Jones Averages'' (a pun on the [[Dow Jones Indexes]]) illustrates this {{IPA|/da<U+028A>/}} pronunciation's widespread familiarity.<ref>Goodspeed (1983).</ref> In speech, ''Tao'' and ''Taoism'' are often pronounced {{IPA|/<U+02C8>ta<U+028A>/}} and {{IPA|<U+02C8>ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, reading the Chinese unaspirated [[lenis]] ("weak") {{IPA|/t/}} as the English voiceless [[stop consonant]] {{IPA|/t/}}. [[Lexicography]] shows [[American and British English differences]] in pronouncing ''Taoism''. A study of major English dictionaries published in Great Britain and the United States found the most common ''Taoism'' [[glosses]] were {{IPA|/ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}} in British sources and {{IPA|/da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m, ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}} in American ones.<ref>Carr (1990, pp. 63<U+2013>65). Converting the various [[pronunciation respelling for English|pronunciation respelling systems]] into [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], British dictionaries (1933<U+2013>1989, Table 3) give 9 {{IPA|/ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m, da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, and 1 {{IPA|/da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}; American dictionaries (1948<U+2013>1987, Table 4) give 6 {{IPA|/da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m, ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m, da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, 2 {{IPA|/ta<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}, and 1 {{IPA|/da<U+028A>.<U+026A>z<U+0259>m/}}.</ref>

==Categorization==
There is debate over how, and whether, Taoism should be categorized. Traditionally, it is divided into two categories:{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
# Philosophical Taoism (''Daojia'', {{zh|c=<U+9053><U+5BB6>|p=d<U+00E0>oji<U+0101>}}; lit. "school or family of Dao") <U+2013> The [[philosophy]] based on the texts of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (or Daodejing, {{zh|c=<U+9053><U+5FB7><U+7D93>|p=d<U+00E0>od<U+00E9>j<U+012B>ng}}) and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' ({{zh|c=<U+838A><U+5B50>|p=zhu<U+0101>ngzi}}). These texts were linked together under the term of Daojia during the early [[Han Dynasty]], but notably not before.<ref>Kohn (2000), p. 44.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/ |title=Taoism |work=Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, [[Stanford University]] |author=Chad Hansen|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> It is unlikely that [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] was familiar with the text of the Daodejing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/ |title=Taoism |accessdate=2008-10-01 |work=Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, [[Stanford University]] |author=Chad Hansen}}</ref><ref name="Graham 1989 p. 170<U+2013>171">Graham (1989) p. 170<U+2013>171</ref> and Zhuangzi would not have identified himself as a Taoist as this classification did not arise until well after his death.<ref name="Graham 1989 p. 170<U+2013>171"/>
# Religious Taoism (''Daojiao'', {{zh|c=<U+9053><U+6559>|p=d<U+00E0>oji<U+00E0>o}}; lit. "teachings of Dao") <U+2013> A family of organized religious movements sharing concepts or terminology derived from Daojia;<ref>Robinet (2000), p. xxix</ref> the first of these is recognized as the [[Celestial Masters]] school.

However, the distinction between Daojia and Daojiao is supposedly rejected by the majority of Western and Japanese scholars.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 3</ref><ref>Kohn (2000), p. xi</ref> It is, among others, contested by [[hermeneutic]] (interpretive) difficulties in the categorization of the different Taoist schools, sects and movements.<ref>[[Victor H. Mair|Mair]] (2001) p. 174</ref> Taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single [[organized religion]] like the [[Abrahamic traditions]]; nor can it be studied as the originator or a variant of [[Chinese folk religion]], as although the two share some similar concepts, much of Chinese folk religion is outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 103">Robinet (1997), p. 103.</ref> Sinologists Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn agree that "Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations."<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 2</ref>

Chung-ying Cheng, a Chinese philosopher views Daoism as a religion that has been embedded into Chinese history and tradition. <U+201C>Whether Confucianism, Daoism, or later Chinese Buddhism, they all fall into this pattern of thinking and organizing and in this sense remain religious, even though individually and intellectually they also assume forms of philosophy and practical wisdom<U+201D>.<ref name="Routledge"/> Chung-ying Cheng also noted that through the Daoism view of heaven, their main approached of this idea mainly from <U+201C>observation and meditation, the teaching of the way (dao) can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature<U+201D>.<ref name="Routledge"/> In Chinese history, while all three religions from Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism stand their own independence views, yet they <U+201C>involved in a process of attempting to find harmonization and convergence among themselves, so that we can speak of a <U+2018>unity of three religious teaching<U+2019> (sanjiao heyi)<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0415435536}}</ref>

==Origins and development==
{{Main|History of Taoism}}
[[File:Baiyun.jpg|alt=|thumb|275px|White Cloud Monastery, [[Beijing]]]]
[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 63"/> Whether he actually existed is disputed;<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25">Robinet 1997, p. 25</ref><ref>Kirkland 2004, p. 62</ref> however, the work attributed to him <U+2013> the ''Tao Te Ching'' <U+2013> is dated to the late 4th century BC.<ref>Kirkland 2004, p. 61</ref>

Taoism draws its cosmological foundations from the [[School of Naturalists]] (in form of its main elements <U+2013> [[yin and yang]] and the [[Five Phases]]), which developed during the [[Warring States period]] (4th to 3rd centuries BC).<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 6">Robinet 1997, p. 6</ref>

Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:
#[[Taoism#Categorization|Philosophical Taoism]], i.e. the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''
#techniques for achieving ecstasy
#practices for achieving longevity or immortality
#exorcism.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"/>

Some elements of Taoism may be traced to [[prehistoric]] folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition.<ref>Demerath (2003), p. 149.</ref><ref>Hucker (1995), pp. 203<U+2013>04.</ref> In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the ''wu'' (connected to the "shamanism" of Southern China) and the ''fangshi'' (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36">Robinet 1997, p. 36</ref> Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to "...&nbsp;magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings" as well as exorcism; in the case of the ''wu'', "shamans" or "sorcerers" is often used as a translation.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"/> The ''fangshi'' were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists, and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.<ref>Robinet 1997, p. 39</ref>

The first organized form of Taoism, the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] (Celestial Masters') school (later known as [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] school), developed from the [[Five Pecks of Rice]] movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by [[Zhang Daoling]], who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.<ref>Robinet 1997, p. 54</ref> The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler [[Cao Cao]] in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return.<ref>Robinet 1997, p. 1</ref> Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 50.</ref>

Taoism, in form of the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing school]], gained official status in China again during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618<U+2013>907), whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 184.</ref> The Shangqing movement, however, had developed much earlier, in the 4th century, on the basis of a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi in the years between 364 to 370.<ref>Robinet 1997, p. 115</ref>

Between 397 and 402, [[Ge Chaofu]] compiled a series of scriptures which later served as the foundation of the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao school]],<ref>Robinet 1997, p. 150</ref> which unfolded its greatest influence during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960<U+2013>1279).<ref>Robinet 1997, p. xvi</ref> Several Song emperors, most notably [[Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong]], were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the ''Daozang.''<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 213.</ref>

In the 12th century, the [[Quanzhen School]] was founded in [[Shandong]]. It flourished during the 13th and 14th century and during the [[Yuan dynasty]] became the largest and most important Taoist school in Northern China. The school's most revered master, [[Qiu Chuji]], met with [[Genghis Khan]] in 1222 and was successful in influencing the Khan towards exerting more restraint during his brutal conquests. By the Khan's decree, the school also was exempt from taxation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vFBy3cvteTQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=quanzhen&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ei=z9-pT923NamRiQfIls3QAw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=quanzhen&f=false|title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters|author=Eskildsen, Stephen|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2004|page=17}}</ref>

Aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the [[Neo-Confucian]] school, which eventually became Imperial [[orthodoxy]] for state bureaucratic purposes under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368<U+2013>1644).<ref>Kohn (2000), p. XVII.</ref>

The [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644<U+2013>1912), however, much favored Confucian classics over Taoist works.

During the 18th century, the imperial library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.<ref>Schipper (1993), p. 19.</ref>  By the beginning of the 20th century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (for example, only one complete copy of the [[Daozang]] still remained, at the [[White Cloud Monastery]] in Beijing).<ref>Schipper (1993), p. 220.</ref>

Today, Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the People's Republic of China. The government regulates its activities through the [[Chinese Taoist Association]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf Human Rights Without Frontiers "Religious Freedom in China in 2006"]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}|30.6&nbsp;KB}} An address given to the Delegation EU-China of the European Parliament.</ref> Taoism is freely practiced in [[Religion in Taiwan|Taiwan]], where it claims millions of adherents.

==Ethics==

Taoism tends to emphasize various themes of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment from desires]], and most important of all, [[wu wei]].<ref>Chan (1963)</ref> However, the concepts of those keystone texts can not be equated with Taoism as a whole.<ref>Kirkland (2004), p. 3</ref>

===Tao and Te===
{{Main|Tao|De (Chinese)}}
''Tao'' ({{zh|c=<U+9053>|p=d<U+00E0>o}}) literally means "way", but can also be interpreted as road, channel, path, doctrine, or line.<ref>DeFrancis (1996) p. 113</ref> In Taoism, it is "the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course."<ref>Chan (1963) p. 136</ref> It has variously been denoted as the "flow of the universe",<ref>Cane (2002), p. 13.</ref> a "conceptually necessary [[ontological]] ground",<ref>A. Chan, in Kohn (2000), p. 20</ref> or a demonstration of nature.<ref name="autogenerated2">Martinson (1987), pp. 168<U+2013>169.</ref> The Tao also is something that individuals can find [[immanent]] in themselves.<ref>LaFargue (1994) p. 283.</ref>

The active expression of Tao is called ''Te'' (also spelled <U+2013> and pronounced <U+2013> ''De'', or even ''Teh''; often translated with ''Virtue'' or ''Power''; {{zh|c=<U+5FB7>|p=d<U+00E9>}}),<ref>Sharot (2001), pp. 77<U+2013>78, 88.</ref> in a sense that Te results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao.<ref>Maspero (1981), p. 32.</ref>

===Wu-wei===
{{Main|Wu wei}}
The ambiguous term ''wu-wei'' ({{zh|s=<U+65E0><U+4E3A>|t=<U+7121><U+7232>|p=w<U+00FA> w<U+00E9>i}}) constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism.{{sfn|Van Voorst |2005 |p=170}} ''Wei'' refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while ''wu'' carries the meaning of "there is no ..." or "lacking, without". Common translations are "nonaction", "effortless action" or "action without intent".{{sfn|Van Voorst |2005 |p=170}} The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression "wei wu wei": "action without action".<ref>Kirkland (2004), p. 60.</ref>

In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature.<ref>Oldmeadow (2007), p. 109.</ref> Taoist philosophy proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world, they disrupt that harmony. Taoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe.<ref name="autogenerated4">Faching & deChant (2001), p. 35.</ref> Thus, a potentially harmful interference must be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly.<ref>A source book in Chinese philosophy, Wing-tsit Chan, p137, p</ref><ref>Living in the Tao: The Effortless Path of Self-Discovery, Mantak Chia</ref> "By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction."{{sfn|Van Voorst |2005 |p=170}}

===Naturalness===
{{Main|Ziran}} 
Naturalness ({{zh|c=<U+81EA><U+7136>|p=z<U+00EC>r<U+00E1>n|w=tzu-jan}}; lit. "self-such") is regarded as a central value in Taoism.{{sfn|Fowler|2005 |p=122}} It describes the "primordial state" of all things{{sfn|Slingerland|2003|p=97}} as well as a basic character of the Tao,{{sfn|Girardot|1988 |p=56}} and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity.{{sfn|Fowler|2005 |p=121}}{{sfn|Girardot|1988 |p=56}} To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao;{{sfn|Girardot|1988 |p=56}} this involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire, and appreciating simplicity.{{sfn|Fowler|2005 |p=122}}

An often cited metaphor for naturalness is ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' ({{zh|s= [[Wikt:<U+6734>|<U+6734>]]|t=[[Wikt:<U+6A38>|<U+6A38>]]|p=p<U+01D4>, p<U+00FA>|w=p'u}}; lit. "uncut wood"), the "uncarved block", which represents the "original nature... prior to the imprint of culture" of an individual.{{sfn|Kraemer|1986|p=286}} It is usually referred to as a state one ''returns'' to.{{sfn|Girardot|1988 |p=70}}

===Three Treasures===
[[File:Taopriest.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|Taoist Priest in [[Macau]], February 2006]]
{{Main|Three Treasures (Taoism)}} 
{{See also|Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)}}
The Taoist ''Three Treasures'' or ''Three Jewels'' ({{zh|t=<U+4E09><U+5BF6>|s=<U+4E09><U+5B9D>|p=s<U+0101>nb<U+01CE>o}}) comprise the basic virtues of ''ci'' ({{zh|c=<U+6148>|p=c<U+00ED>}}, usually translated as ''compassion''), ''jian'' ({{zh|c=<U+4FED>|p=ji<U+01CE>n}}, usually translated as ''moderation''), and ''bugan wei tianxia xian'' ({{zh|c=<U+4E0D><U+6562><U+4E3A><U+5929><U+4E0B><U+5148> |p=b<U+00F9>g<U+01CE>n w<U+00E9>i ti<U+0101>nxi<U+00E0> xi<U+0101>n|lit=}}, literally "not daring to act as first under the heavens", but usually translated as ''humility'').

As the "practical, political side" of Taoist philosophy, [[Arthur Waley]] translated them as "abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment", "absolute simplicity of living", and "refusal to assert active authority".<ref>Waley (1958), p. 225.</ref>

The Three Treasures can also refer to [[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]], [[traditional Chinese medicine#Qi|qi]] and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] ({{zh|t=<U+7CBE><U+6C23><U+795E>|p=j<U+012B>ng-q<U+00EC>-sh<U+00E9>n}}; jing is usually translated with "essence" and shen with "spirit"). These terms are elements of the [[traditional Chinese medicine#Model of the body|traditional Chinese concept of the human body]], which shares its cosmological foundation - [[School of Yin Yang|Yinyangism]] - with Taoism. Within this framework, they play an important role in [[neidan]] ("Taoist yoga").<ref name=":3">Blofeld, John. ''Taoism''. Shambhala, 2000.</ref>

==Cosmology==
{{Further|:School of Yin Yang|Qi|Taoism and death}}

Taoist cosmology is based on the [[School of Yin Yang]]<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 6"/> which was headed by [[Zou Yan]] (305 BC <U+2013> 240 BC). The school's tenets harmonized the concepts of the [[Wu Xing]] (Five Phases) and [[yin and yang]]. In this spirit, the universe is seen as being in a constant process of re-creating itself, as everything that exists is a mere aspect of [[qi]], which, "condensed, becomes life; diluted, it is indefinite potential".<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 7</ref> Qi is in a perpetual transformation between its condensed and diluted state.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 8">Robinet (1997), p. 8</ref> These two different states of qi, on the other hand, are embodiments of the abstract entities of yin and yang,<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 8"/> two complementary extremes that constantly play against and with each other and cannot exist without the other.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 9</ref>

Human beings are seen as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the universe,<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 103"/> and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the [[zang-fu]] organs.<ref>Kohn (2000), p. 825.</ref> As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.<ref>Occhiogrosso (2004), p. 171.</ref>

==Physical exercises==
{{Main|Neidan}}
{{See also|Taoist alchemy|Taoist sexual practices|Neijia}}
A recurrent and important element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally to the point of immortality.<ref>Kohn (2000), p. 672.</ref><ref>Robinet (1993) pp. 228 & 103.</ref> Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as [[Xian (Taoism)|xian]].

A characteristic method aiming for longevity is [[Taoist alchemy]]. Already in very early Taoist scriptures - like the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' - alchemical formulas for achieving immortality were outlined.<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 70<U+2013>71.</ref><ref>Robinet (1997), p. 73.</ref>

A number of martial arts traditions, particularly the ones falling under the category of [[Neijia]] (like [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai Chi Ch'uan]], [[Bagua Zhang]] and [[Xingyiquan|Xing Yi Quan]]) embody Taoist principles to a significant extent, and some practitioners consider their art a means of practicing Taoism.<ref>Silvers (2005), pp. 135<U+2013>137</ref>

==Pantheon==
[[File:Statue of a taoist deity, Taiwan.jpg|thumb|150px|Statue of Taoist deity in Taiwan]]
{{Further|:Category:Chinese deities}}
{{see also|Li Hong (Taoist eschatology)}}
Taoist beliefs include teachings based on various sources. Therefore, different branches of Taoism often have differing beliefs, especially concerning deities and the proper composition of the pantheon.<ref>Segal (2006), p. 50.</ref>  Nevertheless, there are certain core beliefs that nearly all the sects share.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 1.</ref> Traditional conceptions of Tao should not be confused with the Western concepts of [[theism]], however. Being one with the Tao does not necessarily indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu sense.<ref name="autogenerated2"/><ref name="autogenerated4"/>

Popular Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the official head [[deity]]. Intellectual ("elite") Taoists, such as the [[Way of the Celestial Master|Celestial Masters]] sect, usually present [[Laozi]] (''Laojun'', "Lord Lao") and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon of deities.<ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 63">Robinet (1997), p. 63.</ref><ref>Maspero (1981), p. 41.</ref> The pantheon tends to mirror the bureaucracy of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]]; deities also may be promoted or demoted for their actions.<ref>Maspero (1981), p. 92.</ref>

While a number of immortals or other mysterious figures appear in the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', and to a lesser extent in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', these have generally not become the objects of worship.

==Texts==

===Tao Te Ching===
[[File:LaoGod.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Laozi]] depicted as a Taoist teacher]]
{{Main|Tao Te Ching}}
The ''Tao Te Ching'' or ''Daodejing'' is widely considered the most influential Taoist text.<ref>Miller (2003), p. ix</ref> According to legend, it was written by [[Laozi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism.html |title=Patheos Library <U+2013> Taoism |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> and often the book is simply referred to as the "Laozi." However, authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate,<ref>Eliade (1984), p. 26</ref> and will probably never be known with certainty.<ref>Watts (1975), p. xxiii</ref> The earliest texts of the ''Tao Te Ching'' that have been excavated (written on [[Guodian Chu Slips|bamboo tablets]]) date back to the late 4th century BC.<ref name=stanford>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laozi/|title=Laozi|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] by [[Stanford University]]|quote=The discovery of two ''Laozi'' silk manuscripts at Mawangdui, near Changsha, Hunan province in 1973 marks an important milestone in modern ''Laozi'' research. The manuscripts, identified simply as <U+201C>A<U+201D> (jia) and <U+201C>B<U+201D> (yi), were found in a tomb that was sealed in 168 B.C. The texts themselves can be dated earlier, the <U+201C>A<U+201D> manuscript being the older of the two, copied in all likelihood before 195 B.C.<p>Until recently, the Mawangdui manuscripts have held the pride of place as the oldest extant manuscripts of the ''Laozi''. In late 1993, the excavation of a tomb (identified as M1) in Guodian, Jingmen city, Hubei province, has yielded among other things some 800 bamboo slips, of which 730 are inscribed, containing over 13,000 Chinese characters. Some of these, amounting to about 2,000 characters, match the ''Laozi''. The tomb...is dated around 300 B.C.}}</ref> Throughout the history of religious Taoism, the ''Tao Te Ching'' has been used as a ritual text.<ref>Kohn & LaFargue (1998), p. 158.</ref>

The famous opening lines of the ''Tao Te Ching'' are: <blockquote><U+9053><U+53EF><U+9053><U+975E><U+5E38><U+9053> ({{zh|p=d<U+00E0>o k<U+0115> d<U+00E0>o f<U+0113>i ch<U+00E1>ng d<U+00E0>o}})<br/>

"The name that can be named is not the eternal name."<ref name="Laozi">{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/tao-te-ching.htm|title=Tao Te Ching, 1. chapter, translated by Livia Kohn (1993)|author=Laozi|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>
There is significant, at times acrimonious debate regarding which English translation of the Tao Te Ching is preferable, and which particular translation methodology is best.<ref>Kohn & LaFargue (1998), pp. 185<U+2013>86.</ref> The ''Tao Te Ching'' is not thematically ordered. However, the main themes of the text are repeatedly expressed using variant formulations, often with only a slight difference.<ref>Kim (2003), p. 13</ref>

The leading themes revolve around the nature of Tao and how to attain it. Tao is said to be ineffable, and accomplishing great things through small means.<ref name="autogenerated3">Van Voorst (2005), p. 165</ref> Ancient commentaries on the ''Tao Te Ching'' are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the ''Heshang Gong'' commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE.<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 73.</ref> Other important commentaries include the one from [[Wang Bi]] and the [[Xiang'er]].<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 74<U+2013>77.</ref>

===Zhuangzi===
{{Main|Zhuangzi (book)}}
The Taoist book ''Zhuangzi'' ({{zh|t=<U+838A><U+5B50>|s=<U+5E84><U+5B50>|p=Zhu<U+0101>ngz<U+01D0>}}), named after its purported [[author]] [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], is a composite of writings from various sources, and is considered one of the most important texts in Taoism. The commentator [[Guo Xiang]] (circa 300 AD) helped established the text as an important source for Taoist thought. The traditional view is that Zhuangzi himself wrote the first seven [[Chapter (books)|chapter]]s (the "inner chapters") and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the "outer" and "miscellaneous" chapters). The work uses anecdotes, parables and dialogues to express one of its main themes, that is aligning oneself to the laws of the natural world and "the way" of the elements.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://taoism.about.com/od/chuangtz1/p/Zhuangzi.htm | title=Zhuangzi | publisher=About.com | accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/116716/Zhuangzi | title=Zhuangzi | publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

===Daozang===
{{Main|Daozang}}
The Daozang ({{lang|zh|<U+9053><U+85CF>}}, ''Treasury of Tao'') is also referred to as the Taoist canon. It was originally compiled during the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties. The version surviving today was published during the [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 1.</ref><ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 30.</ref> The Ming ''Daozang'' includes almost 1500 [[sacred text|texts]].<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 36.</ref> Following the example of the Buddhist [[Tripi<U+1E6D>aka]], it is divided into three ''dong'' ({{lang|zh|<U+6D1E>}}, "caves", "grottoes"). They are arranged from "highest" to "lowest":<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 15.</ref><ref>Litte (2000), p. 46</ref>

# The ''[[Reality|Zhen]]'' ("real" or "truth" {{lang|zh|<U+771E>}}) grotto. Includes the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] texts.
# The ''Xuan'' ("mystery" {{lang|zh|<U+7384>}}) grotto. Includes the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] scriptures.
# The ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]]'' ("divine" {{lang|zh|<U+795E>}}) grotto. Includes texts predating the Maoshan <U+FF08>{{lang|zh|<U+8305><U+5C71>}}<U+FF09> revelations.

[[Daoshi]] generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose, or inherit, texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student.<ref>Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 44.</ref>

The Shangqing school has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 132.</ref>

===Other texts===
{{see also|Mozi}}
While the Tao Te Ching is most famous, there are many other important texts in traditional Taoism including [[Mohism]]. ''[[Treatise On the Response of the Tao|Taishang Ganying Pian]]'' ("Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution") discusses sin and [[ethic]]s, and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/chin/hbcanondaw-u.html |title=Jordan: The Taoist Canon |publisher=Weber.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

==Symbols and images==
[[File:Dragon on Mengjia Longshan Temple.jpg|thumb|right|A Chinese dragon at the [[Mengjia Longshan Temple]] in [[Taipei]]]]
The ''[[taijitu]]'' ({{zh|t=<U+592A><U+6975><U+5716>| s=<U+592A><U+6781><U+56FE> |p=t<U+00E0>ij<U+00ED>t<U+00FA>}}; commonly known as the "yin and yang symbol")  as well as the [[Ba Gua]] <U+516B><U+5366> ("Eight Trigrams") are associated with Taoist symbolism.<ref>Little (2000), pp. 131<U+2013>139</ref> The taijitu is not an exclusive symbol of Taoism, however. While almost all Taoist organizations make use of it, one could actually also call it Confucian, Neo-Confucian or pan-Chinese. One is likely to see this symbol as decorations on Taoist organization flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. According to Song Dynasty sources, it originated around the 10th century.<ref name="Little 2000, p. 131">Little (2000), p. 131</ref> Previously, yin and yang were symbolized by a tiger and dragon.<ref name="Little 2000, p. 131"/>

Taoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. They typically feature mystical writing or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead, to bring good fortune, increase life span, etc.<ref>Kohn (2004), p. 116.</ref> Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.<ref>Kohn (2004), p. 119</ref>

A zigzag with seven stars is sometimes displayed, representing the [[Big Dipper]] (or the Bushel, the Chinese equivalent). In the [[Shang Dynasty]] the Big Dipper was considered a deity, while during the [[Han Dynasty]], it was considered a ''qi'' path of the circumpolar god, ''Taiyi''.<ref>Little (2000), p. 128</ref>

Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature [[Chinese dragon]]s and [[fenghuang|phoenix]] made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix being yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master.<ref>Schipper (1993), p. 21.</ref> In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture has no universal features that distinguish it from other structures.<ref>Little (2000), p. 74</ref>

==Adherents==
[[File:Taoistjf.JPG|thumb|A century-old Taoist temple, a landmark built by the Chinese community in [[5th Avenue LRT Station]], [[Caloocan]], [[Metro Manila|Manila]], [[Philippines]].]]
The number of Taoists is difficult to estimate, due to a variety of factors including defining Taoism. The number of people practicing [[Chinese folk religion]] is estimated at just under four hundred million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html |title=Major Religions of the World Ranked by Number of Adherents |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Most Chinese people and many others have been influenced in some way by Taoist tradition. Estimates for the number of Taoists worldwide range from twenty million and possibly to as many as 400 million in China alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/taoism/index.htm |title=Taoism |publisher=Religionfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_624.html |title=Religious adherent statistics |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref><ref>[http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=468&Itemid=206 How Now Tao?]. Asia Sentinel (2010-10-18). Retrieved on 2010-10-26.</ref>

Recently, there have been some efforts to revive the practice of Taoist religion. In 1956, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]] was formed, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao, but re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the Association are at Baiyun guan, or [[White Cloud Temple]], of the Longmen branch of Quanzhen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html |title=Patheos Library <U+2013> Taoism: Modern Age |publisher=Patheos.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>

Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, most of them belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen school. For these two schools, [[ordination]] has been officially allowed again. However, "the Chinese government prefers the celibate model of ... Quanzhen clergy", while "Zhengyi clergy are often married, and often reside at home."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html?b=1 |title=Patheos Library <U+2013> Taoism: Modern Age |publisher=Patheos.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>

Geographically, Taoism flourishes best in regions populated by Chinese people: [[mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and various [[Chinese diaspora]] communities. Taoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of [[Taoism in Korea|Korea]], [[Taoism in Japan|Japan]], and [[Taoism in Vietnam|Vietnam]]. Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non-Chinese following, except in Korea and Vietnam, until modern times. In [[Taiwan]] 7.5 million people (33% of the population) identify themselves as Taoists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71337.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006: China (includes Taiwan only) |publisher=State.gov |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> In [[Singapore]], 8.5% of the population identify themselves as Taoist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/singapore/demographics_profile.html |title=Singapore Demographics Profile 2008 |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> There are also small numbers of Taoists in the Western world.

==Rituals==
[[File:Tien hau charm.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|upright|Taoist charm from [[Matsu (goddess)|Tien Hau]] Temple in San Francisco]]
At certain dates, food may be set out as a [[sacrifice]] to the spirits of the deceased or the gods, such as during the [[Qingming Festival]]. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of [[Joss paper]], or [[Hell Bank Notes]], on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear<U+2014>not as a mere image, but as the actual item<U+2014>in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a [[vegan]] diet or full fast may be observed.

Also on particular holidays, street parades take place. These are lively affairs which invariably involve firecrackers and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include [[lion dance]]s and [[dragon dance]]s; human-occupied puppets (often of the "[[Seventh Lord]]" and "[[Eighth Lord]]"); ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' ({{lang|zh|<U+7AE5><U+4E69>}} "spirit-medium; shaman") who cut their skin with knives; ''Bajiajiang'', which are [[Kungfu]]-practicing honor guards in demonic makeup; and [[palanquin]]s carrying god-images. The various participants are not considered performers, but rather possessed by the gods and spirits in question.<ref>Schipper (1993), p. 28<U+2013>29.</ref>

[[Fortune-telling]]<U+2014>including [[astrology]], [[I Ching]], and other forms of [[divination]]<U+2014>has long been considered a traditional Taoist pursuit. [[Mediumship]] is also widely encountered in some sects. There is an academic and social distinction between martial forms of mediumship (such as ''tongji'') and the spirit-writing that is typically practiced through [[fuji (planchette writing)|planchette writing]].<ref>Silvers (2005), p. 129<U+2013>132.</ref>

==Art and poetry==
[[File:Muqi-persimmons.jpg|thumb|[[Six Persimmons]], a Taoist-influenced 13th-century Chinese painting by the monk, [[Mu Qi]].|199x199px]]
Throughout Chinese history there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoist thought. Notable painters influenced by Taosim include [[Wu Wei (painter)|Wu Wei]], [[Huang Gongwang]], [[Mi Fu]], [[Muqi Fachang]], [[Shitao]], [[Ni Zan]], T'ang Mi, and Wang Tseng-tsu.<ref name=":6">Chang, Chung-yuan. ''Creativity and Taoism: A Study of Chinese Philosophy, Art and Poetry''. Singing Dragon, 2011</ref>  Taoist arts represents the diverse regions, dialects, and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy, however scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Augustin|first1=Birgitta|title=Daoism and Daoist Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/daoi/hd_daoi.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art,}}</ref>

==Political aspects==
Unlike Confucianism, Taoism favors philosophical [[individual anarchism|anarchism]], [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and [[laissez-faire]]-government.<ref name=sep>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/ Taoism], Hansen, Chad,  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N.

[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|''[[Confucianism]], Taoism, and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song Dynasty]].]]
Many scholars believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to [[Confucianism]].<ref>Fisher (1997). p. 167.</ref> The philosophical terms Tao and De are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism,<ref>Markham & Ruparell (2001). p. 254.</ref> and [[Laozi]] is traditionally held to have been a teacher of Confucius.<ref>Hansen (2000). pp. 202, 210.</ref> [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] explicitly criticized Confucianist and [[Mohist]] tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucianist emphasis on [[Li (Confucian)|rituals]], [[Confucianism#Relationships|hierarchical social order]], and conventional morality, and favors ''[[Taoism#Naturalness|naturalness]]'', spontaneity, and individualism instead.<ref>Maspero (1981). p. 39.</ref>

The entry of [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] into China was marked by significant interaction and [[syncretism]] with Taoism.<ref>Maspero (1981). p. 46.</ref> Originally seen as a kind of "foreign Taoism", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.<ref>Prebish (1975). p. 192.</ref> Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism, like [[Sengzhao]] and [[Tao Sheng]], knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts.<ref>Dumoulin et al. (2005), pp.70&74</ref>

Taoism especially shaped the development of [[Chinese Chan|Chan (Zen)]] Buddhism,<ref>Mollier (2008).</ref> introducing elements like the concept of ''naturalness'', distrust of scripture and text, and emphasis on embracing "this life" and living in the "every-moment".<ref>Dumoulin et al. (2005), pp. 68, 70<U+2013>73, 167<U+2013>168.</ref>

Taoism on the other hand also incorporated Buddhist elements during the [[Tang period]], such as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in tripartite organisation.

Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another.<ref>Markham & Ruparell (2001). pp. 248<U+2013>249.</ref> For example, Wang Bi, one of the most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and [[Yijing]]), was a Confucian.<ref>Schipper (1993), p. 192.</ref> The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a [[humanism|humanist]] philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously.<ref name="window">[http://www.asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html Windows on Asia]{{dead link|date=May 2011}} Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University.</ref> This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.<ref>Moore (1967). pp. 133, 147.</ref>

Some authors have dealt with [[Comparative religion|comparative studies]] between Taoism and [[Christianity]]. This has been of interest for students of [[history of religion]] such as [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot|J.J.M. de Groot]],<ref>Raphael Jehudah Zwi Werblowsky (2002). ''The Beaten Track of Science: The Life and Work of J.J.M. de Groot''. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 25</ref> among others.
The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] has been done by several authors such as Martin Aronson,<ref>Aronson, Martin (2002). ''[http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=Pf1D3KH_5FUC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Jesus and Lao Tzu: The Parallel Sayings]''. Ulysses Press. ISBN 1569753199, 9781569753194</ref> and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have pararells that should not to be ignored.<ref>Toropov, Brandon; & Hansen, Chadwick (2002). ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism''. Chapter 15: ''The Tao and the Judeo-Christian Tradition.'' pp. 181-169. ISBN 9781440695735</ref> In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto <ref>Yamamoto, J. Isamu (1998). ''Buddhism, Taoism, and Other Far Eastern Religions'', Zondervan. p. 69-70</ref> the main difference is that Christianity preaches a [[personal God]] while Theist Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including [[Lin Yutang]],<ref>Ruokanen, Miikka; Zhanzhu Huang, Paulos (2010). ''Christianity and Chinese Culture''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. p. 137</ref> have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.<ref>Zhiming, Yuan  (2010). ''Lao Tzu and the Bible.'' AuthorHous.
