==Early life and education==

Judge Benson is a [[Utah]] native and current resident.  He was born, along with his identical twin brother, Lee Benson, on August 25, 1948 in Sandy, Utah.  After graduating from Jordan High School, Mr. Benson attended [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]], where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1973, majoring in Physical Education with a minor in Political Science.  That same year, Mr. Benson became a member of the charter class at the J. Reuben Clark Law School at BYU.  While in law school, he served as the editor for the BYU Law Review.  Mr. Benson went on to receive his Juris Doctorate in the spring of 1976.<ref name=DOJ01>The United States Attorney's Office District of Utah, [http://www.justice.gov/usao/ut/history.html#benson "U.S. Attorney's (''sic'') for the District of Utah"], bio/story of appointment. Accessed September 20, 2010.</ref>

In addition to his legal studies, Judge Benson played professionally in the [[American Soccer League]] which has since been disbanded.  He was a member of Utah<U+2019>s team, [[Utah Golden Spikers|The Golden Spikers]].  With soccer as a passion and an affinity for teaching, Judge Benson started and coached the first soccer team at Hillcrest High School in Midvale, Utah.

==Legal career==

Upon graduation from BYU, Mr. Benson accepted a position with a [[Salt Lake City]] firm then known as Parr, Brown where he stayed less than one year.  He was then offered and accepted a position as a litigator with the firm Snow, Christensen and Martineau, where he remained until 1984.<ref name=DOJ01/>

During his eight year tenure at Snow, Christensen, Judge Benson took a two-year leave of absence to accept a position with the construction company [[Parsons Corporation|Ralph M. Parsons Company]] based in Pasadena, California.  With Ralph M. Parsons, he lived in a developing [[Saudi Arabia]]n city known today as [[Yanbu]].  His duties as legal counsel for Parsons included reviewing contracts as well as handling lawsuits that arose with general contractors and employees.  Legally, this was a complex assignment given the fact that there was no official court system and the country generally followed [[Sharia]] Law.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

From 1984 through 1989, Judge Benson served in various U.S. government posts in [[Washington, D.C]], included the following:<ref name=DOJ01/>
*	Counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution from 1984-1986<ref name=DOJ01/>  <U+2013> Notable issues that arose during his employment included The Balanced Budget Amendment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*	Chief of Staff to Senator Orrin Hatch from 1986-1988<ref name=DOJ01/>
*	Counsel to the [[Iran-Contra]] Congressional Investigating Committee<ref name=DOJ01/> 1987, where he helped write the minority report with [[Dick Cheney]].
*	Associate Deputy Attorney General to Deputy Attorney General Harold G. Christensen; Christensen was his former senior partner at Snow, Christensen<ref name=DOJ01/>

In 1989, Judge Benson was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah.  He was recommended to the post by his former boss, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] after the then-U.S. attorney [[Brent Ward]] stepped down. (The U.S. Attorney<U+2019>s Office of Utah has compiled historical information on those who have served in this position.  Full Interview with Judge Benson regarding his tenure as U.S. Attorney).  Mr. Benson<U+2019>s recommendation was further supported by Senator [[Jake Garn]] and by U.S. Attorney General [[Richard Thornburgh]].  He was initially sworn in under an interim appointment on March 7, 1989.  He received a presidential nomination from President [[George H.W. Bush]] and confirmation by the U.S. Senate before being officially sworn in on August 8, 1989.  The Senate confirmation was considered uneventful and non-contentious.  Judge Benson held this post until 1991.<ref name=DOJ01/>

Benson also holds adjunct law school professorships at Brigham Young and the [[University of Utah]] law schools, and teaches courses on criminal trial practice and evidence at the respective schools.<ref name=DOJ01/>

==Judicial career==

In May 1991, Judge Benson was nominated for a federal judgeship to the United States District Court by George H.W. Bush.  This seat was new for Utah, created by Congress in 1990, along with 84 others throughout the country.  Judge Benson went on to be confirmed by the Senate and began serving on September 16, 1991.  He held the position of Chief Judge of the District Court from 1999 to 2007.<ref name=DOJ01/>

Through his appointment in 2004 to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] in Washington, D.C., Judge Benson travels to the nation<U+2019>s capital every 10 weeks to participate in court sessions. He will serve in this capacity until 2011 when his seven-year term will expire.<ref name=DOJ01/>

[[Mike Lee]], Republican U.S. Senate candidate in 2010 in Utah, served as a law clerk to Judge Benson in 1997.<ref>[http://www.mikelee2010.com/about-mike About Mike], Mike Lee bio, Mike Lee U.S. Senate website. Accessed October 20, 2010.</ref>

==Controversial decisions==

In 2011, Judge Benson sentenced eco-activist [[Tim DeChristopher]] to two years in prison for disrupting an oil auction in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|first=Suzanne |last=Goldenberg |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/27/tim-dechristopher-jailed-two-years |title=US eco-activist jailed for two years |publisher=The Guardian |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> Benson had barred DeChristopher's defense team from explaining to the jury why he disrupted the auction. Critics have accused Judge Benson for doling a harsh sentence to DeChristopher.  [[Peter Yarrow]], the folk singer, and member of Peter, Paul, and Mary, wrote in an editorial for the Los Angeles Times, that DeChristopher's actions were comparable to leaders of the civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yarrow |first=Peter |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-yarrow-oil-leases-20110726,0,7950599.story |title=Tim DeChristopher's brave act of civil disobedience |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> 

{{quotation |"Tim is a hero to me," wrote Yarrow. "Throughout American history, acts of civil disobedience have led to change. Think about the Underground Railroad that helped escaped slaves to freedom, or about the courageous actions of people like Rosa Parks, who refused to stay in the back of the bus simply because of their skin color. Without this kind of defiance of unjust laws, our country would likely still be denying people of colour basic freedoms." }}

==Selected rulings==

'''Impact Energy Resources, LLC, ''et al.'' vs. [[Ken Salazar]], ''et al.'': Case No. 2:09-cv-435 and 2:09-cv-440.'''
This lawsuit was filed by three energy companies along with the Utah counties of Carbon, Uintah and Duchene against Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and related federal authorities.  The case involved 77 gas and oil drilling leases that were cancelled by Secretary Salazar in February 2009.  The plaintiffs sought to overturn the action by Secretary Salazar.  Judge Benson ruled in favor of Salazar because the lawsuit was not filed within the statute of limitations mandating the filing of any challenge within 90 days of the Secretary<U+2019>s decision.  He did, however, acknowledge that, <U+201C>In this case, the secretary exceeded his statutory authority by withdrawing leases after determining which parcels were to be leased and after holding a competitive lease sale.<U+201D> Also in his ruling Judge Benson stated, <U+201C>The plain language of the Mineral Leasing Act mandates the Secretary of Interior to accept bids and issues leases as part of the competitive leasing process for oil and gas leases.  Ultimately though, the plaintiff<U+2019>s claims are time barred.<U+201D><ref>Liesek, Geoff, and Mary Bernard. "Deseret News." September 2, 2010.

'''The United States of America vs. [[Tim DeChristopher]]:  Case No. 2:09-CR-183.'''
Tim DeChristopher was indicted in U.S. Federal District Court for bidding on Federal energy leases without intent to pay for them.  He claimed that he did so as an act of civil disobedience.<ref name=DN01>Morgan, Emiley, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700016756/Tim-DeChristopher-not-target-of-discrimination-judge-rules.html "Tim DeChristopher not target of discrimination, judge rules"], ''Deseret News'', March 16, 2010 12:00 a.m. MDT. Accessed October 20, 2010.</ref> In March, 2011, after a four-day jury trial, DeChristopher was convicted and "faces up to five years on each of the two counts <U+2014> disrupting a federal auction and making false statements on federal forms to enter the auction <U+2014> and up to $750,000 in total fines. Sentencing was set for June 23. ... Judge ... Benson strictly limited how much the defense could say about federal energy policies and climate change, which Mr. DeChristopher has said in numerous interviews were his primary motivations in going to the auction."<ref>Johnson, Kirk, [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/us/04leases.html?hp "Federal Jury in Utah Convicts Environmentalist"], ''The New York Times'', March 3, 2011.

'''The Salt Lake Tribune, ''et al.'' vs. [[Elaine Chao]], The U.S. Secretary of Labor, ''et al.'':  Case No. 2:07-cv-739.'''
This suit was commenced by several Utah media organizations seeking access to documents relating to the [[Crandall Canyon mine]] collapse that killed six miners and three rescue workers in Utah.   In dismissing the complaint, Judge Benson noted that, "It is not this court's or any other court's role to make law, only to interpret it."  Plaintiffs contended that public access to the investigation would help insure accuracy.  Judge Benson stated in his ruling, "The court finds many of these policy arguments persuasive," Benson wrote, but said it was not his place to make such decisions. "While it may be true that requiring all government investigations to be open would result in greater accountability and more accurate information, if such a requirement is to be imposed, it must come from a statute that is debated and passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.<U+201D><ref>Benson, Dee. uscourts.gov.

'''Summum vs. Duchesne City, ''et al.'': Case No. 2:03-cv-1049.'''   [[Summum]] is a religious group that sued the City of Pleasant Grove, Utah for the right to install a monolith containing their core beliefs next to an existing monolith of the Ten Commandments.  The group contended that their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] Rights were violated by the existence of the Ten Commandments monument.  Judge Benson ruled against the group, holding their right to free speech had not been violated.   The case was then appealed and heard by the Tenth Circuit Court who overturned Judge Benson<U+2019>s previous decision.  Rather than allow Summum to place their monolith, the City of Pleasant Grove removed the Ten Commandments monolith.  The case was then accepted and heard by The Supreme Court of the United States.  The Court issued a unanimous ruling (No. 07-665) in favor of the city of Pleasant Grove No. 07<U+2013>665 on February 25, 2009.  The court found that monuments that were privately funded were considered government speech and therefore not in violation of any one group<U+2019>s First Amendment rights.   In his opinion, Justice [[Samuel Alito]] analogized that, if the law accorded with Summum and its "civil liberties" supporters, New York City would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.

'''Caldera vs. Microsoft: Case No. 2:96-cv-645 B.'''   This case mirrored the much larger anti-trust case against [[Microsoft]] in Washington D.C.  Utah based Caldera Corporation brought the anti-trust suit against Microsoft for the anti-competitive practice of encoding Microsoft Windows 95 to only run properly if MS-DOS, a Microsoft product, was being used.  Caldera<U+2019>s claim was that this practice unfairly inhibited the competition by eliminating DR-DOS as an alternative.  Justice Benson denied 4 Motions for Summary Judgment by Microsoft to have the case dismissed.  The case was eventually settled by the parties.<ref>Lea, Graham.
