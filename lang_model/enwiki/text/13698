'''Abraham Gonz<U+00E1>lez Casavantes''' (June 7, 1864 &ndash; March 7, 1913) was the provisional and constitutional [[Governor of Chihuahua|governor]] of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] during the early period of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. He was the political mentor to the [[revolutionary]] [[Pancho Villa]], whom he had met and befriended before the revolution.

Gonz<U+00E1>lez was born on his family's estates in [[Bas<U+00FA>chil]], in  [[Guerrero Municipality]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].<ref name="Martinez">de Martinez, Irene Brandtner y Nava (2008) "Chihuahua Governor Abraham Gonz<U+00E1>lez, a Descendant of New Mexicans" ''La Herencia'' 58: p. 34</ref> He was a member of one of the richest and best-educated families in the state<ref>Staff (7 March 2008) [http://www.elagoradechihuahua.com/XCV-Aniversario-Luctuoso-de,3837.html "XCV Aniversario Luctuoso de Abraham Gonz<U+00E1>lez"] ''El <U+00C1>gora'', in Spanish</ref> (the Gonz<U+00E1>lez family was believed to be descended from European nobility).  He was educated at the [[University of Notre Dame]], in [[South Bend]], [[Indiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/index/NDP003.htm|title=Biographical Files - Notre Dame Alumni|work=Notre Dame Archives|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>

He was one of the main leaders of the [[Francisco Madero|Maderista]] ''Junta Revolucionaria Mexicana'', the movement which opposed the re-election of dictator [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]] in 1910.<ref name="Beezley">Beezley, William H. (1973) ''Insurgent governor: Abraham Gonzalez and the Mexican Revolution in Chihuahua'' University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, ISBN 0-8032-0821-9</ref>

During the early phases of the Revolution, Gonz<U+00E1>lez was appointed provisional governor of the State of Chihuahua on October 1910 by [[Francisco Madero]].  After the success of the Madero revolution, Gonz<U+00E1>lez was appointed interim governor in June 1911 pending elections.  He was elected governor in his own right in August 1911. <ref name="Beezley" />

In October 1911, Gonz<U+00E1>lez obtained a leave of absence, approved by the Chihuahua legislature, from the office of governor so that he could serve on Madero<U+2019>s cabinet in Mexico City.  On November 6, 1911 he was sworn in as the Minister of Internal Affairs (Secretar<U+00ED>a de Gobernaci<U+00F3>n).  He served in this capacity until February 1912, when he returned to Chihuahua and served as governor of the state until his death.<ref name="Beezley" />

After the assassination of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Francisco I. Madero]] and Vice-President [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Pino Su<U+00E1>rez]] during ''[[La decena tr<U+00E1>gica]]'', he was forced to resign from his post as governor and arrested on February 25, 1913, on orders of General [[Antonio R<U+00E1>bago]], a subordinate of the dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]].  During his incarceration, he was held in the same complex in the [[Federal Palace of Chihuahua]] that had housed [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] prior to his execution a century before, during the war for Mexico's independence.[http://www.advantagemexico.com/chihuahua/] On 7 March, he was taken aboard a train on the pretense of being transferred to [[Mexico City]], but was then removed from the train and murdered in [[Bachimba Canyon]], about 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) south of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]] on direct orders from Huerta, who had been responsible for ordering the murders of Madero and Pino Su<U+00E1>rez in order to assume power.

His nephew Colonel [[Fernando Gonz<U+00E1>lez y Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] and Pancho Villa later recovered Gonz<U+00E1>lez's remains and gave him a hero's funeral in the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]].  He is buried in the '''Rotunda of Illustrious Chihuahuans''' under the Angel of Libery monument in the Plaza Mayor in Chihuahua City.<ref>[http://www.chihuahuamexico.com/index.php?Itemid=116&id=198&option=com_content&task=view Abraham Gonz<U+00E1>lez Casavantes], accessed November 2010</ref>
