The '''Mandate for Palestine''', also known as the '''Mandate ''of'' Palestine''' or '''British Mandate of Palestine''', was a territory in the [[Middle East]] comprising modern [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], and territories governed by the [[Palestinian Authority]], formerly belonging to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which the [[League of Nations]] entrusted to the [[United Kingdom]] to administer in the [[aftermath of World War I]] as a [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate Territory]]. 

==Establishment of British League of Nations mandate==
British interest in [[Zionism]] dates to the rise in importance of the British Empire's South Asian enterprises in the early 19th century, concurrent with [[the Great Game]] and planning for the [[Suez Canal]]. As early as 1840, [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] (later to become Prime Minister) wrote:
<blockquote>
There exists at the present time among the [[Jews]] dispersed over Europe a strong notion that the time is approaching when their nation is to return to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It would be of manifest importance to the Sultan to encourage the Jews to return and settle in Palestine because the wealth that they would bring with them would increase the resources of the Sultan's dominions, and the Jewish people if returning under the sanction and protection at the invitation of the Sultan would be a check upon any future evil designs of Egypt or its neighbours. I wish to instruct your Excellency strongly to recommend to the Turkish government to hold out every just encouragement to the Jews of Europe to return to Palestine.[http://www.cdn-friends-icej.ca/judeochr/rolegent/prozion.html]
</blockquote>

[[Image:Palestine-Mandate-Ensign-1927-1948.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Palestine Ensign, flown by ships registered in the Mandate territory, 1927-1948]]Before the end of [[World War I]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The British, under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] stirred up by the British intelligence officer [[T. E. Lawrence]], [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|defeated the Turkish forces in 1917]] and occupied [[Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. The land was administered by the British for the remainder of the war.  The British military administration ended starvation with the aid of food supplies from Egypt, successfully fought [[typhus]] and [[cholera]] [[epidemic]]s and significantly improved the water supply to Jerusalem.  They reduced corruption by paying the Arab and Jewish judges higher salaries.  Communications were improved by new railway and telegraph lines.

The [[United Kingdom]] was granted control of Palestine by the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] which established the [[League of Nations]] in 1919 and appointed [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], a former [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinet]], who was instrumental in drafting the [[Balfour Declaration]], as its first [[High Commissioner]] in Palestine. During World War I the British had made two promises regarding territory in the Middle East. Britain had promised the local [[Arab]]s, through [[Lawrence of Arabia]], independence for a united Arab country covering most of the Arab Middle East, in exchange for their supporting the British; and Britain had promised to create and foster a Jewish national home as laid out in the Balfour Declaration, 1917.

The British had, in the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]], previously promised the [[Hashemite]] family lordship over most land in the region in return for their support in the Great [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I. 
In 1920 at the [[Conference of Sanremo]], [[Italy]], the [[League of Nations mandate]] over Palestine was assigned to Britain.  This territory at this time included all of what would later become the State of [[Israel]], the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[West Bank]], a part of the [[Golan Heights]], and the Kingdom of [[Jordan]]. The majority of the approximately 750,000 people in this multi-ethnic region were Arabic-speaking Muslims, including a Bedouin population (estimated at 103,331 at the time of the 1922 census [http://www.zionism-israel.com/Palestine_Hope_Simpson_Report.htm] and concentrated in the [[Beersheba]] area and the region south and east of it), as well as [[Jews]] (who comprised some 11% of the total) and smaller groups of [[Druze]], Syrians, Sudanese, [[Circassians]], Egyptians, Greeks, and [[Hejaz|Hejazi Arabs]].

[[Image:Palestine_stamp.jpg|thumb|left|110px|A stamp from Palestine under the British Mandate]]

In June 1922 the League of Nations passed the Palestine Mandate. The Palestine Mandate was an explicit document regarding Britain's responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine including "secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home", and "safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine".

The document defining Britain's obligations as Mandate power copied the text of the Balfour Declaration concerning the establishment of a Jewish homeland:
<blockquote>
His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.
</blockquote>

Many articles of the document specified actions in support of Jewish immigration and political status. However, it was also stated that in the large, mostly arid, territory to the east of the [[Jordan River]], then called [[Transjordan]], Britain could 'postpone or withhold' application of the provisions dealing with the 'Jewish National Home'. At the Cairo Conference of 1921 a government under the [[Hashemite]] [[Emir Abdullah]] who had just been displaced from ruling the Hejaz was established in Transjordan.  In September 1922, the British government presented a memorandum to the League of Nations stating that Transjordan would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, and this memorandum was approved on [[11 September]]. From that point onwards, Britain administered the part west of the Jordan as Palestine (which was 23% of the entire territory), and the part east of the Jordan as Transjordan (constituting 77% of the mandated territories).  Technically they remained one mandate but most official documents referred to them as if they were two separate mandates. Transjordan remained under British control until 1946.

In 1923 Britain transferred a part of the [[Golan Heights]] to the [[French Mandate of Syria]], in exchange for the [[Metula]] region.

== Palestinian Arab opposition to Jewish immigration ==
[[Image:Kibbutz Degania Alef.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kibbutz]] ''[[Degania]] Alef'', during the 1930s]]

During the 1920s, 100,000 [[Jew]]ish immigrants entered Palestine, and 6,000 non-Jewish immigrants did so as well. Jewish immigration was controlled by the ''[[Histadrut]]'', which selected between applicants on the grounds of their political creed. Land purchased by Jewish agencies was leased on the conditions that it be worked only by Jewish labour and that the lease should not be held by non-Jews. 

Initially, Jewish immigration to Palestine met little opposition from the [[Palestinian Arab]]s. However, as [[anti-Semitism]] grew in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigration (mostly from [[Europe]]) to Palestine began to increase markedly, creating much Arab resentment.

There was violent incitement from the Palestine Muslim leadership that led to violent attacks against the Jewish population.  In some cases, land purchases by the Jewish agencies from absentee landlords led to the eviction of the Palestinian Arab tenants, who were replaced by the Jews of the [[kibbutz|kibbutzim]]. The Arabic speakers before World War I had the status of peasants (''felaheen''), and did not own their land although they might own the trees that grew on that land.  Because most of these Jews were familiar with the European tradition of land-ownership, they did not realize that they were purchasing only the land, not the trees that grew on that land. This was often a source of misunderstanding and conflict.  The [[olive]] tree is particularly important as it can remain productive for more than one thousand years.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] government placed limitations on Jewish immigration to Palestine.  These quotas were controversial, particularly in the latter years of British rule, and both [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s disliked the policy, each side for its own reasons. In response to numerous Arab attacks on Jewish communities, the [[Haganah]], a Jewish paramilitary organization, was formed on [[June 15]], [[1920]]. Tensions led to widespread violent disturbances on several occasions, notably in 1921, 1929 (primarily violent attacks by Arabs on Jews&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;see [[Hebron]]) and 1936-1939. Beginning in 1936, several Jewish groups such as [[Irgun|Etzel (Irgun)]] and [[Stern Gang|Lehi (Stern Gang)]] conducted their own campaigns of violence against British and Arab targets. This prompted the British government to label them both as [[terrorism|terrorist]] organizations.

==Great Uprising==
{{main|1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}

In 1937, the [[Peel Commission]] proposed a partition between Jewish and Arab areas that was rejected by both the Arabs and the [[Zionist Congress]].

In 1936-1939 the mandate experienced an upsurge in militant Arab nationalism that became also known as "the Great Uprising." The revolt was triggered by increased Jewish immigration, primarily Jews that were ejected by the Nazi regime in Germany as well as rising anti-Semitism throughout Europe. The revolt was led or co-opted by the Grand Mufti, [[Haj Amin Al-Husseini]] and his Husseini family. The Arabs felt they were being marginalized in their own country, but in addition to non-violent strikes, they resorted to violence. Husseini's men killed more Arabs than Jews, using the revolt as an excuse to settle accounts with rival clans{{fact}}. The Jewish organization [[Irgun|Etzel]] replied with its own campaign, with marketplace bombings and other violent acts that also killed hundreds. Eventually, the uprising was put down by the British using severe measures. After he was implicated in killing the British district commissioner for the Galilee{{fact}}, Haj Amin El Husseini fled first to [[Lebanon]], then to [[Iraq]], and finally to [[Germany]] in late 1941.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] placed restrictions on Jewish land purchases in the remaining land, directly contradicting the provisions of the Mandate. A similar proposal to limit immigration in 1931 had been termed a violation of the mandate by the League of Nations. According to the Israeli side, the British had by 1949 allotted over 8500 acres (34 km<U+00B2>) to Arabs, and about 4100 acres (16 km<U+00B2>) to Jews.

== World War II and the Nazi Holocaust ==
As in most of the Arab world, there was no unanimity amongst the Palestinian Arabs as to their position regarding the combatants in [[World War II|WWII]].  Many signed up for the British army, but others saw an [[Axis powers|Axis]] victory as a likely outcome and a way of wresting Palestine back from the Zionists and the British.  Some of the leadership went further, especially the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin Al-Husseini]] (who had by then escaped to Iraq), who on [[November 25]], [[1941]], formally declared ''[[jihad]]'' against the Allied Powers.

Even though Arabs were only marginally higher than Jews in [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theory]], the Nazis naturally encouraged Arab support as much as possible as a counter to British hegemony throughout the Arab world.<ref>Secret World War II documents released by the UK in July, 2001, include documents on an [[Operation Atlas]] (See [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/july2001.pdf References: KV 2/400-402]. A joint German/Arab team, lead by [[Kurt Wieland]], parachuted into Palestine in September 1944. This was one of the last German efforts in the region to attack the Jewish community in Palestine and undermine British rule by supplying local Arabs with cash, arms and sabotage equipment. The team was picked up shortly after landing.</ref>

Arabs who opposed the persecution of the Jews at the hand of the Nazis included [[Habib Bourguiba]] in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]]ian intellectuals such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Abbas Mahmoud al-Arkad]]. (Source: [[Yad Vashem]]). The mandate recruited soldiers in Palestine. About 6,000 Palestinian Arabs joined the British forces and about 26,000 Jews.

In World War II, Italy, which in 1940 declared war on the United Kingdom on Germany's side, [[Italian bombings on Palestine in World War II|attacked Palestine from the air]]. In 1942 there was a period of anxiety for the [[Yishuv]], when the German forces of general [[Erwin Rommel]] advanced east in [[North Africa]] towards the [[Suez Canal]] and there was fear that they would conquer Palestine. This period was referred to as the two hundred days of anxiety. This event was the direct cause for the founding, with British support, of the [[Palmach]]<ref>[http://www.historycentral.com/Israel/1941PalmachFormed.html How the Palmach was formed] (History Central)</ref> - a highly-trained regular unit belonging to [[Haganah]] (which was mostly made up of reserve troops).

[[The Holocaust]] had a major effect on the situation in Palestine. During the war, the British forbade entry into Palestine of European Jews escaping Nazi persecution, placing them in detention camps or deporting them to places such as [[Mauritius]]. [[Avraham Stern]], the leader of the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] underground group, whose will to fight the British was so strong he offered to fight on the Nazi side, and other Zionists, tried to convince the Nazis to continue seeing emigration from Europe as the "solution" for their "Jewish problem", but the Nazis gradually abandoned this idea in favor of containment and physical extermination.

Starting in 1939, the Zionists organized an illegal immigration effort, known as [[Aliya Beth]], conducted by "[[Hamossad Le'aliyah Bet]]", that rescued tens of thousands of European Jews from the Nazis by shipping them to Palestine in rickety boats. Many of these boats were intercepted. The last immigrant boat to try to enter Palestine during the war was the [[Struma]], torpedoed in the [[Black Sea]] by a [[Soviet]] submarine in February 1942. The boat sank with the loss of nearly 800 lives. Illegal immigration resumed after WW II. 

Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Bet Zuri, members of the Jewish Lehi underground, assassinated [[Walter Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] in [[Cairo]] on [[6 November]] [[1944]]. Moyne was the British Minister of State for the Middle East. The assassination is said by some to have turned British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] against the Zionist cause, but for [[Lehi]] the priority was to allow Jewish refugees to enter the country and to establish the state on their own.

The British considered it more important to get Arab backing, because of their important interests in [[Egypt]] and other Arab lands, and especially to guarantee the friendship of oil-rich [[Saudi Arabia]], and therefore continued the ban on immigration.   

As a result of the assassination of Lord Moyne, the Haganah kidnapped, interrogated, and turned over to the British many members of the Irgun (ironically Lehi members were not harmed as a result of an understanding with Haganah, even though Lehi committed the assassination). This period is known as the '[[Hunting Season]]'. Irgun ordered its members not to resist or retaliate with violence, so as to prevent a spiraling to civil war.

Following the war, 250,000 Jewish refugees were stranded in displaced persons (DP) camps in Europe. Despite the pressure of world opinion, in particular the repeated requests of US President [[Harry S. Truman]] and the recommendations of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], the British refused to lift the ban on immigration and admit 100,000 displaced persons to Palestine. The Jewish underground forces then united and carried out several attacks against the British. In 1946, the Irgun [[King David Hotel bombing|blew up the King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem, the headquarters of the British administration, killing 92 people. 

Seeing that the situation was quickly spiraling out of hand, the British announced their desire to terminate their mandate and to withdraw by May 1948.

==Division of Palestine by United Nations==
{{main|1947 UN Partition Plan}}

The [[United Nations]], the successor to the [[League of Nations]], attempted to solve the dispute between the [[Palestinian Jew]]s and Arabs. 
The UN created the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]]
(UNSCOP), composed of representatives from several states. In order to make the committee more neutral, none of the [[Great Powers]] were represented. 

UNSCOP considered two main proposals. The first called for the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states in Palestine, with Jerusalem to be placed under international administration. The second called for the creation of a single federal state containing both Jewish and Arab constituent states. A majority of UNSCOP favoured the first option, although several members supported the second option instead and one member (Australia) said it was unable to decide between them. As a result, the first option was adopted and the UN General Assembly largely accepted UNSCOP's proposals, though they made some adjustments to the boundaries between the two states proposed by it. The division was to take effect on the date of British withdrawal.

The partition plan was rejected out of hand by the leadership of the Palestinian Arabs and by most of the Arab population. Most of the Jews accepted the proposal, in particular the Jewish Agency, which was the Jewish state-in-formation. Numerous records indicate the joy of Palestine's Jewish inhabitants as they attended the U.N. session voting for the division proposal. Up to this day, Israeli history books mention [[29 November]], the date of this session, as the most important date leading to the creation of the Israeli state.

Several Jews, however, declined the proposal. [[Menachem Begin]], Irgun's leader, announced: "The partition of the homeland is illegal. It will never be recognized. The signature by institutions and individuals of the partition agreement is invalid. It will not bind the Jewish people. Jerusalem was and will for ever be our capital. The Land of Israel will be restored to the people of Israel. All of it. And for ever". His views were publicly rejected by the majority of the nascent Jewish state. 

On the date of British withdrawal the Jewish provisional government declared the formation of the State of Israel, and the provisional government said that it would grant full civil rights to all within its borders, whether Arab, Jew, Bedouin or Druze. The [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, May 14, 1948]] stated:
<blockquote>
''We appeal ... to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.'' 
</blockquote>

<!--
According to an October 17, 1947 testimony before the United Nations by [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]] of the Jewish Agency, "the Jews have, so far, managed to acquire less than seven percent of the land area of Palestine."[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/571b9a10c26738c7852569350055f202/$FILE/gapal20.pdf]   According to Moshe Aumann, who writes in "Land Ownership in Palestine, 1880-1948,";  of the land that became Israel (approximately 78% of western Mandate Palestine, by area, and 18% if including the Mandate areas east of the Jordan River), Jews owned almost 9%, Palestinians who became citizens of Israel (and retained ownership of their land) owned another 3%, about 18% belonged to Arabs who had left the area, and the mandatory government owned over 70%. [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf3.html#b] -->

== Population of the British Mandate of Palestine ==
In 1922 the British undertook the first census of the mandate. The population was 752,048, comprising 589,177 Muslims, 83,790 Jews, 71,464 Christians and 7,617 persons belonging to other groups. After a second census in 1931, the population had grown to 1,036,339 in total, comprising 761,922 Muslims, 175,138 Jews, 89,134 Christians and 10,145 people belonging to other groups. There were no further censuses but statistics were maintained by counting births, deaths and migration. Some components such as illegal immigration could only be estimated approximately.  The [[White Paper of 1939]], which placed immigration restrictions on Jews, stated that the Jewish population "has risen to some 450,000" and was "approaching a third of the entire population of the country".  In 1945 a demographic study showed that the population had grown to 1,764,520, comprising 1,061,270 Muslims, 553,600 Jews, 135,550 Christians and 14,100 people of other groups.

== Land ownership of the British Mandate of Palestine ==
The Arabs, constituting no less than two thirds of Palestine's population, owned the vast majority of private property. According to one source Arabs owned about half of the land [http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm]. Other sources, however, provide considerably lower figures [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf3.html].

Jews, making up about a third of Palestine's population, privately and collectively owned 1,393,531 [[Dunum | dunums]] in 1945 (Khalaf, 1991, pp. 26-27) and 1,850,000 dunums in 1947 (Avneri p. 224). This constituted about 20% of cultivable, and 7% of the total land of Palestine.

Public property or "crown lands" belonged to the government of Palestine. The amount of Palestine owned by the government is also disputed. One source puts the number as high as 70% of the total land [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf3.html].
