'''Jacques-Nicolas (Jaak-Nicolaas) Lemmens''' (Zoele-Parwijs, near [[Westerlo]], [[Belgium]], [[January 3]], [[1823]] - [[Zemst]], near [[Mechelen]], Belgium, [[January 30]], [[1881]]) was an [[organist]] and [[composer]] for his instrument.

He studied with [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Joseph F<U+00E9>tis]], who wanted to make him into a musician capable of renewing the organ-player's art in Belgium. F<U+00E9>tis sent him to [[Adolf Hesse]] in [[Breslau]] to learn [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s tradition.

In 1847, Lemmens won the prestigious ''[[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Prix de Rome]]'' with his ''Le roi Lear'' ("King Lear"). One year later he published his first work for organ ''Dix improvisations dans le style s<U+00E9>v<U+00E8>re et chantant'' ("Ten improvisations in a strict and singing style"). In March 1849 he was appointed organ teacher at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] aged 26, and he trained young French talents, including [[Alexandre Guilmant]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]].

In 1852 he gave [[pipe organ|organ]] recitals in Saint Vincent de Paul, La Madeleine and Saint Eustache churches in [[Paris]], where he stunned audiences. Particularly notable was his brilliant pedal-playing, which owed a good deal to his studies of [[JS Bach|Bach]]'s music (at the time Bach's organ works were not at all well known in France).

In 1857 he married the [[English people|English]] [[soprano]] [[Helen Lemmens-Sherrington|Helen Sherrington]] (1834-1906), who in the following decade emerged as a leading English concert and operatic singer.
