The '''1930 Atlantic hurricane season''' was the second least active [[Atlantic hurricane season]] on record &ndash; behind only [[1914 Atlantic hurricane season|1914]] &ndash; with only three systems reaching tropical storm intensity. Of those three, two reached hurricane status, both of which also became major hurricanes, Category&nbsp;3 or higher storms on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref name="ACE"/> The first system developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on August&nbsp;21. Later that month, a second storm, the [[1930 Dominican Republic hurricane|Dominican Republic hurricane]], formed on August&nbsp;29. It peaked as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane with winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The third and final storm dissipated on October&nbsp;21. 

Due to the lack of systems that developed, only one tropical cyclone managed to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] during the season, the second hurricane.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} It severely impacted areas of the [[Greater Antilles]], particularly the [[Dominican Republic]], before making subsequent landfalls on [[Cuba]] and the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Florida]] and [[North Carolina]], with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the [[List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|deadliest Atlantic hurricanes]] in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a [[cruise ship]] in open waters.

The season's inactivity was reflected in its low [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating of 50.<ref name="ACE">{{cite report|work=[[Hurricane Research Division]]; [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=March 2011|title=Atlantic basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|accessdate=March 27, 2014|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Comparison_of_Original_and_Revised_HURDAT_mar11.html|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39&nbsp;mph (63&nbsp;km/h), which is tropical storm strength.<ref>{{cite report|author=David Levinson|date=August 20, 2008|title=2005 Atlantic Ocean Tropical Cyclones|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=July 1, 2013|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2005/2005-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629015634/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2005/2005-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html| archivedate= June 29, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no|location=Asheville, North Carolina}}</ref>

The first hurricane of the season was first noted in the central Atlantic Ocean on August&nbsp;21. Slowly intensifying, the system initially moved towards the west.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} On August&nbsp;22, a steamship in the vicinity was sustained some structural damage.<ref name=monthlyweatherreview1>{{cite report|author=F.A.

A tropical depression developed well east of the Lesser Antilles on August&nbsp;29. Initially drifting westward, the storm gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early the next day. By August&nbsp;31, the system strengthened into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The next day, the hurricane entered the [[Caribbean Sea]], passing the island of [[Dominica]] as a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane. Continuing to intensify, the storm further intensified into a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane on September&nbsp;2 and then to a Category&nbsp;4 the following day. Around 18:00&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&nbsp;3, the hurricane peaked with winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h),{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} observed by a ship.<ref name="mwrsantodomingo">{{cite report|author=F.

The mountainous terrain of [[Hispaniola]] rapidly weakened the system to a tropical storm early on September&nbsp;4. Moving westward over the Caribbean Sea, the storm failed to re-strengthen before making landfall in western [[Cuba]] with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) around midday on September&nbsp;6. Thereafter, the system entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and curved northeastward. At 09:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;9, the storm again made landfall near [[Bradenton, Florida]] with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h). Later that day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while crossing [[Florida]]. Upon emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on the next day, the system re-intensified into a tropical storm. While located offshore [[South Carolina]], the storm re-attained hurricane status early on September&nbsp;12. The hurricane then brushed the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] before heading out to sea. The storm further strengthened to Category&nbsp;2 intensity, heading eastward, but weakened to a tropical storm early on September&nbsp;16. The following day, the storm deteriorated further to a tropical depression, and late on September&nbsp;17, the depression dissipated southwest of the Azores.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

The final storm of the season developed in the [[Bay of Campeche]] on October&nbsp;18 at the tail end of a [[weather front|frontal boundary]]. Although cool-air [[Advection#Meteorology|advection]] was occurring off the United States coast, warm air around the system allowed the tropical storm to intensify. Moving to the northeast, the system reached peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm with winds of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Ultimately, the cool-air advection eventually took a toll on the storm, causing it to quickly weaken. By 06:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;21, the storm dissipated.<ref name="metadata"/>
