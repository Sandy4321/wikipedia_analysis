The '''Douglas C-47 Skytrain''' or '''Dakota''' is a military transport that was developed from the [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner.

==History==
During [[World War II]], the armed forces of many countries used the C-47 and modified DC-3s for the transport of troops, cargo and wounded. Over 10,000 aircraft were produced in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Santa Monica, California]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. The C-47 was vital to the success of many [[Allied]] campaigns, in particular those at [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]] and in the jungles of [[New Guinea]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] where the C-47 (and its naval version, the R4D) alone made it possible for Allied troops to counter the mobility of the light-travelling Japanese army. Additionally, C-47s were used to airlift supplies to the embattled American forces during the [[Battle of Bastogne]]. But possibly its most influential role in military aviation was flying [[The Hump]] from India into China where the expertise gain would later be used in the [[Berlin Airlift]] in which the C-47 would also play its part.

In Europe, the C-47 and a specialized paratroop variant, the '''C-53 Skytrooper''', were used in vast numbers in the later stages of the war, particularly to tow [[military glider|glider]]s and drop paratroops. In the Pacific, with careful use of the island landing strips of the Pacific Ocean, C-47s were even used for ferrying soldiers serving in the Pacific theater back to the United States.

C-47s in British and Commonwealth service took the name '''Dakota'''. The C-47 also earned the nickname "Gooney Bird" during the European theater of operations.

The [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] had C-47 Skytrains in service from 1946 through 1947.

After World War II the U.S. Navy also structurally modified a number of the early Navy R4D aircraft and re-designated the modified aircraft as '''R4D-8'''. 

The C-47 was used by the Americans in the initial stages of the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]] and was subsequently replaced by the [[C-54 Skymaster|C-54]].

The Air Force also continued to use the C-47 for various roles, including the [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] gunships - code named 'Puff the Magic Dragon' or 'Spooky' - and the EC-47 for counterintelligence during the [[Vietnam War]].

The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] also adopted the C-47 for use in search & rescue operations throughout the 1940s and 50s.

==Variants==

* '''C-47''' - Initial military version of DC-3.
* '''C-47A''' - 24-volt electrical system replacing the 12-volt of the C-47.
* '''C-47B''' - R-1830-90 engines with superchargers and extra fuel capacity to cover the [[China]]-[[Burma]]-[[India]] routes.
* '''C-47D''' - C-47B with superchargers removed after the war. 
* '''C-47T''' - Used for training. 
* '''C-48''' to '''C-52''' - various DC-3s pressed into military service.
* '''C-53''' - US Army passenger version of the C-47.
* '''C-117/C-129''' - Super DC-3- Landing gear covers-Enlarged empennage
* '''[[XCG-17]]''' - A glider version of the C-47, intended to be towed by a C-47.

==Operators==
===United States Army Air Force===
Used in every major theater of operations in World War II.

===Royal Air Force===
[[Image:C-47 exhibition in 2004.jpg|right|thumb|C-47 at an exhibition in 2004.]]
[[Image:00910460 073.jpg|right|thumb|Interior view of Douglas C-47, [[Hendon Airdrome]], England.]]
[[RAF Transport Command]] was supplied with over 1,900 Dakotas under the [[Lend-Lease]] system during WW2 and the type was flown by at least 46 operational squadrons, plus numerous support units. In total the RAF flew 50 '''Dakota I''' (C-47), 9 '''Dakota II''' (C-53), 962 '''Dakota III''' (C-47A) and 896 '''Dakota IV''' (C-47B). RAF Dakotas were assigned to the European, North African, Middle East and Far East theatres of war. C-47 Dakotas of the RAF and USAAF played an important role in dropping paratroopers and equipment and towing gliders to the Normandy landings and to Arnhem. Four squadrons of Dakota IVs took part in the [[Berlin Airlift]] in 1948/49. 

59 were also supplied to [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] to maintain international air links.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
The [[RAAF]] drafted civilian [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3s]] into military service in September [[1939]] at the outbreak of WW2. The first true C-47s were delivered to the RAAF in 1942 (ex-[[USAAF]]) and the first built specifically for the RAAF entered service in February [[1943]]. 124 C-47s were delivered to the RAAF (and four to the [[Royal Australian Navy]]) by 1945. They were used throughout [[WW2]], [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] and in [[Occupied Japan]]. Most were transferred to civilian government agencies in Australia and [[New Guinea]] or sold to airlines in the 1960s. A handful survived in RAAF service into the 1990s with the last two being retired from the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] in March [[1999]].

===South African Air Force===
* [[35 Squadron SAAF|35 Squadron]] (Still in use, flying the Turbo Dakota.)
* [[No. 44 Squadron SAAF]] (employed in 1944 and 1945 to support operations in the [[Greek Civil War]]

===Indonesian Air Force / TNI-AU===
* C-47 Dakota with tailnumber RI-001 ''Seulawah'', bought by Acehnese people in 1948 during the Netherlands policional action in Indonesia. This plane used for the transportation between Java and Sumatra. One aircraft is given to Burma (now, Myanmar) as an honour for the friendship with Indonesia, during the war with the Dutch. 
* Indonesia got some C-47 from the Netherlands after the wars ended in 1949.
* C-47 intensively used in lots of military conflicts with local rebels like PRRI in Sumatera and Permesta in Sulawesi and Maluku. Beside that, C-47 used for transport in non-confict areas. 
* Some C-47 given to local airlines for commercial using.     

===Greek Air Force===
* [[No. 355 Squadron RHAF]] (employed in the [[Greek Civil War]] from 1946 through 1948)

== Soviet Air Force ==

The [[Lisunov Li-2]] was a licensed copy of the DC-3, produced in Russia, some 6000 were made between [[1939]] and [[1952]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Brouwer |first=Maarten |url=http://www.centercomp.com/cgi-bin/dc3/story?1332 |title=Lisunov Li-2 (NATO: Cab) |accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref>, operated by the Soviet Union, and presumably some of it's allies and client states.
