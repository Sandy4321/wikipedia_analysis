'''L.A. Live''', (also popularly called '''Times Square West''', and '''The Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment District''') is currently under construction in [[downtown Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Adjacent to the [[Staples Center]], L.A. Live is slated to cost approximately USD $2.5 billion to be paid by owner [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]], [[Wachovia]] Corp. and investment firm MacFarlane Partners with help from Los Angeles taxpayers.  It will feature six city blocks of apartments, ballrooms, bars, concert theaters, condominiums, restaurants, movie theaters and a hotel. This project will move the downtown skyline and center of activity further South.{{POV-statement|date=June 2008}}

The multi-faceted entertainment destination will feature entertainment venues, restaurants, retail commercial and residential spaces, television and radio broadcast studios, and concert spaces. Highlights of the district will include a 54-story tower housing two hotels and serviced residences (under the JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Residences At The Ritz-Carlton brands), a 40,000 ft&sup2;  outdoor plaza, an [[ESPN]] broadcast and restaurant facility, [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Theatres]], as well as Club [[Nokia]], the [[Nokia]] Theatre Los Angeles, and [[Nokia]] Plaza.

== Features ==

===Nokia Plaza===
[[Nokia]] Plaza is a 40,000 ft&sup2; open-air plaza that will serve as the central meeting place for L.A. Live. The Plaza will serve as one of the district's key anchors, providing a broadcast venue featuring giant LED screens as well as a red carpet site for special events. The Nokia venues will be part of the "Nokia Unwired" marketing platform, which will bring live music to fans in both the Nokia venues and through "Nokia Presents Hard Rock Live" on [[MTV]].

[[Architecture|Architects]] and designers were inspired to create a district featuring the same amount of flashiness prominent at [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Ginza]] District of [[Tokyo]].

===Nokia Theatre===

[[Nokia]] Theatre Los Angeles is a premier mid-sized music and theatre venue featuring state-of-the-art acoustics and seating for 7,100.{{POV-statement|date=June 2008}} The Theatre will host the [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and [[ESPY Awards]], as well as numerous other productions from [[VH1]], [[MTV]], and [[BET]]. It is also available for corporate shareholder meetings, product launches, and seminars. Club [[Nokia]] will be a club for live music and cultural events. The stand-alone club, which will accommodate up to 2,400 patrons, will feature up and coming music acts, bands, and cultural shows. The club may also be used to host private parties and corporate events.

The first scheduled event held at Nokia Theatre was a concert featuring [[the Eagles]] and the [[the Dixie Chicks]] on [[October 18]], [[2007]].  Other events already booked include the [[American Music Awards]] on [[November 18]].

On [[March 11]], [[2008]], the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] announced with Anschutz that the venue will be the home to the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] ceremony from 2008 until at least 2018, [http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-03-11-emmys_N.htm].

Events held at Nokia Theater:
*Season finale of the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' was held here on [[May 21]], [[2008]], after using the [[Kodak Theatre]] as the finale stage for the 1st and 3rd-6th season coronations.

===Grammy Museum===

On [[May 8]], [[2007]], it was announced that the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] will place a museum dedicated to the history of the [[Grammy Awards]].  The Grammys are now held annually at Staples Center.[http://entertainment.netster.com/story.asp?id=D8P0S9FO0]

===ESPN West Coast Headquarters===
ESPN Network is scheduled to move into the broadcast center once the second phase of development is completed in late 2009.

===J.W. Marriott/Ritz Carlton Hotel and Residences===
The centerpiece of the district will be the tower, a 54 story, 1,001 room two-hotel hybrid constructed above the parking lot directly north of the Staples Center. The hotels, to be operated as the 654-room JW Marriott Los Angeles on the first 24 floors and the 123-room [[Ritz-Carlton]] Los Angeles above, are expected to bring the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] a significant increase of reservations, mainly due to the solution of the existing problem of a lack of nearby hotels to serve convention visitors. The tower was delayed for a time, but local homebuilder [[KB Home]] recently signed an agreement to help build the hotel, thus construction has also begun on the hotel and is on its 10th floor of construction as of [[May 2008]].

===Herbalife Headquarters/Office Space===
Office space is to be created for [[AEG]], and [[Herbalife]] is slated to move its Headquartes to L.A. Live.[http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2007/10/22/news/news01.txt/]

==Timeline==
Construction began on [[15 September]] [[2005]]. The district is expected to revive Downtown Los Angeles and help it compete with [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] for convention center business.

The first phase was completed on October 18th, 2007. Phase one contains the Nokia Theatre, the Nokia Plaza, a retail plaza, as well as an underground parking garage, holding a fraction of the project's expected total of 4,000 parking spaces.
