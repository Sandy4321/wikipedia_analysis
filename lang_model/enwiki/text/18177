'''Sandy Koufax''' of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitched a '''perfect game''' in [[Major League Baseball]] against the [[Chicago Cubs]] at [[Dodger Stadium]] on September 9, 1965.<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1965/B09090LAN1965.htm Box score and play by play]</ref> [[Sandy Koufax|Koufax]], by retiring 27 consecutive [[batting (baseball)|batters]] without allowing any to reach base, became the sixth [[pitcher]] of the modern era to throw a [[perfect game]]. The game was Koufax's fourth [[no-hitter]], breaking [[Bob Feller]]'s Major League record of three (and later broken by [[Nolan Ryan]], in [[1981 in baseball|1981]]). Koufax [[strikeout|struck out]] 14 opposing batters, the most ever recorded in a perfect game.

The game was also notable for the high quality of performance by the opposing pitcher, [[Bob Hendley]] of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning. The only [[run (baseball)|run]] that the Dodgers scored was [[earned run|unearned]]. The game holds the record for fewest base runners (both teams), with two; the next lowest total is four.<ref>Leavy, p. 244.</ref>

Koufax's perfect game is a memorable part of baseball lore. [[Jane Leavy]]'s biography of Koufax is structured around a re-telling of the game. An article in Salon.com honoring broadcaster [[Vin Scully]] focuses on his play-by-play call of the perfect game.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/10/12/scully/ Salon Brilliant Careers - Vin Scully]</ref> This game was selected in a 1995 poll of members of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] as the greatest game ever pitched.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/century/090999.htm ''USA Today''] September 9, 1999.</ref>  

==The game==
Koufax had not won a game in three weeks; not since [[Juan Marichal]] hit Koufax's [[catcher]], [[John Roseboro]], in the head with a baseball bat. The Dodgers were playing at home against the eighth-place Chicago Cubs. Bob Hendley, the pitcher for the Cubs, was just up from the minor leagues and had a 2&ndash;2 record.

Koufax retired the first batter he faced, [[Donald Young (baseball)|Donald Young]], a late season call-up, on a pop-up on the second pitch of the game. [[Glenn Beckert]], another rookie, struck out looking at a curveball after hitting a [[line drive]] down the third base line just barely foul. The third batter, [[Billy Williams (baseball player)|Billy Williams]], also struck out looking at a curve ball. In the second inning, [[Ron Santo]] fouled out to catcher [[Jeff Torborg]], [[Ernie Banks]] struck out on a [[forkball]], and [[Byron Browne]], during his first major league at-bat, lined out to center fielder [[Willie Davis (baseball player)|Willie Davis]]. Koufax got [[Chris Krug]] to line out to center field to start off the third inning. Following him, [[Don Kessinger]] flew out on an 0&ndash;2 pitch and Hendley struck out. In the fourth inning, Koufax got Young to fly out to the first baseman and Beckert to fly out to right. Koufax then struck out Williams a second time.

In the top half of the fifth inning, the Cubs went three up, three down with Santo flying out, Banks striking out for the second time in the game, and Brown grounding out. By the bottom of the fifth, neither team had reached first base. That changed when Hendley walked [[Lou Johnson]] on a three-and-two pitch that could have gone either way. [[Ron Fairly]] dropped a [[sacrifice bunt]] that Hendley bobbled, leaving his only play at first base. On the first pitch to [[Jim Lefebvre]], Johnson [[stolen base|stole]] third base. The Cubs' catcher Krug threw the ball over Santo's head and into left field, which allowed Johnson to score. The Dodgers had scored a run without an [[at bat|official at-bat]] or [[run batted in|RBI]]. 

The bottom of the order came up in the sixth inning for the Cubs. Krug grounded the ball to shortstop [[Maury Wills]], who threw it in the dirt to first baseman [[Wes Parker]]. Parker managed to dig the ball out to save the play and Koufax's perfect game. Kessinger hit a dribbler down the third base line, but [[Jim Gilliam|Junior Gilliam]] was playing shallow (to guard against the bunt) and threw him out by half a step. Hendley, who still had a no-hitter going of his own, struck out on three pitches.

Koufax's performance worsened briefly in the seventh, when he threw one pitch that sailed past Young and went all the way to the backstop. Koufax recovered and struck out Young. Beckert was next; he flew out to right field. Williams started out with three straight balls. Koufax's next two pitches were fastballs right down the middle. Williams let the first one go and fouled off the second one. Williams ended up hitting a pop fly to left field on the next pitch. During the bottom of the seventh inning, Johnson broke up Hendley's no-hitter with a bloop hit behind the second baseman. By the time Banks reached it, Johnson was on second base. Fairly grounded out to second, stranding Johnson on second base.

The heart of the Chicago order came up in the eighth inning, and Koufax struck out all three of them. Banks, who struck out for the third time, never made contact the entire game. The Dodgers went three up and three down in the bottom half of the inning. Koufax again struck out the side in the ninth inning to secure the perfect game. As Vin Scully, the Dodgers' long time play-by-play announcer, commented at the end: "And Sandy Koufax, whose name will always remind you of strikeouts, did it with a flourish. He struck out the last six consecutive batters. So when he wrote his name in capital letters in the record books, that "K" stands out even more than the O-U-F-A-X." The final out was made by [[Harvey Kuenn]], the same man who made the final out of Koufax's 1963 no-hitter <U+2014> which had been, appropriately, a ground ball back to Koufax. In the end, Johnson's hit was the only one by either team; the combined total of 1 hit for the entire game is a major league record. Koufax threw 113 pitches during the game, 79 of which were [[strike zone|strikes]]. Koufax's catcher, [[Jeff Torborg]], would also catch the first of [[Nolan Ryan]]'s seven no-hitters in [[1973 in baseball|1973]].

Five days after the perfect game, the Koufax-Hendley rematch took place at [[Wrigley Field]]. This time, Hendley defeated Koufax, 2-1.

To date, the perfect game is the last no-hitter to be pitched against the Cubs. They have gone the longest of all MLB teams since a no-hitter was last pitched against them.

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=May 2008}}
*According to Leavy, it was known throughout the league that Koufax "telegraphed" his pitches: another "hitch" in his windup told batters whether the curveball or fastball was coming. Cubs outfielder Al Spangler reminded teammates of this just before the game. Cubs player Billy Williams later groused that "We knew what was coming, and we still couldn't hit it."{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

*In addition to having gone the longest of all Major League teams since a no-hitter was last pitched against them, the Cubs had also gone the longest since they were last involved in a no-hitter. They had pitched four since the perfect game, the most recent being on September 2, 1972 by [[Milt Pappas]], whose bid for a perfect game was spoiled by a walk to the 27th batter he faced. This ended on September 14, [[2008 in baseball|2008]], when [[Carlos Zambrano (baseball)|Carlos Zambrano]] threw a no-hitter against the [[Houston Astros]] at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080915&content_id=3479561&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc].

*The Dodger's one run was scored without an official at-bat.  It went walk, sacrifice, stolen base, error.
