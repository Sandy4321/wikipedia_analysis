'''Thomas Bryan Martin''' (1731<U+2013>1798) was an 18th-century [[English American]] land agent, justice, legislator, and planter in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later [[U.S. state]]) of Virginia and in present-day West Virginia. Martin was the land agent of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] for his uncle [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1693<U+2013>1781) and served two terms in the [[House of Burgesses]].

Martin was born in [[Kent]] in 1731, and was the grandson of [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1657<U+2013>1710) through his mother, Frances Fairfax Martin. Raised in humble surroundings in England, Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle Lord Fairfax in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary, which encompassed up to {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}}. Martin resided with his uncle on their frontier [[Greenway Court, Virginia|Greenway Court]] estate in present-day [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]], Virginia. He earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature and loyalty, and through Martin's growing influence, Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations to Greenway Court in 1762 and made Martin steward and land agent of the proprietary.

Martin took an active role in political and civil affairs within the proprietary's domain. He served as a [[vestryman]] for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Frederick Parish and upon the creation of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in 1754, he presided as the county's first justice and was further appointed the County Lieutenant. He later represented Hampshire County in the House of Burgesses from 1756 to 1758 and served alongside [[George Washington]] representing [[Frederick County, Virginia|Fredrick County]] from 1758 until 1761. Martin was appointed a trustee of the frontier towns of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City), and [[Berkeley Springs, West Virginia|Bath]] (present-day Berkeley Springs). He was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. Through not in best of health, Martin was relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources in response to Native American attacks. Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Martin refused reappointment by Governor [[Patrick Henry]] as a justice of the Frederick County Commission of Peace. Afterward, Martin retreated from civil service entirely, and retired to Greenway Court.

He maintained a low profile during the war and his uncle Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration despite being the only resident [[Peerage|peer]] in the American colonies. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin's brother Reverend Denny Martin Fairfax inherited the Northern Neck Proprietary and Martin was given the Greenway Court estate. He took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress and died unmarried in 1798. Martin bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly maintain the proprietary and conveyed the remaining lands in 1797, thus terminating the Fairfax and Martin families' interests in the proprietary before it was formally dissolved in 1806. The city of [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] was named for Martin by his friend [[Adam Stephen]].

Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron owned the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] [[land grant]], which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper]] in 1719.<ref name="Munske1">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=9.}}</ref><ref name="UVA1">{{cite web|url=http://carter.lib.virginia.edu |title=The Diary, Correspondence and Papers of Robert "King" Carter of Virginia 1701<U+2013>1732 |publisher=University of Virginia Library, [[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> The proprietary constituted up to {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}} of Virginia's [[Northern Neck]] and a vast area spanning west to the [[Potomac River#North Branch Potomac River|North Branch Potomac River]] headwaters.<ref name="Munske1" /> The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by [[Charles II of England]] to seven of his supporters in 1649, and again in 1688 by official patent.<ref name="Munske1" /> One of these seven supporters, Lord Colepeper, acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681 and his grandson, Lord Fairfax inherited the land grant upon his death.<ref name="Munske1" /><ref name="UVA1" /> Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin [[William Fairfax]] (1691<U+2013>1757) to replace [[Robert Carter I]] as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary, a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757.<ref name="Munske1" /><ref name="Cartmell1">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=245.}}</ref><ref name="Harrison2">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=37.}}</ref> In 1750, Martin's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation [[Greenway Court, Virginia|Greenway Court]] estate near present-day [[White Post, Virginia|White Post]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]] with the intention of administering the proprietary himself.<ref name="Brown1" /><ref name="Munske1" /> Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747, then known as "the Quarter."<ref name="Lissandrello2">{{Harvnb|Lissandrello|1975|p=3 of the PDF file.}}</ref> With his cousin William Fairfax performing as land agent, Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would be up to the task.<ref name="Brown1" /> Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert, then his brother-in-law Denny Martin, and in 1751, he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty-year-old nephew and Denny Martin's son, Thomas Bryan Martin.<ref name="Brown1" /><ref name="Russell3">{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=29.}}</ref>
[[File:GreenwayCourt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An early 19th-century engraving of the main house at [[Greenway Court]].]]
Lord Fairfax sent for Martin, who arrived in Virginia from England aboard the ''Hatley'' on May 24, 1751, accompanied by William Fairfax, who had been seeking an appointment to a probable position in England.<ref name="Harrison2" /><ref name="Brown2">{{Harvnb|Brown|2008|p=121.}}</ref> Martin and Fairfax arrived in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], where they dined with Fairfax's fellow [[Virginia Governor's Council]] member John Blair, Sr. and visited the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] and the [[Capitol (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Capitol]] before beginning their journey toward the [[Northern Neck]] on May 31.<ref name="Brown2" /> Following his arrival to the Northern Neck Proprietary, Martin settled at Greenway Court with his uncle that autumn.<ref name="Tyler1" /><ref name="Cartmell1" /><ref name="Harrison2" /> Due to his humble upbringing, Martin quickly adapted to frontier life at Greenway Court.<ref name="Brown3" /> Martin soon earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature, loyalty, and his good eyesight, which greatly assisted his [[myopia|myopic]] uncle.<ref name="Brown3" /> On May 21, 1752, shortly after Martin had come of age on his twenty-first birthday, Lord Fairfax granted Greenway Court to his nephew, along with {{convert|8840|acre|km2}} of limestone lands on the west bank of the [[Shenandoah River]] across from Leeds Manor, which were "to be known and called by the name of the Manor of Greenway Court" and subject to an annual [[quit-rent]] fee of "a good buck and doe" due on the feast day of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]].<ref name="Harrison6" /><ref name="Brown3" /><ref name="Harrison3">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=38.}}</ref> Greenway Court had taken its name from the Culpeper family's manor in Kent.<ref name="Harrison6" /><ref name="Harrison3" />

Desiring a larger role for himself in the proprietary's administration, Martin sought to influence his uncle into reorganizing the management of the proprietary.<ref name="Cartmell1" /> At Martin's suggestion, Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations {{convert|56|mi|km}} northwest from [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]] to an expressly built land office depository and archive at Greenway Court in 1762.<ref name="Munske1" /><ref name="Cartmell1" /><ref name="Lissandrello1">{{Harvnb|Lissandrello|1975|p=2 of the PDF file.}}</ref> Prior to this move, a small land office had been in operation at Greenway Court.<ref name="Munske1" /> Following William Fairfax's death in 1757, his son [[George William Fairfax]] (1729<U+2013>1787) had succeeded him as steward and land agent of the proprietary.<ref name="Munske1" /><ref name="Cartmell1" /> Martin succeeded Fairfax as the steward and land agent of the proprietary in 1762.<ref name="Tyler1" /><ref name="Munske1" /> Fairfax's replacement by Martin, the transfer of the land office and Martin's increased influence over Lord Fairfax caused bitter feelings from George William Fairfax, as evidenced by his letters during this period.<ref name="Cartmell1" /> Fairfax and his wife [[Sally Fairfax|Sally Cary Fairfax]] returned to England in 1773 prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]] and did not return afterward.<ref name="Cartmell1" />

While residing at Greenway Court, Martin would have preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate, as their living situation there was originally supposed to have only been temporary until the construction of a more grand estate.<ref name="Harrison2" /><ref name="Russell2">{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=354.}}</ref> In 1767, Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court "remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain, ...we are building castles, tho' not on earth where one is greatly wanted, but castles in the air."<ref name="Russell2" /> Martin's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among "strange, brutish people... past all conception."<ref name="Russell2" /> For the next thirty years, until Lord Fairfax's death in 1781, Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his "self-exiled" uncle.<ref name="Harrison3" /><ref name="Norris3">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=481.}}</ref> While established at Greenway Court, Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits.

== Political and civic affairs ==
In addition to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking an active role in political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish [[Vestryman|vestrymen]] before June 15 of that year.<ref name="Cartmell6">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=181.}}</ref> Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and Gabriel Jones.<ref name="Cartmell6" /><ref name="Harrison7">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=55.}}</ref> Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish.<ref name="Cartmell6" />

In 1754, upon the creation of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Martin presided as the inaugural justice of the county's court.<ref name="Brannon1">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=3.}}</ref> Under the act establishing the county, the first county court was to have been held in June 1754, however, the first court was not held until December 1757.<ref name="Brannon1" /><ref name="Kercheval3">{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=175.}}</ref> The first court to be held was composed of justices Martin, James Simpson, William Miller, Solomon Hedges, and Nathaniel Kuykendall with [[Gabriel Jones (Virginia)|Gabriel Jones]] serving as the Clerk of Court.<ref name="Kercheval3" /> In 1755, Martin was further appointed as the County Lieutenant of Hampshire County.<ref name="Harrison7" /> Martin was then elected alongside Thomas Walker to the [[House of Burgesses]] representing Hampshire County from 1768 to 1758.<ref name="Tyler1" /><ref name="Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|pp=45<U+2013>47.}}</ref> In 1758, Martin and [[George Washington]] challenged the incumbents and ran for election to represent [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] in the House of Burgesses against Hugh West, and Thomas Swearingen.<ref name="Cartmell2">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=251.}}</ref><ref name="Longmore1">{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=57.}}</ref> Martin and Washington received considerable support from Lord Fairfax, and the leading Anglican cleric in Frederick County, William Meldrum.<ref name="Longmore2">{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=59.}}</ref> Washington received the most votes with 310, followed by Martin with 240 votes, 199 votes for West, and 45 votes for Swearingen.<ref name="Cartmell2" /> Martin and Washington served alongside one another representing Frederick County until 1761.<ref name="Munske2" /><ref name="Cartmell7">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=511.}}</ref> Martin chose not to run for reelection and retired from legislative politics in 1761.<ref name="Longmore3">{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=63.}}</ref>

In September 1758, the Virginia General Assembly appointed Martin as one of the trustees of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].<ref name="Norris5">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=313.}}</ref> Martin was further appointed as a trustee of the town of [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City).<ref name="Cartmell3">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=228.}}</ref> His uncle Lord Fairfax, John Hite, Gabriel Jones, [[Robert Rutherford]], Lewis Stephens, and James Wood were also appointed trustees of the towns alongside Martin.<ref name="Cartmell3" /> When the town of [[Berkeley Springs, West Virginia|Bath]] received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly in October 1776, Martin was appointed as a trustee alongside [[Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Bryan Fairfax]], Philip Pendleton, Robert Rutherford, [[Samuel Washington]], Warner Washington, [[Alexander White (Virginia)|Alexander White]], and others.<ref name="Cartmell9">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=93.}}</ref><ref name="Kercheval4">{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=181.}}</ref>

Martin was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia.<ref name="Tyler1" /><ref name="Norris2">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=484.}}</ref> While Martin was not in best of health, he could be relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources to act promptly during an emergency, especially in response to attacks by Native Americans.<ref name="Russell1">{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=32.}}</ref>

By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County.<ref name="Norris1">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|pp=242<U+2013>243.}}</ref> Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor [[Patrick Henry]], along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term.<ref name="Norris1" /><ref name="Cartmell8">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=231.}}</ref><ref name="Norris4">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=137.}}</ref> Martin did not swear in to the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort.<ref name="Norris1" /> The committee had also been actively arresting [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], which may have influenced Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment.<ref name="Norris4" /> Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court.<ref name="Harrison7" /> Prior to his death, Martin became an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name="Norris5">{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=313.}}</ref>

== American Revolution and Lord Fairfax's death ==
As a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.<ref name="Russell2">{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=354.}}</ref> By 1778, the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit-rents, but in recognition of Lord Fairfax's loyalty, the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception.<ref name="Russell2" /> Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly, and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies, he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen.<ref name="Harrison3" /> Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, his will was recorded on March 5, 1782, and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties, including the Northern Neck Proprietary, to Martin's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin, after which he assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax.<ref name="Cartmell1" /><ref name="Cartmell4">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=133.}}</ref> Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of [[Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].<ref name="Kercheval1">{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=159.}}</ref> Martin was appointed by his uncle, along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog, as an executor of his will and estate.<ref name="Cartmell5">{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=134.}}</ref> Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of {{convert|600|acre|km2}}.<ref name="Cartmell5" /> Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and "all the stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, implements of husbandry household goods and furniture" there.<ref name="Tyler1" /><ref name="Cartmell5" /> Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax's slaves.<ref name="Cartmell5" /> Martin's uncle and Lord Fairfax's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament, and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.<ref name="Cartmell1" />
[[File:Byran-fairfax-00308.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]]]
On account of his residency in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary.<ref name="Cartmell1" /> Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them.<ref name="Norris2" /> The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757.<ref name="Cartmell1" /> In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.<ref name="Cartmell1" />

Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England, he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction, thus he and his British relatives were consider "alien enemies" and his landholdings were confiscated under [[escheat]] laws.<ref name="Munske1" /><ref name="Cartmell4" /> In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref name="Cartmell1" /> Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land.<ref name="Munske1" /> Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value, which Martin noted in 1790 letter.<ref name="Hofstra2">{{Harvnb|Hofstra|1999|p=26.}}</ref> The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: "The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing."<ref name="Hofstra2" />

== Later life and death ==
Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress, and fathered a daughter by her.<ref name="Kercheval1" /> Mrs. Crawford remained Martin's mistress for several years until her death.<ref name="Kercheval1" /> Their daughter married British captain Francis Geldart, however, she died without issue soon after their marriage and Martin gave Geldart {{convert|1000|acres|km2}} of Greenway Court and a number of slaves.<ref name="Kercheval1" /> Following the death of his daughter, Martin employed housekeeper Betsy Powers at Greenway Court.<ref name="Kercheval1" /> Martin died unmarried in 1798, and his will dated July 24, 1794 was proved on October 1, 1798.<ref name="Harrison7" /> In it, he bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} to his housekeeper Betsy Powers.<ref name="Harrison7" /><ref name="Kercheval1" /> Powers also inherited "all houses thereon, household goods (except plate and watch), one half of stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs and choice of ten slaves."<ref name="Harrison7" /><ref name="Kercheval1" /> Martin's living sisters Frances, Sybilla, and Anna Susanna Martin received "all moneys, and remainder of personal property" not bequeathed to Powers.<ref name="Harrison7" /> Each of the executors of Martin's will received ten guineas.<ref name="Harrison7" /> Martin bequeathed the remainder of his property and the {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of Greenway Court, should Powers have predeceased him, to his will executors Gabriel Jones, Robert Mackey, and John Sherman Woodcock to divide into parcels and sell, the profits from which were to be given to Martin's sisters.<ref name="Kercheval2">{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=160.}}</ref><ref name="Harrison8">{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|pp=55<U+2013>56.}}</ref> Powers also received a chariot, harness, and {{convert|160|acres|km2}} in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] near [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]].<ref name="Harrison8" /> Following Martin's death, Powers married W. Carnagy.<ref name="Kercheval1" />

Due to his advanced age and his inability to relocate to America, Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30, 1797 to [[James Markham Marshall]] "all and every of those divers tracts, pieces and parcels of land, being part and parcel of the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va., with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be."<ref name="Cartmell4" /> This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families' interest in the proprietary.<ref name="Harrison5" /> In 1799, the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax's remaining landholdings.<ref name="Cartmell5" /> The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its legal owner.<ref name="Munske1" /> 

The legality of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands continued to be contested in state and federal courts long after Denny Martin Fairfax's death in 1800. The [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia Supreme Court]] upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the [[Jay Treaty]] with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] did not address the disputed proprietary.<ref name="Justia1">{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/11/603/ |title=Fairfax's Devisee v.
