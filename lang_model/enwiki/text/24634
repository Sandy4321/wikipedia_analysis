Written by [[Michael Schur]], and directed by [[Paul Feig]], the episode first aired in the [[United States]] on [[October 4]], [[2005]] on the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC).

==Synopsis==
While [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carrell]]) leaves with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to sign closing papers for his new condominium, the staff fills out their expense reports. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) "dies" of boredom, and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) revives him by calling him to the reception desk and throwing objects into Dwight's coffee mug. Jim discovers that his fellow coworkers have their own office games, and he and Pam organize the ''Games of the First Dunder-Mifflin Olympiad'', competing for medals made of yogurt lids and paper clips.

Dwight finds a variety of things wrong with the condominium, and Michael gets [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] but relents when he learns that backing out of the deal will cost him a substantial amount of money.

A coffee cup race quickly dissolves when Michael and Dwight return, and the office returns to normal. Undeterred, Jim and Pam organize the "closing ceremonies", awarding Michael the gold medal for closing on his condo. Michael feels touched by this and thanks everyone for the honour.

==Production==
This episode was the first episode of the series directed by [[Paul Feig]]. Feig had previously directed episodes of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' and ''[[Undeclared]]''. "Office Olympics" was written by [[Michael Schur]].

Producer [[Greg Daniels]] said they had Office Olympics in offices for ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (for which he is also executive producer), stating "Like, who<U+2019>s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. The funny thing is then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices are doing it all over."<ref name="Ryan">{{cite web |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/02/office_workers_.html |title='Office' promotions pay off in a big way |accessdate=2008-07-29 |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |coauthors= |date=2006-02-23 |work= |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> When choosing Michael's car for the episode, producer Kent Zbornak brought in pictures of various cars and had the writers choose which one they thought Michael would most likely own. The writers ended up choosing a [[Sebring]] convertible, because according to [[B. J. Novak]] "we figured it's the showiest car that he could afford". While shooting the scene in Michael';s car, cameraman [[Randall Einhorn]] accidently broke the back window, which ended up costing $859 to replace.<ref name="Novak">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting={1A623B2B-5407-4341-B5F0-7B84E654B4D9} |title=Michael and Co.

His only criticism of the episde was that "Dwight is too creepy", Sciannamea suggested that the writers "tone down his insanity a bit".<ref name="Sciannamea">{{cite web |url= http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/10/04/the-office-office-olympics/ |title= ''The Office'': "Office Olympics" |accessdate=2008-07-28 |last=Sciannamea |first=Michael |coauthors= |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=[[TV Squad]]}}</ref> "Miss Alli" of ''TelevisionWithoutPity.com'' graded the episode with a "A-".<ref name="Alli">{{cite web |url= http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the_office/the_client.php |title= "OFFICE OLYMPICS" |accessdate=2008-07-29 |last= |first=Alli |coauthors= |date=2005-10-04 |work= |publisher=TelevisionWithoutPity.com}}</ref> In a poll done by ''Office'' fansite OfficeTally.com, viewers ranked "Office Olympics" as the ninth most popular episode out of the twenty-two episodes of season two.<ref name="OfficeSurvivor">{{cite web |url=http://www.officetally.com/?p=1433&cp=35 |title=OfficeTally Survivor Poll: Season 2 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |last=Tan |first=Jennie |work= |publisher=OfficeTally |date= }}</ref>
