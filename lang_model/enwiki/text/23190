The '''Pat Metheny Group''' is a [[jazz]] [[jazz fusion|fusion]] band founded in [[1977 in music|1977]].  The core members of the group are [[guitarist]] and [[bandleader]] [[Pat Metheny]], composer, [[keyboardist]] and [[pianist]] [[Lyle Mays]] (who was part of the group's inception in 1977), and [[bassist]] and producer [[Steve Rodby]] (joined in 1980). Other long-standing members include [[Paul Wertico]] who was the drummer for 18 years.

==History==
===1970s===
[[Image:Pmg - pmg.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Pat Metheny Group (album)|Pat Metheny Group (album)]] ([[1978]]), the band's first release.]]
Founder Pat Metheny first appeared on the jazz fusion scene in the mid-1970s with a pair of solo albums; the latter of these, 1977's ''[[Watercolors (album)|Watercolors]]'', featured keyboard player [[Lyle Mays]]. Metheny's follow-up album formalized the relationship, and featured several songs co-written with Mays; the album was released as the self-titled ''Pat Metheny Group'' on the ECM label. The second group album, ''American Garage'' (1980), was a breakout hit, reaching #1 on the Billboard Jazz chart and crossing over onto the pop charts as well, largely on the strength of the up-tempo opening track "(Cross the) Heartland" which would become an early signature tune for the group. This first incarnation of the group included [[Danny Gottleib]] (drums) and [[Mark Egan]] (bass). The group built upon its success through lengthy tours in the USA and Europe. The early group featured a unique sound, particularly due to Metheny's [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson ES-175|ES-175]] guitar and Mays' Oberheim synthesizer and Yamaha Organ. Even in this early state the band played in a wide range of styles from experimental to grassroots. Later on, Metheny began working with the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GR300 guitar synthesizer and the [[Synclavier|Synclavier System]] made by [[New England Digital]], while Mays expanded his setup with the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet 5|Prophet 5]] synthesizer made by [[Sequential Circuits]], and later with many other synthesizers.

===1980s===
[[Image:Pmg - travels.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Travels (album)|Travels]] ([[1983]]) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance]] in 1984]]
From 1982 to 1985 the Pat Metheny Group released ''Offramp'' (1982), a live set ''Travels'' (1983), and ''First Circle'' (1984) as well as [[The Falcon and the Snowman]] (1985) a soundtrack album for the movie of the same name.  The latter featured the song [[This Is Not America]], a collaboration with [[David Bowie]].  ''Offramp'' marked the first recorded appearance of bassist Steve Rodby in the group (replacing Mark Egan), and also featured Brazilian "guest artist" Nana Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos had appeared on the [[Pat Metheny]]/[[Lyle Mays]] album ''As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls'', and his work on percussion and wordless vocals marked the first addition of Latin music shadings to the Group's sound. ''Offramp'' was also the group's first recording to win a Grammy award, marking the start of more-or-less unbroken series of wins <ref>[http://www.patmethenygroup.com/press_kit/pat_metheny_group/awards.cfm]</ref> for the group, up to and including their latest release ''The Way Up'', which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album]]. The Latin influence would continue and intensify on ''First Circle'' with the addition of Argentinian multi-instrumentalist [[Pedro Aznar]]. ''First Circle'' also marked the group debut of drummer Paul Wertico (replacing Danny Gottlieb).  This period saw the commercial popularity of the band increase, especially thanks to the live recording ''Travels''. ''First Circle'' would also be Metheny's last project with the ECM label; Metheny had been a key artist for ECM but left over conceptual disagreements with label founder [[Manfred Eicher]].

Then next three Pat Metheny Group releases would be based around a further intensification of the Brazilian rhythms first heard in the early '80s. Additional Latin musicians appear as guests, notably Brazilian percussion player Armando Marcal. ''Still Life (Talking)'', (1987) was the Group's first release on new label ([[Geffen Records]]), and featured several tracks which have long been popular with the group's followers, and which are still in their setlist. In particular, the album's first tune, "Minuano (Six Eight)", represents a good example of the Pat Metheny group compositional style from this period: the track starts with a haunting minor section from Mays, lifts off in a typical Methenian jubilant major melody, leading to a Maysian metric and harmonically-modulated interlude, creating suspense which is finally resolved in the Methenian major theme. Another popular highlight was "Last Train Home", a rhythmically relentless piece evoking the American Midwest. The 1989 release ''Letter From Home'' continued this approach, with the Latin influence becoming even more prevalent in its bossa nova and samba rhythms.

===1990s===
[[Image:PMG - We Live Here.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[We live here]] ([[1995]])]]
Metheny then again delved into adventurous solo and band projects, and four years went by before the release of the next record for the next Pat Metheny Group. This was a live set recorded in Europe entitled ''The Road to You'', and it featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums alongside new tunes. By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays' addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a pedal control.

Mays and Metheny refer to the following three Pat Metheny Group releases as the triptych: ''We Live Here'' (1995), ''Quartet'' (1996), and ''Imaginary Day'' (1997).  Moving away from the Latin style which had dominated the releases of the previous deacde, these albums were the most wide-ranging and least commercial Group releases, including experimentations with hip-hop drum loops, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues and sonata schemes.

===2000s===
[[Image:Pmg - way up.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[The Way Up]] ([[2005]]), the band most recent release]]
After another hiatus, the Pat Metheny Group re-emerged in [[2002]] with the release ''Speaking of Now'', marking another change in direction through the addition of younger musicians. Joining the core players (Metheny, Mays and Rodby), were drummer Antonio Sanchez from Mexico City, Vietnamese trumpet player [[Cuong Vu]] and bassist, vocalist, guitarist, and percussionist [[Richard Bona]] from [[Cameroon]].  

Following the group's 2003 tour, Bona left to concentrate on his solo career, but appeared as one of two guest artists (the other being mallet cymbalist Dave Samuels) on the group's latest release, [[2005]]'s ''The Way Up'', together with a new group member: Swiss/American harmonica player Gr<U+00E9>goire Maret. ''The Way Up'' is a large-scale concept record which consists of a single 68 minute-long piece (split into four sections only for CD navigation). Metheny has said [http://www.patmethenygroup.com/press_kit/pat_metheny_group/current.cfm] that one of the inspirations for the labyrinthine piece was a reaction against a perceived trend for music requiring a short attention span and which lacks nuance and detail. Many of the textures in ''The Way Up'' are created from interlocking guitar lines ([[Steve Reich]] is credited on the CD as an inspiration, along with [[Eberhard Weber]]), and there are large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. On the group's 2005 tour (when its lineup was supplemented by Brazilian multiinstrumentalist Nando Lauria), ''The Way Up'' was played in its entirety as the first half of the concert. The final performance of the piece was at a free show for more than a hundred thousand people at the close of the 2005 [[Montreal Jazz Festival]].

''The Way Up'' was released through [[Nonesuch Records]].  It is planned that all of Metheny's Geffen and Warner Brothers records are to be rereleased on the label.
