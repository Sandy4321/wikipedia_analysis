:''You may be looking for [[titulus (inscription)]].''

In Christian archeology, a '''titulus''' is one of a set number of [[churches of Rome#Ancient churches|Early Christian churches]] (collectively known as "the '''tituli'''") built round the edges of the city of [[Rome]], which were ascribed to patrons, whose names often identified them: 
::::"they received the name tituli, from the name of the founder <br>or proprietor who held the property in custody for the Church".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14745b.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1908:]</ref> 

The most ancient text which alludes to a ''titulus'' of this kind is the [[fourth century]] defense of [[Athanasius]] against the [[Arian]]s. By the end of the [[fifth century]] the'' [[Liber Pontificalis]]'' recognized 25 ''tituli''. Three more were added in the [[twelfth century]].

In Roman Catholicism, the holder of one of these churches is a '''"[[titular (Catholicism)|titular]]"'''.  Such holders were initially by tradition native-born Romans (of high social standing). The first church in Rome to have a non-Italian titular was [[Santi Quattro Coronati]]: Dietrich of [[Trier]] was appointed titular in [[975]] by [[Pope Benedict VII]]. That [[basilica]] was originally ''Titulus [[Aemilius|Aemilianae]]'', drawing its name in characteristic fashion from its  foundress, who doubtless owned the extensive suburban [[Roman villa]] whose foundations remain under the church and whose audience hall became the ecclesiastical [[basilica]].    

Today, each member of the [[College of Cardinals]] in the order of cardinal-presbyter is appointed a titular church. The Cardinalate developed from the senior clergy in and around the Diocese of Rome (the seven bishops of suburban towns, the fourteen deacons of the diocese, and the priests/presbyters of Roman parishes). As the college was internationalized, each cardinal was given a ''titulus'', making him an honorary member of the Roman clergy. Today, the cardinal-presbyters have a loose patronal relationship with their titular churches (their names and coats of arms are inscribed on a plaque in the church, and many raise funds for their churches' maintenance and restoration), but they no longer participate in the actual management of the parish. (Likewise, the cardinal-bishops are given honorary title to one of the suburbicarian dioceses, and the cardinal-deacons, today much more than fourteen in number, are given a similar relationship to churches as their deaconries.)
