'''Stephen Edwin King''' (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]], [[suspense]], [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[fiction]]. His books have sold more than 350 million copies<ref>Morgan, Robert. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/programmes/newsnight/6174256.stm Stephen King], ''[[Newsnight]]'', [[BBC]], 22 November, 2006</ref> and have been made into many movies. He is known for novels such as ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', ''[[The Stand]]'', ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', and the seven-novel series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', which King wrote over a period of 27 years. As of 2010, King has written and published 49 novels, including seven under the [[pen name]] [[Richard Bachman]], five [[non-fiction]] books, and nine collections of [[short story|short stories]] including ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', ''[[Skeleton Crew]]'', and ''[[Everything's Eventual]]''. Many of his stories are set in his homestate of [[Maine]]. He has collaborated with authors [[Peter Straub]] and [[Stewart O'Nan]]. Some of his novels have been also been turned into comic books, such are ''[[The Stand (comics)|The Stand]]'', ''[[The Talisman (comics)|The Talisman]]'', and ''[[The Dark Tower (comics)|The Dark Tower]]'' series.

King has received many awards, including several [[Bram Stoker Award]]s, [[Locus Award]]s, and, in 2003, the [[National Book Foundation]] awarded him the [[National Book Award|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]].<ref name=natbook>http://www.nationalbook.org/amerletters.html The National Book Foundation's Medal for
Distinguished Contribution to American Letters award page</ref>

King and his wife, [[Tabitha King|Tabitha]], have three children, [[Naomi King|Naomi]], [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe]] and [[Owen King|Owen]]. Tabitha, Joe and Owen are also published writers.

==Early life and background==
King's father, Donald Edwin King, who was born ca. 1913 in [[Peru, Indiana]], was a merchant seaman.<ref name="genealogy">[http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/stephen-king/d0/i0000002.htm Ancestry of Stephen King] at Geneaology.com. Retrieved August 3, 2010.</ref> King's mother, Nellie Ruth (n<U+00E9>e Pillsbury; March 13, 1913 - December 28, 1973) was born in [[Scarborough, Maine]].<ref name="genealogy" /> They were married July 23, 1939 in [[Cumberland County, Maine]].<ref name="genealogy" />

Stephen King was born September 21, 1947 in [[Portland, Maine]]. When King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of "going to buy a pack of cigarettes," leaving his mother to raise King and his adopted older brother David by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to [[De Pere, Wisconsin]]; [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]; and [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. When King was eleven years old, the family returned to [[Durham, Maine]], where Ruth King cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a [[caregiver]] in a local residential facility for the [[mentally challenged]].<ref name=stephenking.com_bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/biography.php |title=Stephen King.com: Biography |accessdate=2008-03-04 |last=King |first=Tabitha |coauthors=Marsha DeFilippo }}</ref>

As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,<ref>Beahm, George ''The Stephen King Story: A Literary Profile'' Andrews and McMeel. 1991. ISBN 0-8362-7989-1 : pp.101</ref> but King himself has dismissed the idea.<ref name=KingOnWriting>{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | authorlink = | title =On Writing | publisher =Scribner | year =2000 | location = | pages = | isbn = 0684853523}}</ref>

King's primary inspiration for writing horror fiction was related in detail in his 1981 non-fiction ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'', in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause". King makes a comparison of his uncle successfully [[dowsing]] for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. While browsing through an attic with his elder brother, King uncovered a paperback version of an [[H. P. Lovecraft]] collection of short stories that had belonged to his father. The cover art<U+2014>an illustration of a yellow-green Demon hiding within the recesses of a Hellish cavern beneath a tombstone<U+2014>was, he writes,
<blockquote>
"The moment of my life when the dowsing rod suddenly went down hard... as far as I was concerned, I was on my way."
</blockquote>

==Education and early creativity==
King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from [[Lisbon Falls High School]] in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of [[EC Comics|EC's horror comics]], including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for ''[[Creepshow]]''). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to ''Dave's Rag'', the newspaper that his brother published with a [[mimeograph machine]] and later began selling stories to his friends which were based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber", serialized over three published and one unpublished issue of a fanzine, ''Comics Review'', in 1965.<ref>Wood, Rocky et al. 'Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished Abingdon, Maryland 2006 ISBN 1-58767-130-1</ref> That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, ''Stories of Suspense'', edited by Marv Wolfman.<ref>Private Research by Rocky Wood confirmed by a copy of the original publication secured in 2008</ref>

From 1966, King studied English at the [[University of Maine]], graduating in 1970 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in English. That same year his first daughter, Naomi Rachel, was born. He wrote a column for the student newspaper, ''[[The Maine Campus]]'', titled "Steve King's Garbage Truck", took part in a writing workshop organized by [[Burton Hatlen]],<ref name=bn>{{Cite news|first=Alicia |last=Anstead |title=UM scholar Hatlen, mentor to Stephen King, dies at 71 |url=http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&zoneid=176 |work= [[Bangor Daily News]] |publisher=|date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2008-03-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080302041533/http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&zoneid=176 |archivedate = March 2, 2008}}</ref> and took odd jobs to pay for his studies, including one at an industrial laundry. He sold his first professional short story, "The Glass Floor", to ''Startling Mystery Stories'' in 1967.<ref name=stephenking.com_bio/> The [[University of Maine#Academics|Fogler Library at UMaine]] now holds many of King's papers.

After leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, being unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]] such as ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''. Many of these early stories have been published in the collection ''Night Shift''. In 1971, King married [[Tabitha King|Tabitha Spruce]], a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops.<ref name="bn"/> That fall, King was hired as a teacher at [[Hampden Academy]] in [[Hampden, Maine]]. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.<ref name=stephenking.com_bio/> It was during this time that King developed a drinking problem, which stayed with him for more than a decade.

In 1972, Joseph Hillstrom, his second child was born.

==Success with ''Carrie''==
On Mother's Day, 1973, King's novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' was accepted by publishing house [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].  King actually threw an early draft of the novel in the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers.  His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it.<ref>{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | authorlink = | title =On Writing | publisher =Scribner | year =2000 | location = | pages =76<U+2013>77 | isbn = 0684853523}}</ref>  His advance for ''Carrie'' was $2,500, with paperback rights earning $400,000 at a later date.  King and his family relocated to southern [[Maine]] because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled ''Second Coming'', later titled ''Jerusalem's Lot'', before finally changing the title to ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' (published 1975). Soon after the release of ''Carrie'' in 1974, his mother died of [[uterine cancer]]. His Aunt Emrine read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.<ref name=KingOnWriting/>

After his mother's death, King and his family had moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where King wrote ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' (published 1977). The family returned to western [[Maine]] in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, ''[[The Stand]]'' (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to [[Maine]] that fall where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. King has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since.

==''The Dark Tower'' books==
{{Main|The Dark Tower (series)}}
[[File:StephenKingGFDL.PNG|thumb|Stephen King at the [[Harvard Book Store]]]]
In the late 1970s, King began a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the "Man in Black" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and the American [[wild west]] as depicted by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sergio Leone]] in their [[spaghetti western]]s. The first of these, ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', was first published in five installments by ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' under the editorship of [[Edward L. Ferman]], beginning in 1977 and the last in 1981. The Gunslinger would be continued as a large 7-book epic called [[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]],  which would be written and published infrequently over four decades, from the 1970s to the 2000s.

In 1982, the fantasy small-press [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc.|Donald M. Grant]] (known for publishing the entire canon of [[Robert E. Howard]]) printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and black-and-white illustrations by then up-and-coming fantasy artist [[Michael Whelan]], as ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. Each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form. King dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at ''F&SF'', Ed Ferman, who "took a chance on these stories". The original print-run was only 10,000 copies, which was, by this time, a comparatively low run for a first printing of a King novel in hardcover. His 1980 novel, ''[[Firestarter]]'', had an initial print-run in trade hardcover at 100,000 copies, and his 1983 novel, ''[[Christine (novel)|Christine]]'', had a trade hardcover print-run of 250,000 copies, both by the much larger publisher Viking. ''The Gunslinger'''s initial release was not highly publicized, and only specialty science-fiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves. The book was generally not available in the larger chain stores, except by special order. Rumors spread among avid fans that there was a King book out that few readers knew about, let alone had actually read. When the initial 10,000 copies sold out, Grant printed another 10,000 copies in 1984, but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book. ''The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger'' was the beginning of his magnum opus fantasy epic. Both the first and second printings of ''The Gunslinger'' garner premium prices on the collectible book market, notably among avid readers and collectors of Stephen King, horror literature, fantasy literature, and even American western literature. And it is also desirable among avid fans of the artwork of Michael Whelan.

In 1987, King released the second installment, ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three]]'', in which Roland draws three people from 20th-century United States into his world through magical doors. Grant published ''The Drawing of the Three'' with illustrations by [[Phil Hale]] in a slightly larger run of 30,000 copies, which was still well below King's typical initial hardcover print-run of a new book. (''[[It (novel)|It]]'', published in 1986, had an initial print-run of 1,000,000 copies, King's largest to date.) King had believed that the Dark Tower books would only be of interest to a select group of his fans, and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale. Finally, in the late 1980s, bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were hungry for the books (at this point fewer than 50,000 of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the Dark Tower books), King agreed to release ''The Gunslinger'' and all subsequent Dark Tower books in trade paperback and mass market formats. The series reached seven books, with the final installment called ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower]]'', in 2004.

In the early 2000s King revised the original book, ''The Gunslinger'', because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late 1970s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of 2004. King felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening 27 years. The revised version was published in 2003 by his former hardcover publisher Viking. Grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of ''The Gunslinger'' along with a prequel story set in the Dark Tower world called "[[The Little Sisters of Eluria]]" (from King's short story collection ''[[Everything's Eventual]]'') in 2009.

On November 10, 2009, King announced he was writing a new Dark Tower novel titled ''[[The Wind Through the Keyhole]]''. King stated it will take place between the fourth and fifth installments.<ref>[http://blogs.usaweekend.com/whos_news/2009/03/stephen-king-no.html USA WEEKEND Who's News Blog]</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}

===Adaptations===
In October 2005, King signed a deal with [[Marvel Comics]] to publish a seven-issue, [[miniseries]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|''The Dark Tower'' series]]'' called ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born|The Gunslinger Born]]''. The series, which focuses on a young [[Roland Deschain]], is plotted by Robin Furth, with dialogue by [[Peter David]], and illustrated by [[Eisner Award]]-winning artist [[Jae Lee]]. The first issue was published on February 7, 2007, and King, David, Lee and Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] appeared at a midnight signing at a [[Times Square]], New York comic book store to promote it.<ref>{{cite web|last=David |first=Peter |url=http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005156.html |title=Peter David discusses the signing on his blog |publisher=Peterdavid.malibulist.com |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hauman |first=Glenn |url=http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005169.html |title=Another blog entry of the signing with photos and links to interviews |publisher=Peterdavid.malibulist.com |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> The work had sold over 200,000 copies by March 2007.<ref>[http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ap/20070310/117359580000.html Stephen King Ventures Into Comic Books]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>  The success of ''The Gunslinger Born'' led to a ongoing series of miniseries published by Marvel, with Furth and David continuing to collaborate, featuring both adapted material from the ''Dark Tower'' books and new material approved by King; it also led to a second series of King adaptations in the same format, serializing the events of ''[[The Stand]]''.

Although ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced in February 2007 that plans were underway for ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' co-creator [[J. J. Abrams]] to do an adaptation of King's epic ''Dark Tower'' series,<ref name=JoBlo/> Abrams stated in a November 2009 interview with [[MTV]] that he would not be adapting the series.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.cinematical.com/2009/11/10/j-j-abrams-not-adapting-kings-dark-tower-series/ | title = J.J.

==Richard Bachman==
{{Main|Richard Bachman}}
In the late 1970s-early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels<U+2014>''[[Rage (novel)|Rage]]'' (1977), ''[[The Long Walk]]'' (1979), ''[[Roadwork]]'' (1981), ''[[The Running Man]]'' (1982) and ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]'' (1984)<U+2014>under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was largely an experiment to measure for himself whether or not he could replicate his own success again, and allay at least part of the notion within his mind that popularity might all be just an accident of fate. An alternate (or additional) explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php
|title=Stephen King FAQ: "Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?"|author=King, Stephen|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061115014750/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = November 15, 2006}}</ref>

Richard Bachman was exposed as being King's pseudonym after a persistent Washington D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noticed similarities between the two's works and later located publisher's records at the [[Library of Congress]] naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.<ref>Brown, Steve. [http://www.liljas-library.com/bachman_exposed.php/ 'Richard Bachman Exposed']. Lilja's Library: The World of Stephen King. Retrieved December 27, 2008.</ref> This led to a press release heralding Bachman's "death" <U+2014> supposedly from "cancer of the pseudonym".<ref>[http://books.simonandschuster.com/9781416548584  'Blaze - Book Summary']. Simon & Schuster. Retrieved January 10, 2009.</ref> King dedicated his 1989 book ''[[The Dark Half]]'', about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to "the deceased Richard Bachman", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel ''[[Desperation]]'' was released, the companion novel ''[[The Regulators]]'' carried the "Bachman" byline.

In 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]''. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the manuscript had been held at King's [[alma mater]], the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King completely rewrote the 1973 manuscript for its publication.

==Car accident and thoughts of retirement==
In the summer of 1999, King had finished the memoir section of ''[[On Writing|On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', but had abandoned the book for nearly eighteen months, unsure of how or whether to proceed.

On June 19, at about 4:30 p.m., he was reading a book and walking on the shoulder of Route 5, in [[Lovell, Maine]]. Driver Bryan Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan,<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9906/21/stephen.king.03/ Stephen King cracking jokes following surgery - June 21, 1999]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet from the pavement of Route 5.<ref name=KingOnWriting/> According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was struck from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding or reckless.<ref>[http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html Liljas-library homepage]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center, in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]. His injuries<U+2014>a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip<U+2014>kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered doctors initially considered amputating it, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an [[external fixator]].<ref>Rogak, Lisa. [http://books.google.com/books?id=c8EIvHkg4EYC&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=rogak+haunted+heart+amputation&source=bl&ots=XT-78FTTqJ&sig=H_PZFVst16x9biU0J8Hb-a0WlSY&hl=en&ei=NQ-hTNXICo6-sAPF8bHWAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Haunted heart: The Life and Times of Stephen King''] at [[Google Books]]. Retrieved September 27, 2010.</ref> After five operations in ten days and [[physical therapy]], King resumed work on ''On Writing'' in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could only sit for about forty minutes before the pain became worse. Soon it became nearly unbearable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on [[eBay]]. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he dreamed of beating it with a baseball bat. King later mentioned during an interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'s'' [[Terry Gross]] that he wanted to completely destroy the vehicle himself with a pickaxe.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1124785 "Novelist Stephen King"] ''Fresh Air''; [[NPR]] June 22, 2001</ref>

Two years later, King suffered severe pneumonia as a direct result of his lung being punctured in the accident. During this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==2000s work==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
In 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his website that:
<blockquote>
"I'm writing but I'm writing at a much slower pace than previously and I think that if I come up with something really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |title=Stephen King.com: The Official FAQ: Is it true that you have retired? |accessdate=2008-03-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013010729/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2000, King published a serialized novel, ''[[The Plant]]'', [[Internet|online]], bypassing print publication. At first it was presumed by the public that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but he later stated that he had simply run out of stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/features/00/11/30/1238204.shtml |title=Stephen King's Net Horror Story |publisher=Slashdot |date=2000-12-04 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> The unfinished [[epistolary novel]] is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, ''[[Riding the Bullet]]'', and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market "probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012."

In August 2003 King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', usually every third week. The column is called "The Pop of King", a play on the nickname "The King of Pop" commonly given to [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=King |first=Stephen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472359,00.html |title=The Pop of King: The Tao of Steve |publisher=Ew.com |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

In 2006, King published an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic novel]] ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]''.

In 2008, King published both a novel, ''[[Duma Key]]'', and a collection, ''[[Just After Sunset]]''. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, ''[[N.]]'', which was later released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.

In 2009, King published ''[[Ur (novella)|Ur]]'', a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation [[Amazon Kindle]] and available only on [[Amazon.com]], and ''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'', a novella co-written with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], which later was released as an [[audiobook]] ''[[Road Rage (audiobook)|Road Rage]]'', which included [[Richard Matheson]]'s short story "[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]".

On November 10, 2009, King novel, ''[[Under the Dome]]'', was published. It is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since 1986's ''[[It (novel)|It]]''. It debuted at #1 in [[The New York Times Bestseller List]], and #3 in UK Book Charts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On February 16, 2010, King announced on his website that his next book will be a collection of four previously unpublished [[novella]]s. The book will be called ''[[Full Dark, No Stars]]''.

In April 2010, King published ''[[Blockade Billy]]'', an original novella issued first by independent small press [[Cemetery Dance Publications]] and later released in mass market paperback by [[Simon & Schuster]]. This baseball-related suspense novella is not set to be reprinted in ''Full Dark, No Stars''.

===Writing style===
King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer." He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented."<ref>''Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully<U+2014>in Ten Minutes''</ref>

Shortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'' with a notebook and a [[Waterman pens|Waterman]] [[fountain pen]], which he called "the world's finest word processor."<ref>{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | authorlink = | title =Dreamcatcher | publisher =Scribner | year =2001 | location = | pages = | isbn = 0743211383}}</ref>

When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple<U+2014>there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php | title = Stephen King's official site | accessdate = 2007-05-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070509175239/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question "Why do you assume I have a choice?"<ref>{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | authorlink = | title =Night Shift | publisher =Doubleday | year =1976 | location =xii | page =336 | isbn =}}</ref>

King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of [[fictional book]]s in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' and Jack Torrance in ''The Shining''. See also [[List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King]] for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for ''[[Fangoria]]''.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html Stephen King writes for FANGORIA!]</ref>

===Influences===
King has called [[Richard Matheson]] "the author who influenced me most as a writer."<ref name="KingOnWriting"/> Both authors casually integrate characters' thoughts into the third person narration, just one of several parallels between their writing styles. In a current edition of Matheson's ''[[The Shrinking Man]]'', King is quoted: "A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story<U+2014>it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading."

King refers to [[H. P. Lovecraft]] several times in ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]''. "[[Gramma (short story)|Gramma]]", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show ''[[The New Twilight Zone]]'', mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation ''[[Necronomicon]]'', also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. "[[I Know What You Need]]" from the 1976 collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', and ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' also mention the tome. In ''[[On Writing]]'', King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from ''[[The Colour Out of Space]]'' as particularly poor examples. There are also several examples of King referring to [[Lovecraftian]] characters in his work, such as [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Yog-Sothoth]].

King acknowledges the influence of [[Bram Stoker]], particularly on his novel '''Salem's Lot'', which he envisioned as a retelling of ''[[Dracula]]''.<ref>[http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/salems_lot/ StephenKing.com: 'Salems Lot]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> Its related short story "Jerusalem's Lot", is reminiscent of Stoker's ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]''.

King has also referenced author [[Shirley Jackson]]. '''Salem's Lot'' opens with a quotation from Jackson's ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'', and a character in ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' references the Jackson book ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]''.

King is a fan of [[John D. MacDonald]], and dedicated the novella "Sun Dog" to MacDonald, saying "I miss you, old friend." For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to ''Night Shift'', and even had his famous character, [[Travis McGee]], reading ''Cujo'' in one of the last McGee novels and ''Pet Sematary'' in the last McGee novel, ''The Lonely Silver Rain.''

In 1987 King's [[Philtrum Press]] published [[Don Robertson (author)|Don Robertson]]'s novel, ''The Ideal, Genuine Man''. In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, "Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald)."<ref>{{Cite book| last = Robertson | first = Don | authorlink = Don Robertson (author) | coauthors = | title = The Ideal, Genuine Man | publisher = Philtrum Press | year = 1987 | location = Bangor, ME | pages = viiI | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | nopp = true }}</ref>

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' is repeatedly mentioned in King's ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''.

In an interview with King, Published in the ''[[USA Weekend]]'' in March, 2009, the author stated, "People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. [[Elmore Leonard]], every day I wake up and <U+2013> not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree <U+2013> don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, "Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read." Because when he's gone, there's nobody else."<ref>"Exclusive: Stephen King on J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer"</ref>

King  partly dedicated his book ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' to [[film director]] [[George Romero]], and wrote an essay for the Elite [[DVD]] version of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.

===Collaborations===
King has written two novels with acclaimed horror novelist [[Peter Straub]]: ''[[The Talisman (King & Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'' and a sequel, ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]''. King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no time line for its completion.

King also wrote the nonfiction book, ''[[Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season|Faithful]]'' with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic [[Stewart O'Nan]].

In 1996 King collaborated with [[Michael Jackson]] to create ''[[Ghosts (1997 film)|Ghosts]]'', a 40-minute musical video in which the singer portrays a recluse living in a mansion confronting an unwelcoming group of townsfolk initially calling for his exodus from their community.

"Throttle", a novella written in collaboration with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], appears in the anthology ''He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson'', (Gauntlet Press, 2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gauntletpress.com/cgi-bin/gauntletpress/perlshop.cgi?ACTION=template&thispage=HeisLegend&ORDER_ID=251390396 |title=Gauntlet Press website, forth coming titles |publisher=Gauntletpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red]]'', was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries ''[[Rose Red (film)|Rose Red]]''. The book was published under anonymous authorship, and written by Ridley Pearson. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King.

King has written a musical play with [[John Mellencamp]] titled ''[[Ghost Brothers of Darkland County]]''.

King played guitar for the rock band [[Rock-Bottom Remainders]], several of whose members are authors. Other members include [[Dave Barry]], [[Ridley Pearson]], [[Scott Turow]], [[Amy Tan]], [[James McBride (musician)|James McBride]], [[Mitch Albom]], [[Roy Blount, Jr.]], [[Matt Groening]], Kathi Kamen Goldmark, [[Sam Barry (Author)|Sam Barry]], and [[Greg Iles]]. None of them claim to have any musical talent. King is a fan of the rock band [[AC/DC]], who did the soundtrack for his 1986 film, ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]''. He is also a fan of [[The Ramones]], who wrote the title song for ''[[Pet Sematary (film)|Pet Sematary]]'' and appeared in the music video. King referred to the band several times in various novels and stories and The Ramones referenced King on the song "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", which is on 1981's ''[[Pleasant Dreams]]''. In addition he wrote the liner notes for their tribute album ''[[We're a Happy Family]].'' In 1988, the band [[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult]] recorded an updated version of their 1974 song [[Astronomy (song)|"Astronomy"]]. The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King.<ref name = "BOC">{{cite web| title =  Complete Blue Oyster Cult Discography | url = http://www.blueoystercult.com/Studio/BOC_Discography.pdf | author = Bolle Gregmar | publisher = Blue Oyster Cult | accessdate = 2008-07-14|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071128155309/http://www.blueoystercult.com/Studio/BOC_Discography.pdf |archivedate = November 28, 2007}}</ref>

On Sunday, October 25, 2009 the [[DC Comics]] [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] blog news feed released that King will team up with short story writer [[Scott Snyder]] and artist [[Rafael Albuquerque]] in a new monthly comic book series from Vertigo in March 2010 called ''[[American Vampire]]''.<ref name="Mullin251020009" />  King is to write the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the five issues of the first arc. Scott Snyder will write the story of Pearl. Both stories are to weave together to form the first story arc.

In 2010, King collaborated with musician [[Shooter Jennings]] and his band [[Hierophant]], providing the narration for their most recent album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]''.

===Films and TV===
{{Main|Media based on Stephen King works}}
Many of King's novels and short stories have been made into major motion pictures or TV movies and miniseries.

King has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', and ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXRuWx-mkTc&feature=related Matt Lauer interview of King] on ''[[The Today Show]]''; [[YouTube]]; 8 February 2008</ref>

King's first film appearance was in George Romero's ''Knightriders'' as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in ''[[Creepshow]]'', playing Jordy Verrill, a backwoods redneck who, after touching a fallen meteor in hopes of selling it, grows moss all over his body. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in ''[[Pet Sematary (film)|Pet Sematary]]'' as a minister at a funeral, in ''[[Rose Red (film)|Rose Red]]'' as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in ''The Storm of the Century'', in ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' as "Teddy Wieszack," in the ''[[The Shining (TV miniseries)|Shining]]'' miniseries as a band member, in ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]'' as Tom Holby and in ''[[Sleepwalkers (film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' as the cemetery caretaker. He has also appeared in ''The Golden Years'', in ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' and, along with fellow author [[Amy Tan]], on ''[[Insane Clown Poppy|The Simpsons]]'' as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using an ATM that is on the fritz.

King produced and acted in a miniseries, ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]'', which is based on the Danish miniseries ''[[Riget]]'' by [[Lars von Trier]]. He also co-wrote ''[[The X-Files]]'' season 5 episode "[[Chinga]]" with the creator of the series [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].

King has also made an appearance as a contestant on ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy!]]'' in 1995, playing to benefit the [[Bangor Public Library]].

King provided the voice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[audiobook]] version of ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.

In 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman on the [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''.<ref name="Monsters and Critics">{{cite web| last = Morrison| first = Sara

In the 2000 ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "Brian In Love", [[Brian Griffin]] accidentally hits a man with his pickup truck, initially fearing that he has struck Stephen King, a reference to the real-life incident experienced by King. However, when the man identifies himself as [[Dean Koontz]], Brian backs up over him again.

A season 3 episode of ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' is a homage to King, at the end when Sam realizes that the character Stevie is a young Stephen King.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/quantum-leap/the-boogieman/episode/60515/summary.html |title=Quantum Leap: The Boogieman Episode Summary on |publisher=Tv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
Although critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.

Science fiction editors [[John Clute]] and [[Peter Nichols]] <ref>Clute, John and Peter Nichols. ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. ISBN 0-312-09618-6</ref> offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers."

In his analysis of post-[[World War II]] horror fiction, ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), critic [[S. T. Joshi]]<ref>Joshi, S.T, ''The Modern Weird Tale: A Critique of Horror Fiction'', McFarland & Company, 2001, ISBN 978-0-7864-0986-0</ref> devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to ''[[deus ex machina]]'' endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since ''[[Gerald's Game]]'' (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible "[[everyman]]" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of [[adolescence]]. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels<U+2014>''[[Rage (novel)|Rage]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Running Man]]'' (1982)<U+2014>as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed [[suspense thriller]]s, with believable characters.

In 1996, King won an [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story "[[The Man in the Black Suit]]".

In 2003, King was honored by the [[National Book Awards]] with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, with his work being described thus:

<blockquote>Stephen King<U+2019>s writing is securely rooted in the great American tradition that glorifies spirit-of-place and the abiding power of narrative. He crafts stylish, mind-bending page-turners that contain profound moral truths<U+2013>some beautiful, some harrowing<U+2013>about our inner lives. This Award commemorates Mr. King<U+2019>s well-earned place of distinction in the wide world of readers and book lovers of all ages.</blockquote>

Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard Snyder, the former CEO of [[Simon & Schuster]], described King's work as "non-[[literature]]", and critic [[Harold Bloom]] denounced the choice:
<blockquote>The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of [[Penny Dreadfuls|penny dreadfuls]], but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Dumbing down American readers | first=Harold | last=Bloom | date=September 24, 2003}}</ref></blockquote>

However, others came to King's defense, such as writer  [[Orson Scott Card]], who responded:

<blockquote>Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2003-09-21.shtml |title=Yummi Bears, Lions, Boomtown, Mayer, and King - Uncle Orson Reviews Everything |publisher=Hatrack.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref></blockquote>

In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the 2004 movie ''[[Secret Window]]'', he stated, "A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book ''[[On Writing]]'' had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', I have gotten over my own snobbery."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040312/REVIEWS/403120306/1023 |title=Chicago Sun-Times - Reviews '&#39;Secret Window'&#39; (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

In 2008, King's book ''[[On Writing]]'' was ranked 21st on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' list of "The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207349,00.html |title=The New Classics: Books &#124; EW 1000: Books &#124; Books &#124; The EW 1000 &#124; Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Ew.com |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

The book, whose profits were donated to assist with [[famine]] relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as [[Chris Claremont]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Alan Moore]], as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as [[Harlan Ellison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator_title.php?ID=1385&cID=2957&pID=1 |title='&#39;Heroes for Hope'&#39; at the Comic Book Database |publisher=Comicbookdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> The following year, King wrote the introduction to ''[[Batman]]'' #400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over [[Superman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=34874 |title='&#39;Batman'&#39; #400 at The Comic Book Database |publisher=Comicbookdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] began publishing [[comic books]] based on King's ''[[The Dark Tower (comics)|Dark Tower]]'' series, followed by adaptations of ''[[The Stand (comics)|The Stand]]'' in 2008 and ''[[The Talisman (comics)|The Talisman]]'' in 2009.

=== Radio stations ===
Stephen and his wife Tabitha own The Zone Corporation, a central [[Maine]] radio station group consisting of [[WZON (AM)|WZON]], [[WZON-FM]], and [[WKIT]]. The last of the three stations features a [[Frankenstein]]-esque character named "Doug E. Graves" as part of the logo and the tagline "Stephen King's Rock 'n' Roll Station."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Philanthropy===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2010}}
Since becoming commercially successful, King and his wife have donated large amounts of money to causes around their home state of Maine and elsewhere, notably to literacy projects.

The Kings' early '90s donation to the [[University of Maine]] Swim Team saved the program from elimination from the school's athletics department. Donations to local [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]] programs have allowed renovations and improvements that would otherwise have been impossible. Additionally, King annually sponsors a number of scholarships for high school and college students.

The Kings do not desire recognition for their funding of Bangor-area facilities: they named the Shawn T. Mansfield Stadium for a prominent local little league coach's son who has cerebral palsy, while the Beth Pancoe Aquatic Park memorializes an accomplished swimmer from the region who died of cancer.

On November 6, 2008, King appeared with friend and fellow author [[Richard Russo]] to raise money for the Western Massachusetts food bank. The event held by the Odyssey Bookshop in South Hadley at Mount Holyoke College raised over $18,000 and helped to promote his new collection, ''Just After Sunset'', and Russo's ''Bridge of Sighs''.

Stephen and Tabitha King also donate thousands each year to politically progressive organizations, such as the Maine People's Alliance.

===Political activism===
In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the [[Massachusetts state legislature]] that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to others' children, which he asserted is usually "disastrous" and "undemocratic". He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', from buying or renting ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', which is violent but less graphic. While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence.<ref>King, Stephen; "Videogame Lunacy"; "The Pop of King" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; April 11, 2008.</ref>

A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when a conservative blogger posted a clip of King at a [[Library of Congress]] reading event.

[[Image:Stephenking house.JPG|thumb|300px|King's home in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]]]]
King and his wife own and occupy three different houses, one in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], one in [[Lovell, Maine]], and they regularly winter in their waterfront [[mansion]] located off the [[Gulf of Mexico]], in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. He and Tabitha have three children and three grandchildren.<ref name=stephenking.com_bio/>

Shortly after publication of ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'', King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping evidence of his addictions taken from the trash including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of [[cocaine]], [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], [[Valium]], [[NyQuil]], [[dextromethorphan]] (cough medicine) and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], on the rug in front of him. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help and quit all forms of drugs and alcohol in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.<ref name=KingOnWriting/>

[[Tabitha King]] has published nine of her own novels. Both King's sons are published authors: [[Owen King]] published his first collection of stories, ''We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories'', in 2005; [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joseph Hillstrom]] published an award-winning collection of short stories, ''[[20th Century Ghosts]]'', in 2005, and his first novel, ''[[Heart-Shaped Box (novel)|Heart-Shaped Box]]'' will be adapted by [[Irish people|Irish]] director [[Neil Jordan]] for a 2010 [[Warner Bros.]] release.<ref name=imdbhsb>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790681/ Internet Movie DataBase - Heart Shaped Box]</ref>

King's daughter [[Naomi King|Naomi]] spent two years as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]], in [[Utica, New York]]. Naomi now ministers for the Unitarian Universalist Church of River of Grass, in [[Plantation, Florida]] with her same-sex partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riverofgrass.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=27&Itemid=12|title=River of Grass Ministry|accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref>

King was raised [[Methodist]], while his wife, Tabitha, was raised [[Catholic]].<ref name="Official Stephen King website FAQ">[http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#0.5 "Frequently Asked Questions"] StephenKing.com; Accessed October 21, 2010.</ref>

King is a fan of [[baseball]], and of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine [[Little League]] Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essay "[[Head Down]]", which also appears in the collection ''[[Nightmares & Dreamscapes]]''. In 1999, King wrote ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]],'' which featured former Red Sox [[pitcher]] [[Tom Gordon]] as the protagonist's imaginary companion. King recently co-wrote a book titled ''[[Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season]]'' with [[Stewart O'Nan]], recounting the authors' roller coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] and [[2004 World Series|World Series]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In the 2005 film ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]],'' about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening day game. He has also devoted one of his columns for ''Entertainment Weekly'' on the subject of commercialism in Major League Baseball.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} He also starred in an [[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCenter]]'' advertisement referencing both his allegiance to the Red Sox and his preferred writing genre (horror fiction).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
