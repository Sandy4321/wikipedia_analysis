===Etymology===
There are several generally accepted pronunciations and spellings for this village's name, including Greatford (the common modern pronunciation), Gritford (an older version),{{says who?|date=August 2011}} and Gretford (the general local pronunciation).<ref name=pc>[http://parishes.lincolnshire.gov.uk/Greatford/section.asp?catId=15407 "The Village"], Greatford Parish Council.  Retrieved 15 August 2011</ref> Greatford was listed in the ''[[Domesday book]]'' as "Greteford" and "Griteford",<ref name=pc/> indicating that the local pronunciation is closest to the original.{{says who?|date=August 2011}} The name is believed to be derived from its location on a gravel or 'grit' ford of the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|West Glen River]].<ref name=pc/> The variable pronunciation and spelling seems to be accepted,{{by whom|date=August 2011}} as some local records spell the village's name "Gretford" as late as 1900.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===History===
The parish contains the now untraceable [[Deserted medieval village|medieval hamlet]] of Banthorp, mentioned in ''[[Domesday]]''.

===Greatford Hall===
Greatford Hall was originally a manor house built by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century. It was the home and private asylum for Francis Willis, the physician who treated and 'cured' [[King George III]] of his 'madness' here in 1788. In 1922 the hall burned down and was subsequently rebuilt in a similar style to the original. There is no public access to the hall today.<ref name=pc/>

During the Second World War, the Hall was owned by Lancaster Gate Hotels.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In the 20th century Greatford Hall was the residence of the businessman Harry Dowsett who, in 1943, formed the civil engineering company [[Dow-Mac]] that first developed the use of [[prestressed concrete]], made at [[Tallington]] {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} to the south of Greatford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The company is now [[Tarmac Limited|Tarmac]] Precast Concrete. In 1940 Dowsett bought the [[Lowestoft]]-based firm of shipbuilders, [[Brooke Marine]] that made [[Royal Navy]] landing craft during World War II.

===Amenities===
The village [[public house]] is the Hare and Hounds on Main Street.

==Geography==
To the west, the parish boundary meets [[Braceborough and Wilsthorpe]] to the north, passing through Banthorpe Lodge, crossing the [[East Coast Main Line]], then following the West Glen River through Shillingthorpe Park. Close to the village near Greatford Hall, the boundary passes north, crossing the road to [[Carlby]]. It follows part of the [[Macmillan Way]] (which [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1584306 passes] straight through the parish, broadly following the Glen) near some coppices. It rejoins the West Glen River, crossing the road to [[Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire|Wilsthorpe]]. East of Fletland Mill, it meets [[Thurlby by Bourne|Thurlby]] ([[Obthorpe]]).

At the A15 bridge over the West Glen River, where the Macmillan Way crosses, it meets [[Baston]], to the east. The boundary now follows the [[Roman road]] [[King Street (Roman road)|King Street]], and the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/997274 King Street Drain], to the south. For 200 metres it meets [[Langtoft, Lincolnshire|Langtoft]], then meets [[Barholm and Stowe]], and leaves [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/717690 King Street] to the west, passing through some coppices. north of [[Barholm]], it briefly follows the Greatford Cut, a navigation built in 1954 to connect the West Glen River, to the north at Greatford, with the [[River Welland]] west of [[Market Deeping]], and to stop the River Glen from flooding. It passes north of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/487328 Maidens' Farm] and at the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1584448 East Coast Main Line] meets [[Uffington, Lincolnshire|Uffington]], passing along the southern edge of Browne's Oaks.
