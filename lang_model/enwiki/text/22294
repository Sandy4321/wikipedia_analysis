==Geography==
[[Image:Beograd_Sat.png|250px|thumb|left|Satellite view of Belgrade]]
Belgrade lies 116.75&nbsp;[[metre|m]] above [[sea level]], at [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] 44<U+00B0>49'14" North 20<U+00B0>27'44" East. The historical core of Belgrade (today's [[Kalemegdan]]) is on the right bank of [[Sava river|Sava]] and [[Danube]] rivers. However, as the city grew, it expanded over the Sava river, so that now it includes [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]] and [[Zemun]], both on Sava's left bank. The city is located at the [[confluence]] of the Danube and Sava rivers. The city has an urban area of 359.96&nbsp;[[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]], while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3222.68&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. Belgrade, like many other cities, is considered a crossroads between the [[Western world|West]] and [[the Orient]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201029|title=Geographical Position|publisher=Official website}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[Image:KlimaBG.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Monthly rainfall and temperature]]
Belgrade has a moderate [[continental climate]]. The year-round average temperature is 11.7&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]], while the hottest month is July, with an average temperature of 22.1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. However, there are 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, and 95 days when the temperature is above 25&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. Belgrade receives about 700 [[millimetre|mm]] (27.56 [[inch]]es) of precipitation a year. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,096. The sunniest months are July and August, with an average of about 10 sunny hours a day, while December and January are the darkest, with an average of 2<U+2013>2.3 sunny hours a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201193|title=Climate|publisher=Official website}}</ref>

Singidunum experienced occupation by successive invaders of the region<U+2014>[[Huns]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]]<U+2014>before the arrival of the [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s around 630. The first record of the Slavic name ''Beograd'' dates back to 878, during the rule of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. For about four centuries the city remained a subject of warfare between [[Byzantium]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the First Bulgarian Empire.<ref name="bhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201243 City of Belgrade - History (Byzantine Empire)]</ref> It finally passed to Serbian rule as a part of the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]] in 1284. The first [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]] to rule over Belgrade was [[Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin]] (1276<U+2013>1282), the ruler of the Kingdom of Syrmia, who received it as a gift from his [[father-in-law]], the Hungarian king [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislav IV]].<ref name="MSH">[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201247|title=History (Medieval Serbian Belgrade)|publisher=Official website}}</ref>{{Quote_box|

Following the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371 and the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, the [[Serbian Empire]] began to crumble, the south being conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050991/Battle-of-the-Maritsa-River|

The city flourished under [[Despot]] [[Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>]], son of the famous Serbian ruler [[Prince Lazar|Lazar Hrebeljanovi<U+0107>]]. Its ancient walls were refortified, along with its castles, harbours and churches, which helped the Despotate to avoid surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] for almost 70 years. At that time Belgrade became a haven for many Balkan peoples escaping Ottoman control. It is thought that the city had a population of some 40<U+2013>50,000 at this time. During the reign of [[George, Prince of Rascia|<U+0110>ura<U+0111> Brankovi<U+0107>]], most of the Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottomans, but Belgrade itself invited in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kings]] for protection.<ref name="MSH">source</ref> The Ottomans, however, wanted to conquer Belgrade as it presented an obstacle to their further advance into [[central Europe]]. They attacked in 1456, leading to the famous [[Siege of Belgrade]] where the [[Christendom|Christian]] army under [[John Hunyadi]] successfully defended the city from the Ottomans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3030796.html|author=Tom R.

===Turkish conquest===
Under [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], on [[28 August]] [[1521]], the fort was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The city was largely razed to the ground by the conquering Ottomans. For the next 150 years or so it was a peaceful town, and the seat of the district ([[sanjak]]). It attracted new traders and inhabitants<U+2014>[[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], [[Ragusa]]n traders, and others. It is thought that the city's population was around the 100,000 mark in the 17th century. It became more of an [[Oriental]] town, with [[Ottoman architecture]] and many new [[mosque]]s.<ref name="imperialrule">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201251|title=History (Turkish and Austrian Rule)|publisher=Official website}}</ref> It was affected by a major Serb rebellion in 1594 (the [[Banat Uprising]]), which was crushed by the Turks, who burned churches and the relics (mortal remains) of [[Saint Sava]] on the [[Vra<U+010D>ar plateau]], an event the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] was built to commemorate in more recent times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitropolija.cg.yu/dvavoda/knjige/aradovic-hram_l.html|title=Duhovni smisao hrama Svetog Save na Vra<U+010D>aru (Online book reprint)|author=[[Amfilohije Radovi<U+0107>]]|publisher=Janus, Belgrade|date=1989|language=Serbian|retrieved=2007-07-05}}</ref>

In [[World War I]], [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] shelled Belgrade on [[July 29]], [[1914]], and it was taken by [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] under General [[Oskar Potiorek]] on [[November 30]] before it was re-taken by [[Serb Army|Serbian troops]] under Marshal [[Radomir Putnik]] on [[December 15]]. On [[October 9]], [[1915]] Belgrade fell to [[German Army|German]] and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] after a prolonged battle between October 6<U+2013>9, 1915 that destroyed much of the city. The city was liberated by Serbian and [[French Army|French troops]] on [[November 5]], [[1918]] under the command of Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Esp<U+00E9>rey]] of [[France]] and [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia]]. After the war Belgrade experienced faster growth and significant modernisation as the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during the 1920s and 1930s, growing in population to 239,000 by [[1931]] (incorporating the suburb of [[Zemun]], formerly in Austria-Hungary), and 320,000 by [[1940]]: the population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.<ref name="stan"/> In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened and in 1929, its first [[radio]] station began operation. In 1935, the [[Pan<U+010D>evo bridge]] was opened, crossing the Danube.

On [[March 25]] [[1941]], the government of the [[Regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Paul]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in an effort to stay out of the [[Second World War]]. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] led by the Air Force commander, General [[Du<U+0161>an Simovi<U+0107>]], who proclaimed [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] to be of age to rule the realm. Consequently, the city was [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#German bombing|heavily bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] on [[April 6]] [[1941]], killing thousands of people; most estimates maintain at least 17,500 were killed. [[Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Italian fascism|Italian]], [[Hungary between the two world wars|Hungarian]] and [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgarian]] forces and the western suburbs were incorporated into a Nazi [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal to guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of citzens from Belgrade; in particular, members of Belgrade's Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General [[Franz B<U+00F6>hme]], the German Military Governor of Serbia. B<U+00F6>hme enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot with a great deal of vigor. Belgrade was the location of a puppet government headed by General [[Milan Nedic]] during [[World War II]]. [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#Allied bombing|The city was bombed]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as well, on [[April 16]] [[1944]], killing about 1,600 people. Both bombings happened to fall on [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[Easter#Eastern Christianity 2|Easter]]. Most of the city remained under German occupation until [[October 20]] [[1944]], when it was liberated by [[Communism|Communist]] [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Partisans]] and the [[Red Army]]. On November 29, 1945, Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] proclaimed the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in Belgrade. In 1946, Colonel [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] was tried and executed in Belgrade. In the post-war period Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|renewed Yugoslavia]], developing as a major industrial centre.<ref name="20c"/> In 1958, Belgrade's first [[Television]] station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned Countries]] was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1968, major student protests against Tito led to several street clashes between students and the police. In March 1972, Belgrade was at the centre of [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe]], which was contained with enforced quarantine and mass vaccination by late May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/news/specials/response/anthrax/features/2001/oct/011023.quarantine.html|title=Bioterrorism: Civil Liberties Under Quarantine|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=2001-10-23|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref>

A more traditional Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as ''[[Starogradska]]'' (roughly translated as ''Old Town Music''), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in [[Skadarlija]], the city's old [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] neighbourhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade gathered in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called [[kafana]]s in Serbian), which date back to that period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tob.co.yu/english/zasto_bg/bg_amb/skadarlija/index.html|title=Skadarlija|publisher=Tourist Organisation of Belgrade|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref> At one end of the neighborhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded in the first half of the nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bip.co.yu/e-istorija.htm|title=History|publisher=BiP (Belgrade Brewery)|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref> One of the city's oldest kafanas is the [[Znak pitanja]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=1319|title=Znamenite gra<U+0111>evine 3|publisher=Official site|language=Serbian}}</ref>

The city has only one permanent gay club, as well as a few gay and gay-friendly caf<U+00E9>s, in the centre of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gay-serbia.com/scena/|title=Gay Scene|publisher=Gay Serbia portal|retrieved=2007-05-23}}</ref> Intolerance towards sexual minorities is still common in Belgrade and Serbia as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labris.org.yu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=136&Itemid=48|title=Discrimination against lesbians and gays in Serbia in 2006|publisher=Labris Organization for Lesbian Human Rights|retrieved=2007-05-19|author=Dragana Vu<U+010D>kovi<U+0107>}}</ref>
=== Media ===
{{seealso|List of media organisations in Belgrade}}
Belgrade is the most important media hub in Serbia. The city is home to the main headquarters of the national broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia|Radio Television Serbia - RTS]], which is currently in the process of being transformed into a public service broadcaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.co.yu/jedna_vest.asp?belong=&IDNews=125391|title=Samo RTS mo<U+017E>e da bude javni servis|date=2005-08-23|publisher=Radio Television of Serbia}}</ref> The RTS record label, PGP RTS, is also based in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgp-rts.co.yu/info/index.html|title=<U+041F><U+0413><U+041F> - <U+0420><U+0422><U+0421> (<U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0430> <U+043E> <U+043D><U+0430><U+043C><U+0430>)|publisher=PGP RTS}}</ref> The most popular commercial broadcaster is [[RTV Pink]], a Serbian media multinational, known for its popular entertainment programs, which are considered by many to be sensationalist and of low quality. The most popular mainstream "alternative" broadcaster is [[B92]], another media company, which has its own TV station, radio station, and music and book publishing arms, as well as the most popular website on the Serbian internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/issues/2005/1/manasek-paradox.asp|title=The Paradox of Pink| author=Jared Manasek|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|date=2005-01|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2006&mm=09&dd=01&nav_category=15&nav_id=210237&fs=1|title=B92 na 8.598. mestu na svetu|publisher=B92|date=2006-09-01|retrieved=2007=05-19|language=Serbian}}</ref> Other TV stations broadcasting from Belgrade include [[Kosava|Ko<U+0161>ava]], [[TV Avala|Avala]], and others which only cover the greater Belgrade municipal area, such as [[Studio B]] and [[TV Politika]]. Numerous specialised channels are also available: [[SOS channel]] (sport), [[Metropolis (TV station)|Metropolis]] (music), [[Art TV]] (art), Cinemania (film), and [[Happy TV]] (children's programs).

High-circulation daily newspapers published in Belgrade include ''[[Politika]]'', ''[[Ve<U+010D>ernje novosti]]'', ''[[Blic (newspaper)|Blic]]'', ''[[Glas javnosti]]'', and ''[[Sportski <U+017E>urnal]]''. Other dailies published in the city are ''[[Press (newspaper)|Press]]'', ''[[Danas]]'', and ''[[Kurir]]''. A new free distribution daily, ''[[24 sata (Serbia)|24 sata]]'', was founded in the autumn of 2006. The two most popular Serbian weekly newsmagazines, ''[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]'' and ''[[Vreme]]'', are published in Belgrade.

[[Image:ParlamentBelgrad.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Parliament of Serbia]], and the headquarters of the [[Po<U+0161>ta Srbije|Post Office of Serbia]]]]
Various parts of Belgrade have wildly varying [[architecture]], from the centre of [[Zemun]], typical of a [[Central Europe]]an town,<ref>{{cite web|title=Zemun: The Town Within the City|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/travel/index.php?nav_id=38986|author=Nicholas Comrie, Lucy Moore|publisher=[[B92]] Travel|date=2007-10-01|retrieved=2007-05-17}}</ref> to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]]. In Belgrade proper, the oldest buildings date only from 19th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.<ref name=manevic>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/most/www/ser/Belgrade/zoran_manevic.html|title=Architecture and Building|author=Zoran Manevi<U+0107>|publisher=[[MIT]] website|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref> The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish [[turbe]], while the oldest house is a modest clay house on [[Dor<U+0107>ol]], from late 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulus.org.yu/ENGLISH/Exhibitions/TriennialA/TriennialA.htm|title=Seventh Belgrade triennial of world architecture|publisher=ULUS|author= 	
Prof. Dr. Mihajlo Mitrovi<U+0107>|date=2003-06-27|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref> The western influence came in the 19th century, when the city received complete transformation from an oriental town to contemporary architecture of the time, with influences of [[neoclassicism]], [[romanticism]] and [[academic art]]. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the buildings of [[National Theatre in Belgrade|National Theatre]], [[Old Palace (Belgrade)|Old Palace]], [[Saborna Crkva|Cathedral Church]] and later, in the early 20th century, the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] and [[National Museum of Serbia|National Museum]], with influences of [[art nouveau]].<ref name=manevic/> Elements of [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] are present in buildings such as [[Vuk's Foundation]], old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|St. Mark's Church]] (based on the [[Gra<U+010D>anica monastery]]), and the [[Temple of Saint Sava]].<ref name=manevic/>

During the period of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply to house the huge influx of people from the countryside following the World War II, sometimes resulting in the [[brutalist architecture]] of the [[blokovi]] (blocks) of New Belgrade; a [[socrealism]] trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the [[Trade Union Hall (Belgrade)|Trade Union Hall]].<ref name=manevic/> However, in mid-1950s, the [[modernism|modernist]] trends took over, still dominating in the Belgrade architecture.<ref name=manevic/>

==Transportation==
{{main|Transport in Belgrade}}
[[Image:New Railway Bridge 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[New Railroad Bridge (Belgrade)|New Railroad Bridge]] at night]]
Belgrade has an extensive public transport system, which is based on [[bus]]es (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), [[tram]]s (12 lines), and [[trolleybus]]es (8 lines).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsp.co.yu/english/statistic.htm|title=Statistics|publisher=Public Transport Company "Belgrade"|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref> The system is mostly run by [[GSP Beograd]] (the City Transport Company) and SP Lasta, in cooperation with some private companies on various bus routes. Belgrade also has a [[regional rail|commuter railway]] network, [[Beovoz]], run by the [[Serbian Railways]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serbianrailways.com/active/en/home/glavna_navigacija/putnicki_saobracaj/red_voznje/karta_mreze_beovoz.html| Publisher=Serbian Railways|title=Beovoz Network Map|retrieved=2007-05-19}}</ref>
The city's Main Railway Station connects Belgrade with other European capitals, as well as with many of towns in Serbia. However, more popular in Serbia is travel by coach, and the capital is well served with daily connections to all major and minor towns in the country, as well as in the region. The motorway system provides for easy access by car to [[Novi Sad]] to the north, [[Ni<U+0161>]] to the south, and [[Zagreb]], the capital of Croatia, to the west. As a city situated at the confluence of two major rivers, Danube and Sava, Belgrade has many bridges<U+2014>the two main ones are [[Branko's bridge]] and [[Gazela bridge|Gazela]], both of which connect the core of the city to [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]]. The [[Port of Belgrade]] is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port-bgd.co.yu/en/history.htm|title=History of the Port of Belgrade|publisher=Port of Belgrade|retrieved=2007-05-18}}</ref> The city is served by [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: '''BEG'''), a few kilometres west of the city centre. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vazduhoplovnivodic.co.yu/sr/letelista.htm|title=Aerodromi i leteli<U+0161>ta|publisher=Vazduhoplovni vodi<U+010D> kroz Beograd|language=Serbian|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060503063756/www.vazduhoplovnivodic.co.yu/sr/letelista.htm|archivedate=2006-05-03}}</ref> Following growth since 2000, the number of passengers reached about 2 million in 2004 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danas.co.yu/20050520/ekonomija1.html|title=Regionalni centar putni<U+010D>kog i kargo saobra<U+0107>aja|publisher=Danas|date=2005-05-20|language=Serbian}}</ref> In 2006, 2 million passengers passed through the airport by mid-November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beg.aero/code/navigate.php?Id=130#775|title="Nikola Tesla" Airport received its two millionth passenger|publisher=Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|date=2006-11-14|retrieved=2006-05-18}}</ref>

With the city's expansion and substantial increase of number of vehicles, congestions in the city have became a major problem in 2000s. In an attempt to solve the problem, a bypass around the city is under construction, connecting [[E70]] and [[E75]] highways which intersect in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankwatch.org/project.shtml?w=147584&s=1961998|title=Belgrade Bypass, Serbia|publisher=CEE Bankwatch network|retrieved=2007=05-19}}</ref> Further, an "inner magistral semi-ring" is planned, including a new bridge across Sava river, which should ease [[commuting]] within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/projects/eias/34913s.pdf|title=1. faza prve deonice Unutra<U+0161>njeg magistralnog poluprstena|publisher=Belgrade Direction for Building and Real Estate Land/EBRD|date=2005-07-01|retrieved=2007-09-15|language=Serbian}}</ref>
