'''Air Rhodesia Flight 825''' was a passenger flight that was deliberately shot down by [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA) [[professional revolutionary|cadres]] on 3 September 1978. Of the 52 passengers and four crew on board, 38 died in the crash; guerrillas proceeded to attack those still alive in the wreckage, killing a further 10. The aircraft involved, a [[Vickers Viscount]] named the ''Hunyani'', was flying the last leg of [[Air Rhodesia]]'s regular scheduled service from [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] to the capital [[Harare|Salisbury]], via the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]]; most of the passengers were holidaymakers returning to Salisbury.

Soon after Flight 825 took off in the late afternoon, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas scored a direct hit on its [[Port and starboard|starboard]] wing with a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-made [[Strela 2]] surface-to-air [[infrared homing]] missile, largely disabling the aircraft and forcing an [[emergency landing]]. An attempted [[belly landing]] in a cotton field just west of [[Karoi]] was foiled by an unseen ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and explode. Cadres then approached the wreckage, rounded up any passengers they saw and attacked them with automatic gunfire, killing 10 of the 18 survivors, including two children. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five were saved because they had immediately left the site to look for water.

ZIPRA leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] claimed responsibility for shooting down the ''Hunyani'' on [[BBC]] television the same evening, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes. He denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white,<ref name=nyarota62/> saw the attack as an act of [[terrorism]].<ref name=freeman/> A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.

Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately cut off by the furious Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a "monster".<ref name=moorcraft154/> On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of [[martial law]] over selected areas. The [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] launched several retaliatory strikes over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]]. Five months later, in February 1979, ZIPRA shot down [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident.

==Background==
{{main|Rhodesia|Rhodesian Bush War|Internal Settlement}}
A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]]{{refn|group=n|name=zimbabwe}} led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], to [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The UK had recently adopted a policy of [[no independence before majority rule]], and Rhodesia's government mostly comprised members of the country's [[white people in Zimbabwe|white minority]], so this declaration went [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] internationally. Britain and the [[United Nations]] imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.<ref name="wood2008pp1to8">{{Harvnb

Two rival black communist parties initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the {{nobreak|Chinese-aligned}} [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), mostly comprising [[Shona people|Shona]]s, created the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), while the {{nobreak|[[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]-dominated}} [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), aligned with [[Marxism<U+2013>Leninism]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], mobilised the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA).<ref name=nationalists>{{Harvnb

The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because Rhodesian whites were determined to keep control of law enforcement and the military even following the introduction of black rule in parliament.

==Incident==

===Prior threats to Rhodesian air traffic===
Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977, in the latter stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the [[Strela 2]] shoulder-launched [[Man-portable air-defense systems|{{nobreak|surface-to-air}} missile launcher]], supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] from the {{nobreak|mid-1970s}} as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel support.{{#tag:ref|ZANLA, aligned with China rather than the Soviets, never received such weapons. ZANLA's Mozambican ally, [[FRELIMO]], did receive Soviet arms, and reportedly had Strela 2 launchers as early as 1973.<ref name=moorcraft97/>|group="n"}} By September 1978, there had been 20&nbsp;reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]s had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.<ref name="moorcraft97">{{Harvnb

===Flight===
[[Air Rhodesia]] was the [[flag carrier|national airline]] of Rhodesia, established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed [[Central African Airways]], which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at [[Harare International Airport|Salisbury Airport]], Air Rhodesia's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]].<ref>{{Harvnb
|Flight International
|1979}}</ref>

The Flight 825 aircraft was a [[Vickers Viscount]] 782D, a British-made [[turboprop]] vessel with two engines on each wing. It was named the ''Hunyani'' after the [[Manyame River|river of the same name]], which flowed between [[Lake Kariba]] and the Rhodesian capital [[Harare|Salisbury]].<ref name=nyarota62/>

The ''Hunyani'' was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]] on the way.<ref name=smith266/> Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the [[Zambezi]] (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist attractions.<ref name=nyarota62/> In addition to the four crew members, the 3 September 1978 Sunday afternoon flight from Kariba to Salisbury carried 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake.<ref name=nyarota62/> The flight took off from [[Kariba Airport]] on schedule soon after 17:00 [[Central Africa Time]].<ref name=time/>

Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of [[Bulawayo]] who had gained his [[commercial pilot licence]] in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the [[Rhodesian Air Force]] on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were {{nobreak|Bulawayo-born}} Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21, and {{nobreak|23-year-old}} Louise Pearson, from Salisbury.<ref name=lindsellstewart/>

A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela 2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the ''Hunyani'' about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the [[Climb#Climb_phase|climb phase]] of its flight.<ref name=time/> The {{nobreak|[[infrared homing|heat-seeking]]}} missile hit the plane's [[port and starboard|starboard]] wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. This caused the rupture of a fuel tank and hydraulic lines, which in turn created a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the ''Hunyani'' ceased its ascent and hurtled towards the ground.<ref name=nyarota62/>

At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to [[air traffic control]], informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. "We're going in," he radioed.<ref name=time/> Telling his passengers to brace for an [[emergency landing]], he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of [[Karoi]], intending to [[belly landing|belly land]] the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the ''Hunyani'' hit a previously unseen ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>

===Massacre on the ground===
Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen passengers survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr C. MacLaren, led four others<U+2014>young newly-weds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey<U+2014>off in the direction of a nearby village in the search of water.<ref name=heraldreporters>{{Harvnb
|Rhodesia Herald
|5 September 1978}}</ref> The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45.<ref name=lindsellstewart/> Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the bush surrounding the crash site, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same.<ref name=time/> This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, of whom six were women (including two girls, respectively aged 11 and 4).<ref name=lindsellstewart/> 

The guerrillas, who were armed with [[AK-47]] assault rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water.<ref name=time/> They spoke in English, both to the survivors and amongst themselves. They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the {{nobreak|able-bodied}} men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about {{convert|10|m2|ft2}}. Standing roughly {{convert|15|m|ft}} away, the cadres now raised their weapons. "You have taken our land," one of them said.<ref name=lindsellstewart>{{Harvnb

Having collected water from a nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to "come here".<ref name=platts/> The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee.<ref name=platts>{{Harvnb
|Platts
|1978}}</ref> Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the cadres return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with various passengers' belongings, then left again.<ref name=lindsellstewart/>

The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to [[Parirenyatwa Hospital|Andrew Fleming Hospital]] in Salisbury.<ref name=heraldreporters/>

===Nkomo claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors===

Though most Rhodesian blacks opposed this kind of attack just as the whites did, many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be "terrorist sympathisers", in the words of Geoffrey Nyarota, who was then one of the few black reporters at the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' newspaper. Describing the ''Herald'' newsroom the night of the incident, Nyarota writes of the "vile collective temper" amongst the white [[Copy editing|sub-editors]]: "They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all ''terrs'' and ''munts'' or ''kaffirs''...&nbsp;I sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears."<ref name=nyarota63>{{Harvnb

Several racially-motivated incidents occurred over the following days; according to the ''Time'' article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar "fingering the triggers of rifles",<ref name=time/> and forced blacks drinking there to leave. ''Time'' also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw.<ref name=time/> Smith says that several would-be [[vigilante]] groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to "make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists".<ref name=smith266/> He writes that he instructed them not to, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them.<ref name=smith266>{{Harvnb

===Memorial service, 8 September 1978===
[[File:Harare anglicanchurch.JPG|thumb|upright|The Anglican Cathedral of St Mary and All Saints in Salisbury was the location of the memorial service on 8 September 1978. ''(2006 photograph)''|alt=A small stone cathedral, viewed from across the street]]
The general mood was largely summarised by the events on 8 September 1978, when a memorial service was held for Flight 825's dead passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral. About 2,000 people packed into the cathedral, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent amongst those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and [[South African Airways]] personnel, as well as [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including [[P. K. van der Byl]], the co-minister of foreign affairs.<ref name=heraldmemorial>{{Harvnb
|Rhodesia Herald
|9 September 1978}}</ref>

[[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] John de Costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a "deafening silence" from overseas. "Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount," he said. "But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not! Like men in the story of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|good Samaritan]], they pass by on the other side<ref name=petterbowyer331>{{Harvnb

|p=331}}</ref> ... The ghastliness of this ill-fated flight from Kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come."<ref name=heraldmemorial/>

At the end of the service, a white man on the pavement held a poster above his head with a message intended for the prime minister to read as he left the cathedral. "{{smallcaps|pm smith}}", it read, "{{smallcaps|give nkomo a message when next you meet him secretly: 'go to hell, you murdering bastard'}}".<ref name=heraldmemorial/> The demonstrator was quickly joined by another man, who had a similar poster. The pair received loud applause from the mostly white onlookers. As Smith made his way to his car, ignoring the posters, Bishop Burrough and the Dean asked the two activists to remove their banners, but they refused. When Burrough proceeded to pull one of posters to the ground, the crowd's cheers turned to boos. "We want Smith to stand down," one of the demonstrators yelled. "If he hasn't the guts to stand up and fight, we have."<ref name=heraldmemorial/> The man continued in a similar vein for some time afterwards, despite the efforts of the churchmen to silence him; he was received positively by most of the crowd, though some disagreed with him.<ref name=heraldmemorial/>

===Smith<U+2013>Nkomo talks halted===
Amidst the atmosphere that prevailed amongst white Rhodesians following the attack of almost universal hatred for the black nationalists, communism and Nkomo personally, the talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself was personally appalled by the attack, calling Nkomo a "monster".<ref name=moorcraft154>{{Harvnb

|p=154}}</ref> Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith<U+2013>Nkomo talks at this time was "potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre",<ref name=cilliers47/> as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two "at this critical stage" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition.<ref name="cilliers47"/>

On 10 September, the prime minister broadcast to the nation, announcing that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of [[martial law]], which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to "liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for "any defensive strikes we might undertake" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front.<ref>{{Harvnb

==Rhodesia strikes back==

===Operation ''Snoopy''; Rhodesia hits New Chimoio===

Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesian civilians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against cadres in that country,<ref name=moorcraft154/> but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around [[Chimoio]] in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during [[Operation Dingo|Operation ''Dingo'']], destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the nationalists had since built a complex called "New Chimoio", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation ''Snoopy'', the Rhodesian Air Force, [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.<ref name=petterbowyer331/> Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine {{nobreak|Soviet-made}} [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks and four Russian armoured cars, but the former were routed and the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were "several hundred" guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a [[friendly fire|friendly]] air strike.<ref name=moorcraft154/>

===Operation ''Gatling''; the "Green Leader" raid===
Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Peter Petter-Bowyer, a former Rhodesian Air Force pilot, writes was "payback time" for Flight 825.<ref name=pb333>{{Harvnb
|Petter-Bowyer
|2005
|p=333}}</ref> Operation ''Gatling'', launched on 19 October 1978, was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. ''Gatling'''s primary target was the previously {{nobreak|white-owned}} Westlands Farm, just {{convert|16|km}} north-east of central Lusaka; rechristened "Freedom Camp", it had become ZIPRA's military headquarters and main training base. ZIPRA presumed that because the camp was so close to Lusaka, Rhodesia would never dare to attack it. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior ZIPRA staff also on site.<ref name=pb333/> Rhodesia's other targets were Chikumbi, {{convert|19|km}} north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. The assault on targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.<ref name=moorcraft155/>

Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to [[Lusaka International Airport|Lusaka Airport]] tower as "Green Leader", the Rhodesian Air Force took control of [[airspace]] over Zambia during the raid, informing the [[Zambian Air Force]] that the attack was against "Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia", and that Rhodesian [[Hawker Hunter]]s were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off.<ref name=moorcraft135144>{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft
|McLaughlin
|2008
|pp=135<U+2013>144}}</ref> The Rhodesian Air Force proceeded to use a Zambian airstrip, Rufansa, as a forward base. During the three-day assault, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors. Historians [[Paul Moorcraft]] and [[Peter McLaughlin]] write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed [[refugee]]s often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been "impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits."<ref name=moorcraft155/>

==Aftermath==
{{main|Air Rhodesia Flight 827|Zimbabwe Rhodesia|Lancaster House Agreement}}
The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident. Though they had not actually made much impact on the respective nationalist campaigns, they still prompted Nkomo and Zambian President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] to request further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three quarters of the country by the end of 1978.<ref name=moorcraft155>{{Harvnb
|Moorcraft
|McLaughlin

|p=155}}</ref> Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing {{nobreak|anti-Strela}} shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>

Following the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with {{nobreak|low-radiation}} paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over {{convert|2000|ft}}. There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>

In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first prime minister of the reconstituted, {{nobreak|majority-ruled}} state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979.<ref name=hackland289>{{Harvnb
