The '''Engine Shed''' is a music and entertainment venue in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire]], England, and part of the [[University of Lincoln]].

==History==
It was opened in September 2006 and takes its name from the [[locomotive]] shed that used to lie<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyewipe-jct/5735968545/ Former shed]</ref> in its current location, immediately adjacent to the [[Nottingham to Lincoln Line|railway line]] to Nottingham. The venue sees bands play and then opens to the students as a nightclub following the bands' performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The venue has a capacity of 1,500 in the main hall side and approximately 800 in the Upper and Lower Tower Bars.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexbancroft/4356545750/ Tower Bar]</ref>

The venue has recently renovated the balcony area above the venue bar area to create a smaller, intimate venue called [[The Platform (Venue)|The Platform]]. The venue can hold a capacity of approximately 300 persons and will showcase local and national talent but can double up as a balcony to larger gigs and events on removal of the acoustic wall.

The first live gig was [[Embrace (English band)|Embrace]] on 18 September 2006.<ref>[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2006/09/uni01freshers%20(2).htm Embrace September 2006]</ref> It has also staged [[Job fair|careers fair]]s, and hosts the University's [[Student orientation|freshers' fair]]; the LPAC also serves this function. In February 2007 it launched its website.

==Construction==
The [[Motive power depot|building]] was originally constructed in 1874 for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) as Shed 40A, with four railway tracks. It had been disused since 1964. Although the Brayford site had been derelict for many years, there had been vast regeneration plans for the site including a new theatre since the early 1970s, which were killed off by Lincoln City Council in the mid-1970s for being too financially extravagant. It was too far-fetched for the financially strapped 1970s.

For many years Lincoln only had the [[Theatre Royal, Lincoln|Theatre Royal]] as its main venue. Although the local council had no enthusiasm for a theatre or venue on the Brayford site, the University resumed plans for a much-needed music venue.

The building is at the eastern end of the university campus, and is near the point where the [[River Witham]] joins [[Brayford Pool]] (Foss Dyke) from the south. It is opposite the headquarters of the [[Lincolnshire Echo]]. The River Witham lies directly across the front of the building.

===Design===
There were two phases in the design - 1 and 2. 1 became what is now the Engine Shed, and Phase 2 was the [[Lincoln Performing Arts Centre|LPAC]]. The consulting engineers were Ward Cole, who designed many other new buildings in the Brayford area. 

The architects were Stem Architects (then known as UL Architects) who are based in Sparkhouse Studios, and have designed most (if not all) of the other buildings for the University. 

Construction began in February 2005. The [[topping out]] ceremony was on 16 May 2006.<ref>[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2006/05/engine%20shed%20topping%20out.htm Topping out ceremony]</ref>

===Facilities===
It is a 1500-seat venue. It is part of the [[University of Lincoln]]'s campus and lies next to the [[Great Central Warehouse University Library, University of Lincoln|university library]], which is another former railway building, built by the [[Great Central Railway]].<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/expolight/2296217858/ Engine Shed and library]</ref>

The Tower Bars offer hot food on two levels, and are open from 10am. The Engine Shed is also home to the University of Lincoln's Students Union and SOAP Centre.<ref>[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2007/11/SOAPCentre.htm Opportunities]</ref><ref>[http://www.lincolnista.com/index.php/venues/category/bars_and_pubs/detail/tower_bars Tower Bar]</ref> The university union used to have another bar called the Delph Bar, on the opposite side of the campus.

==Tours==
It has hosted a number of high-profile [[rock band]]s including The Wombats, [[Stereophonics]], [[Embrace (UK band)|Embrace]], [[The Zutons]], [[The Charlatans (British band)|The Charlatans]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], [[Beautiful South]], [[LostAlone]], [[Deftones]], [[Shiny Toy Guns]], [[Babyshambles]], [[Feeder]], [[The Cribs]], [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Kasabian]], [[The Hoosiers]], [[Razorlight]], [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Fratellis]] and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Marina And The Diamonds]]. 

In addition to this, it played host to [[30 Seconds To Mars]]. The concert was broadcast on Radio 1, for their Radio 1 Student tour.

The venue has also played host to a number of top comedians, including [[Jason Manford]], [[Russell Howard]], [[Rhod Gilbert]] and [[Stewart Lee]].
