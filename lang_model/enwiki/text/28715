'''Hog Island sheep''' are a breed of [[sheep]] descended from animals first brought to [[Hog Island (Virginia)|Virginia's Hog Island]] in the 1700s. During the 1930s and 1940s, storm conditions forced the island's residents to evacuate, leaving some sheep behind. These sheep adapted to the environment free of human intervention, becoming [[feral]].<ref name="crews"/>

The breed is preserved by various organizations because of its relevance to American history and its resemblance to historical American sheep. It also possess some traits that have been somewhat lost in more modern breeds.<ref name="harman"/><ref name="star"/><ref name="Dohner"/>

==Breed characteristics==

The Hog Island sheep is a feral breed, descended from sheep abandoned on Hog Island in the 1930s and '40s.<ref name="crews">{{cite journal | last = Crews | first = Ed | title = Rare Sheep from Hog Island and Leicester | journal = Colonial Williamsburg | url = http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/summer07/sheep.cfm |issue = Summer 2007 | publisher = The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation | accessdate = 20 October 2011}}</ref> It is believed that the breed was descended from the [[Merino]] breed, among others, possibly the [[English Leicester (sheep) | Improved Leicester]] or other English breeds.<ref name="harman"/><ref name="Dohner"/>
The sheep is relatively small but tough and hardy. Rams weigh on average {{convert|125|lb|kg}} and ewes {{convert|90|lb|kg}}.<ref name="crews"/> Lambs are born with spotted or speckled fleece; about 90% of adults have white fleece and 10% black.<ref name="albcbreedinfo">{{cite web | title = Hog Island Sheep | work = Breed Information | publisher = American Livestock Breeds Conservancy | year = 1993 | url = http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/hogisland.html | accessdate = 20 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="SheepMag">{{cite news |url=http://www.sheepmagazine.com/issues/25/25-2/Rosemarie_Colombraro.html |title=Hog Island Breed: Goats In Sheep's Clothing |last=Colombraro |first=Rosemarie |work=Sheep Magazine |date=March<U+2013>April 2004}}</ref> Both males and females can have horns, and about half the total population do.<ref name="Dohner"/>

The Hog Island sheep is not commonly used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy [[Domestic sheep reproduction#Lambing | lambing]].<ref name="harman">{{cite news | last = Harman  | first = Alan  | title = Hoarding Faded Genes  | newspaper = Sheep magazine  | location = Wisconsin  | publisher = Countryside Publications, Ltd.  | date = May<U+2013>June 2011  | url = http://www.sheepmagazine.com/issues/32/32-3/hoarding_faded_genes-feds_+_non-profits_team_up_to_store_rare_breed_remnants_for_future.html  | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="svf">{{cite web  | title = Hog Island Sheep  | publisher = [[SVF Foundation]]  | url = http://svffoundation.org/animals/hog-island-sheep.html  | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Dark Hog Island sheep.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph|right|Most Hog Island sheep are white, but there are black individuals.]]
Hog Island was colonized in the 1600s.<ref name="star">{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Moyer |title=Rare sheep with a history |url=http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2003/082003/08172003/1064594/ |work=[[The Free Lance-Star]] |date=17 August 2003 |accessdate=31 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="okie">{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/hogisland/index.htm|title=Hog Island Sheep|work=Breeds of Livestock |publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]] Dept. of Animal Science |accessdate=31 January 2008}}</ref> The sheep that colonists would have been using at the time would have been the contemporary English breeds, but [[Merino]]s were known to roam the barrier islands, taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose. The colonists would have used some combination of these sheep in their flocks.<ref name="Dohner"/> 

As an island, Hog Island had open space and lacked predators, therefore the colonists allowed their livestock to roam free, rounding them up only to mark them or to use them for meat or wool. In 1933 a [[hurricane]] destroyed most of the island; the inhabitants abandoned the settled areas and many sheep were left to fend for themselves, reverting to a [[feral]] state. [[The Nature Conservancy]] bought the island in the 1970s, rounded up the sheep, and removed them to prevent [[overgrazing]].<ref name="star"/> The breed is extremely rare today; with fewer than 200 registered animals it is listed as "Critical" by the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]].<ref name="albcwatchlist">{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/wtchlist.html#sheep |title=Conservation Priority List |publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>

===Research and conservation (after rediscovery)===
When the Nature Conservancy bought Hog Island, most of the sheep were bought by private owners.<ref name="Dohner"/> Some were taken to [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]], where they were studied to determine why they were relatively free of parasites; the researchers concluded that the sheep had no special resistance to parasites but were simply isolated from them by their habitat. The sheep were then sent to institutions such as [[George Washington Birthplace National Monument|George Washington's birthplace]], [[Mount Vernon]], and [[Colonial Williamsburg]] for preservation.<ref name="crews"/><ref name="star"/> The [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[National Animal Germplasm Program]] has collected semen samples from several of the sheep as part of a program that aims to preserve the genetic material of animals significant to American history.<ref name="usda">{{cite journal | last = McGinnis | first = Laura | title = Collaboration Brings Colonial Sheep Collection to Colorado | journal = Agricultural Research | issue = March 2009 | pages = 20<U+2013>21 | publisher = USDA | date = March 2009 | url = http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/31859/1/IND44210098.pdf | accessdate = 9 November 2011}}</ref> Because Hog Island sheep resemble the small, short-fleeced sheep that would have been raised in colonial farms for meat and wool, they (or a cross between them and [[Dorset sheep]], a combination called "American Site sheep") are used in exhibits to recreate the look and feel of a historical farm.<ref name="Dohner">{{Harv | Dohner | 2001 | pp=142<U+2013>143}}</ref>

Because the Hog Island sheep population is so small, the preservation of the breed through a pure, inbred line would threaten the breed's health by an increased risk of pairing of "bad genes". Stillbirths and atypical-looking sheep have been reported by some breeders. In response, some breeders have crossed Hog Island sheep with other breeds, including [[Gulf Coast Native]] sheep, and then bred the offspring with pure Hog Island sheep, producing almost pure Hog Island sheep except for the addition of some genetic diversity.<ref name="Dohner"/>
