==Meets H<U+1ED3> Ch<U+00ED> Minh==
Vietnam was at this time part of [[French Indochina]], which banned communist and nationalist political activity. H<U+1ED3> arrived in Guangzhou in November 1924 on a boat from [[Vladivostok]].<ref name="Tran">Tr<U+1EA7>n Gia Ph<U+1EE5>ng, (2006) "[http://www.dcvonline.net/php/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=2314 <U+00D4>ng H<U+1ED3> m<U+1EA5>y v<U+1EE3>?

In 1925, Minh was introduced to H<U+1ED3> by L<U+00E2>m <U+0110><U+1EE9>c Th<U+1EE5>, also a leader of Thanh Ni<U+00EA>n.<ref name="Duiker143"/> H<U+1ED3> later gave Minh a ruby engagement ring.<ref name="Kong"/> When H<U+1ED3>'s comrades objected to the match, he told them, "I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house."<ref name="Brocheux39-40">Brocheux, Pierre (2007).

In April 1927, following an anti-communist coup by [[KMT]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]], H<U+1ED3> left Guangzhou and returned to Moscow, traveled to various countries, and arrived in [[Bangkok]] in July 1928. "Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said in order to be felt," he reassured Minh.<ref name="Brocheux39-40"/> This letter was intercepted by French police.<ref name="Brocheux39-40"/> Minh, although uninterested in politics, is recorded as a member of the Communist Youth League from July 1927 to June 1929. According to one report, Minh visited H<U+1ED3> in the winter of 1929-30 when he was in Hong Kong.<ref name="Duiker618">Duiker, p. 618.</ref> In May 1930, H<U+1ED3> sent a letter asking Minh to meet him in Shanghai, but her boss hid the letter and she did not receive it in time.<ref name="Hoang2001">Ho<U+00E0>ng Tranh (Huang Zheng), "[http://vantuyen.net/index.php?view=story&subjectid=4848 H<U+1ED3> Ch<U+00ED> Minh v<U+1EDB>i ng<U+01B0><U+1EDD>i v<U+1EE3> Trung Qu<U+1ED1>c T<U+0103>ng Tuy<U+1EBF>t Minh]" (H<U+1ED3> Ch<U+00ED> Minh and his Chinese wife T<U+0103>ng Tuy<U+1EBF>t Minh), ''<U+0110><U+00F4>ng Nam <U+00C1> Tung ho<U+00E0>nh'', November 2001.

==Attempts to reunite==
In May 1950, Minh saw a picture of H<U+1ED3> in a newspaper and sent a message to the [[Vietminh]] ambassador in Beijing.<ref name="Tran"/> This message was unanswered.<ref name="Tran"/> She tried again in 1954, but her letter was again unanswered.<ref name="Tran"/> Representatives of the Chinese government told her to stop trying to contact H<U+1ED3> and promised to provide for her needs.<ref name="Brocheux181">Brocheux, p. 181.</ref> By this time, a cult of personality had arisen around H<U+1ED3> and the North Vietnamese government had an investment in the myth of H<U+1ED3>'s celibacy. For his part, H<U+1ED3> asked the North Vietnamese consul in Guangzhou to look up Minh in 1967, but without success.<ref name="Brocheux189">Brocheux, p. 189.</ref> H<U+1ED3> died in 1969. Minh retired as a midwife in 1977 and died 14 November 1991 at the age of 86.<ref name="Hoang2001"/>

The claim that H<U+1ED3> had a Chinese wife first appeared in a book by Chinese author Huang Zheng published in 1987.<ref name="Huang1987">Huang Zheng (<U+9EC4><U+94EE>), [http://books.google.com/books?id=nQkRAAAAMAAJ&q= <U+80E1><U+5FD7><U+660E><U+4E0E><U+4E2D><U+56FD> / <U+9EC4><U+94EE><U+7F16><U+8457>], (Hu Zhiming yu Zhongguo / Huang Zheng bian zhu), 1987. ISBN 7505601600.</ref> The claim went unnoticed until the book was translated into Vietnamese in 1990. A newspaper editor in Vietnam was dismissed from his post in 1991 for publishing a story about it.<ref>Ruane, Kevin, (2000), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=3ZU2cZ8EU6MC The Vietnam Wars]'', p. 26.
