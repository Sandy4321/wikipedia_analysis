'''Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle''', <small>[[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]]</small> (22 May 1859&nbsp;<U+2013> 7 July 1930) was a Scottish<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/170563/Sir-Arthur-Conan-Doyle |title="Scottish writer best known for his creation of the detective Sherlock Holmes" |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=2009-12-30}}</ref> physician and writer, most noted for his stories about the [[detective fiction|detective]] [[Sherlock Holmes]], which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of [[crime fiction]], and for the adventures of [[Professor Challenger]]. He was a prolific writer whose other works include [[science fiction]] stories, [[historical novel]]s, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction.

==Life==
===Early life===
Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to father of Irish descent, [[Charles Altamont Doyle]], and an Irish mother, n<U+00E9>e Mary Foley. His parents were married in 1855.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lellenberg |first=Jon |coauthors=Daniel Stashower and Charles Foley |title=Arthur Conan Doyle: A Life in Letters |publisher=HarperPress |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-00-724759-2 |pages=8<U+2013>9 }} {{cite book |author=Stashower, Daniel |title=Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2000 |isbn=0-8050-5074-4 |pages=20<U+2013>21}}</ref>

Although he is now referred to as "Conan Doyle", the origin of this compound [[surname]] (if that is how he meant it to be understood) is uncertain. The entry in which his baptism is recorded in the register of St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh gives 'Arthur Ignatius Conan' as his Christian name, and the simple 'Doyle' as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of "Conan Doyle" (Stashower 20<U+2013>21). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as "A. Conan Doyle". However, other sources (such as the 1901 census) indicate that Conan Doyle's surname was "Doyle", and that the form "Conan Doyle" was only used as a surname in his later years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}</ref>

Conan Doyle was sent to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] preparatory school [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|Hodder Place]], [[Stonyhurst]], at the age of nine. He then went on to [[Stonyhurst College]], but by the time he left the school in 1875, he had rejected [[Christianity]] to become an [[agnosticism|agnostic]].

From 1876 to 1881, he studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], including a period working in the town of [[Aston]] (now a district of [[Birmingham]]) and in Sheffield.<ref>[http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/coresite/burngreave_html/DoyleSAC.asp SGMT - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: Author of the Sherlock Holmes detective novels<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> While studying, he also began writing short stories; his first published story appeared in ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' before he was 20.<ref>Stashower 30<U+2013>31.</ref> Following his term at university, he was employed as a ship's doctor on the SS ''Mayumba'' during a voyage to the [[West Africa]]n coast. He completed his [[doctorate]] on the subject of ''[[tabes dorsalis]]'' in 1885.<ref name="Archive">Available at the [http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/418 Edinburgh Research Archive].</ref>

===Employment and the origins of Sherlock Holmes===
[[File:Paget holmes.png|upright|thumb|Sherlock Holmes (right) and Dr Watson, by [[Sidney Paget]].]]
In 1882, he joined former classmate George Budd as his partner at a medical practice in [[Plymouth]],<ref>[http://www.bfronline.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=109&Itemid=9 Arthur Conan Doyle & Plymouth].</ref> but their relationship proved difficult, and Conan Doyle soon left to set up an independent practice.<ref>Stashower 52<U+2013>59.</ref> Arriving in [[Portsmouth]] in June of that year with less than <U+00A3>10 to his name, he set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, [[Southsea]].<ref>Stashower 55, 58<U+2013>59.</ref> The practice was initially not very successful; while waiting for patients, he again began writing stories. His first significant work was ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', which appeared in ''Beeton's Christmas Annual'' for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, who was partially modelled after his former university professor [[Joseph Bell]], to whom Conan Doyle wrote "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes. ... [R]ound the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/conan-doyle-and-joseph-bell-the-real-sherlock-holmes-surgeons-hall-museums-edinburgh-410821.html Independent, 7 August 2006].</ref> Future short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the English ''[[Strand Magazine]].'' Interestingly enough, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: "[M]y compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes. ... [C]an this be my old friend Joe Bell?"<ref>Letter from R L Stevenson to Conan Doyle 5 April 1893 [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Letters_of_Robert_Louis_Stevenson_Volume_2/Chapter_XII The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 2/Chapter XII].</ref> Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences<U+2014>for instance, the famous [[Edgar Allan Poe]] character, [[C. Auguste Dupin]].<ref>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. pp. 162-163. ISBN 081604161X.</ref>

While living in [[Southsea]], he played [[Association football|football]] for an amateur side, Portsmouth Association Football Club, as a goalkeeper, under the pseudonym A.&nbsp;C. Smith.<ref>{{cite book |title=Full-Time at The Dell |last= Juson |first=Dave |coauthors=Bull, David |publisher=[[Hagiology Publishing|Hagiology]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-9534474-2-1 |page=21}}</ref> (This club disbanded in 1894 and had no connection with the [[Portsmouth F.C.]] of today, which was founded in 1898.) Conan Doyle was also a keen [[cricketer]], and between 1899 and 1907 he played 10 [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]]. His highest score was 43 against [[London County Cricket Club|London County]] in 1902. He was an occasional bowler who took just one first-class wicket (although one of high pedigree&nbsp;<U+2014> it was [[W.G. Grace]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900/ENG_LOCAL/OTHERS/LONDON-CO_MCC_23-25AUG1900.html |title=London County v Marylebone Cricket Club at Crystal Palace Park, 23-25 Aug 1900 |publisher=Static.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref> Also a keen golfer, Conan Doyle was elected captain of Crowborough Beacon Golf Club, [[East Sussex]], for the year 1910.

===Marriage and family===
[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|Portrait of Arthur Conan Doyle by [[Sidney Paget]], 1897]]
In 1885, he married Louisa (or Louise) Hawkins, known as "Touie", who suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and died on 4 July 1906.<ref name="Leeman">Leeman, Sue, "Sherlock Holmes fans hope to save Conan Doyle's house from developers", Associated Press, 28 July 2006.</ref> He married Jean Elizabeth Leckie in 1907, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897. He had maintained a [[platonic love|platonic relationship]] with her while his first wife Louisa was still alive, out of loyalty to her. Jean died in London on 27 June 1940.

Conan Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (1) Mary Louise (28 January 1889&nbsp;<U+2013> 12 June 1976) and (2) Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (15 November 1892&nbsp;<U+2013> 28 October 1918), and three with his second wife, (3) Denis Percy Stewart (17 March 1909&nbsp;<U+2013> 9 March 1955), second husband in 1936 of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Princess Nina Mdivani (circa 1910&nbsp;<U+2013> 19 February 1987; former sister-in-law of [[Barbara Hutton]]), (4) [[Adrian Conan Doyle|Adrian Malcolm]] (1910&nbsp;<U+2013> 1970) and (5) [[Jean Conan Doyle|Jean Lena Annette]] (1912&nbsp;<U+2013> 1997).

===Death of Sherlock Holmes===
In 1890, Conan Doyle studied the [[eye]] in [[Vienna]]; he moved to London in 1891 to set up a practice as an [[ophthalmologist]]. He wrote in his [[autobiography]] that not a single patient crossed his door. This gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: "I think of slaying Holmes&nbsp;... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things." His mother responded, saying, "You may do what you deem fit, but the crowds will not take this lightheartedly." In December 1893, he did so in order to dedicate more of his time to more "important" works<U+2014>his [[historical novel]]s.
[[Image:Fina-01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Holmes and Moriarty fighting over the Reichenbach Falls. Art by Sidney Paget.]]
Holmes and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] apparently plunged to their deaths together down the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in the story "[[The Final Problem]]". Public outcry led him to bring the character back; Conan Doyle returned to the story in "The Adventure of the Empty House", with the explanation that only Moriarty had fallen but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, especially [[Colonel Sebastian Moran]], he had arranged to be temporarily "dead" also. Holmes ultimately appeared in a total of 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four Conan Doyle [[novel]]s (he has since appeared in [[Non-canonical Sherlock Holmes works|many novels and stories by other authors]]).

===Political campaigning===
[[Image:Arthur Conan Doyle house.JPG|thumb|right|Arthur Conan Doyle's house in [[South Norwood]], London]]
Following the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in South Africa at the turn of the 20th century and the condemnation from around the world over the United Kingdom's conduct, Conan Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled, ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'', which justified the UK's role in the Boer war and was widely translated.

Conan Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being [[knighthood|knighted]] in 1902 and appointed Deputy-Lieutenant of [[Surrey]]. He also, in 1900, wrote the longer book, ''[[The Great Boer War]]''. During the early years of the 20th century, Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], once in Edinburgh and once in the [[Hawick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Hawick Burghs]], but although he received a respectable vote, he was not elected.

Conan Doyle was involved in the campaign for the reform of the [[Congo Free State]], led by the journalist [[E.D. Morel]] and the diplomat [[Roger Casement]]. During 1909, he wrote ''The Crime of the Congo'', a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in that country. He became acquainted with Morel and Casement and it is possible that together with [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]],<ref>[http://www.bfronline.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=9 - BFRonline.biz].</ref> they inspired several characters in the novel, ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]'' (1912).

He broke with both when Morel became one of the leaders of the [[pacifism|pacifist]] movement during the [[World War I|First World War]], and when Casement was convicted of [[treason]] against the UK during the [[Easter Rising]]. Conan Doyle tried, unsuccessfully, to save Casement from the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], arguing that he had been driven mad and was not responsible for his actions.

===Miscarriages of justice===
Conan Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes they were accused of. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]], who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.

It was partially as a result of this case that the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] was established in 1907, so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped establish a way to correct other [[miscarriages of justice]]. The story of Conan Doyle and Edalji is told in fictional form in [[Julian Barnes]]' 2005 [[novel]], ''[[Arthur & George]]''. In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche "The West End Horror"(1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy Parsee Indian character wronged by the English justice system. In real life, Edalji was also a Parsee.

The second case, that of [[the strange case of Oscar Slater|Oscar Slater]], a German [[Jew]] and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in 1908, excited Conan Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed.

===Spiritualism===
After the death of his wife Louisa in 1906, and the death of his son Kingsley, his brother Innes, his two brothers-in-law (one of whom was [[Ernest William Hornung|E. W. Hornung]], the creator of the literary character ''[[A. J. Raffles|Raffles]]''), and his two nephews shortly after [[World War I]], Conan Doyle sank into depression. He found solace supporting [[Spiritualism]] and its alleged scientific proof of existence beyond the grave. In particular he favoured [[Christian Spiritualism]], and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept, that of following the teachings and example of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News |first=Leslie |last=Price |issue=4037 |year=2010}}</ref>

Kingsley Doyle died from pneumonia on 28 October 1918, which he contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded during the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]]. Brigadier-General Innes Doyle died in February 1919, also from pneumonia. Sir Arthur became involved with Spiritualism to the extent that he wrote a [[Professor Challenger]] novel on the subject, ''The Land of Mist''.
[[Image:Cottingley Fairies 1.jpg|thumb|left|Frances Griffiths with the alleged fairies, taken by Elsie Wright in July 1917. One of the five photographs.]]
His book ''The Coming of the Fairies'' (1921) shows he was apparently convinced of the veracity of the [[Cottingley Fairies]] photographs (which were exposed as a hoax decades later), which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. In his ''The History of Spiritualism'' (1926), Conan Doyle praised the [[psychic]] phenomena and spirit materialisations produced by [[Eusapia Palladino]] and [[Mina Crandon|Mina "Margery" Crandon]].<ref name= Houdini>Kalush, William, and Larry Sloman, ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero'', Atria Books, 2006. ISBN 0743272072.</ref> His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', was banned in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 for supposed [[occult]]ism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This ban was later lifted.{{When|date=May 2009}} Russian actor [[Vasily Livanov]] later received an [[Order of the British Empire]] for his portrayal of [[Sherlock Holmes]].

Conan Doyle was friends for a time with the American magician [[Harry Houdini]], who himself became a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist movement in the 1920s following the death of his beloved mother. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently attempted to expose them as frauds), Conan Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers, a view expressed in Conan Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''. Houdini was apparently unable to convince Conan Doyle that his feats were simply illusions, leading to a bitter public falling out between the two.<ref name= Houdini/>

[[Richard Milner (historian)|Richard Milner]], an American historian of science, has presented a case that Conan Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit [[hominidae|hominid]] [[fossil]] that fooled the scientific world for over 40 years. Milner says that Conan Doyle had a motive, namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics, and that [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|''The Lost World'']] contains several encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax.<ref>Highfield, Roger, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3342867/Is-the-spirit-of-Piltdown-man-alive-and-well.html "The mysterious case of Conan Doyle and Piltdown Man."], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]], Thursday 20 March 1997.</ref>

[[Samuel Rosenberg]]'s 1974 book ''[[Naked is the Best Disguise]]'' purports to explain how Conan Doyle left, throughout his writings, open clues that related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality.

==Death==
[[Image:Doyle Arthur Conan grave.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at [[Minstead]], England]]
Conan Doyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of "Windlesham", his house in [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]], on 7 July 1930. He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], aged 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: "You are wonderful."<ref>Stashower, p. 439.</ref> The epitaph on his gravestone in the churchyard at [[Minstead]] in the [[New Forest]], [[Hampshire]], reads:

'''<p align=center>STEEL TRUE<br />BLADE STRAIGHT<br /><big>ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE</big><br />KNIGHT<br />PATRIOT, PHYSICIAN & MAN OF LETTERS</p align=center>'''

Undershaw, the home Conan Doyle had built near [[Hindhead]], south of London, and lived in for at least a decade, was a hotel and restaurant from 1924 until 2004. It was then bought by a developer, and has been empty since then while conservationists and Conan Doyle fans fight to preserve it.<ref name="Leeman"/>

A statue honours Conan Doyle at Crowborough Cross in Crowborough, where Conan Doyle lived for 23 years. There is also a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Picardy Place, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, close to the house where Conan Doyle was born.
