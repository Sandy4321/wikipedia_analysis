'''U.S. Highway 8''' ('''US&nbsp;8''') is a [[United States Highway]] that runs primarily east<U+2013>west for {{convert|280.00|mi|km|2}}, mostly within the state of [[Wisconsin]]. It runs from [[Interstate 35]] (I-35) in [[Forest Lake, Minnesota]], to [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] at [[Norway, Michigan|Norway]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] near the border with Wisconsin. Except for the short freeway segment near Forest Lake, and a section near the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin<U+2013>Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] bridge, it is all undivided surface road. As a state highway in the three states, US&nbsp;8 is maintained by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation|Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan]] departments of transportation (Mn/DOT, WisDOT, MDOT, respectively).

The highway was originally commissioned on November 11, 1926, with the rest of the original US Highway System. Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway. The western end has been extended south to [[Minneapolis]] before being returned to Forest Lake. Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from an original end location at [[Powers, Michigan]] to the current location in Norway. Plans have surfaced at various times in internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files that show the route of the missing highway segment to Powers.

A bypass built by WisDOT around the city of [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin|Rhinelander]] in the 1990s created the opportunity for a [[business route|business loop]] through the town. The loop was a locally maintained route through the [[central business district]] in Rhinelander. Currently the signage for the loop has been removed.

== Route description ==

=== Forest Lake to St. Croix Falls ===
US&nbsp;8 begins at an interchange with [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|I-35]] in [[Forest Lake, Minnesota|Forest Lake]]. This interchange is incomplete: traffic can only access US&nbsp;8 directly from northbound I-35, and westbound traffic on US&nbsp;8 merges onto southbound I-35. The first {{convert/spell|1|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of roadway to Forest Lake is a [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]], with an interchange at [[U.S. Route 61 in Minnesota|US&nbsp;61]]. East of this junction, the highway follows Lake Boulevard North around Forest Lake and continues northeasterly through the community to cross the [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington]]<U+2013>[[Chisago County, Minnesota|Chisago]] county line.<ref name="MnDOT-Washington">{{cite map |title=General Highway Map: Washington County, Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota Department of Transportation |year=2009 |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/maps/cadd/county/washington.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= May 1, 2010}}</ref> The highway continues running to the northeast along farmland and the shore of Green Lake to [[Chisago City, Minnesota|Chisago City]], where it meets up with County Road 22 (CR&nbsp;22). US&nbsp;8 follows Lake Boulevard through Chisago City along the isthmus between the larger Chisago Lake and the smaller Wallmark Lake on the eastern side of town. The highway turns along a more easterly path in [[Lindstrom, Minnesota|Lindstrom]] between North and South Lindstrom Lakes.<ref name="MnDOT-Chisago">{{cite map |title=General Highway Map: Chisago County, Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota Department of Transportation |year=2009 |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/maps/cadd/county/chisago.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= May 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name="googleMN">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=forest+lake,+mn&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=64.409204,65.654297&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Forest+Lake,+Washington,+Minnesota&ll=45.318116,-92.840309&spn=0.228136,0.387268&z=12 |title=Overview Map of US&nbsp;8 in Minnesota |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}</ref>

The highway continues east through [[Center Lake, Minnesota|Center Lake]] between North and South Center Lakes, curving around the north shore of South Center Lake. On the eastern edge of town, it turns due east and runs through [[Shafer, Minnesota|Shafer]]. US&nbsp;8 merges with [[Minnesota State Highway 95|State Highway&nbsp;95]] (MN&nbsp;95) about {{convert/spell|2|mi|km}} southwest of Taylors Falls. The two highways [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] turn northeast along the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] entering [[Taylors Falls, Minnesota|Taylors Falls]]. At this point, MN&nbsp;95 continues north along the river while US&nbsp;8 turns east to cross the St. Croix River, exiting the state of Minnesota into [[Wisconsin]].<ref name="MnDOT-Chisago"/><ref name="googleMN"/>

=== St. Croix Falls to Ladysmith ===
US&nbsp;8 enters [[Polk County, Wisconsin|Polk County]] at [[St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin|St. Croix Falls]] as a multilane highway.

[[File:Rhinelander WI area, 1924.png|thumb|350px|Rhinelander area, 1924|alt=Map]]
The first changes to the routings of the predecessor highways were made by Wisconsin by 1920. A series of curves were added between Turtle Lake and Baron adding "stair steps" to the routing while similar jogs were removed near Cameron, Weyerhauser, Hawkins and Prentice. WIS&nbsp;14 was rerouted between Rhinelander and [[Pelican Lake, Wisconsin|Pelican Lake]] to run via [[Monico, Wisconsin|Monico]], and [[Wisconsin Highway 38|WIS&nbsp;38]] (the future US&nbsp;141) was extended northward from [[Wausaukee, Wisconsin|Wausaukee]] to terminate at the state line near [[Niagara, Wisconsin|Niagara]].<ref name=WI1919>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Highway Commission |year= 1918 |title= Official Map of the State Trunk Highway System of Wisconsin |cartography= WHC |section= A7<U+2013>N8}}</ref><ref name=WI1920>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Highway Commission |year= 1920 |title= Official Map of the State Trunk Highway System of Wisconsin |cartography= WHC |section= 5 & 6 |pages= 22<U+2013>7}}</ref> The realignment between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake was shown as reversed by 1922.<ref name=WI1922>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Highway Commission |year= 1922 |title= Official Map of the State Trunk Highway System of Wisconsin  |cartography= WHC |section= 5 & 6 |pages= 22<U+2013>7}}</ref> By 1925, the highway in that area was again rerouted to run directly from Rhinelander to Monico, but instead of turning south to Pelican Lake, it was run directly to Crandon. That same year, WIS&nbsp;14 was extended eastward from Armstrong Lake to Pembine and northward to Niagara. The north<U+2013>south section, previously numbered WIS&nbsp;38, was also redesignated as part of [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]].<ref name=WI1925>{{cite map |publisher= Wisconsin Highway Commission |year= 1925 |title= Official Highway Map of Wisconsin  |cartography= WHC |scale= 1&nbsp;in=15&nbsp;mi}}</ref>

The '''U.S. Highway 8 Business Route''' ('''BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;8''') in [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]] was a locally-maintained business loop highway routing through the central business district of the city. The route was designated when US&nbsp;8 was shifted to a bypass of town in the 1990s. The former routing of US&nbsp;8 through town was turned over to the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway south of town.<ref name=OnCo02/> The signs along the road were removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was redesignated CTH-P.<ref name=dn2004-08-30>{{cite news |url= http://www.rhinelanderdailynews.com/articles/2004/08/30/news/local_news/news1.txt |title= Business Highway 8 To Be Renamed County Highway P |work= The Rhinelander Daily News |date= August 30, 2004 |accessdate= November 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

Before the signage was removed, BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;8 started at the western junction of US&nbsp;8 and [[Wisconsin Highway 47|WIS&nbsp;47]]. The business loop ran east from this intersection along Kemp Street, crossing the [[Wisconsin River]] north of the convergence with the [[Pelican River]]. The loop jogged north along Oneida Street for 3&nbsp;blocks and turned east again on Lincoln Street. East of town, BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;8 intersected [[Wisconsin Highway 17|WIS&nbsp;17]] and turned to the southeast. Outside of town, the business loop ran through wooded terrain and turned south near Clear Lake. Near the larger George Lake, the roadway curved back east along the lake's southern shore, running parallel to the main highway before turning south to connect to the main highway. At this intersection with US&nbsp;8/WIS&nbsp;47, the business loop ended after a total run of {{convert|7.1|mi|km|1}}.<ref name="googleR">{{google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=US-8+%26+West+Kemp+Street,+Rhinelander,+WI&daddr=45.633246,-89.379101+to:US-8+E%2FWI-47+S&hl=en&geocode=FWBGuAIdNUir-imnuOzLTqpVTTHwO9NrdXs-wQ%3B%3BFaTJtwIddgWt-g&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=13&via=1&sll=45.611876,-89.382534&sspn=0.113475,0.128231&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=13 |title= Overview Map of U.S. Route 8 Business in Rhinelander, Wisconsin |accessdate= May 11, 2008 |link= no}}</ref>
