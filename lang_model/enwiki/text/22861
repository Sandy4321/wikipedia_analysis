'''Imogen Clare Holst''' <small>[[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]</small> (12 April 1907&nbsp;<U+2013> 9 March 1984) was an English composer, arranger, conductor, teacher and festival administrator. The only child of  the composer [[Gustav Holst]], she is particularly known for her educational work at [[Dartington Hall]] in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the [[Aldeburgh Festival]].  She was also a prolific writer on music, producing   composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father.

From a young age, Imogen Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance.  After attending [[Eothen School]] and  [[St Paul's Girls' School]], she entered the [[Royal College of Music]], where she developed her skills as a conductor  and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Imogen spent most of the 1930s teaching,  and as a full-time organiser for the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]]. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts]] at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.

In the early 1950s Imogen became [[Benjamin Britten]]'s musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual  Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Imogen's own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.

===Childhood and education===

====Birth and family background====
[[File:House on The Terrace, Barnes - geograph.org.uk - 1309706.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The house in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] where the Holst family lived between 1908 and 1913]]
Imogen Holst was born on 14 April 1907  at   31 Grena Road, [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], a riverside town to the west of London. Her parents were [[Gustav Holst|Gustav Theodore Holst]], an aspiring composer then working as a music teacher, and  Isobel, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Harrison. The Holst family,  of mixed Swedish, German and Latvian ancestry, had been in England since 1802 and  had been musicians for several generations.{{#tag:ref|The family's name was "von Holst" until Gustav changed it in 1918, during the First World War.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30928|startpage=11615|date=1 October 1918|}}</ref>|group= n}} Gustav followed this family tradition; while studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] (RCM), he met Isobel Harrison, who sang in one of the amateur choirs that he conducted.  He was immediately attracted to her, and they were married on 22 July 1901.<ref>Holst, p. 29</ref>

While attempting to establish himself as a composer, Gustav Holst worked first as an orchestral trombonist, and later as a teacher.  In 1907 he held teaching posts at [[James Allen's Girls' School]] in [[Dulwich]],  and [[St Paul's Girls' School]] (SPGS) in [[Hammersmith]], where he was director of music.<ref>{{cite web|last= Matthews|first= Colin|title= Holst, Gustav(us Theodore von)|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/13252?q=Gustav+Holst&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 21 February 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> He also taught evening classes at [[Morley College]], an adult education centre in the [[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]] district of London.<ref name=dnb>{{cite web|last=Warrack|first=John|title=Holst, Gustav Theodore (1874<U+2013>1934)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33963|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 March 2013|authorlink=John Warrack}}{{ODNBsub}}</ref> Shortly after Imogen's birth the family moved from Richmond to a small house by the river in nearby [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], which they rented from a relative. Imogen's main memories of this house were of her father working in his composing room on the top floor, which she was forbidden to visit, and of his efforts to teach her folk-songs.<ref name= GS2>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 2<U+2013>3</ref>

====Schooling====
[[File:Holst-by-rothenstein-1920.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7| Gustav Holst circa 1920, drawn by [[William Rothenstein]] ]]
Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.<ref name= GS2/> In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the [[Froebel College|Froebel Institute]], and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at  the Holsts' rented country cottage at [[Thaxted]] in [[Essex]],  where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", p. 6</ref>

In 1917  Imogen began boarding at [[Eothen School|Eothen]], a small private school for girls in [[Caterham]],<ref>Gibbs, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> where  [[Jane Joseph]], Holst's  star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of "compertishions{{sic}}, and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea".<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with Andr<U+00E9> Mangeot (described as "topping") and theory with Jane Joseph ("ripping"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions<U+2014>three instrumental pieces and some Christmas carol tunes<U+2014>which she  numbered as Ops. 1, 2, 3 and 4.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 9<U+2013>12</ref> In the  summer term of 1920, Imogen composed and choreographed a "Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds", which was  performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", p. 15</ref>{{#tag:ref|The "Nymphs and Shepherds" dance music was Imogen's Op. 4, originally titled  ''The Masque of the Tempest''.<ref>Tinker and Strode, p. 451.</ref>|group= n}}

Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama,<ref>{{cite web|title= Ruby Ginner (1886<U+2013>1978)|url= http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095853709|work= Oxford Index|publisher= Oxford University Press|accessdate= 21 February 2014}}</ref> but was rejected as probably  lacking the stamina for a dancing career. While studying at home under a governess for six months, at Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in a production of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s [[semi-opera]] from 1690, ''[[Dioclesian]]'', a version largely devised  by  Joseph.<ref name= GS16>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref><ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Gustav Holst|last= Holst|first= Gustav|title= Jane Joseph: A brief discussion of her published music|url= http://landofllostcontent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/jane-joseph-brief-discussion-of-her.html|journal= The Monthly Musical Record|date= April 1931|pages= pp. 97<U+2013>98}}</ref>

In September 1921 Imogen became a boarder at St Paul's Girls School. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which  Joseph praised her warmly, writing: "I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the end of it".<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 18<U+2013>20</ref>  Imogen's SPGS years were generally happy and successful.  In July 1923 she won the junior Alice Lupton piano prize, but her chances of distinction as a pianist were marred when she began to develop [[phlebitis]] in her left arm.<ref name= GS22>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 22<U+2013>26</ref>{{#tag:ref|In an obituary tribute, Ursula Vaughan Williams refers to Imogen's arm condition as "inherited from her father".<ref name= Obit/> In fact, Gustav Holst suffered from neuritis in his right arm, an equally disabling but unrelated condition.<ref name= GS22/>|group= n}} Among other activities she became interested in folk music and dance, and in 1923 became a member of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]] (EFDS). In 1924<U+2013>25, her final year at SPGS, Imogen founded a folk dance society in the school. At an end-of-term school concert late in July 1925,  she  played [[<U+00C9>tude Op. 10, No. 3 (Chopin)|Chopin's <U+00E9>tude in E major]] and gave the first performance of Gustav Holst's ''Toccata''.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 29<U+2013>32</ref>

====Royal College of Music====
[[File:Royal College of Music - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The Royal College of Music]]
Although destined like her father for the RCM, Imogen first spent a year studying composition with [[Herbert Howells]] and piano with Adine O'Neill, while otherwise occupying herself with EFDS activities.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  pp. 33<U+2013>40</ref> She began at the RCM in September 1926, studying piano with [[Kathleen Long]],  composition with [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], and conducting  under [[William Henry Reed|W. H. Reed]]. Her aptitude as a  conductor was evident in December 1926, when she led the college's  Third Orchestra  in the opening movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 38 (Mozart)|"Prague" Symphony]].<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref> This and other performances on the podium led ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' to speculate that Imogen might eventually become the first woman to "establish a secure tenure of the conductor's platform".<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  p. 46</ref> 
 
In her second RCM year Imogen concentrated on composition, producing several chamber works including a violin sonata, an oboe quintet, and a suite for woodwind. She took her first steps towards personal independence when she moved from the family home to a [[bedsit]] near [[Kensington Gardens]].<ref name= GS49>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  pp. 49<U+2013>52</ref>  In 1928 she went to Belgium with the EFDS, took an Italian holiday, and made an extended trip to Germany with a group known as "The Travelling Morrice" which promoted international understanding  through music and dance.<ref name= GS49/> In October 1928 she won the RCM's Cobbett prize for an original chamber composition,   her ''Phantasy'' String Quartet, and shortly afterwards was awarded the Morley Scholarship for the "best all-round student".<ref name="Strode p. 72">Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  p. 72</ref>  The quartet was broadcast by the BBC on 20 March 1929,<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31",  p. 60</ref> but the achievement was overshadowed by the news, that month, of the premature death of her early mentor Jane Joseph.<ref>Gibbs, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Gibbs|first= Alan|title= Joseph, Jane Marian|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52756?q=Jane+Joseph&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1|work= Grove Music Online|publisher= Oxford University Press|accessdate= 23 February 2014}}</ref>

In the winter of 1929 Imogen made her first visit to Canada and the United States, as part of an EFDS party.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 67<U+2013>70</ref> Back home, she worked on   her RCM finals composition,  a suite for brass band entitled ''The Unfortunate Traveller''.<ref name="Strode p. 72"/> Despite some apprehension on her part, the piece passed the examiners' scrutiny and was  played at the college's end-of-year concert in July.{{#tag:ref|In 1969, after Isobel Holst's death, Imogen found the manuscript of ''The Unfortunate Traveller'' among her mother's possessions.

====European travels, 1930<U+2013>31====
Imogen spent much of period between September 1930 and May 1931 travelling. A brief visit to [[Li<U+00E8>ge]] in September  was followed immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary,  returning to England via  Prague, Dresden,  Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her "orgy of musical experiences" included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg,   performances of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and ''[[Die Entf<U+00FC>hrung aus dem Serail]]'' at the [[Vienna State Opera]], Bach in Berlin and  [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Mahler's Seventh Symphony]] in Amsterdam.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 79<U+2013>90</ref> On 1 February 1932 she departed again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour  Imogen came home with mixed views on Italian music-making.  She concluded that "the Italians are a nation of singers&nbsp;... But music is a different language in that part of the world". Back in London, she decided that despite her experiences, "if it is music one is wanting, there is no place like London."<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 91<U+2013>93</ref><ref name= guardian>{{cite news|last= Grogan|first= Christopher|title= Daughter of the renaissance|url= http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/17/classicalmusicandopera|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 17 October 2007}}</ref>

====Mainly teaching, 1931<U+2013>38====
[[File:Cecil Sharp House-1.jpg|thumb|left|Cecil Sharp House, London headquarters of the English Folk Dance and Song Society]]
With her scholarship funds exhausted, Imogen needed a job, and in June 1931 took charge of music at the Citizen House arts and education centre in [[Bath (Somerset)|Bath]].{{#tag:ref|Citizen House had been founded in 1916 by Helen Hope, as a centre for social welfare, education and the arts. It included a theatre group, the Citizen House Players, and eventually a 200-seat theatre.<ref>{{cite web|title= Little Theatre with a big heart celebrates 70 years in Bath|url= http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Little-Theatre-big-heart-celebrates-70-years-Bath/story-11349391-detail/story.html|work= The Bath Chronicle|date= 30 December 2008  }}</ref>|group= n}} She disliked the disciplines imposed by an unsympathetic and unyielding superior, and she stayed only a few months.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 97<U+2013>99</ref> She then worked as a freelance conductor and accompanist before joining the staff of the EFDS early in 1932. The organisation had  by now expanded to become the "English Folk Dance and Song Society" (EFDSS) and was based in new headquarters at Cecil Sharp House.{{#tag:ref|The EFDSS was  established in March 1932, after the English Folk Dance Society, for which Imogen had worked voluntarily for many years, had agreed to merge  with the English Folk Song Society.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", p. 100</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Keel|first= Frederick|title= The Folk Song Society 1898<U+2013>1948|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4521287|journal= Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society|volume= 5|issue= 3|date= December 1948|pages= p. 126}} {{subscription}}</ref>|group= n}} The duties, mainly teaching, were not full time, and she was able to take up part-time teaching posts at her old school, Eothen, and at [[Roedean School]].<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 109<U+2013>12</ref> Although she composed little original music during these years, she made many instrumental and vocal arrangements of traditional  folk melodies.<ref name= IHM>{{cite journal|last= Tinker|first= Christopher|title= Imogen Holst's Music 1962<U+2013>64|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/945906|journal= Tempo (New Series)|issue= 166|pages= pp. 22<U+2013>27}} {{subscription}}</ref>

Gustav Holst's health had been poor for years; in the winter of 1933<U+2013>34 it deteriorated, and he died on 25 May 1934. Imogen privately determined that she would protect her father's musical legacy, and began working on his biography. Meanwhile her own music began to attract  attention. Her carol arrangement "Nowell and Nowell" was performed in a 1934 Christmas concert in [[Chichester Cathedral]], and the following year saw the premiere of her Concerto for Violin and Strings, with Elsie Avril as the soloist and Imogen conducting the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name= GS114>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 114<U+2013>18</ref> In 1936 she paid a visit to [[Hollywood]], where she stayed with her uncle (Gustav's brother), the actor [[Ernest Cossart]]. A highlight of this visit was a  [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] concert at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], conducted by [[Otto Klemperer]].<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 118<U+2013>20</ref> Back in England, Imogen worked on recorder arrangements of music by the neglected 16th-century composer [[Pelham Humphrey]]. These were published in 1936 to an enthusiastic critical reception. Her  biography of her father  was published in 1938;<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 124<U+2013>25</ref> among several tributes, the composer [[Edmund Rubbra]] praised her for producing a book that was not "clouded by sentiment&nbsp;... her biography is at once intimate and objective".<ref>Edmund  Rubbra in ''Monthly Musical Record'',  November 1938, quoted in Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 124<U+2013>25</ref>

====War: travelling for CEMA====
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb| A CEMA concert during the Second World War (a performance of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' by the [[Ballet Rambert]])]]

In 1938 Imogen  decided to abandon amateur music-making and teaching to concentrate on her own professional development. She resigned her EFDSS post while continuing to honour existing commitments to the organisation. She had given up her work at Roedean in 1936; at Easter 1939 she resigned from Eothen. In June 1939 she began a tour of Switzerland which included the [[Lucerne Festival]]. Towards the end of August, as war became increasingly likely, she broke off the trip and returned home.<ref name= GS126>Grogan and Strode, "Part II: 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 126<U+2013>28</ref>

After the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, Imogen worked for the Bloomsbury House Refugee Committee, which supported German and Austrian refugee musicians interned under  emergency regulations. In January 1940 she accepted a position under a scheme organised by the [[Pilgrim Trust]], to act as one of six "music travellers", whose brief was to boost morale by encouraging  musical activities in rural communities. Imogen was assigned to cover the west of England, a huge area stretching from [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Cornwall]]. When  the government set up the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts]] (CEMA), responsibility for the music travellers   passed  to that body.<ref name= GS126/>{{#tag:ref|CEMA was created by a [[Royal Charter]] in 1940. In 1946 it evolved into the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], under a new charter.<ref>{{cite web|title= The history of the Arts Council|url= http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/who-we-are/history-arts-council/|publisher= Arts Council|accessdate= 4 March 2014}}</ref>|group= n}}

With little practical support from CEMA, Imogen's organisational talents, according to her friend [[Ursula Vaughan Williams]], "developed brilliantly".<ref name= Obit>{{cite journal|last= Vaughan Williams|first= Ursula|title= Obituary: Imogen Holst, 1907<U+2013>84|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4522176|journal= Folk Music Journal|volume= 4|issue= 5|year= 1984}} {{subscription}}</ref> According to Imogen's account, her duties included conducting local brass bands, leading hymn-singing practice ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round the edge of a dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged   performances by professional groups, and what she termed "drop-in-and-sing" festivals in which anyone could join.    Imogen also writes of "idyllic days" spent over cups of tea, discussing the hopes and dreams of would-be music makers.<ref>Imogen Holst essay, first published in ''Making Music'', October 1946, reproduced in Grogan and Strode, "Part II: 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 129<U+2013>32</ref> Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but  she produced two recorder trios<U+2014>the ''Offley'' and ''Deddington'' suites<U+2014>and made numerous arrangements for female voices of  carols and traditional songs.<ref name= TS454>Tinker and Strode, pp. 454<U+2013>55</ref> By the summer of 1942 the workload and concomitant bureaucracy was such that she was exhausted, and in need of a lengthy rest.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II: 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 136<U+2013>37</ref>

===Dartington===
[[File:Main Hall entrance Dartington.jpg|thumb|left|The main hall at Dartington]]
In 1938, Imogen had visited [[Dartington Hall]], a progressive school and  crafts community near [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]], which had been founded in 1925 by [[Leonard Elmhirst|Leonard]] and [[Dorothy Elmhirst]].<ref>Cox and Dobbs, p. 31</ref>   In 1941<U+2013>42, while travelling for  CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there,  she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", p. 138</ref>  He had in mind a music course, "the sort of thing that your father did in the old days at Morley College".<ref>Cox and Dobbs, pp. 10<U+2013>27</ref>  Beginning in 1943,  Imogen established   a one-year   course, initially designed to train young women to  organise amateur orchestras  and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including  the foundation of an amateur orchestra: "Hardly any of us could play&nbsp;... However bad we were, we went on".<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 139<U+2013>40</ref> Imogen's  teaching methods, heavily based on "learning by doing" and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", p. 145</ref> Rosamond Strode,  a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before&nbsp;... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".<ref>Rosamond Strode, in an unpublished typescript, quoted in Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 154<U+2013>55</ref>

In the conducive atmosphere of Dartington Imogen   resumed serious composition, largely abandoned during the hectic CEMA years. In  1943 she completed a ''Serenade'' for flute, viola and bassoon, a ''Suite for String Orchestra'', and a choral work, ''Three Psalms''. All these works were performed at a [[Wigmore Hall]] concert on 14 June 1943 devoted to her music. Other compositions from the Dartington years  included ''Theme and Variations'' for solo violin, String Trio No. 1 (premiered by the Dartington Hall String Trio at the [[National Gallery]] on 17 July 1944), songs from the 16th-century anthology [[Tottel's Miscellany]],  an oboe concerto, and a string quartet.<ref name= TS454/><ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 141<U+2013>42</ref>  In October 1943 the composer [[Benjamin Britten]] and the tenor [[Peter Pears]] gave the first of several recitals at Dartington.    A mutual respect and friendship developed between Britten and Imogen, strengthened by their shared love of neglected music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 150<U+2013>51</ref>

From 1945,  while maintaining her commitment to Dartington, Imogen began to widen her musical activities. As well as editing and preparing scores for Britten, she promoted  Dartington as the base for Britten's new [[English Opera Group]], although eventually [[Glyndebourne]] was preferred.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 226 and 236</ref> In 1947 she encouraged the refugee violinist [[Norbert Brainin]] to form his own string quartet,<ref name= GS146/> and arranged its debut at Dartington, as the "Brainin Quartet", on 13 July 1947. Six months later, renamed the [[Amadeus Quartet]], the group appeared at the  Wigmore Hall, and went on to world-wide recognition.<ref>{{cite web|last= Potter|first= Tully|title= Amadeus Quartet|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/00724?q=Norbert+Brainin&search=quick&pos=3&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 19 February 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1948 she began work on a critical study of her father's music, a companion volume to her 1938 Holst biography.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", p. 151</ref> When this was published in 1951, most critics praised its objectivity, one critic venturing that she had been "unnecessarily harsh" in her judgements.<ref name= GS162>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 162<U+2013>65</ref>

Rising standards of achievement at Dartington  enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's [[Mass in B minor]] in July 1950 to honour the 300th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute from one of the audience: "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus".<ref name= GS146>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 146<U+2013>48</ref> By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two [[Aldeburgh Festival]]s in 1948 and   1949, and in 1950  accepted a commission   to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part II, 1931<U+2013>52", pp. 155<U+2013>57. The work was the song cycle for female voices and harp, ''Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow''.</ref> Sensing that it was time to leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music  at [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s university in West Bengal.<ref name= odnbI/> A fruit of this visit was her ''Ten Indian Folk Tunes'' for recorder.<ref name= T436>Tinker, p. 436</ref> On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, ''Benedick and Beatrice'', was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.<ref name= GS162/>

===Aldeburgh===
Without definite plans for her  future after Dartington, Imogen toured Europe, collecting music that she would later edit for performance, including madrigals by [[Carlo Gesualdo]] which she found "very exciting".<ref name= GS167/>  At home, although not formally employed by Britten, she worked with  him on  several projects, including a new performing version of Purcell's ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''<ref>Bridcut, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref> and   the preparation of the vocal and full scores for Britten's opera ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]''.<ref name= GS167>Grogan and Strode, "Part II: 1931<U+2013>1952", pp. 167<U+2013>70</ref>  Pears, who had observed Imogen's overall contributions to musical life at Dartington, believed she could help Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival on a more formal basis, and shortly after the 1952 festival Britten invited her to come and work with him. She agreed, and in September 1952  moved to lodgings in Aldeburgh.<ref>Carpenter, p. 309</ref>

====Assistant to Britten====
[[File:Benjamin Britten, London Records 1968 publicity photo for Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|upright|Benjamin Britten, photographed in the mid-1960s]]
When Imogen joined Britten, the financial arrangement was vague; Britten paid her on a piecemeal basis rather than a regular salary, unaware that she had made over her rights to her father's estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she   lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own physical comfort.<ref>Carpenter, p. 311</ref> For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Although she temporarily put her own compositional ambitions aside,<ref name="Grogan p. 176">Grogan, "Part III: 1952<U+2013>54", p. 176</ref> she did not abandon all other activities. She made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father's music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes.{{#tag:ref|Books written by Imogen Holst in this period include ''The Book of the Dolmetsch Descant Recorder'' (1957);<ref name="T436"/> ''Tune'' (1961);<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 364<U+2013>65</ref>  and ''An ABC of Music'' (1963).<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 374</ref>|group= n}}

For the first 18 months of her association with Britten, Imogen kept a diary  which, Grogan says, forms a record of her "unconditional belief in Britten's achievement and status, and her absolute devotion to his work".<ref name="Grogan p. 176"/> The first of Britten's works to which she made a significant contribution was the opera ''[[Gloriana]]'', scheduled to form part of the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|1953 Coronation celebrations]]. The short timescale for the writing of the opera placed  considerable pressure on the composer and his new assistant,<ref name= C306>Carpenter, pp. 306<U+2013>09</ref>   strains that were  dramatised 60 years later in a radio play, ''Imo and Ben''.{{#tag:ref|The play, by Mark Ravenhill, was broadcast on 30 June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last= Rees|first= Jasper|title= Imo and Ben: a new radio drama that shows the tensions in Benjamin Britten's working life|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10143079/Imo-and-Ben-a-new-radio-drama-that-shows-the-tensions-in-Benjamin-Brittens-working-life.html|newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 28 June 2013}}</ref>|group= n}}  Imogen's main task with ''Gloriana'' was to copy Britten's pencil sketches and prepare the vocal and piano scores  which  the singers needed for rehearsals by February 1953.<ref name= C306/><ref>White, p. 79</ref>  Later she assisted him with the writing of the full orchestral score,<ref>Carpenter, p. 317</ref> and performed similar services with his next opera, ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1954).<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 334<U+2013>35</ref> When Britten was under pressure during the composition of his ballet ''The Prince of the Pagodas'' (1956), Imogen accompanied him to Switzerland, to remain by his side as he completed the  work.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 348<U+2013>49</ref>{{#tag:ref|Britten dedicated the ballet jointly to Imogen and [[Ninette de Valois]].<ref>White, p. 82</ref>|group= n}}   Imogen took great pleasure in her association with Britten's children's opera ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' (1957),  for which she showed Britten how to achieve a unique raindrop effect by hitting a row of china mugs with a wooden spoon.<ref>Carpenter, p. 382</ref> She and Britten combined to collect and publish music for the recorder, in a series published by Boosey and Hawkes (1954<U+2013>59),<ref name= T436/> and jointly wrote a popular introductory book, ''The Story of Music'' (1958).<ref>White, p. 86</ref>

Imogen assisted Britten with  all his major compositions until 1964.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 361<U+2013>73</ref> At that point, conscious of time passing, she determined to give priority to the final securing of her father's musical legacy, and to re-establish her credentials as a composer. She relinquished her post as Britten's assistant to Rosamund Strode, although she did not leave Aldeburgh or break with Britten, continuing her work with the Aldeburgh Festival for a further 13 years.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 374<U+2013>75</ref>

====Artistic director====
From the time of her arrival in Aldeburgh Imogen gave considerable support and assistance to the Aldeburgh Festival, as a conductor and, from 1953, increasingly as a planner and organiser.<ref>Grogan, "Part III: 1952<U+2013>54", p. 157</ref> In 1956 her position was formalised, and she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, with responsibility for programmes and performers.<ref name= G336>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 336</ref> At the 1956 festival she fulfilled a long-held ambition by arranging a performance of Gustav Holst's opera ''[[Savitri (opera)|Savitri]]'',<ref name= G345>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 345</ref>  the first of several Holst works that she introduced to the festival.{{#tag:ref|In 1961 Imogen persuaded Britten to conduct   Gustav Holst's tone-poem ''Egdon Heath'', and the following year saw a performance of ''Ode to Death''.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 366<U+2013>67</ref> |group= n}} ''Savitri'' was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of [[John Blow]]'s 17th century opera ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]''.<ref name= G345/><ref>Carpenter, p. 369</ref> In 1957 she instituted late-night  concerts devoted to early music, and in 1962 she organised a series of evening concerts of [[Flemish music#Classical music|Flemish music]], in which she had more recently become interested.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 352 and 367<U+2013>68</ref> She also devised frequent programmes devoted to church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church.<ref>White, p. 65</ref> Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Imogen had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she  lived for the rest of her life.{{#tag:ref|The house was built on the edge of the site where it had been hoped to build a Festival Theatre. When that plan was abandoned in favour of a move to [[Snape Maltings]], the bungalow was built anyway by the architect H. T.

In 1964,  after giving up her role as Britten's assistant,  Imogen   began composing again, and in 1965 accepted commissions for two large-scale works: ''The Sun's Journey'', a cantata for female voices, and the ''Trianon Suite'', composed for the Trianon Youth Orchestra of [[Ipswich]].<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 384</ref> In 1965 and 1966 she published two books, studies of Bach and Britten. The latter work caused ill-feelings among several key figures in Britten's earlier career with whom he had subsequently fallen out, such as his former librettists [[Eric Crozier]] and [[Ronald Duncan]], whose contributions to Britten's success were ignored in the book.<ref name= Carpenter468>Carpenter, pp. 468<U+2013>69</ref><ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 382 and 387</ref> Between 1966 and 1970 Imogen recorded a number of her father's works with the Purcell Singers and the [[English Chamber Orchestra]], under the Argo and Lyrita labels.<ref>{{cite web|last= Stuart|first= Philip|title= Decca Classical 1929<U+2013>2009|url= http://images.cch.kcl.ac.uk/charm/liv/pubs/DeccaComplete.pdf|publisher= AHRC  Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music|date= June 2009|accessdate= 21 March 2014}} (Items 1383, 1395, 1419, 1518 and 1688)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Holst: Vocal Works|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Australian%2BEloquence/ELQ4802327|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 17 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=  Holst: Songs, Terzetto, Canons & Medieval Lyrics|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Australian%2BEloquence/ELQ4802327|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 17 February 2014}}</ref> Among these recordings was the ''Double Violin Concerto'' for which, forty years earlier, she had acted as the rehearsal pianist before the first performance.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 388 and 399</ref>

Imogen had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears.<ref>Grogan, "Part III, 1952<U+2013>54", pp. 188</ref><ref name= Grogan317>Grogan, "Part III, 1952<U+2013>54", p. 317</ref> From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely-heard medieval music  to 20th-century works.<ref name= odnbI>{{cite web|last= Strode|first= Rosamund|title= Holst, Imogen Clare|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31251|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate= 17 February 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Tinker|first= Christopher|title= Holst, Imogen Clare|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/13254?q=Imogen+Holst&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 17 February 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone [[John Shirley-Quirk]], the tenors [[Robert Tear]] and [[Philip Langridge]], and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Sch<U+00FC>tz Choir, [[Roger Norrington]].<ref>Grogan , "Part IV, 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 371<U+2013>72</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Pratt|first= George|title= Norrington, Sir Roger  Arthur Carver|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20079?q=Roger+Norrington&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Oxford Music online|accessdate= 17 February 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in [[Orford, Suffolk|Orford]] church of [[Thomas Tallis]]'s forty-part motet ''[[Spem in alium]]'', on 2 July 1963.<ref>Wake-Walker, p. 190</ref>     When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its  musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's  Sch<U+00FC>tz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister [[Grayston Burgess]].<ref>Grogan, "Part IV, 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 389<U+2013>90</ref>

On 2 June 1967 Imogen shared the podium with Britten  in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the [[Snape Maltings]].{{#tag:ref|In 1969, just after the opening concert of that year's festival, the Maltings was destroyed by fire; it was rebuilt in time for the 1970 festival.<ref name= festival>{{cite web|last= Goodwin|first= Noel|title= Aldeburgh Festival|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/00500?q=Aldeburgh+Festival&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 1 March 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref>|group= n}} From 1972 Imogen was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes  and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra.<ref name= festival/> By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at [[Framlingham Castle]]. A report of the event described an evening of "persistent drizzle&nbsp;... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before".<ref>Wake-Walker, p. 193</ref>

Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 549 and 585</ref> Imogen was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship  with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 decided she would retire as artistic director after the 1977 festival. That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor [[Andr<U+00E9> Previn]] at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 414<U+2013>16</ref>

===Late career===

Gustav Holst's centenary was celebrated in 1974, when Imogen published a revised biography in Faber's "Great Composers" series and a ''Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music''.<ref name= G406>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 406<U+2013>07</ref> The centenary was the occasion for the publication of the first volume of a facsimile edition of  her father's manuscripts, on which Imogen worked with the help of the composer [[Colin Matthews]].<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 404 and 410</ref> Three more facsimile volumes followed in the years up to 1983, at which point Imogen's own failing health led to the abandonment of the project.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 419<U+2013>20 and 429</ref> As part of the 1974 centenary, Imogen negotiated performances of  ''Savitri'' and ''[[The Wandering Scholar]]'' at Aldeburgh and [[Sadler's Wells]], and helped to arrange exhibitions of Holst's life and works at Aldeburgh and the [[Royal Festival Hall]].<ref name= G406/>

Apart from her books concerned with her father's life and works, Imogen continued to write on other aspects of music. In addition to numerous articles she published a short  study of the Renaissance composer [[William Byrd]] (1972)<ref>{{cite web|title= Byrd (Great Composers)|url= http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1164845896&searchurl=an%3DImogen%2BHolst%26amp%3Bsts%3Dt%26amp%3Btn%3DByrd|publisher= AbeBooks|accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref> and a handbook for conductors of amateur choirs (1973).<ref>{{cite web|title= Conducting a Choir: a guide for amateurs|url= http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=6354942691&searchurl=an%3DImogen%2BHolst%26amp%3Bbi%3D0%26amp%3Bbx%3Doff%26amp%3Bds%3D30%26amp%3Bfe%3Don%26amp%3Brecentlyadded%3Dall%26amp%3Bsortby%3D17%26amp%3Btn%3DConducting%2Ba%2BChoir%26amp%3Bx%3D57%26amp%3By%3D14|publisher= AbeBooks|accessdate= 3 March 2014}}</ref> She continued to compose, usually short pieces but with occasional larger-scale orchestral works such as the ''Woodbridge Suite'' (1970) and the ''Deben Calendar'' (1977), the latter a series of twelve sketches depicting the River Deben in Suffolk at different phases of the year.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 396 and 419</ref>  Her last major composition was a String Quintet, written in 1982 and performed in October of that year by the [[Endellion Quartet]], augmented by the cellist [[Steven Isserlis]].<ref name= G425/>

In April 1979 Imogen was present when the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] opened the new Britten<U+2013>Pears School building in Snape. The building included a new library<U+2014>the Gustav Holst Library<U+2014>to which Imogen had donated a large amount of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 422</ref> She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a  70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.<ref name= G425>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", p. 425</ref>

=== Illness, death, tributes ===
Shortly after  the 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Imogen became seriously ill with what she described as "a coronary angina".<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 418<U+2013>19</ref> Thereafter, [[angina]] was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at  home  of heart failure  on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's.<ref>Grogan, "Part IV: 1955<U+2013>84", pp. 427<U+2013>30</ref> An obituary tribute in the  magazine ''Early Music''  emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she "[brought] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomson|first= John|title= Imogen Holst|journal= Early Music|volume= 12|issue= 4|date= November 1984|pages= pp. 583<U+2013>84}}</ref>   Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her&nbsp;... content with  few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain what most of us need twice that time to do".<ref name= Obit/>

In 2007, Imogen's centenary was recognised at Aldeburgh by several special events, including  a recital in the parish church by the Navarra Quartet in which works by Purcell and Schubert were mixed with Imogen's own ''The Fall of the Leaf'' for solo cello, and the String Quintet. The latter work was described by Andrew Clements in ''The Guardian'' as "genuinely memorable&nbsp;... The set of variations with which the quintet ends dissolves into a series of bare solo lines, linking Holst's music to her father's".<ref>{{cite news|last= Clements|first= Andrew|title= A Celebration of Imogen Holst|url= http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/23/classicalmusicandopera|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 23 October 2007}}</ref>

Imogen never married, though   she enjoyed a number of romantic friendships, notably with the future poet Miles Tomalin, whom she met when she was a   pupil at St Pauls.<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> The two were close until 1929, and exchanged poetry;<ref>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", pp. 57<U+2013>65</ref> Tomalin married in 1931.<ref name= GS66>Grogan and Strode, "Part I: 1907<U+2013>31", p. 66</ref>  Many years after the relationship ended, Imogen admitted to  Britten that she would have married Tomalin.<ref name= GS66/>

===Honours===
Imogen was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1966. She was awarded  [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]]  from the universities of [[University of Essex|Essex]] (1968),   [[University of Exeter|Exeter]] (1969), and   [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] (1983). She was given honorary membership of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1970. In 1975 she was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Companion of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).<ref name= odnbI/>

Early in her compositional career Imogen was primarily influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter,  by what the analyst Christopher Tinker terms  "her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment", and by her close personal relationship with her father.<ref name= T434/> Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who taught her at the RCM.<ref name= T444>Tinker, pp. 444<U+2013>45</ref> In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but  composed little music herself.<ref name= IHM/> The personal style that emerged in the 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English  music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the ''Five Songs'' (1944).<ref name= IHM/><ref name= T444/> This experimentation reappears in later works; in ''Hallo My Fancy'' (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice.<ref name= IHM/> In ''Homage to William Morris''  (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]  "to add strength to the musical articulation of the text".<ref>Tinker, p. 443</ref> By contrast,  the String Quintet of 1982,  the work which Imogen herself thought made her "a real composer", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.<ref name= IHM/><ref name= T448/>

Much of Imogen's choral music was written for amateur performance. Critics have observed a clear  distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women's voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer.<ref>Tinker, p. 440</ref> Record companies were slow in recognising Imogen's commercial potential, and not until 2009 was an entire CD issued devoted entirely to her music<U+2014>a selection of her works for strings.<ref>{{cite web|title= Imogen Holst: String Chamber Music|url=http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Court%2BLane%2BMusic/CLM37601|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 25 March 2014}}</ref> The ''Guardian''{{'}}s reviewer welcomed the recording: "[T]here is a great deal of English music of far less worth that is frequently praised to the skies".<ref>{{cite news|last= Clements|first= Andrew|title= Imogen Holst: String Chamber Music: Court Lane Music|url= http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/30/imogen-holst-string-chamber-music|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 30 January 2009}}</ref>  In 2012  a selection of her choral music, sung by the [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi.<ref>{{cite web|title= Imogen Holst: Choral Works|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Harmonia%2BMundi/HMU907576|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 8 March 2014}}</ref> One review of this recording  picks out ''Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow'', written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as "[giving] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice".<ref name= Maddocks/> Another mentions the "Three Psalms" setting, where "inner rhythms are underscored by the subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath".<ref name= indy/>
