In 1980 while studying [[civil engineering]] at [[University of Sydney]], Blades was a founding member of electronic music group The East End Butchers with Doyle.<ref name=priest-em-contribs>{{cite book|last=Priest|first=Gail|title=Experimental Music : Audio Explorations in Australia|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney, N.S.W.|isbn=9781921410079|pages=vii|editor=Gail Priest|accessdate=4 December 2011|page=vii|chapter=Contributors|chapterurl=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZOQqDz0Snm4C&lpg=PP1&dq=Experimental%20Music%20%3A%20Audio%20Explorations%20in%20Australia&pg=PT7#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="HolmgrenLC">{{Cite web | url = http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/l/laughingclowns.html |work=[[Australian Rock Database]] | title = The Laughing Clowns | publisher = Magnus Holmgren | last1 = Holmgren | first1 = Magnus | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}</ref> In 1982 he was a founding member of The Loop Quartet, with [[Richard Fielding]] (ex-[[Severed Heads]]), Ron Brown and [[Jaimie Leonarder]].<ref name=priest-em>{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Ian|title=Experimental Music : Audio Explorations in Australia|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney, N.S.W.|isbn=9781921410079|pages=47|last2=Blades|first2=John (consultation)|editor=Gail Priest|accessdate=25 November 2011|page=47|chapter=The Lost Decade: Post-Punk, Experimental and Industrial Music|chapterurl=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZOQqDz0Snm4C&lpg=PP1&dq=Experimental%20Music%20%3A%20Audio%20Explorations%20in%20Australia&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=%22John%20Blades%22&f=false}}</ref> During that year, the quartet performed a radio studio live to air experimental performance using loops on reel-to-reel tape machines.<ref name=hypnotique>{{cite web|title=Hypnotique - Loop Orchestra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/adlib/stories/s909510.htm|work=Australia Adlib|publisher=[[Radio National|ABC Radio National]] ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=2003}}</ref> Blade also formed and performed in other groups: War Meat and the Dictator, and Men Like Licorice, both in 1982.<ref name=priest-em-contribs/> That year, Blade also started working as a structural engineer for [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] (RTA): he specialised in bridge engineering.<ref name="Blades08">{{cite web|last=Blades|first=John|title=8.

[[Annette Shun Wah]] from [[SBS TV]]'s ''The Noise'' programme interviewed the band and Blades described their work, 
<blockquote>for the piece, ''Suspense'', the sound sources were all concrete, that is, all pre-existing sounds, and it was a study of the way sounds and music is constructed for suspense in horror movies. So it's all taken from scores for those films - generally untreated sections of the scores from those films, from the 1940s, through to films like ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' of the 1950s, right through to ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' in the 1970s and ''[[Evil Dead]]'' in the 1980s, and so they're fragments of sound. It's like deconstructing an existing sound source and reconstructing - or structuring - something else out of that deconstruction.<ref name=sbs-1990>{{cite web|last=Shun Wah|first=Annette|authorlink=Annette Shun Wah|title=The Loop Orchestra: interview on The Noise on SBS 1990 With John Blades and Peter Doyle|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBdpdRKj498|work=The Noise|publisher=[[SBS TV|SBS]]|accessdate=25 November 2011|archiveurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBdpdRKj498|archivedate=16 September 2010|year=1990}}</ref></blockquote>

By 1993 Blades' MS had progressed and he was wheelchair-bound but he continued with his work at RTA, with The Loop Orchestra and on radio.<ref name="Blades04">{{cite web|last=Blades|first=John|title=4.

<blockquote>Multiple sclerosis sentenced John Blades to a wheelchair, where no doubt it was expected that he would spiral slowly out of view. The contrary happened and with committed zeal, he has become a major figure in the Sydney alternative music scene, organising & conducting his Loop Orchestra, promoting & supporting new music and outsider art. Not only have his activities kept his mental state together, he tells me that his condition has actually been reversed through his involvement with music. Physical healing with music is not just the province of new agers <U+2013> music can be as practical as taking aspirin.<ref name=rose-glanville-hicks>{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Jon|title=Listening to history: some proposals for reclaiming the practice of music|url=http://www.newmusicnetwork.com.au/PGH/JR07.html|work=9th Annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address 2007|publisher=New Music Network|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=3 December 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Radio ===
During 1981 John Blades was invited by Ian Hartley to appear on the [[2MBS]]' radio programme, ''Disc Noir'', to present samples of his music collection.<ref name="Blades01"/> Hartley asked Blades to host his own show, ''Hot Dog You Bet'', which was broadcast by 2MBS from 1982 to 1985.<ref name=night-sweats2/> Fielding had suggested the name of the show, inspired by "a flexi disc released with a New York art magazine called Smegma, an audio collage".<ref name=night-sweats2>{{cite web|last=Blades|first=John|title=2.

In March 1998, due to the severity of his MS which reduced his mobility, Blades finished working at the RTA.<ref name="Blades08"/> His most pleasing work as an engineer was on the [[ANZAC Bridge|Glebe Island Bridge]]: "I designed water drainage system from the bridge deck to the underground stormwater system".<ref name="Blades08"/> From 1998 Blades presented a fortnightly radio programme, ''Background Noise'', with initial co-host Fielding, and from 2003, another ex-Severed Heads musician, [[Garry Bradbury]]<ref name=2mbs-schedule>{{cite web|title=Light music, Jazz and Contemporary|url=http://www.2mbs.com/content_common/pg-light-music-jazz-and-contemporary.seo|work=2MBS-FM Programming Schedule|publisher=2MBS FM Radio|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> on 2MBS. The programme featured "mainly experimental music with innovative film soundtracks, radio plays and spoken word".<ref name=night-sweats2>{{cite web}}</ref> During his time at 2MBS FM, Blades also founded the Contemporary Music Collective (CMC), a group of radio broadcasters and producers who supported noise and experimental music programmes after midnight, which differs from the station's usual programming of classical music during daytime. Other programmes include ''Eclectic Chair'', ''The Dust Museum'' and ''Our World Through Seratonin''. In 2004 CMC organised a fund-raiser in 2004 called ''Discollaboration'' to celebrate 22 years on-air <U+2013> Severed Heads played live, along with radio presenters and CMC members. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s reporter, Sunanda Creagh, wrote:
<blockquote>For 22 years, the station with a split personality has broadcast an eclectic mix of noise music, samples, mashed-up radio plays and live sound art from midnight to 3am from Monday to Thursday, placing it at the centre of Sydney's experimental music scene.<ref name=smh-2004>{{cite web|last=Creagh|first=Sunanda|title=Wayward children of the air could drive granny wild|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/01/1093938999910.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=2 September 2004}}</ref></blockquote>
