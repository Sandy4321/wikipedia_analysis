'''Three Rivers Stadium''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] from 1970 to 2000. It was home to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise and [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise respectively.

Built as a replacement to [[Forbes Field]], which opened in 1909, the [[United States dollar|US$]]55&nbsp;million multi-purpose was designed to maximize efficiency. Ground was broken in April 1968 and an oft behind-schedule construction plan lasted for 29&nbsp;months.<ref name=Slices/> The stadium opened on [[July 16]], [[1970]] when the Pirates played their first game. In the [[1971 World Series]], Three Rivers Stadium hosted the first World Series game played at night. The following year the stadium was the site of the [[Immaculate Reception]], which is regarded as the greatest play in NFL history. The final game was in the stadium was won by the Steelers on [[December 16]], [[2000]]. Three Rivers Stadium also hosted the [[Pittsburgh Maulers]], of the [[United States Football League]], and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh Panthers]] for a single season each.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.usfl.info/maulers/|title= Pittsburgh Maulers|accessdate=2008-08-07 |publisher= USFL.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/don_banks/news/2000/12/13/banks_insider_dec13/|title= A fond farewell |accessdate=2008-08-07 |publisher= [[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date= 2000-12-15}}</ref>

==History==
===Planning and construction===
A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948, however, plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s.<ref name=Meh9>{{harvnb|Mehno|1995|pp=9}}</ref> The Pittsburgh Pirates played their home games at [[Forbes Field]], which opened in 1909,<ref>{{harvnb|Leventhal|2000|pp=52}}</ref> and was the only baseball field younger than [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago]].<ref name=Meh9/> The Pittsburgh Steelers, who had moved from Forbes Field to [[Pitt Stadium]] in 1964, were large supporters of the project.<ref name=Meh9/> In an attempt to expand their campus, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] purchased Forbes Field with an agreement to lease the stadium to the Pirates until a replacement could be built.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehno|1995|pp=9<U+2013>10}}</ref> An early design of the stadium included plans to situate the stadium atop a bridge across the [[Monongahela River]], however, plans of the "Stadium over the Monongahela" were not pursued.<ref name=Lev51/> A design was presented in 1958 which featured an open center&nbsp;field design<U+2014>through which fans could view Pittsburgh's "[[Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Golden Triangle]]".<ref name=Meh10>{{harvnb|Mehno|1995|pp=10}}</ref> A site on the city's [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]] was approved on [[August 10]], [[1958]], due to land availability and parking space,<ref name=Meh10/> the latter of which had been a problem at Forbes Field.<ref name=Meh9/> The same site had hosted [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], which the Pirates' had left in 1909.<ref>{{harvnb|McCollister|1998|pp=175}}</ref>  Political debate continued over the ''North Side Sports Stadium'' and the project was often behind schedule and over-budget.<ref name=Meh10/> Arguments were made by commissioner Dr. William McCelland that the Pirates and Steelers should fund a higher percentage of the $33&nbsp;million project. Due to lack of support, however, the arguments faded.<ref name=Meh10/>

Ground for Three Rivers Stadium was broken on [[April 25]], [[1968]].<ref name=Meh10/> Due to the Steelers' suggestions, the stadium's design was changed to enclose center&nbsp;field.<ref name=Meh10/> Construction continued, though it became plagued with problems such as thieves stealing materials from the building site.<ref name=Meh10/> In November 1969, Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3&nbsp;million, which was granted.<ref name=Meh13>{{harvnb|Mehno|1995|pp=13}}</ref> In January 1970, the opening target date of the stadium was set on [[May 29]], however, because of a failure to install the lights on schedule opening day was pushed back to [[July 16]].<ref name=Meh13/> The stadium was named due to its location at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] and [[Monongahela River]], which forms the [[Ohio River]]. It would sometimes be called ''The House That Clemente Built'' after after Pirates' right-fielder [[Roberto Clemente]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gershman|1993|pp=224}}</ref>

===Design and alterations===
Three Rivers Stadium was similar in design to other stadiums built in the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[Riverfront Stadium|Cinergy Field]] and the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]], which were designed as multi-purpose facilities to maximize efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Gershman|1993|pp=191}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Creating Breakthrough Products|last= Cagan|first= Jonathan|coauthors= Craig M.
