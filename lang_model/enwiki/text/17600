'''Turning Point (2008)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|event]] produced by the [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], which took place on November 9, 2008 at the [[TNA Impact! Zone]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. It was the fourth event under the [[TNA Turning Point|Turning Point]] chronology and first event under the name to take place in November. It was originally scheduled to take place in December, but TNA moved the event to November in late-2008, for an unknown reason. Eight [[mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were featured on the event's [[card (sports)|card]].

The [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]] for the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] between the champion, [[Steve Borden|Sting]], and the challenger, [[A.J. Styles]], in which Sting retained the championship. Another featured match was also a standard wrestling match, in which [[Kevin Nash]] defeated [[Samoa Joe]]. [[Kurt Angle]] defeated [[Chris Parks|Abyss]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. The [[TNA Legends Championship]] was defended for the first time, as [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], who was accompanied by [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]], successfully defended the championship against [[Jason Reso|Christian Cage]].

The professional wrestling section of the [[Canadian Online Explorer]] website rated the event a 7 out of 10, which was just above the [[TNA Turning Point#2007|2007 event's]] rating of 6.5.

===Storylines===
{{See also|Professional wrestling}}
Turning Point featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] in the scripted events that build tension and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches.

[[File:AJ Styles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[A.J. Styles]] fought [[Steve Borden|Sting]] for the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] at Turning Point.]]
Heading into Turning Point, TNA's main storyline was an [[Kayfabe|on-screen]] [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] between [[professional wrestling]] veterans, who played the villains and made up a group of wrestlers that called themselves [[The Main Event Mafia]] ([[Steve Borden|Sting]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]]), and the [[The TNA Front Line|younger talent]] of the company, who play the heroic type characters in the storyline and were led by [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Samoa Joe]]. Multiple smaller rivalries broke off from this storyline, such as one over the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] between the reigning champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles, which began in early August at TNA's [[Hard Justice (2008)|Hard Justice]] PPV event on August 10 when Sting assaulted Styles after his encounter with [[Kurt Angle]].<ref name="WVHJ08">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1218423570.shtml|title=Hard Justice PPV results - 8/10 - Trenton, NJ (Joe vs. Booker T, more)|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-08-10|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> Sting then went on to defeat an ally of Styles', Joe, at TNA's PPV event [[Bound for Glory IV]] on October 12 after an assist from Nash, which later sparked a rivalry between Joe and Nash.<ref name="SlamBFGIV">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/10/13/7066311.html|title=Sting takes title at Bound for Glory|date=2008-10-13|last=Sokol|first=Chris|coauthors=Sokol, Bryan|accessdate=2009-10-25|work=SLAM!

Joe's rivalry with Nash also broke off from the storyline, however, build to a future encounter between the two began in 2007.

Sting and Styles went on to have another match for the TNA Championship at Final Resolution. This time the rules were different than their standard wrestling match at Turning Point, with the team of Sting, Steiner, Nash, and Booker T (The Main Event Mafia) facing off against Styles, Joe, and two mystery partners (The TNA Front Line) for the TNA Championship in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Eight Man Tag Team match]]. The stipulations were if anyone from Styles' team pinned a member of Sting's team then Styles won the TNA Title, while if anyone from Sting's team pinned a members of Styles' team, then Sting retained the title. The match was announced on the November 20 episode of ''Impact!''.<ref name="WVImpact112008"/> Styles' mystery partners were revealed on the November 27 episode of ''Impact!'' as being [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]] ([[Devon Hughes|Brother Devon]] and [[Mark LoMonaco|Brother Ray]]).<ref name="SlamImpact!112708">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/11/28/7565206.html|title=Impact: Bring out the turkeys|date=2009-11-28|last=Sokol|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-10-25|work=SLAM!
