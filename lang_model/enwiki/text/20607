The '''Lantern Theatre''' (Originally called The Chalet Theatre) is a small [[Sheffield]] theatre (seating capacity 84) that hosts performances from local Sheffield groups and schools. The theatre is situated in the residential area of [[Nether Edge]]. It was originally the personal theatre of a local industrialist, however it fell into disrepair after his death. It was restored as a theatre in 1957 by Dilys Guite.

The Theatre was used almost exclusively by the Dilys Guite Players (who own and run the theatre) for the first forty years but in the last ten years the theatre has been hired out by the players and used by a number of groups, bands and companies.
