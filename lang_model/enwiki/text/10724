{{Civil union}}
'''[[Civil union]]''' is legal in '''[[New Zealand]]''' since April 26, 2005. The [[Civil Union Act 2004|Civil Union Act]] to establish the institution of civil union for [[same-sex couples|same-sex]] and opposite-sex couples was passed by the [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] on 9 December 2004.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0102/latest/DLM323385.html Civil Union Act 2004]</ref><ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=9002456 Civil Unions Bill passed]</ref> The Act has been described as very similar to the [[Marriage Act]] with references to "[[marriage]]" replaced by "civil union". A companion bill, the [[Relationships (Statutory References) Act]], was passed shortly thereafter on 15 March 2005, to remove discriminatory provisions on the basis of [[marital status|relationship status]] from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a [[de facto]] partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to [[immigration]], [[next-of-kin]] status, [[social welfare]], matrimonial property and other areas. Non-married couples are not however permitted to adopt children, although people in non-marital relationships can adopt as individuals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10591948|title=Judge: Time to let gay couples adopt|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=2009-08-20 }}</ref>

==History==
Both the Civil Union Bill and the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill were promoted as part of their Ministerial responsibilities by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MPs and Ministers [[David Benson-Pope]] and [[Lianne Dalziel]]. The Civil Union Bill was treated as a [[conscience vote|conscience]] issue by most parties, including the largest parties on the left and right, and passed its third and final reading by 65 votes to 55. The table below shows the breakdown of votes by party for the final reading of the Bill. (see also: [http://commonz.wotfun.com/bill/1 Searchable database of individual votes on bill], and [http://commonz.wotfun.com/bill/8 Relationships (Statutory References)]).

During consideration of the bill, various amendments were proposed. These included making the issue subject to a binding [[referendum]], (a motion moved by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Ron Mark]] who voted for the first two readings of the Bill, but against in its final vote). Another was to replace it with a "civil relationships" bill that would allow any two people to register any personal relationship and to gain joint property rights (moved by National MP Richard Worth, a consistent opponent of the bill). These proposals were dismissed by supporters of the bill as delaying tactics rather than serious proposals and were defeated in Parliament by a block vote of [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], and the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]].

The Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was also treated as a [[conscience vote]] and passed by 76 votes to 44 votes. Civil Unions came into effect on April 26, 2005 and at least two couples had applied for licenses by 9:30 that morning.

== Public opinion ==
Before passage, the New Zealand public narrowly supported the bill, with opinion polls indicating around 56 per cent in favour.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The bill was controversial in some quarters, attracting strong opposition from the [[Protestantism|evangelical]] [[Destiny Church]] and the [[Catholic Church in New Zealand]]. However, not all [[Christians]] were opposed to the Bill. Christians for Civil Unions played a role in the debates<ref>{{cite web |title=Christians support Civil Unions Bill |publisher=Scoop |date=2004-06-16 |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0406/S00157.htm}}</ref> along with other Christian groups including the [[Student Christian Movement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scm.org.nz/go/70 |title=Student Christian Movement submission on the Civil Union bill}}</ref>

In the build up to the vote, there were several instances of anti-gay and lesbian protests and rallies as a way of dissuading public favour. The most publicised rally was the 'Enough is Enough' march through central Wellington, terminating at Parliament, in August 2004. The march was organised by the [[Brian Tamaki]]-led [[Destiny Church]] and involved thousands of church members and supporters, many wearing black shirts, marching down Lambton Quay punching the air with their fists and chanting 'enough is enough'. Also present on this march were members of the Christian Heritage Party and white supremacist group [[New Zealand National Front|National Front]].

Other protest action saw a theology student cover the windows of [[David Benson-Pope]]'s South Dunedin electoral office with posters denouncing the bill. These bore the message 'Civil Unions Is [sic]Not Gay Marriage. Yeah Right' in a parody of Tui beer advertisements. On the same occasion a jar of excrement labelled 'Civil Unions Bill' was placed outside the office. A member of Dunedin's gay community had earlier had excrement placed in his letter box accompanied by an abusive note.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Three months after the Civil Union Act came into effect, a [[New Zealand Herald|Herald]]-DigiPoll survey revealed that a plurality of people who expressed an opinion either way were happy with the legislation. When asked "whether they were happy or unhappy with the way the law allowing civil unions is working," 46% said they were happy, 35.7% were unhappy, and 18.1% were undecided or refused to comment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=247&objectid=10333649 |title=Majority happy with civil union, prostitution laws |date=2005-07-01 |publisher=NZ Herald}}</ref>

Conservative Christian pressure groups like [[Family First New Zealand]] have questioned the apparent low uptake of civil unions.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0912/S00110.htm Civil Unions Irrelevant Five Years On]</ref> LGBT organisations respond that this criticism is unfounded because there are far fewer divorces after incompatible civil unions than is the case with heterosexual-only marriages, particularly amongst Southern US fundamentalist Christians, who tend to have a higher than average divorce rate.<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm U.S. divorce rates for various faith groups, age groups, & geographic areas]</ref> This suggests that those LGBT community members and heterosexuals who enter civil unions engage in more prior deliberation beforehand than those who enter heterosexual marriages.
