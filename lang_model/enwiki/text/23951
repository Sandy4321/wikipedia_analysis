'''Faneuil Hall''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>f<U+00E6>nl<U+0329>}}, previously {{IPA|/<U+02C8>f<U+028C>nl<U+0329>/}}), located near the waterfront and today's [[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Government Center]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], has been a marketplace and a meeting hall since [[1742]]. It was the site of several speeches by [[Samuel Adams]], [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]], and others encouraging independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and is now part of [[Boston National Historical Park]] and a well known stop on the [[Freedom Trail]]. It is sometimes referred to as "the Cradle of Liberty".<ref>[http://www.celebrateboston.com/sites/faneuilhall.htm Faneuil Hall Boston, the Cradle of Liberty]</ref>

==History==
The original Faneuil Hall was built by artist [[John Smibert]] in 1740<U+2013>1742 in the style of an English country market, with an open ground floor and an assembly room above, and funded by a wealthy Boston merchant, [[Peter Faneuil]]. The ground floor was originally used to house African sheep brought over from the northwestern region of New Hampshire. The program was short lived however, due to a shortage of sheep and reasoning behind the program in the first place.

The grasshopper [[weathervane]] is a well known symbol of Boston; see the section "[[Faneuil Hall#Grasshopper Weathervane|Grasshopper Weathervane]]", below. Knowledge of the grasshopper was used as a test to determine if people were spies during the Revolution period.  The people would ask suspected spies the identity of the object on the top of Faneuil Hall; if they answered correctly then they were free; if not, they were convicted as British spies.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

The hall burned down in 1761, but was rebuilt in 1762. In 1806, the hall was greatly expanded by [[Charles Bulfinch]], doubling its height and width and adding a third floor. Four new bays were added, to make seven in all; the open [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s were enclosed; and the [[cupola]] was moved to the opposite end of the building. Bulfinch applied [[Doric order|Doric]] brick [[pilaster]]s to the lower two floors, with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] pilasters on the third floor. This renovation added galleries around the assembly hall and increased its height. The building was entirely rebuilt in 1898<U+2013>1899, of noncombustible materials. The ground floor and basement were altered in 1979. The Hall was restored again in 1992. The building is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Fanueil Hall is now part of a larger [[festival marketplace]], [[Faneuil Hall Marketplace]], which includes three long granite buildings called North Market, [[Quincy Market]], and South Market, and which now operates as an outdoor<U+2013>indoor mall and food eatery. It was managed by [[The Rouse Company]]; its success in the late 1970s led to the emergence of similar marketplaces in other U.S. cities.

On [[November 3]], [[2004]], Faneuil Hall was the site of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]'s concession speech in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].

Faneuil Hall is also the headquarters of the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts]] founded 1638.

Though ''Faneuil'' is a French name, it is pronounced ['f<U+00E6>n.<U+0259>l]  or ['f<U+00E6>n<U+02CC>.j<U+0259>l] rather than [fa.n<U+00F8>j]. Native Bostonians generally pronounce it to rhyme with ''panel'', ''manual'', or ''Daniel.''<!------/* History */ unless cited, no need to say "these are the three ways it's pronounced: A, B, and C, with A being used by older people and B being used, too.  Also, C is used.-------, with the first generally preferred by [[baby boomer]] and older residents, and the last fairly common as well. Rhyming it with ''manual'' is often heard as well.---> There is some evidence that it was pronounced quite differently in Colonial times, as in ''funnel''. Peter Faneuil's gravestone is marked "P. Funel", although the inscription was added long after his burial. The stone originally displayed only the Faneuil family crest, not his surname.

The bell was repaired in 2007 by spraying the frozen clapper with [[WD-40]] over the course of a week and attaching a rope. The last known ringing of the bell with its clapper was at the end of [[World War II]], in 1945; it has since been rung several times by striking with a mallet.<ref>{{cite news

==Grasshopper Weathervane==
[[Image:Faneuilgrasshopper.JPG|thumb|left|The gilded grasshopper weathervane atop Faneuil Hall]]
The gilded grasshopper [[weathervane]] on top of the building was created by [[silversmith]] [[Shem Drowne]] in [[1742]] and was modeled on the grasshopper weathervane on the London [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], thus associating the new building in the New World with a great center of finance of the Old World. As strange as it seems, the weathervane was first, accidentally, brought and placed atop the [[Wren Building]] at the [[College of William and Mary]] in Williamsburg, Virginia. After 3 months, designers realized that they had actually ordered a butterfly weathervane which was mistakenly shipped to Charlestown, SC. Six weeks later order was restored as Faneuil Hall received its grasshopper, William and Mary got its butterfly and [[Charlestown Town Hall]] was left with no weathervane at all.

The weathervane has a total weight of thirty-eight pounds and is fifty-two inches long. Made of solid copper covered with gold leaf, it has glass eyes which are said to have begun life as door-knobs.

The origin of the grasshopper comes from the family crest of [[Sir Thomas Gresham]], founder of the Royal Exchange in [[1565]].
