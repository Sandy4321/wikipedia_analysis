The '''R188''' is an [[A Division (New York City Subway)|A Division]] car for the [[New York City Subway]]. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|MTA]] is displacing the [[R62A (New York City Subway car)|R62As]] from the {{NYCS trains|Flushing|type=service}} with these cars and to [[Automation of the New York City Subway|automate]] the [[IRT Flushing Line]]. The R188 is part of both the fourth and fifth generation of New York City Subway A Division rolling stock; many fourth-generation R142As are being converted to R188s, along with deliveries of new R188 cars.

In addition to providing six extra 11-car trains for the [[7 Subway Extension]], the R188s will allow twenty R62A expansion cars to be freed up for the other seven IRT services.

At the time that the R188 order was placed, forty R62A 11-car trainsets were assigned to the 7 service. The R188 order originally consisted of 186 new cars, as well as 131 converted [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A cars]] compatible with [[communication-based train control]] (CBTC) and an additional 189 R142A conversion kits for MTA, totaling a possible 506 cars, or in other words, 46 11-car trains. Given this number, it can be deduced that 230 of these cars will be arranged in 5-car sets while the remaining 276 cars will be arranged in 6-car sets.<ref name="thejoekorner">http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/r34188sol.pdf</ref> Six extra R188 trainsets were ordered in conjunction with CBTC installation and 7 Subway Extension.

According to the 2010<U+2013>2014 capital plan, 146 new cars were to be purchased. Of these new cars, 110 cars would go to make up 10 new 11-car trains, while the remaining 36 cars were to be "C" cars that would go to expanding 36 CBTC upgraded R142A 5-car sets (360 existing cars) to 6-car length. The original planned total of 46 11-car trains (506 cars) would still result from this order.<ref name="page92">[http://web.archive.org/web/20101125211056/http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/091214_1200_cpoc.pdf Page 92]</ref>

In the latest revision, however, only 88 new cars were to be purchased to form 8 new 11-car trains, with 38 "C" cars, rather than ten 11-car trains. Likewise, the number of conversion cars was altered to 370. This change was made with the knowledge that only two ten-car R62A growth sets for the mainline IRT would be needed, as opposed to the projected four sets, and thus the MTA and Kawasaki opted to convert two additional R142A train sets in place of manufacturing two new sets. The MTA also decided to have Kawasaki perform all of the conversions at the Yonkers plant instead of 207th Street Shop as part of that contract modification.<ref name="modification">http://i42.tinypic.com/r2oqb8.jpg Modification to purchase document</ref>

===Contract===
The R188 contract was awarded in Spring 2010 to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], who won by default since only two manufacturers qualified and [[Bombardier Transportation]] opted not to bid on the contract citing the small order and large requirement for engineering resources. The contract was specified at $87,094,272 for the base order, which consisted of 33 cars (23 new cars and 10 conversions), and $384,315,168 for the option order, which consisted of 473 cars (123 new cars, and 350 conversions) for a total price of $471,409,440.

According to the latest update, the MTA expects to have 8 conversion sets in service by the time that the [[7 Subway Extension]] is opened for revenue service in November 2014. In addition, the breakdown of the trainsets has been disclosed. Operationally, the R188s are coupled as such: A-C-B-B-A+A-B-B-B-C-A; where dashes signify link bars and the addition sign denotes couplers. Thirty-eight R142A B cars, therefore, will be converted into R188 "C" cars, in addition to the 38 deliveries of new "C" cars (not including the "C" cars in the eight new 11-car sets).<ref>http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/120227_1400_CPOC.pdf</ref>

===Entering revenue service===
The 10 converted R142A cars from the base order (numbers 7211-7220) were completed in December 2011 at Kawasaki's Yonkers facility, and were delivered for testing on the Flushing line in 2012. The 23 new cars from the base order (numbered 7811-7832) were completed in mid-2012, delivered in November 2013, and entered service in December 2013. The new 66 option cars (numbers 7833-7898) were also completed in mid-2012 and are currently being delivered since November 22, 2013, while the remaining 37 new cars and the 370 conversions are currently being converted and delivered since February 2014 until the 4th quarter of 2015.<ref>http://mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/100426_1100_Transit.pdf Page 100 (Document), or Page 108 (PDF reader)</ref><ref>http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/cbtc-trials-on-new-yorks-flushing-line.html</ref>

On November 9, 2013, the first R188 train, consisting of cars 7811-7821, entered service on the 7 train as part of its 30 day revenue test.<ref>http://new.mta.info/news/2013/11/18/new-subway-cars-being-put-test</ref> After successful completion, it entered revenue service by December 15, 2013.<ref>[http://www.thejoekorner.com/carassignments/irt-2013-12-15.html A Division Train Assignments 12-15-2013]</ref>
