'''LaToyia Figueroa''' (January 26, 1981 &ndash; August 2005) was an [[United States|American]] woman of [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] descent who was reported missing on July 18, 2005, and later found strangled to death after being featured on [http://www.amw.com/missing_persons/brief.cfm?id=33641 America's Most Wanted]. Figueroa, who was five months pregnant at the time, was reported missing after she failed to show up to work.

Police discovered Figueroa's remains in a grassy, partially wooded lot in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], located 13 miles south of [[Philadelphia]].  They arrested Stephen Poaches, the father of her unborn child, on August 20, more than a month after she was reported missing.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EED7103EF932A1575BC0A9639C8B63&scp=2&sq=latoyia+figueroa&st=nyt  Missing Philadelphia Woman Is Found Dead]</ref>  On October 17, 2006, Poaches was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Figueroa and her unborn child.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&id=4669083 Poaches Convicted of Figueroa Murders]</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/17/girlfriend.killed.ap/index.html   Man guilty of murdering girlfriend who refused abortion]</ref>

The disappearance of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Fox News Channel]], neglected to cover her story in favor of [[Natalee Holloway]], a [[Whites|Caucasian]] teen missing on the island of [[Aruba]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/national/07missing.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=latoyia+figueroa&st=nyt&oref=slogin Missing Woman's Case Spurs Discussion of News Coverage]</ref> Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the [[Laci Peterson]] case and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage. Her family and friends pressured the news media to cover her case, and succeeded. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}


==Details of the case==
The Figueroa case bears a similarity to the case of Laci Peterson, who was found dead and whose husband, [[Scott Peterson (convicted murderer)|Scott]], was found guilty of her murder. The Peterson case was covered heavily throughout 2004 and led to [[consensus|public consensus]] that Scott Peterson was guilty of the murder.

Figueroa's family stated that the lack of media coverage of her disappearance only brought more tragedy to an already troubled search. Figueroa's mother, Ann Taylor, was murdered when LaToyia was a [[toddler]]. Figueroa had a seven-year-old daughter.  Joseph Taylor, Figueroa's uncle and family spokesman, has actively criticized the media.  [[America's Most Wanted]] and the Philadelphia Citizen Crime Commission teamed up with police to aid in the search.  A $100,000.00 reward was funded by rap stars [[Beanie Sigel]] (while in a prison) and Damon Dash, Beneficial Bank, T.G.I. Fridays, local philanthropists Joe Mammanaand, Kal Rudman, and Internet bloggers to help the family in the search for LaToyia. <ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510706/20050930/story.jhtml Beanie Sigel Signing With G-Unit? - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164599,00.html Reward for Missing Mom up to $100G]</ref>

==Missing White Woman Syndrome== 
The disappearance of Figueroa has spawned controversy about media coverage of missing people and how cases get national attention. "[[Missing white woman syndrome|Missing White Women Syndrome]]," as described by journalist [[Gwen Ifill]], has drawn attention to the neglect of missing non-white people. Conservative pundit [[Michelle Malkin]] also describes this phenomenon as "Missing Pretty Girl Syndrome." Media critics say that major news outlets are guilty of ignoring Figueroa and other missing-persons cases in favor of cases involving attractive young [[whites|white]] women. Most [[Mass media|media]] outlets in Philadelphia have been helping the Figueroa family, and Internet [[bloggers]] have pressured cable news networks to give coverage equal to that given to [[Natalee Holloway]] and [[Runaway bride case|Jennifer Wilbanks]]; they succeeded in gaining attention to Figueroa's disappearance from [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Fox News Channel]].
