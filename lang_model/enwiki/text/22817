'''''Witchfinder General''''' is a [[1968]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Michael Reeves]], starring  [[Vincent Price]], [[Ian Ogilvy]], and [[Hilary Dwyer]].  The screenplay was by Reeves and Tom Baker, based on the novel of the same name by [[Ronald Bassett]].  The film was coproduced by [[Tigon British Film Productions]] and [[American International Pictures]]. It was retitled '''''The Conqueror Worm''''' in the United States in an attempt to link it with an earlier series of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] films starring Price &mdash; although this movie has little to do with Poe and only briefly alludes to [[The Conqueror Worm|the poem]].  

The film details the heavily [[fiction|fictionalized]] murderous exploits of [[Matthew Hopkins]], an historical figure who claimed to have been been appointed by Parliament during the [[English Civil War]] to root out [[sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].  Director and co-writer Reeves featured many scenes of intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time.  Upon its [[film release|theatrical release]] throughout the spring and summer of 1968, the movie was met with disgust by several film critics in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and almost completely ignored by reviewers in the [[United States|U.S.]]  It has gradually developed a large [[cult film|cult]] following and several prominent critics have championed the film, including [[J. Hoberman]] and [[Danny Peary]]. In [[2005]], the magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' named ''Witchfinder General'' the 15th greatest horror film of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/movie_news/the_50_greatest_horror_movies_of_all_time|title=Shock Horror!

==Plot==
{{spoilers}}
The year is [[1645]] &mdash; the middle of the English Civil War. Matthew Hopkins, an opportunist and witchhunter, takes advantage of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror on [[East Anglia]].  Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches.  They make a small fortune by charging local magistrates for each and every woman they execute.

Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) is a young [[Roundhead]].  After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier, he rides home to Brandeston, [[Suffolk]] to  visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer).  Sara is the niece of the village<U+2019>s parson, John Lowes ([[Rupert Davies]]), a kindly old man who is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by some of the villagers for his relatively unorthodox views.  Lowes delightedly gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara.  Marshall vows to Sara that <U+201C>no harm will ever come to you.<U+201D>  That same night, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path.  Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston, then rides on.

In Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects and killing them.  Lowes  is tortured and thrown into a cell.  He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called <U+201C>Devil<U+2019>s Mark<U+201D>) and is about to be killed when Sara stops Hopkins by seducing him.  She offers him sexual favors every night in exchange for the safety of her uncle.  Hopkins agrees.  Soon, Hopkins is called away to another village.  Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins's absence and rapes Sara.  When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman.  Stearne begins to torture Lowes again.  Right before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.  

Marshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara.  He vows to murder both Hopkins and Stearne.  He <U+201C>marries<U+201D> Sara in a ceremony of his own devising, and instructs her to leave to Lavenham.  He then rides off by himself.  In the meantime, Hopkins has deserted the unreliable Stearne, who subsequently vows blood himself against his former employer.  Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, he is able to escape.  Stearne reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall<U+2019>s desire for revenge.   

Hopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham.  Marshall learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends.  Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall.  Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and drag them off to a dungeon prison.  They are horribly tortured but both refuse to confess.  Marshall watches Sara being tortured, and breaks free from his bonds at the same time his army friends begin to make their way into the prison.  Consumed by hatred and impending madness, Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly hacks Hopkins into bloody pieces.  The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done.  One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him in the head.  Marshall<U+2019>s mind snaps and he shrilly screams, <U+201C>You took him away from me!<U+201D>  Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.

==Production==
Tigon Productions owned the rights to Ronald Bassett's [[novel]], ''Witchfinder General'' (1966), which was based very loosely on a historical figure named Matthew Hopkins, a [[witchhunt|witchhunter]] who claimed to have been commissioned by Parliament to prosecute and execute witches. Hopkins was in fact never given an official mandate to hunt witches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/film-witchfindergeneral.html
|title=Witchfinder General|last=Gaskill|first=Malcolm|accessdate=2006-07-19|publisher=Channel 4 History}}</ref> Tigon offered the film to Michael Reeves, who had just completed ''[[The Sorcerers (film)|The Sorcerers]]'' (1967), starring [[Boris Karloff]]. Reeves and Tom Baker wrote a screenplay with [[Donald Pleasence]] firmly in mind as the film's star.  However, once American International Pictures became involved in the production, they insisted that their contract star, Vincent Price, be given the lead. <ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref>   

Production began on [[18 September]], [[1967]] with a budget of <U+00A3>82,000 (<U+00A3>50,000 from Tigon British, and <U+00A3>32,000 from American International Pictures). Interiors were filmed in two specially converted aircraft hangers near [[Bury St. Edmunds]] in [[Suffolk]], and the exterior shots ranged from [[Brandeston]] and [[Lavenham]] to the [[Dunwich]] Coast. The climax of the film was shot at [[Orford Castle]].  Filming wrapped on [[13 November]], 1967.<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.

ISBN 1-903111-01-3</ref>      

The production went relatively smoothly except for the unrelentingly antagonistic relationship that developed between Reeves and Price.  Reeves kept it no secret from everybody associated with the production that the American actor was not his choice for the role, and the director's comments had reached the actor back in the U.S.  Reeves refused the courtesy of meeting Price at the airport when he arrived in England.  "Take me to your goddamn young genius," Price reportedly said to co-producer Phil Waddilove.<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Faster and Furiouser:  The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0786401370</ref>  

According to [[Kim Newman]] in his book, ''Nightmare Movies'', when Reeves made a suggestion on the set, Price objected and told the director: "I've made 87 films.  What have ''you'' done?"  And Reeves responded:  "I've made three good ones."<ref name="Newman">Newman, Kim.  ''Nightmare Movies: A Critical Guide to Contemporary Horror Films'', Harmony Books, 1988. ISBN 0517573660</ref>  <U+201C>Reeves hated me,<U+201D> Price stated. <U+201C>He didn<U+2019>t want me at all for the part. I didn<U+2019>t like him, either. It was one of the first times in my life that I<U+2019>ve been in a picture where the director and I just clashed.<U+201D><ref name="Biordowski2">Biordowski, Steve and Del Valle, David.  ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine, Vol 19 No.1/Vol 19 No. 2 (January 1989), "Vincent Price:  Horror's Crown Prince", pgs 40 - 85; 120</ref>
Price felt that all the actors on the set had a difficult time with the director, explaining: "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors.  He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.'  And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There -- you're doing it again.  Don't do that'." Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.  Later, when Price finally saw the movie, he admitted that he understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten page letter praising the film.  Reeves wrote Price back, "I knew you would think so."  Years after Reeves' death, Price said, "...I realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance.  He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way.  Had I known what he wanted, I would have cooperated."<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Faster and Furiouser:  The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0786401370</ref>   

The film's violent climax was edited together in its present shape due to a continuity problem.  In the screenplay, the soldier played by Nicky Henson was supposed to shoot both Price ''and'' Ogilvy to death.  However, the actor only had one flintlock pistol, which had been clearly established in previous scenes, and was therefore only able to shoot one person.  When the error was discovered, Reeves immediately told the actor:  "All right, just shoot Vincent and I'll get Ian to scream and shout and go mad and freeze frame on Hilary Dwyer screaming."<ref name="Fleming">Fleming, John.  ''Hammer's House of Horror Magazine'', Issue # 1 (U.S. version), Article on ''Witchfinder General'', pgs 16 - 19</ref>     

Several "alternate" nude scenes were filmed during the production, reportedly solely intended for the movie's [[Germany|German]] release version.<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Faster and Furiouser:  The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0786401370</ref>  None of these scenes were made available in the theatrical versions released in the U.S. or UK, although they were reportedly included in the videotape version released in the mid-1980s by [[HBO]] Home Video.

==Response==

For its time, ''Witchfinder General'' was considered an unusually sadistic film experience.  British film censor [[John Trevelyan]] was reportedly a distant relative of Michael Reeves<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/witchfindergeneral68.html|title=<U+2019>Witchfinder General<U+2019>|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=Hollywood Gothique}}</ref> and accepted the director<U+2019>s good intentions when Reeves explained why he felt it was necessary to include such intense violence in the movie.  Trevelyan nonetheless argued, <U+201C>The film gave the impression that it was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons.<U+201D>  Consequently, the film was cut extensively for its British release.  Nearly four complete minutes of what was described as <U+201C>excesses of sadistic brutality<U+201D> were removed.  Reeves refused to take part in the cutting, but when he saw the edited result, he admitted to Trevelyan that the film had not been harmed as much as he had expected.<ref name="Fleming">Fleming, John.  ''Hammer's House of Horror Magazine'', Issue # 1 (U.S. version), Article on ''Witchfinder General'', pgs 16 - 19</ref>     

Even the truncated version was met with considerable controversy by UK film critics.  Dilys Powell in the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The London Sunday Times]]'' complained <U+201C><U+2026>17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England<U+2019>s prize torture-overseer.  Peculiarly nauseating.<U+201D><ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt the film was filled with <U+201C>gratuitous sadism.<U+201D><ref name="Fleming">Fleming, John.  ''Hammer's House of Horror Magazine'', Issue # 1 (U.S. version), Article on ''Witchfinder General'', pgs 16 - 19</ref>   Margaret Hinxman of  ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' dismissed it as a <U+201C>sadistic extravaganza.<U+201D><ref name="Fleming">Fleming, John.  ''Hammer's House of Horror Magazine'', Issue # 1 (U.S. version), Article on ''Witchfinder General'', pgs 16 - 19</ref>  Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades.  [[John Russell Taylor]] in the London ''[[The Times|Times]] Saturday Review'' said the film <U+201C><U+2026>is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else<U+2026>There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject<U+2026>Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising.  He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period.<U+201D><ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref>  ''Films and Filming'' noted, <U+201C>''Witchfinder General'' has no explicit <U+2018>message<U+2019>, but it does say something about the springs of despair and it says it forcefully.  It is a very frightening film<U+2026>Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price<U+2019>s recent performances.  ''Witchfinder General'' is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one<U+2026><U+201D><ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref>

Playwright [[Alan Bennett]] was particularly repulsed by ''Witchfinder''.  He felt that horror films should always be "punctuated by belly laughs" and attacked Reeves's completely humorless movie as "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean it made me feel dirty."  Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material: "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence...Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such - and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the `dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that ''Witchfinder General'' works as intended."<ref name="Murray">Murray, John B.

In the U.S., the film was not subject to any censorship at all, and was released virtually intact to [[Drive-in theater|drive-in]]s.  However, in an attempt to link the film with [[Roger Corman]]<U+2019>s earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled ''The Conqueror Worm''.  Brief [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]] narrations (by Price) taken from Poe<U+2019>s poem were added to justify the new title.  As Danny Peary noted in his ''Cult Movies'' book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics:  <U+201C>The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP<U+2019>s Edgar Allan Poe series<U+2026>and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce."<ref name="Peary">Peary, Danny.  ''Cult Movies'', Delta Books, 1981. ISBN 0517201852</ref>  ''Hollywood Citizen News'' was appalled by the film:  <U+201C>A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking<U+2026>a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country.<U+201D><ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref>  The trade journal ''Box Office'' noted that: <U+201C>Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends<U+2026>bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable<U+2026><U+201D><ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0806516003</ref> Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, reportedly earning $1.5 million for AIP.<ref name="Biordowski2">Biordowski, Steve and Del Valle, David.

The film's retitling by AIP caused a minor fracas in [[Hong Kong]].  A group of British sailors had seen the movie at the base theater under its original title and one week later unwittingly saw the movie again in a local theater, playing under the American release title.  They immediately demanded their money back and, when the manager refused, they tipped over trashcans, threw popcorn at the screen and "almost tore the theatre apart."  The manager changed his mind and paid the sailors back for the price of the tickets, and sent a bill to AIP for the damages.  <ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.

Very soon after its initial release in the spring of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the U.K. and U.S.  [[David Pirie]], who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book ''A Heritage of Horror'', reviewed the film in 1971 for ''[[Time Out]]'', commenting:  <U+201C><U+2026>one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema<U+2026>The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way.<U+201D> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/64697.html|title=Witchfinder General|last=Pirie|first=David|accessdate=2006-05-29|publisher=Time Out}}</ref>  Danny Peary noted, <U+201C>''The Conqueror Worm'' is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves<U+2019>s greatest achievement is that he was able to maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming.<U+201D>  In 2000, [[Derek Malcolm]] included ''Witchfinder General'' as part of his series [[The Century of Films]], a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most "artistically or culturally important" movies of the 20th Century.  Malcolm noted that the film "...is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain...''Witchfinder'' transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,,408045,00.html|title=Michael Reeves:  Witchfinder General|last=Malcolm|first=Derek|accessdate=2006-06-01|publisher=Guardian Unlimited}}</ref> More recently, J. Hoberman of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' stated that the film <U+201C><U+2026>has long been a cult item -- in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil...Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance<U+2026>it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0522,closeup,64493,20.html|title=<U+2019>Witchfinder General<U+2019>|last=Hoberman|first=J.|accessdate=2006-05-29|publisher=Village Voice}}</ref>

==Influence==

Writer Mark Thomas McGee noted that ''Witchfinder General'' "did fantastic business and kicked off a second wave of Edgar Allan Poe movies" produced by American International Pictures, including [[Gordon Hessler]]'s ''[[The Oblong Box]]'' starring Price (originally scheduled to be directed by Reeves but handed over to Hessler upon Reeves's death) and ''Murders in the Rue Morgue'' (1971).<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Faster and Furiouser:  The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0786401370</ref>  Hessler's ''[[Cry Of The Banshee|Cry of the Banshee]]'' (1970), which featured ''Witchfinder'' co-stars Price and Hilary Dwyer, was also vaguely associated with Poe in advertisements ("Edgar Allan Poe Probes New Depths of Terror!"); it was dismissed by [[Vincent Canby]] as "a rehashing of ''Witchfinder General''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=11698|title="Cry of the Banshee"|last=Canby|first=Vincent|accessdate=2006-07-20|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>  This new Poe "series" was short-lived and effectively over by 1971.  

According to AIP's Louis Heyward, ''Witchfinder General'' "was very successful in Germany -- it was the most successful of the violence pictures -- it started a vogue."<ref name="Biordowski2">Biordowski, Steve and Del Valle, David.  ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine, Vol 19 No.1/Vol 19 No. 2 (January 1989), "Vincent Price:  Horror's Crown Prince", pgs 40 - 85; 120</ref> "Copycat" films financed, or partially financed,  by German production companies included ''[[Hexen bis aufs Blut gequ<U+00E4>lt|Mark of the Devil]]'' (1970), with [[Herbert Lom]] and [[Udo Kier]], ''Night of the Blood Monster'' (1970), directed by [[Jesus Franco]] and starring [[Christopher Lee]], and ''[[Hexen gesch<U+00E4>ndet und zu Tode gequ<U+00E4>lt]]'' (1972), released in the U.S. years later on video as ''[[Mark of the Devil Part II]]''.

Tigon's own ''[[Blood on Satan's Claw]]'' (1970) was produced "as a successor, in spirit if not in story" to ''Witchfinder General'', and borrowed Reeves's usage of "the usually tranquil English countryside as a place of terror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=6486|title="Blood on Satan's Claw"|last=Sutton|first=Mike|accessdate=2006-07-20|publisher=DVD Times}}</ref>  Some critics maintain that [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'' (1971) was influenced by the commercial success of Reeves's film, with one writer calling Russell's movie "the apex of the <U+2018>historical<U+2019> witch-persecution films started by ''Witchfinder General''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~histweb/scothist/brown_k/film/closed/reviews/devils.html|title="The Devils"|last=Bourne|first=Thomas|accessdate=2006-07-20|publisher=University of St. Andrews}}</ref>

The film has had a minor influence on [[heavy metal music]]. In 1980, the movie inspired a band to call themselves [[Witchfinder General (band)|Witchfinder General]].  The group broke up in 1983.  Another metal band, [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], released a 1996 [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Hopkins (The Witchfinder General)'', featuring a song called "Matthew Hopkins".   That song also appeared on their album, ''The Carnival Bizarre'' and the music video was included as an extra on the UK DVD release of Reeves's film.  And [[Electric Wizard]] have a song from their 2000 album ''[[Dopethrone]]'' called "I, The Witchfinder", although its lyrics indicate it may also have been inspired by ''Mark of the Devil''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavylyrics.com/lyrics/electric_wizard_lyrics_519/i,_the_witchfinder_lyrics_16768.html|title="I, The Witchfinder" Lyrics

==Historical accuracy==

While some reviewers have praised the film for its ostensible <U+201C>historical accuracy<U+201D>,  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~histweb/scothist/brown_k/film/closed/reviews/witchfinder.html|title=History at the Movies: The Early Modern Years <U+2013> Witchfinder General|last=Engdahl|first=Malin.|accessdate=2006-07-24|publisher=University of St. Andrews}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhorrorfilms.co.uk/witchfinder.shtml|title=Witchfinder General|last=Wood|first=Chris|accessdate=2006-07-24|publisher=British Horror Films}}</ref>others have strongly questioned its adherence to historical fact.  Dr. Malcolm Gaskill, fellow and director of studies in history at [[Churchill College]], [[Cambridge]], and author of  ''Witchfinders: A 17th-Century English Tragedy''<ref name="Gaskill">Gaskill, Malcolm.  ''Witchfinders: A 17th- Century English Tragedy'', Harvard University Press, 2005. ISBN 0674019768</ref>, critiqued the film for the [[Channel 4]] History website, calling it <U+201C>a travesty of historical truth.<U+201D> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/film-witchfindergeneral.html|title=Witchfinder General|last=Gaskill|first=Malcolm|accessdate=2006-07-24|publisher=Channel 4 History}}</ref>  While acknowledging that <U+201C>there is much to be said in favour of ''Witchfinder General'' <U+2013> but as a film, not as history<U+201D>, based purely on its level of historical accuracy Gaskill gave the film <U+201C>3 stars<U+201D> on a scale of 0 - 10. 

Gaskill had several complaints regarding the film<U+2019>s <U+201C>distortions and flights of fancy<U+201D>.  While Hopkins and his assistant John Stearne really did torture, try and hang John Lowes, the vicar of Brandeston, Gaskill notes that other than those basic facts the film<U+2019>s narrative is <U+201C>almost completely fictitious.<U+201D>  In the movie, the fictional character of Richard Marshall pursues Hopkins relentlessly to death, but in reality the <U+201C>gentry, magistrates and clergy, who undermined his work in print and at law<U+201D> were in pursuit of Hopkins throughout his (brief) murderous career, as he was never legally sanctioned to perform his witch hunting duties.

==Home video versions==

Censorship and musical rights issues continue to keep a complete, pristine version of ''Witchfinder General'' from being released on [[videotape]], [[laserdisc]] or [[DVD]].  Although uncensored theatrical prints have been available for archival showings in the U.S. for several years, video releases of the title have been continually compromised.    

In 2001,  a DVD was released in the UK by Metrodome consisting of two versions, the complete <U+201C>Director<U+2019>s Cut<U+201D> containing the four minutes of previously censored violence, and an <U+201C>Export Version<U+201D>, also with the violence intact but including brief shots of nudity added to certain sequences.  In both versions, the four minutes of violence have been taken from what has been described as <U+201C>a grainy VHS source.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s354witch.html|title=Matthew Hopkins: Witchfinder General|last=Swindoll|first=Jeff|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=DVD Savant}}</ref>Some critics complained that watching the film in this manner was an often <U+201C>jarring<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s354witch.html|title=Matthew Hopkins: Witchfinder General|last=Swindoll|first=Jeff|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=DVD Savant}}</ref> or <U+201C>distracting<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/U-Z/witchfinder_general.html|title=Witchfinder General|last=Jane|first=Ian|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=DVD Maniacs}}</ref> viewing experience.  In addition, the soundtrack of the newly inserted nude shots had <U+201C>brief snippets of audio repeating itself because of the timing involved in inserting the previously cut footage<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/U-Z/witchfinder_general.html|title=Witchfinder General|last=Jane|first=Ian|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=DVD Maniacs}}</ref> 

In the U.S., while censorship of the film has never been a factor, the film has nonetheless never been released on home video in its originally intended form.  When [[Orion Pictures]] acquired the rights to many of AIP<U+2019>s titles in the 1980s, they were unable to also purchase rights to the musical soundtracks of some of the films, and added [[synthesizer]] scores by [[composer]] Kendall Schmidt in lieu of the original music.  ''Witchfinder General'' was one of these <U+201C>problem<U+201D> titles.<ref name="Lucas">Lucas, Tim.  ''The Video Watchdog Book'', Video Watchdog,  1992. ISBN 0963375601</ref>  Paul Ferris<U+2019>s acclaimed full orchestral score has never been made available in the U.S. on any subsequent home video release, although it is included on theatrical and syndicated television prints.   The [[HBO]] videotape release from the late 1980<U+2019>s utilized the Orion version, which also included the nude inserts.  [[Tim Lucas]] noted that the spoken soundtrack to these newly added <U+201C>spicy<U+201D> shots <U+201C>doesn<U+2019>t match it correctly."<ref name="Lucas">Lucas, Tim.

In 2005, writer Steve Biodrowski reported that a <U+201C>definitive version<U+201D> of the film had been restored and would be released in the U.S. on DVD by [[MGM]]-[[United Artists|UA]] in August of that year, as part of their Midnite Movies series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/witchfindergeneral68.html|title=<U+2019>Witchfinder General<U+2019>|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve|accessdate=2006-05-30|publisher=Hollywood Gothique}}</ref>  After [[Sony]] purchased the rights to the MGM film library, James Owsley (Director of Restorations at MGM) advised Philip Waddilove (one of ''Witchfinder General'''s producers) that the date of the DVD release was postponed until October of 2006.  However, in an interview conducted in August of 2005,  Waddilove revealed that he had learned Sony had "little interest" in the film and no official announcement of any pending DVD release had ever been made.  Waddilove noted that "the principal at Sony doesn't greenlight DVDs of anything older than ten years!!" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htf/showthread.php?t=233057|title=Sony says "NO" to WITCHFINDER GENERAL DVD, Midnite Movies in Serious Trouble!
