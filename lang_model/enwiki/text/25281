'''''Live and Let Die''''' is the second novel in [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] series. First published by [[Jonathan Cape]] on  [[April 5]], [[1954 in literature|1954]], it is considered one of Fleming's most controversial novels due to its depiction of [[Afro-Caribbean]] people and [[voodoo]]. 

The novel was adapted in 1973 as the the [[Live and Let Die (film)|eighth official film]] in the [[EON Productions]] Bond franchise and the first to star [[Roger Moore]] as James Bond. Besides the film of the same name, major plot elements from this novel appeared in two other Bond films: ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981) and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989).

==Plot summary==

James Bond is sent to [[New York City]] to investigate "[[Mr. Big (James Bond)|Mr. Big]]", an underworld [[voodoo]] leader who is suspected by [[M (James Bond)|M]] of selling [[17th century]] gold coins to finance [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy operations in [[United States|America]]. These gold coins have been turning up in [[Harlem]] and [[Florida]] and are suspected of being part of a treasure that was buried in [[Jamaica]] by the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[pirate]] Sir [[Henry Morgan]]. Although Bond is at first reluctant to take on the mission, his attitude quickly changes upon learning that Mr. Big is an agent of [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] and that this mission offers him a chance of retaliation for previously being [[torture]]d by SMERSH operative [[Le Chiffre]] and branded on his hand by a SMERSH assassin in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.

In Harlem, Bond meets up with his counterpart in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Felix Leiter]]. The two decide to visit some of Mr. Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but Mr. Big is aware of their movements through his network of informers and they are easily captured.  Bond is personally interrogated by Mr. Big, and he uses his [[fortune teller|fortune telling]]-girlfriend, Solitaire to determine if Bond is telling the truth.  Solitaire lies to Mr. Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr. Big decides to release Bond and Felix with only a mild beating, but Bond escapes from the nightclub, killing several of Mr. Big's men in the process.
Solitaire later contacts Bond and they travel to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. While Bond and Lieter are scouting one of Mr. Big's warehouses that deals in exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr. Big's minions. Felix later returns to the warehouse by himself, but is captured and fed to a shark. He survives, losing an arm and a leg. Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest "He disagreed with something that ate him". After getting Felix to hospital, Bond investigates the warehouse himself, and discovers that Mr. Big is indeed smuggling gold by placing it in the bottom of fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish. Bond destroys much of the warehouse and feeds the henchman who captured Felix to his own shark without leaving evidence that he has discovered the coin-smuggling scheme.

Bond continues his mission in Jamaica where he meets [[List of James Bond allies#Quarrel|Quarrel]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Strangways, John|John Strangways]], the head of the MI6 station in Jamaica. Quarrel gives Bond training in Scuba diving in the local waters.  Bond swims through shark and barracuda infested waters to Mr. Big's island and manages to plant a [[limpet mine]] on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr. Big. In the grand finale, Mr. Big ties Solitaire and Bond to a line behind his yacht and attempts to drag them over the shallow [[coral reef]], with the sharks and barracuda that Mr. Big regularly feeds to keep them in the area finishing them. They are saved when Bond's limpet mine explodes, destroying the yacht. Bond and Solitaire are protected from the explosion by the reef, and they watch as Mr. Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda.

==Critical reviews==

===Racism===

Reaction to the novel has been mixed. Some critics have accused Fleming of barely concealed [[racism]] and ignorance regarding the general social behaviour of black people in the [[Caribbean]] and [[United States|America]], as for instance when he describes a room in [[Harlem]] as:
{{cquote| "the air was thick with smoke and the sweet, feral smell of two hundred Negro bodies"<ref>{{cite web|title = Will the real James Bond, please stand up ?|url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/will-the-real-james-bond-please-stand-up/2006/11/23/1163871531360.html?page=4|accessdate =2007-06-30}}</ref>}}
Fleming's writing style cannot divert attention away from his copious use of the word "''nigger''" in the novel. It is used, generally, in reference to black people and, specifically, in reference to Mr. Big. Fleming uses the word to denote people of passion who think by instinct, in contrast to Bond and white people, whom Fleming regards, as thinking by logic. 

What contemporary critics deplore is Fleming's suggestion that Mr. Big's leadership qualities stem from his "French" &ndash; i.e., non-black &ndash; blood. Critics have made the inference that people with "black blood" are regarded as being biologically excluded from leadership<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mushtown.blogspot.com/2006_03_12_archive.html|title = Live and Let Die - James Bond Novel or Racist Polemic|accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref>. What divides critics is whether Fleming was consciously being racist or whether he unconsciously absorbed the racism prevalent in 1950s America.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stainlesssteeldroppings.com/?p=595|title = Live and Let Die Review|accessdate =2007-06-30}}</ref>

===Sex===

Fleming's natural [[England|English]] reserve has been blamed for his fumbling descriptions of sex scenes in ''Live and Let Die''. Critics tend to agree that there is no finesse in the sex scenes and that they lack [[passion]] compared to the movie version. Bond's love making techniques are rudimentary and Fleming does not give any thought to a woman receiving any pleasure from it &ndash; instead, women are viewed as objects of pleasure to Bond.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://latereviews.blogspot.com/2004/07/double-o-nothing.html|title =Double O Nothing|accessdate =2007-06-30}}</ref>

Fleming had a tempestuous love life; he had numerous affairs even though he was married, and there were frequent accusations of [[sado-masochism| sado-masochistic]] acts in his relationships with women.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/james_bond.html| title =The Real James Bond|accessdate =2007-06-30}}</ref> This has led critics to speculate over how much Fleming projected his own character into the figure of James Bond as Bond, too, has a dismissive attitude towards women. For instance, Bond does not desist from hitting women and his rough handed treatment of women has been noted.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/understanding007.html| title = Understanding 007|accessdate = 2007-06-30}}</ref>

===Style===

''Live and Let Die'' was Fleming's second novel, and critics have praised the development of Fleming's writing style as he gained experience and maturity as a writer. Originally written in serial form, Fleming developed the technique of leaving the reader in suspense at the end of each installment. His style is more mature, the language is more refined &ndash; apart from the derogatory racist references &ndash; and the plot is more taut than in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.amazon.com/rss/people/A14WNNL05MQUQD/reviews| title = Live and Let Die Book Review|accessdate =2007-06-30}}</ref>

==Allusions and references==
===Allusions to actual history===
This novel, like others in the series, reflects the changing roles of Britain and America during the 1950s and the perceived threat from the Soviet Union to both nations. Unlike ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', whose Cold War politics revolve around British-Soviet tensions, in ''Live and Let Die'' Bond arrives in Harlem to protect America from the Soviets working through the Black Power movement.<ref>{{cite web| last=Black |first=Jeremy |url = http://hnn.us/articles/3556.html| title = What We Can Learn from James Bond|accessdate =2007-07-13}}</ref> Subsequent books in the series reprise Bond's efforts to save America from Soviet danger, even as Britain's political power declines and America's rises.

==Adaptions==
===1973 film===
[[Image:007LALDposter.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Live and Let Die Film Poster|An original poster for the film adaptation of ''Live and Let Die''.]]
{{main|Live and Let Die (film)}}
After [[Sean Connery]] departed from the role of James Bond, producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] needed to find a new actor to take his place as agent 007. After a substantial search, they picked actor [[Roger Moore]] for the lead role. The film was released in 1973, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]], and was Moore's first outing as the secret agent.<ref name="doc">''Inside "Live and Let Die" Documentary (Live and Let Die Special Edition DVD)</ref>

The film is based loosely on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. In the film, a drug lord known as Mr. Big plans to distribute two tonnes of heroin free so as to put rival drug barons out of business. Bond is soon trapped in a world of gangsters and voodoo as he fights to put a stop to Mr. Big's scheme.

''Live and Let Die'' was released during the height of the 1970s [[blaxploitation]] era, and many blaxploitation archetypes and clich<U+00E9> are depicted, e.g. afro hairstyles, derogatory racial epithets (e.g. "honky"), black gangsters, and "pimpmobiles". The film departs from conventional Bond plot &ndash; generally focused on villains plotting to dominate the world &ndash; and instead focuses on drug trafficking, an activity often depicted in blaxploitation films. Additionally, the film takes place in African American cultural centres such as [[Harlem]], [[New Orleans]], and the [[Caribbean Islands]].<ref name="doc"/>

====Differences from film====
The characters as portrayed in the film differ from Fleming's descriptions.  Mr. Big's real name in the movie is Dr. Kananga instead of Buonaparte Ignace Gallia, and he smuggles heroin from Bloody Morgan's treasure instead of gold coins.  In the novel, Baron Samedi was only a voodoo myth &ndash; people believed Mr. Big  was actually Baron Samedi or perhaps his zombie.  Solitaire's real name is revealed in the novel, she does not lose her virginity to Bond, and there is no evidence that she risks losing her psychic powers by having sex. Also, in the novel she uses regular playing cards.

Some scenes from this novel were depicted in subsequent Bond movies; for example, the keelhauling sequence was later used in the film adaptation of ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', and Felix Leiter was not fed to a shark  until ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.

===Comic strip adaptation===
{{main|James Bond comic strips}}
Fleming's original novel was adapted as a daily [[comic strip]] which was published in the British ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from [[December 15]], [[1958]] to [[March 28]], [[1959]]. The story was truncated, omitting much of the detail and background information to compress the story into 15 weeks of strips<ref>{{cite web| url = 
http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/comics/lald.php3| title = James Bond 007 Comics - Live and Let Die|accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref>, making ''Live and Let Die'' much shorter and less faithful than the previous strip ''[[Casino Royale (novel)#Comic strip adaptation|Casino Royale]]''.
The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by [[John McLusky]], whose drawings of Bond had an uncanny resemblance to [[Sean Connery]], the actor who portrayed Bond three years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18107291 | title=The James Bond Films - 2006 onwards | accessdate =2007-07-14}}</ref> The strip was reformatted from its original cells and reprinted in full in the 1967 ''James Bond Annual'', the only 007 strip to be reprinted in this way. [[Titan Books]] reprinted the strip in the early 1990s and again in 2005 as part of the ''Casino Royale'' collection, which is a collection of James Bond comics, that also included ''Casino Royale'' and ''[[Moonraker#Comic strip adaptation|Moonraker]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Johnny's James Bond Comics Website|url=http://home9.inet.tele.dk/oreskov/|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref>
