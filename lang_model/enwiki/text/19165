'''Zena''' is a former community (considered a [[ghost town]]) approximately 10 miles northwest of [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]], in [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk County]]. The community was established in 1858 was originally called "Spring Valley". It was renamed "Zena" by D.J. Cooper and his brother, pioneers from [[Missouri]]. In 1866 they built a store and obtained the post office there, renaming the community in tribute to their wives, Arvazena and Melzena Cooper. [http://users.wi.net/%7Ecensus/lesson5.html] 

According to Arvazena Cooper:

<blockquote>Grandpa [Elbert Emmerson Cooper] went over into Polk County during this week and got a place to stop at from Bolivar Walker.  Afterward he bought a place from Nels Walling, paying for it with his outfit he crossed the plains with.  It was at a place afterwards called Zena, near a church where Grandpa preached for several years."  <ref>by Nancy Cooper Thomas, Arvazena's daughter, in an addendum to Arvazena Angeline Spillman Cooper's "Our Journey Across the Plains".  This tells the story of the covered-wagon trip undertaken by Daniel Jackson Cooper, his wife Arvazena, their 18-month-old daughter Belle, and Daniel's father, Elbert Emmerson Cooper, across the plains from Missouri to Oregon during the "War of the Great Rebellion".</ref></blockquote>

Zena is home to the historic [[Spring Valley Presbyterian Church]].

The 1992 novel ''The Road to Zena'' by Joel Redon is set in Zena.
