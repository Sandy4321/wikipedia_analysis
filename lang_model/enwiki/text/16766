{{History of China}}


'''Nanyue''' ({{CJKV|t=[[wikt:<U+5357><U+8D8A>|<U+5357><U+8D8A>]]}}) (111BC - 203BC) was an ancient Chinese kingdom, co-existing with the Chinese kingdoms of [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Minyue]]. It mainly consisted of land from the modern-day [[Chinese provinces]] of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]] and a small portion of northern [[Vietnam]]. It was established by Chinese general [[Zhao Tuo]] of the [[Qin dynasty]], whose army and people fled to the south after the collapse of the [[Qin Dynasty]].  Its capital was named '''[[Panyu]]''' (<U+756A><U+79BA>), located in today's [[Guangzhou]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. 

==History==
The history of Nanyue was written in [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]], between 109 BC to 91 BC.

After the first [[Emperor of China]] [[Qin Shi Huang]] united [[China]] by conquering all six kingdoms in 219 BC, he ordered his generals to conquer the regions of present-day [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]. The conquest was completed in 214 BC. A new administrative unit, Nanhai Commandery (<U+5357><U+6D77><U+90E1>) was formed to rule the area corresponding approximately to present-day Guangdong. Zhao Tuo was appointed to manage a Longchuan (<U+9F8D><U+5DDD>), a strategic place in the military. He asked Qin Shi Huang to send 500 thousand people from Central China to Nanhai to assimilate the culture of Central China and Yue.

===Establishment===
After the death of Qin Shi Huang, a wave of anti-Qin riots swept across central China and the [[Qin Dynasty]] soon capitulated. In 208 BC, the head of Nanhai Commandery, Ren Xiao (<U+4EFB><U+56C2>), appointed Zhao Tuo to succeed his position and suggested that Zhao establish a country in the south and take advantage of the mountainous boundary with northern China. Zhao soon reinforced the defences in the [[mountain pass]]es north and replaced the Qin officials with his own followers. In 203 BC, he conquered another two commanderies, Guilin (<U+6842><U+6797><U+90E1>, approximately Guangxi) and Xiang ''"Elephant"'' (<U+8C61><U+90E1>, approximately Yunnan, north and central Vietnam), at the south of the mountain. The new kingdom of Nanyue was born, with [[Panyu|P<U+0101>ny<U+00FA>]] as the capital; Zhao Tuo declared himself Wu Wang (<U+6B66><U+738B>, lit. ''martial king'') of Nanyue.

[[Liu Bang]], after years of war with his rivals, established the [[Han dynasty]] and reunified Central China in 202 BC. Liu and his successors adopted a policy of peace to give his empire time to regenerate. In 211 BC, the emperor Liu sent Lu Jia (<U+9678><U+8CC8>) to Nanyue to appoint Zhao Tuo as the King of Nanyue. Trade relations were established at the border between Nanyue and the Han kingdom of [[Changsha]]. Although formally a Han subject state, Nanyue retained a large measure of effective autonomy.

After the death of Liu Bang in 195 BC, the government was put in the hands of his wife, [[Empress Lu Zhi]], who served as [[empress dowager]] over their son [[Emperor Hui of Han]] and then Emperor Hui's sons [[Liu Gong]] and [[Liu Hong]]. Zhao Tuo believed that Wu Chen (<U+5433><U+81E3>), the Prince of Changsha, had made false accusations against him to get Empress Dowager Lu to block the trade between the states and to prepare to conquer the Nanyue to merge into his principality of Changsha.  In revenge, he then declared himself the emperor of Nanyue and attacked the principality of Changsha. Lu sent general Zao (<U+7076>) to punish Zhao Tuo. The hot and humid weather made soldiers fall ill and the army unable to go south of the mountains. The army withdrew. With the military success, Zhao Tuo took in the surrounding states of [[Minyue]] (<U+95A9><U+8D8A>) in the east and [[Ouluo]] (<U+750C><U+96D2>) in the west as subject kingdoms. The empress dowager then killed some of Zhao's clan members within Han territory and damaged his ancestors' tombs. 

In 179 BC, [[Liu Heng]] ascended the Emperor of Han. He reversed the policy of the empress. He ordered officials to visit the family town Zhending (<U+771F><U+5B9A>), garrison the town and make offerings to his ancestors regularly. His prime minister Chen Ping (<U+9673><U+5E73>) suggested sending Lu Jia to Nanyue as they were familiar with each other. Zhao Tuo felt surprised on Lu's arrival. He then withdrew his title of emperor and Nanyue became Han's subject state.

=== Zhao Mo ===
In 137 BC, Zhao Tuo died. His grandson [[King Wen of Nanyue|Zhao Mo]] (<U+8D99><U+771B>; also known as Zhao Hu, <U+8D99><U+80E1>, in the Records of the Grand Historian) succeeded the king of Nanyue. Ying Xing (<U+90E2><U+8208>), the king of Minyue, attacked Nanyue. Zhao Mo asked the Emperor [[Liu Che]] to send troops to halt the attack of Minyue. The emperor sent two generals to Minyue. Before Han's advancing to Minyue, Ying Xing's younger brother Yu Shan (<U+9918><U+5584>) killed Ying Xing and surrendered.

The emperor Liu Che sent Zhuang Zhu (<U+838A><U+52A9>) to Nanyue. Zhao Mo thanked the Emperor and sent his son Zhao Yingqi (<U+8D99><U+5B30><U+9F4A>) to the Han capital, [[Chang'an]]. He also wanted to go Chang'an but was stopped by his minister for fear that he could not return and it would be the end of the kingdom. He thus pretended to be sick and stayed in Nanyue. He really fell sick later for over 10 years and died. He received the [[posthumous name]] Wen Di (<U+6587><U+5E1D>).

=== Zhao Yingqi===
Zhao Yingqi returned to Nanyue and succeeded the king. He married a woman of family Jiu (<U+6A1B>) from [[Handan]] and born a son Zhao Xing (<U+8D99><U+8208>) when he was in Chang'an. He asked the Emperor to appoint Jiu as his queen and Zhao Xing his crown prince. He sent his second son to Chang'an. Zhao Yingqi died with posthumous name Ming Wang (<U+660E><U+738B>).

=== Zhao Xing ===
Zhao Xing succeeded Zhao Yingqi as king. As the king was young, the king's mother Jiu took control of the kingdom. In 113 BC, the Emperor sent Anguo Shaoji (<U+5B89><U+570B><U+5C11><U+5B63>) to Nanyue ask the king and the king's mother to visit the Emperor. Anguo Shaoji was in fact Jiu's lover when she was in Chang'an. They renewed their affair which made the subjects mistrust the king's mother. To secure their positions, the king and his mother wanted Nanyue to be a kingdom within the Han Empire. The king, his mother, and Anguo Shaoji tried to persuade Lu Jia (<U+5442><U+5609>) and other ministers to follow. Lu Jia stood and left. The king's mother tried to kill him but stopped by the king.

Lu Jia refused to meet the king and planned to revolt. As he knew the king had no intention to kill him, the plan was not carried out for months.

=== Zhao Jiande===
The minister Lu Jia revolted and killed the king and the king's mother. He named Zhao Jiande (<U+8D99><U+5EFA><U+5FB7>), the eldest son of Zhao Yingqi, to be the king of Nanyue. In autumn 112 BC the emperor sent a navy of a hundred thousand strong to attack Nanyue. In winter 111 BC the capital Panyu fell and many surrendered. Lu Jia and Zhao Jiande fled out to sea but were captured soon. Nanyue was officially incorporated into Han.

==Archaeological findings==

The Nanyue Kingdom Palace Ruins([[<U+5357><U+8D8A><U+56FD><U+5BAB><U+7F72><U+9057><U+5740>]]), located in the the Chinese city of [[Guangzhou]] covers 15,000 square metres. Excavated in 1995, it contains the remains of the ancient Nanyue palace. In 1996, it was listed as protected National Cultural Property by the [[Chinese|People's Republic of China]] government. Crescent-shaped ponds, Chinese gardens and other [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] architecture were discovered in the excavation. 

In 1983, the ancient tomb of the Nanyue King Wang Mu (<U+738B><U+5893>) was discovered in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]]. In 1988, the [[Museum of the Tomb of the King of Southern Yue in Western Han Dynasty]] was constructed on this site, to display more than 1000 excavated artefacts including 500 pieces of [[bronzeware|Chinese bronzes]], 240 pieces of [[jade|Chinese jade]] and 246 pieces of metal. In 1996, the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] listed this site as a protected National Heritage Site.

==Nan Yue-Vietnam Controversy==
The relationship between Nan Yue and present-day Vietnam is unclear, as the political and cultural core of Nan Yue was located entirely in modern-day China.
