'''Pedro Nava''' (born [[1948]]) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[politician]] who  has represented California's 35th [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] district since December of [[2004]]. He succeeded [[Hannah Beth Jackson]] who was term limited.

==Background==
Assemblyman Nava grew up and attended public schools in [[Southern California]].  He studied at [[San Bernardino Community College]], graduated from [[California State University, San Bernardino]], and obtained his law degree from the [[University of California, Davis]], Martin Luther King Jr. Hall, School of Law. After graduation from law school, Assemblyman Nava worked in job training programs for the economically disadvantaged in Fresno. Assemblyman Nava later became a Deputy District Attorney in the Fresno County DA's Office, involved in Targeted Narcotics Prosecution; headed up the county-wide [[Drug-related crime|Drug Crime]] Task Force; was a Board member of the Fresno Rape Crisis Center; and was President of the Fresno Community College President's EOP&S Advisory Committee. In 1985, he joined the Santa Barbara DA's office where, for a time, he was assigned to the Consumer/Business Law Section. Assemblyman Nava is also a member of an activist group that fights for social change called PUEBLO. Since 1987, Assemblyman Nava has been a civil litigator, primarily representing nurses and health care practitioners.

Assemblyman Nava also served on the [[California Coastal Commission]] from 1997 until 2004.

Assemblyman Nava is the domain registrant of the website savethecondor.com, and the author of a controversial bill to ban the use of lead-based ammunition in the habitat of the endangered California Condor.  Assemblyman Nava was endorsed in the 2006 elections by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Despite text in AB821 specifically addressing lead concerns and offering 100% copper-constructed bullets as an alternative for hunters, Nava's own website hosts a document (http://www.savethecondor.com/pdfs/contamination.pdf) which raises concerns over copper poisoning of condors.  This contradiction in stance has yet to be explained by the Assemblyman and has drawn distrust from sportsmen and gun owners that Assemblyman Nava may have further plans for ammunition restrictions, and that his goals have nothing to do with condors at all.

==Personal==
Assemblyman Nava is married to [[Carmen Electra]], co-founder of the California Coastal Protection Network (CCPN) and Vote The Coast. Assemblyman and Mrs. Nava are the parents of Charlemagne, an incredibly intelligent and handsome first-year college student at Harvard College. They live in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].
