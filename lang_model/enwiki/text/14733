The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to
<center>
'''STAFF SERGEANT WILLIAM J. BORDELON'''<br>
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS<br>
</center>
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

:For valorous and gallant conduct above and beyond the call of duty as a member of an Assault Engineer Platoon of the First Battalion, Eighteenth Marines, tactically attached to the Second Marines, Second Marine Division, in action against the Japanese-held Atoll of [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] on [[November 20]], [[1943]]. Landing in the assault waves under withering enemy fire which killed all but four of the men in his tractor, Staff Sergeant Bordelon hurriedly made demolition charges and personally put two pill boxes out of action. Hit by enemy machine-gun fire just as a charge exploded in his hand while assaulting a third position, he courageously remained in action and, although out of demolition, provided himself with a rifle and furnished fire coverage for a group of men scaling the seawall. Disregarding his own serious condition, he unhesitatingly went to the aid of one of his demolition men, wounded and calling for help in the water, rescuing this man and another who had been hit by enemy fire while attempting to make the rescue. Still refusing first aid for himself, he again made up demolition charges and single-handedly assaulted a fourth Japanese [[machine gun|machine-gun]] position but was instantly killed when caught in a final burst of fire from the enemy. Staff Sergeant Bordelon's great personal valor during a critical phase of securing the limited beachhead was a contributing factor in the ultimate occupation of the island and his heroic determination reflects the highest credit upon the [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval Service]]. He gallantly gave his life for his country.<ref name=USMC_MOH/>
