'''Rapunzel''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[main character]] who appears in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Pictures]]' 50th animated feature film ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010). The character subsequently appears in the film's  [[animated short]] sequel ''[[Tangled Ever After]]'' (2012).  In both appearances, Rapunzel is voiced by American recording artist and actress [[Mandy Moore]].  In the first film, a young Rapunzel is voiced by American actress Delaney Rose Stein.

Created by [[Glen Keane]], who also served as her supervising animator, Rapunzel was based on the heroine of the [[Germany|German]] [[Rapunzel|fairy tale]] by [[The Brothers Grimm]].  A princess born with long, magical golden hair, Rapunzel is stolen from her parents at infancy and raised by a vain woman named Mother Gothel, who exploits her hair's healing abilities in order to remain youthful.  Locked in a secluded tower and kept unaware of her royal identity for eighteen years, Rapunzel enlists the help of a thief named [[Flynn Rider]] to see the [[floating lantern]]s in time for her birthday.

Rapunzel has received mostly positive reception from critics, the majority of whom praised her personality, which they have described as free-spirited, independent and contemporary.  Rapunzel is the tenth princess in the [[Disney Princess]] line-up.  Her physical appearance and spirited personality has caused much comparison to be drawn between her and preceding Disney Princess [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).

[[Walt Disney]] attempted to adapt the story of "Rapunzel" into an animated feature film soon after the studio released ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).  However, the project was eventually shelved because the story proved to be "a really hard nut to crack".  Keane believes the fact that the majority of the original fairy tale takes place inside a tower may have contributed to the difficulty of adapting it into a full-length animated feature.  "That was, I think, why it was so wonderful to see what Byron and Nathan brought <U+2013> bringing Rapunzel out of the tower ... bringing this really fresh new take to the fairytale."<ref name=keaneindielondon/>  Originally, the film was conceived under the title ''Rapunzel Unbraided'',<ref name="nusairrapunzeladapted">{{cite web|last=Nusair|first=David|title=Top 5 Disney Animated Adaptations|url=http://movies.about.com/od/animatedmovies/tp/best-disney-adaptations.htm|work=About.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> which he described as "a ''[[Shrek]]''-like version of the film",<ref name="christiantodaykeane">{{cite web|last=Paluso|first=Marianne|title=Once Upon a Time|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/marchweb-only/onceupon.html|work=Christian Today|publisher=Christianity Today|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=March 29, 2011}}</ref> and revolved around an entirely different plot and concept.  Keane said of the original version, "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers.  But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale."<ref name="beliefnetkeane">{{cite web|last=Minow|first=Nell|title=Interview: Glen Keane of <U+2018>Tangled<U+2019>|url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/moviemom/2010/11/interview-glen-keane-of-tangle.html|work=Beliefnet|publisher=Beliefnet, Inc|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>

As directors, Greno and Howard attempted to make Rapunzel resemble a less "passive" heroine than how she is depicted in the original fairy tale.  "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way.  We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life."<ref name=grenohowardabout/>

Moore "grew up loving Disney films," describing the opportunity to be featured in one as "the ultimate fantasy".<ref name=mooremovieweb/>  She initially had little intention of auditioning for ''Tangled'' because she was aware that there would be much competition, and feared that a failed audition would simply result in disappointment for herself.<ref name="moorehuffpost">{{cite web|title=Mandy Moore On Tangled: 'I Screamed As Soon As I Found Out' (INTERVIEW)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/10/19/mandy-moore-on-tangled_n_1019215.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=October 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name="mooremoviesonline">{{cite web|title=Mandy Moore Interview, TANGLED|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/2010/11/mandy-moore-interview-tangled/|work=Movies Online|publisher=MoviesOnline|accessdate=17 March 2013|date=February 9, 2013}}</ref>  Upon making up her mind to audition, Moore reportedly "chased after" the role of Rapunzel, auditioning for it twice.

==== Recording ====
Upon joining the cast of ''Tangled'', Moore was initially unaware that the film would become [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' 50th animated feature film.  Since then, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, "I feel lucky because I would<U+2019>ve probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process."<ref name=mooremoviesonline/>  Moore was also surprised to learn that the majority of her dialogue would not be recorded in the presence of co-stars [[Zachary Levi]] and [[Donna Murphy]].

She told ''[[NOW (UK magazine)|NOW]]'', "All I had to work off were a few sketches.  I was standing in a recording booth and it can get pretty lonely in there, but it was also fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination."<ref name="mandymoorenow">{{cite web|title=Tangled star Mandy Moore: I'd like to think I look like Rapunzel|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/531660/tangled-star-mandy-moore-i-d-like-to-think-i-look-like-rapunzel|work=Now|publisher=IPC Media Fashion & Beauty Network|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref>  She also said that creating Rapunzel's voice simply revolved around a process of "letting go".

I read a book about feminine beauty and it said the key to beauty is strangeness in a woman's face.  There needs to be something slightly off, some element; it might be her nose, her lip, her tooth, or one eye higher than the other, but something.  Even in Rapunzel's teeth, the way she talks, there's something a little bit wonky in the placement of her teeth, and things like that were designed so that she was more real, true and appealing."

Glen Keane served as a supervising animator on Rapunzel.

Co-director Byron Howard was personally inspired by the appearance of [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), a character also animated by Keane.  Howard told ''The Hollywood News'', "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to".  Meanwhile, Keane aimed to "[bring] the hand drawn into computer."<ref name="tangledhollywoodnews">{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Katie|title=THN talks TANGLED with star Mandy Moore and Disney<U+2019>s directorial golden boys|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2011/01/30/thn-talks-tangled-star-mandy-moore-disneys-directorial-golden-boys/|work=The Hollywood News|publisher=The Hollywood News 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=January 30 2011}}</ref>  While designing Rapunzel, Keane was influenced by a book that instructs readers on the idea of "feminine beauty".  The book explains that "the key to beauty is strangeness in a woman's face."  Taking this into consideration, Keane drew Rapunzel with a sense of [[asymmetry]] in mind, incorporating into her appearance several subtle imperfections, especially noticeable in her teeth<ref name=keanephilonfilm/> that are "not quite perfect";<ref name=tangledhollywoodnews/> Rapunzel was given [[buck teeth]] intentionally.

Actresses Reese Witherspoon and [[Natalie Portman]] served as inspiration, as well as comedian and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' star [[Amy Poehler]].

===''Tangled''===
{{Main|Tangled}}
In order to remain young and beautiful, a vain old woman named Mother Gothel hoards the healing powers of a magical golden flower.  When the pregnant Queen falls ill, the flower is harvested and fed to her, removing Gothel's access to it.  Once healthy, the Queen gives birth to Rapunzel, whose long golden hair has inherited the flower's magic.  Hoping to regain full control over the flower, Gothel kidnaps the princess and incarcerates her in an isolated tower simply for the purpose of exploiting her hair in order to remain youthful.  Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom of Corona releases thousands of [[Sky lantern|floating lanterns]] into the sky in her memory.

Eighteen years later, Rapunzel, ignorant to the fact that she is a princess, is growing eager to leave the tower and see the "floating lights," which she believes bear some significance to her.  However, she is forbidden by Gothel, by whom she has been led to believe is her mother.  When a wanted thief named Flynn Rider, in search of a place to hide, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower, Rapunzel, who has tricked Gothel into leaving her unattended, [[Blackmail|blackmails]] Flynn into taking her to see the lanterns in return for the crown that he has stolen from the palace.  Accompanied by Rapunzel's chameleon friend Pascal, they embark, but Gothel is soon in close pursuit.

Rapunzel and Flynn eventually arrive at the kingdom in time for the lantern ceremony.  Soon afterwards, Flynn is ambushed and vengefully turned into the police by his former partners-in-crime the Stabbington Brothers, who he abandoned in an attempt to outrun the King's soldiers, and [[sentenced to death]].  However, before the Brothers can harm Rapunzel, Gothel knocks them unconscious and takes a heartbroken Rapunzel back to the tower.

Back in her bedroom, Rapunzel is suddenly flooded by memories from her past.  Realizing Gothel is a fraud, she finally finds the courage to rebel against her.  However, Gothel, unwilling to lose Rapunzel, ties her up and immobilizes her.  When Flynn, having managed to escape from the castle, arrives at the tower, Gothel stabs him.  Desperate to save him, Rapunzel promises to do whatever Gothel pleases in return.  Gothel complies, but just as Rapunzel is about to heal him, Flynn cuts her hair short, causing it to turn brown and lose its powers, resulting in Gothel's death.  Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms and she cries bitterly.  However, the flower's magic manifests itself through Rapunzel's tears and revives Flynn.  Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.<ref>{{Cite AV media|people = Howard, Byron; Greno, Nathan (directors)|date = November 24, 2010|title = Tangled|medium = Motion picture|publisher = Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|location = United States of America}}</ref>

===''Tangled Ever After''===
{{Main|Tangled Ever After}}

At the end of ''Tangled'', Flynn Rider finally accepts his [[birth name]], Eugene Fitzherbert, and reveals that he has proposed to Rapunzel, implying that a wedding is soon to take place.  In ''Tangled Ever After'', the entire kingdom is preparing for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene.  Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's parents the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon and Maximus, a horse, serve as [[Flower girl|flower]] and [[Page boy|ring bearer]] respectively.  Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the aisle to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the [[Wedding ring|rings]] on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings down the aisle and out onto the city streets.

Desperate to retrieve them, Pascal and Maximus sneak out of the chapel while Rapunzel and Flynn say their [[Wedding vows|vows]].  After pursuing the rings on tumultuous chase around the kingdom and encountering several obstacles along the way, they finally manage to recover them from a flock of flying doves, crashing into a  [[tar]] factory in the process.  Pascal and Maximus return to the chapel just as the [[bishop]] asks for the rings.  Though shocked by their tar-covered appearance, Rapunzel and Flynn exchange rings none-the-less and share a kiss.  Exhausted from their previous endeavors, Maximus sits down, nudging the [[wedding cake]] in the process and causing it, which has been positioned on wheels, to roll down the aisle.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/Home/display.jsp?contentId=dcp_home_pressroom_pressreleases_dcp_home_pr_us_licensing_show_release_060911 | title=Disney Consumer Products Poised For Incremental Retail Sales Growth with New Disney Baby Store & Rich Franchise Investment | publisher=[[Disney Consumer Products]] | date=2011-06-09 | accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref>

Being the tenth character in the [[Disney Princess]] line-up, several critics have drawn positive comparisons between Rapunzel and preceding Disney Princesses, most notably [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989).  Joe Neumaier of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' compared Rapunzel's independence to that of [[Belle (Disney character)|Belle]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), writing, "thoroughly modern Rapunzel does most of the saving".<ref name="dailynewsrapunzel">{{cite web|last=Neumaier|first=Joe|title='Tangled' review: Mandy Moore's Rapunzel is chill Disney retelling of classic hair-raising tale|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tangled-review-mandy-moore-rapunzel-chill-disney-retelling-classic-hair-raising-tale-article-1.455647|work=Daily News|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=13 March 2013|date=November 23, 2010}}</ref>  Jonathan Crocker of ''[[Total Film]]'' noted similarities between the character and Ariel, describing Rapunzel as "A strong-willed heroine longing to see outside."<ref name="rapunzeltotalfilm">{{cite web|last=Crocker|first=Jonathan|title=Tangled Disney has a good hair day<U+2026>|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/tangled|work=Total Film|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=January 14, 2011}}</ref>  Mike Scott of ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' wrote that Rapunzel's innocence is "reminiscent of [[Amy Adams]]' flighty [[Princess Giselle|Giselle]] from ...

Some critics have reacted less favorably towards Rapunzel.  Although [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thoroughly enjoyed the film, he felt that too much emphasis was placed on Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel.  Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," and accused various film studios of "abolis[ing] female-centered stories."<ref name="rapunzeltime">{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Tangled: Disney's Ripping Rapunzel|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2033166,00.html|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=November 26, 2010}}</ref>  [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a "bland, plastic" heroine, likening her to a [[Barbie doll]].<ref name="varietytangled">{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Justin|title=Review: <U+201C>Tangled<U+201D>|url=http://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/tangled-1117943999/|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=November 7, 2010}}</ref>  Similarly, Tom Huddleston of [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'']] described Rapunzel as "bland".<ref name="rapunzeltimeout">{{cite web|last=Huddleston|first=Tom|title=Tangled (PG)|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/tangled|work=Time Out|publisher=Time Out|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=June 25, 2011}}</ref>  [[James Berardinelli]] of [[ReelViews|''ReelViews'']] was fairly mixed in his review, writing, "although likeable and energetic, [Rapunzel] is not as memorable as [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]], Ariel, or Belle."<ref name="rapunzelberardinelli">{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Tangled|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2215|work=ReelViews|publisher=James Berardinelli|accessdate=13 March 2013|date=November 22, 2010}}</ref>  Keith Uhlich of ''Time Out'' described the character as "synthetic".

=== Accolades and recognition ===
[[CNN]]'s Stephanie Goldberg included Rapunzel in her article "[[Brave (2012 film)|''Brave'']]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>''<nowiki/>s [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]] and other animated heroines", a list that recognized some of Disney's most heroic and independent heroines who have appeared in animated films.  Goldberg jokingly wrote, "So what if ... Rapunzel defends herself with a frying pan and holds prisoners captive with her long, magical hair?"<ref name="cnnheroines">{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Stephanie|title='Brave's' Merida and other animated heroines|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/22/showbiz/movies/brave-merida-animated-heroines|work=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=June 22, 2012}}</ref>  Sonia Saraiya of [[Nerve.com|''Nerve'']] ranked Rapunzel fourth in her article "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist".  Comparing the character's spirited personality to that of preceding Disney Princesses Ariel and [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]] from [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|''Aladdin'']] (1992), Saraiya described Rapunzel as "badass," despite the fact that "her naivete sometimes gets in the way of her progressivism."  Saraiya continued, "[Rapunzel] also recognizes the unfairness of her plight and finds a way out of it, outwitting her 'mother,' who is in fact her kidnapper, to venture to the outside world."<ref name="rapunzelnerverank">{{cite web|last=Saraiya|first=Sonia|title=Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist|url=http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/ranked/ranked-disney-princesses-from-least-to-most-feminist?page=2|work=Nerve|publisher=Nerve.com Inc|accessdate=13 March 2013|date=July 11, 2012}}</ref>  Tala Dayrit of ''Female Network'' included Rapunzel in her article "30 Fierce and Fun Female Cartoon Characters", writing that, unlike her original fairy tale counterpart, "She<U+2019>s not the helpless damsel locked in a tower awaiting an unknown fate, but a strong woman capable of defending herself in a fight."<ref name="femalenetwork">{{cite web|last=Dayrit|first=Tala|title=30 Fierce and Fun Female Cartoon Characters|url=http://www.femalenetwork.com/travel-leisure/30-fierce-and-fun-female-cartoon-characters|work=Female Network|publisher=Summit Digital|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref>
