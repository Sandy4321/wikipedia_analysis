The 119th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 7 March 1973. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  It was won by Cambridge who passed the finishing post thirteen lengths ahead of Oxford, the largest winning margin since the [[The Boat Race 1955|1955 race]].  Despite being pre-race favourites, Oxford's warm-up saw them take on board a large amount of water in rough conditions.

In the reserve race, [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Isis, and in the [[Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge were victorious.

[[File:John Snagge.jpg|right|thumb|BBC radio broadcaster [[John Snagge]] was "surprised" that the BBC decided not to broadcast the race in whole.]]
The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183555/http://theboatrace.org/women/history|archivedate=14 July 2014| title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 9 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the [[Tideway]], prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>  

It was the first year since 1927 that the main race was not covered in full on any of the BBC's national radio networks.  Its 4.15pm start coincided with the conclusion of the [[1972<U+2013>73 FA Cup#Semi-Finals|FA Cup semi-finals]], and it had been decided that the rowing would be broadcast in full on the [[BBC World Service]] and [[BBC Radio Oxford]] only.  Commentator [[John Snagge]] who had described every race since 1931 was disappointed: "I do not want to be unreasonable but I am a little surprised that for an event like the Boat Race, with its tradition and history, the BBC cannot find 20 minutes on one of its four networks to carry it in full."<ref>{{Cite news | title = Half-time and tide swamp the Boat Race| work = [[The Times]] | first = Christopher | last = Walker | date = 3 April 1973 | page = 4 | issue = 58748}}</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Following good performances in practice in the buildup, Oxford were considered pre-race favourites.<ref name=favoured/>  They won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start on the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=before>{{Cite news | title = Oxford beaten before they started | work = [[The Guardian]] | date=9 April 1973 | first = John | last= Rodda |page=18}}</ref>  In the warm-up to the race, the Light Blues opted for calm waters in Wandsworth Reach while Oxford rowed part of the course, in rough conditions, up to the Mile Post and back.  Arriving back at the stake boat, the Dark Blues spent considerable time attempting to alleviate their boat of large amounts of water, using their tracksuits as makeshift sponges.<ref name=suicide/>

Oxford made a fast start, rating over 40&nbsp;strokes per minute, but in the rough conditions it resulted in more water being drawn into their boat.  Cambridge "slowly but surely" took control with a lead of just under three lengths within three minutes of the start.<ref name=roulette/>  A ten-second lead at the Mile Post was extended to sixteen seconds by [[Hammersmith Bridge]] with Oxford still taking on more water in their pursuit of the Light Blues.  Oxford were 26 seconds behind at Chiswick Steps and despite a last push from Oxford to reduce the deficit, Cambridge passed the finishing post in 19 minutes 21 seconds, 13 lengths and 48 seconds ahead of their opponents.<ref name=roulette/>  It was Cambridge's sixth consecutive victory, and their 67th overall to Oxford's 51 wins.<ref name=results/>

In the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by five lengths, their seventh consecutive victory.<ref name="results"/> In the 28th running of the [[Henley Boat Races#Women's Boat Race|Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge triumphed, their eleventh consecutive victory.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/results | title =Women &ndash; Results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate =1 September 2014}}</ref>

==Reaction==
The Oxford boat club president Andy Hall said "the water was round our ankles&nbsp;... we made a mistake in doing that warm-up over part of the course&nbsp;... there was so much water on board that I thought 'God, we're going to sink.'  It was really hopeless after that."<ref name=suicide>{{Cite news | title = Oxford suicide by drowning | work = [[The Observer]] | page = 28 | first = Roger | last = Purfleet | date = 8 April 1973}}</ref>  In losing the race, Hall became the first Oxonian to lose four Boat Races in the 20th century.<ref name=suicide/>  Jim Railton, writing in ''The Times'' summarised the race: "Cambridge beat the Tideway and the Tideway beat Oxford."<ref name=roulette/>  According to [[Dickie Burnell]], "to say that the race was soon over would be a mis-statement.  It never really began."<ref>Burnell, p. 29</ref>
