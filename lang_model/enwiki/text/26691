The '''Hither Green rail crash''' was a train derailment that occurred near [[Hither Green maintenance depot]], between [[Hither Green railway station|Hither Green]] and [[Grove Park railway station|Grove Park]] railway stations at 21:16 on 5 November 1967. It was a busy Sunday evening service from {{rws|Hastings}} to {{rws|London Charing Cross}} and there were passengers standing on the train. Of the twelve coaches, eleven were derailed and four turned onto their sides.  Forty-nine passengers were killed and 78 injured. Singer [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] was amongst the survivors.

The derailment was found to be due to a broken rail. The Ministry of Transport report criticised the maintenance of the line, especially following a recent increase of the maximum speed of trains over the route. Following the accident the maintenance of the line was improved and plans accelerated for replacing jointed track by continuous welded rail.

==Derailment==
On Sunday 5 November 1967 the 19:43 Hastings to Charing Cross service, consisting of twelve coaches (two six-car [[British Rail Class 201|Class 201]] [[Diesel multiple unit|diesel-electric multiple units]]) and travelling at approximately {{convert|70|mph}}, [[derailment|derailed]] at 21:16 shortly before the St Mildred's Road railway bridge, near [[Hither Green maintenance depot]]. The leading pair wheels of the third coach were derailed by a broken rail and ran on for a {{convert|1/4|mi|m|adj=on}} before hitting points, causing eleven coaches to be derailed and four of those to turn onto their sides. The train came to rest in {{convert|250|yd}}, except for the leading coach that detached and ran on a further {{convert|220|yd}}.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=1}}

It was a busy Sunday evening and there were passengers standing in the train. Forty-nine passengers were killed and 78 injured, 27 being detained in hospital. Most of the casualties had been travelling in the overturned coaches.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=1}} Amongst the survivors was singer [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] and his wife-to-be Molly.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2089867/Robin-Gibb-How-obsession-Titanic-helped-save-life.html|title= How my obsession with the Titanic has helped save my life

==Aftermath==
The emergency services arrived within five minutes and the first casualty arrived at hospital 18 minutes after the derailment. The last survivor was taken to hospital at 01:00 the following morning. Local residents, the [[Salvation Army]] and [[Women's Voluntary Service]] assisted the injured and shocked.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=1}}

The fast lines were blocked by the derailment and the traction current to the slow lines was turned off to allow the rescue. Traction current was temporarily restored to the slow lines for the Tuesday morning rush hour and returned to traffic at 15:40 that afternoon. The fast lines were reopened with a speed restriction at 06:20 Wednesday morning.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=1}}

==Inquiry and report==
The derailment was found to be due to a broken rail at a rail joint, where a [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack through the first bolt hole in a running-on rail had progressively developed and a triangular piece of rail had broken out. The [[railroad tie|sleeper]] at the joint had previously failed and been replaced with a shallower timber replacement. This replacement had not been well packed, was on a shallow layer of clean ballast and the rubber pad supporting the rail on the adjacent concrete sleeper was missing.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=17}}

After the derailment passengers commented about trains running at excessive speed, but British Rail routinely monitored this and the number of trains running in excess of the permitted speed was small and normally only by a small amount. Complaints were also received about the rough riding of Hastings line stock and another train of the same class was tested on Southern Region and Eastern Region track. Although the ride quality was better on the Eastern region track, it was not considered dangerous on Southern Region track.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|pp=14<U+2013>16}}

The speed limit for [[electric multiple unit]]s on the track had been raised from {{convert|75|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|mph|abbr=on}} in July 1967.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=2}} After the derailment the line was inspected and a temporary speed restriction of  {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} imposed.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|p=6}} The report found that Civil Engineering and Inspection Departments had permitted too low a standard of maintenance on the line and had failed to assess the implications of increasing the speed of the trains.{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|pp=18<U+2013>19}}

==Legacy==
Maintenance of the line was improved, [[Rail inspection|inspection]] techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing [[jointed track]] by [[continuous welded rail]] were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at rail joints on the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]].{{sfn|Ministry of Transport|1968|pp=19<U+2013>21}}
