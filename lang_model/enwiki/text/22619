'''''Red Dwarf''''' is a British [[comedy]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] which primarily comprises eight series (plus a ninth smaller series named ''Back To Earth'') of a television [[science fiction]] [[sitcom]] that aired on [[BBC Two]] between 1988 and 1999 and on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] in 2009 and 2012. It gained  [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2002/10_october/reddwarf.shtml |title=Worldwide Press Office - Red Dwarf on DVD |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref> It was created by [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]], who also wrote the first six series. The show originated from a recurring sketch, ''[[Dave Hollins: Space Cadet]]'' part of the mid-1980s [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy show ''[[Son of Clich<U+00E9>]]'', also scripted by Grant and Naylor. In addition to the television episodes, there are four bestselling novels, two [[pilot (television)|pilot episodes]] for an American version of the show, a radio version produced for BBC radio 7,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/12/04/infinity%2Dwelcomes%2Dcareful%2Dbroadcasters/ |title=Reddwarf.co.uk page on radio 7 broadcast}}</ref> tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.

In 2008, a three-episode production was commissioned by the digital channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]. These episodes were screened in April 2009 during the Easter weekend and comprised a three-part story titled ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7851989.stm |title=BBC website |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref> Unlike the majority of the original BBC episodes, this [[Miniseries|mini-series]] was a [[Comedy-drama|comedy drama]] filmed without a [[studio audience]] or an added [[laugh track]].

Despite the [[pastiche]] of science fiction used as a backdrop, ''Red Dwarf'' is primarily a character-driven comedy, with [[wiktionary:off-the-wall|off-the-wall]], often [[Toilet humour|scatological]] science fiction elements<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/mad-boffin-jailed-over-computer-virus-havoc-1582105.html|title=Independent Newspaper reports on activities of Red Dwarf fan | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Peter | last=Victor | date=16 November 1995 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> used as complementary [[plot device]]s. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the "[[The Odd Couple (film)|Odd Couple]]"-style relationship between the two central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other and are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are [[Dave Lister]], the last known human alive, and [[Arnold Rimmer]], a [[hologram]] of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]], ''Red Dwarf's'' computer; [[Kryten]], a service mechanoid; and, as of Series VII, [[Kristine Kochanski]], an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love.

One of the series' highest accolades came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series, "[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]", won an [[International Emmy|International Emmy Award]] in the Popular Arts category, and in the same year the series was also awarded "Best BBC Comedy Series" at the [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Dwarf VI released on DVD 21.02.05|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/01_january/red_dwarf.shtml|date=|accessdate= 2009-02-05}}</ref> The series attracted its highest ratings, of over eight million viewers, during the eighth series in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Dwarf VIII Aftermath|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=8&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath|date=|accessdate= 2009-02-05}}</ref>

Series X will consist of six episodes, recorded in front of a studio audience in December 2011-January 2012 and will begin on 4 October 2012, on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] and also on [[Dave (TV channel)#Dave HD|Dave HD]].<ref name="officialsite-series-x">{{cite web|author=Red Dwarf: Back to Earth |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2011/04/15/new-series-of-red-dwarf-confirmed/ |title=New Series of Red Dwarf Confirmed &#124; News |publisher=Red Dwarf |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref><ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2012/08/31/whats-in-a-name/ http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2012/08/31/whats-in-a-name/] </ref>

The main dramatic thrust of the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth, although the crew's ownership of an unlimited time-space travel drive in series seven was to later negate this intention.<ref name="Series I at SciFi.com">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw9510.html | title =Series I at SciFi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070817030011/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw9510.html |archivedate = 17 August 2007}}</ref> As their journey begins, the not-so-intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions, faster-than-light travel, mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years.<ref name="Series I at SciFi.com"/> During the second series, the group encounter the service [[mechanoid]] [[Kryten]], rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p52.</ref> Initially, Kryten only appeared in [[Kryten (Red Dwarf episode)|one episode]] of series two, but by the beginning of series three he had become a regular character.<ref name="screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> At the end of series five, ''Red Dwarf'' itself is stolen by persons unknown, forcing them to travel in the smaller ''[[Starbug]]'' craft for two series, with the side-effect that they lose contact with Holly.<ref name="Series VI review at Sci-Fi Weekly">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =Series VI review at Sci- Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Ace Rimmer]], whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension.

The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face [[Grim Reaper|Death]] (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).<ref name="Episode Guide at Britannia.org&nbsp;<U+2014> Series 8">{{cite web | url =http://www.britannia.org/tvarchives/dwarf/episodes/series8.php | title =Episode Guide&nbsp;<U+2014> Series 8 | publisher =www.britannia.org |accessdate =2008-02-06}}</ref>

Nine years later, the four "Boys from the Dwarf" are once more the only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is mourning Kochanski, lost to him out of an [[airlock]] some time previously. A chance to get back to Earth through a dimension warp presents itself, but though it is not quite what it first appears to be, it results in giving Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.

==Characters and actors==
{{Main|List of Red Dwarf characters}}

* '''[[Kryten]]''', full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by '''[[Robert Llewellyn]]''' from series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in series II by '''[[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]'''), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship ''Nova 5'' in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years. Kryten is a service mechanoid and when first encountered by the crew, he was bound by his "behavioural protocols", but Lister gradually encouraged him to break his programming and think for himself. His change in appearance between the two actors is explained-away by an accident involving Lister's spacebike and Lister having to repair him.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 38-42.</ref>
* '''[[Dave Lister]]''', played by '''[[Craig Charles]]''', is a genial [[Liverpudlian]] and self-described bum. He was the lowest-ranking crew member on the ship before the accident and has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident that renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name="Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 19-24.</ref> He deeply enjoys [[Indian food]], especially [[vindaloo|chicken vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.

* His bunk mate '''[[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc''' ("Bronze swimming certificate" and "Silver swimming certificate"), played by '''[[Chris Barrie]]''', was the second-lowest ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident that would kill the entire crew (along with himself). Nevertheless, he was chosen by Holly to be the ship's one available hologram,<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 24-30.</ref> because he was considered the person most likely to keep Lister sane.  From the Series III episode "[[Timeslides]]" onwards, the timeline of the crew is adjusted and Rimmer's death is newly attributed to a moment in which he hits a cardboard box filled with explosives.<ref name="Prog Guide p65">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 65.</ref> During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become the new Ace Rimmer. Along with the Red Dwarf ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with Death at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. In the ''Back to Earth'' specials, he is once again a hologram.

[[File:RedDwarfBackToEarth1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From left to right: [[Kryten]], [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], and [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth''.]]

* The '''[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]''', played by '''[[Danny John-Jules]]''', is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew. As time goes by, however, he becomes more influenced by his human companions, and so begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human. It is later revealed that, unlike his human companions, he has a "cool" sounding pulse and heart beat, six nipples and colour-coordinated internal organs.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 30-34.</ref>

* The ship's computer, '''[[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]]''' (played by '''[[Norman Lovett]]''' during series I, II, VII and VIII and '''[[Hattie Hayridge]]''' in series III to V), has an [[IQ]] of 6,000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years it is left alone after the accident, having developed "computer senility". The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe "with whom he'd once fallen madly in love".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 35-38.</ref>

* '''[[Kristine Kochanski]]''' (originally portrayed by '''[[Clare Grogan]]''' before '''[[Chlo<U+00EB> Annett]]''' took on the role from series VII) was initially a Red Dwarf navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since.<ref name="Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24"/> In one [[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|episode]], the crew happen upon an alternative dimension, where Kochanski had survived the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident. She joined Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapsed.<ref name="Series VII review at DVD Active"/> By the first episode of the ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her "death") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her. Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in "the next series" and to make amends.

==Production==
The first series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in [[1988 in television|1988]]. Nine further series have so far been produced,<ref name="screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> and a [[film]] has been in development almost continually since before series VIII in 1999.<ref name="Red Dwarf: The Movie">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Red Dwarf: The Movie | work = | publisher=www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk | date = | url =http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-06 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071128145914/http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm#filming <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>

===Concept and commission===
The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch-series ''[[Dave Hollins: Space Cadet]]'' on the BBC Radio 4 show ''[[Son of Clich<U+00E9>]]'' in the mid-1980s, written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor.<ref name="The Official Red Dwarf Companion, Red Dwarf Genesis">{{cite book |last=Dessau |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Official Red Dwarf Companion |year=1992 |publisher=Titan |location=Red Dwarf Genesis |isbn=978-1-85286-456-9}}</ref> Their influences came from films and television programmes such as ''[[Silent Running]]'' (1972), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1981),<ref name="screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> but also had a large element of British-style comedy and satire thrown into the mix, ultimately moulded into the form of a sitcom. Having first written the pilot script in 1983, the former ''[[Spitting Image]]'' writers had hawked their unusual and original script around but it was rejected by everyone at the BBC, as it was believed a sitcom based around science fiction would not be popular.<ref name="The Official Red Dwarf Companion, Red Dwarf Genesis"/>

It was finally accepted by [[BBC North]] in 1986, a result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of ''[[Happy Families (TV series)|Happy Families]]'' that would never arise, and producer [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]]'s insistence that ''Red Dwarf'' should be filmed instead.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series I Genesis">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=genesis | title =Red Dwarf Series I Genesis | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17}}</ref> The show was lucky to be remounted after an [[electrician]]s' [[strike action|strike]] partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (The title sequence was filmed in January 1987).<ref name = "Prog Guide p6"/> The filming was rescheduled for September, and the [[The End (Red Dwarf)|pilot episode]] finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.<ref name = "screenonline: Red Dwarf"/>

===Casting===
[[Alan Rickman]] and [[Alfred Molina]] auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina being cast as Rimmer.<ref name="Interview: Norman Lovett">Interview: Norman Lovett, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 9, November 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603</ref><ref name="Red Dwarf Series 1 Episode One: The End">Red Dwarf Series 1 Episode One: The End, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 1, May 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603</ref> However, after Molina had difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular, the role was recast and filled by [[Chris Barrie]]. Barrie was a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on ''[[Spitting Image]]'', and with the producers on ''Happy Families'' and [[Jasper Carrott]] productions.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series 1 Episode One: The End"/> [[Craig Charles]], a Liverpudlian "punk poet", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the "Cat" character, as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist.<ref name="Prog Guide p5">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 5.</ref> Charles described the character as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister.<ref name="Prog Guide p6">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 6.</ref> Laconic [[stand up comedian]] [[Norman Lovett]], who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer, was kept in the show as Holly, the senile computer of the titular ship.<ref name="Prog Guide p5"/> A professional dancer and singer, [[Danny John-Jules]], arriving half an hour late for his appointment, stood out as the Cat immediately. This was partly due to his "cool" exterior, dedicated research (reading [[Desmond Morris]]'s book ''Catwatching''), and his showing up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style suit.<ref name="Prog Guide p5"/>

===Writing, producing, and directing===
Grant and Naylor wrote the first six series together (using the pseudonym Grant Naylor on the first two novels and later as the name of their production company, although never on the episodes themselves).<ref name="Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 205">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 205.</ref> Grant left in 1995,<ref name = "screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> to pursue other projects,<ref name="Series VI Aftermath">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=6&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Series VI Aftermath | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11}}</ref> leaving Naylor to write the final two series with a group of new writers, including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn who portrayed the character Kryten.<ref name="Series VII Writing">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =Series VII Writing | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11}}</ref>

For the most part, [[Ed Bye]] produced and directed the series. He left before series V due to a scheduling clash (he ended up directing a show starring his wife, [[Ruby Wax]]) so [[Juliet May]] took over as director.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 16.</ref> May parted ways with the show halfway through the series for personal and professional reasons and Grant and Naylor took over direction of the series, in addition to writing and producing.<ref name="Series V production">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series V production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17}}</ref> Series VI was directed by Andy de Emmony, and Ed Bye returned to direct series VII and VIII. Series I, II and III were made by Paul Jackson Productions, with subsequent series produced by the writers' own company Grant Naylor Productions for [[BBC North]]. All eight series were broadcast on BBC2. At the beginning of series IV, production moved from the BBC North's [[New Broadcasting House|Oxford Road studios]] in [[Manchester]] to [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]].<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 13, 14.</ref>

===Theme song and music===
The theme tune and incidental music were written and performed by [[Howard Goodall]], with the distinctive vocals on the closing theme tune courtesy of [[Jenna Russell]]. The first two series used a relatively sombre theme tune for the opening titles; from series III onwards this switched to an instrumental version of the closing theme. Goodall also wrote music for the show's various songs, including "Tongue Tied", with lyrics written by Grant and Naylor.<ref name="Interview: Howard Goodall">Interview: Howard Goodall, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603</ref> Danny John-Jules (credited as "Cat") re-orchestrated and released "Tongue Tied" in October 1993; it reached #17 on the UK charts.<ref name="everyHit.com&nbsp;<U+2014> UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts">{{cite web | url =http://www.everyhit.co.uk/notauth.html | title =everyHit.com&nbsp;<U+2014> UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts | publisher =www.everyhit.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref> Goodall himself sang "The Rimmer Song" heard during the series VII episode "Blue", to which Chris Barrie mimed.<ref>"Back from the Dead" featurette on the Series VII DVD release</ref>

===Remastered===

In 1998, on the tenth anniversary of the show's first airing (and between the broadcast of series VII and VIII), the first three series of ''Red Dwarf'' were [[Red Dwarf Remastered|remastered]] and released on [[VHS]]. The remastering included replacing model shots with computer graphics, cutting certain dialogue and scenes,<ref name="Sci-Fi-London Film Festival&nbsp;<U+2014> The Bodysnatcher Collection">{{cite web | url=http://www.sci-fi-london.com/news/article/1195080035/3/red-dwarf-the-bodysnatcher-collection | title =Sci-Fi-London Film Festival&nbsp;<U+2014> The Bodysnatcher Collection | publisher =www.sci-fi-london.com |accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> re-filming Norman Lovett's Holly footage, creating a consistent set of opening titles, replacing music and creating ambient sound effects with a digital master.<ref name="Red Dwarf series I Remastering">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=remastering | title =Red Dwarf series I Remastering | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18}}</ref> The remastered series were released in a 4 disc DVD boxset "The Bodysnatcher Collection" in 2007.<ref name="The Bodysnatcher Collection">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2007/11/09/the-bodysnatcher-collection/ | title =The Bodysnatcher Collection | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-

Three years elapsed between series VI and VII, partly due to the dissolving of the [[Grant Naylor|Grant and Naylor]] partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects.<ref name="Series VI Aftermath"/> When the series eventually returned, it was [[filmizing|filmised]] and no longer shot in front of a live audience, allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, location shooting and [[single camera setup|single camera]] techniques.<ref name="Red Dwarf series VII Production">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series VII Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17}}</ref> When the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and returned to using a live audience.<ref name="Red Dwarf series VIII Production">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=8&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series VIII Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18}}</ref>

The show received a setback when the BBC rejected proposals for a series IX.

===Back to Earth===
{{Main|Red Dwarf: Back to Earth}}

''Red Dwarf: Back to Earth'' was broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2009, along with a "making of" documentary.<ref>{{cite news|title= Red Dwarf to return in new series|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/4348317/Red-Dwarf-to-return-in-new-series.html|date= 2008-09-26|accessdate= 2008-09-27 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Back To Earth: The Trilogy|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/02/20/back-to-earth-the-trilogy/|date=|accessdate= 2009-02-20}}</ref> A further special, titled ''Red Dwarf: Unplugged'', had been planned and was described by Craig Charles as "just the four of us - and some chairs <U+2013> trying to improvise, or rather trying to remember, classic scenes", but this special was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.ganymede.tv/atspeed/2009/01/whose-dwarf-is-it-anyway Whose Dwarf Is It Anyway? | Ganymede & Titan].

The episode is set nine years after the events of "[[Only the Good...]]", Kochanski is dead and Holly is offline due to water damage caused by Lister leaving a tap running.<ref name="The Kryten Factor">Red Alert, p. 8, SFX, Issue 181, April 2009</ref> Actress [[Sophie Winkleman]] plays a character called Katerina, a resurrected hologram of a Red Dwarf science officer intent on replacing Rimmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dave.uktv.co.uk/library/red-dwarf/red-dwarf-news-new-character-revealed/ |title=Red Dwarf News: New character revealed! - Red Dwarf exclusive weekly news Library on Dave |publisher=Dave.uktv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>

To achieve a more cinematic atmosphere, ''Back to Earth'' was not filmed in front of a studio audience. Although this was not the first time this had happened (i.e., Series VII), it was the first time a laughter track was not added for broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red-Through: A high-definition start to the new ''Dwarf'' production.|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/02/13/red-through/|date=|accessdate= 2009-02-13}}</ref>  It was also the first episode of ''Red Dwarf'' to be filmed in [[High-definition television|High Definition]].<ref name="The Kryten Factor"/>

The specials were televised over three nights starting on Friday, 10 April 2009 to a mixed audience response. ''Back to Earth'' received record ratings for freeview channel Dave. ''Back to Earth'' was released on DVD on 15 June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Episodes' DVD Date Revealed|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/02/20/dave-episodes-dvd-date-revealed/|work=Reddwarf.co.uk|date=20 February 2009|accessdate= 2009-02-20}}</ref> The DVD includes both the individual episodes and a newly edited "Director's Cut" combining the three episodes into a single feature film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/04/24/were-making-the-dvd-now/|title=We're Making The DVD Now|work=Reddwarf.co.uk|date=24 April 2009|accessdate= 2012-07-30}}</ref> ''Back to Earth'' was subsequently described on the series' official website as "for all intents and purposes, the 'ninth series' of ''Red Dwarf''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/help/|title=Official Red Dwarf Help page|work=Reddwarf.co.uk|accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>

Doug Naylor stated in an interview with Dave before the broadcast of ''Back to Earth'' that he would like to make another full-length series, but added that "we would have to wait and see" how good or bad the reaction to the new specials would be. He also stated that he would not want to make a series nine but that he might make a series ten, and explained that ''Back to Earth'' is to be considered as series nine. The specials establish that two series focusing on the events leading up to ''Back to Earth'' occurred after series eight; during the fictional ninth series (described within the episode by one fan as "the best series yet"), Kryten informed Lister that Kochanski had died, but within ''Back to Earth'' Lister learned that Kochanski hadn't died at all, leaving open the possibility of Lister's pursuit of Kochanski in future episodes.

==Themes==
[[File:Red dwarf polymorph.jpg|thumb|right|The episode "[[Polymorph (Red Dwarf episode)|Polymorph]]" parodied the 1979 ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' film]]''Red Dwarf'' was founded on a standard sitcom [[trope (literature)|trope]]: namely, a disparate and frequently dysfunctional group of individuals living together in a restricted setting. With the main characters routinely displaying their cowardice, incompetence and laziness, while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue, the series provided a humorous antidote to the fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science fiction shows<ref name = "screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> with the main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative. The increasing science fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by Grant and Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other&nbsp;<U+2014> not always science fiction&nbsp;<U+2014> television shows, films and books.<ref name="Red Dwarf paraody">{{cite web | url=http://www.reviewsbygavrielle.com/dwarf.shtml | title =Red Dwarf  parody | publisher =www.reviewsbygavrielle.com |accessdate =2008-02-08}}</ref> These have included references to the likes of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968),<ref name="2001: A Space Oddyssey paraody">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =2001: A Space Oddyssey paraody | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-17}}</ref> ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986),<ref name="Top Gun influences">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=4&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=music | title =Top Gun influences | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-17}}</ref> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977),<ref name="movie connections at dvd verdict">{{cite web | url =http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarf.php | title =Alien, Robocop, Star Wars movie reference | publisher =www.dvdverdict.com |accessdate =2008-02-08}}</ref> ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1942), ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984)<ref name="smegazine39">Nazzaro, Joe. p. 39. Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993</ref> and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813).

The writers would even base the whole theme of an episode on a film's plot. The series III episode "Polymorph" references and parodies key moments from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979),<ref name="movie connections at dvd verdict"/> series IV's "[[Camille (Red Dwarf)|Camille]]" echoes key scenes from ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942),<ref name="smegazine39"/> "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]" borrows the main plot from ''[[Westworld]]'', (1973) and "[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]" is greatly inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). But the series does not limit its themes to films or television; historical events and figures have also been referenced and even integrated as part of an episode.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 67, 68.</ref> Religion also plays a part in the series, as a significant factor in the ultimate fate of the Cat race, and the perception of Lister as their "God".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 48, 49.</ref> Religion is turned on its head as mundane things are shown to acquire deep religious significance. The dispute over the colour of cardboard hats in Lister's fantasy doughnut diner (which has become the Cat version of Paradise) sparks the holy war that almost annihilates the species. The series also makes a literary reference to the [[Samuel Beckett]] play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in the title for the episode ''[[Waiting for God (Red Dwarf)|Waiting for God]]''. The episode titled ''[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]'' derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon.org/chris/ouroboros.html |title=Ouroboros |publisher=Dragon.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>

The series also explores many sci-fi staples such as time-travel paradoxes ([[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.

Aliens do not feature in the series as Rob Grant and Doug Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens in the show.  However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, or a Genetically Engineered Life Form ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature (most of the enemies within the later series are some variant on GELFs or Simulants).<ref>{{cite web|author=Red Dwarf Series I |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/analysis/ten-moments-that-shaped-red-dwarf/index.cfm |title=Ten Moments That Shaped Red Dwarf  &#124; Features |publisher=Red Dwarf |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>

==Hallmarks==
{{Main|List of Red Dwarf concepts}}
The series developed its own distinct vocabulary. Words and phrases such as [[holography|hologramatic]] [''sic''], Dollarpound, ''[[Felis sapiens]]'', [[List of Red Dwarf Concepts#Simulants|Simulants]], [[GELF]], space [[weevil]] and [[zero gravity|Zero Gee]] Football appear throughout the series, highlighting a development in language, political climate, technology, evolution and culture in the future.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide">{{cite book |last=Howarth |first= Chris |authorlink= |coauthors=Steve Lyons |title=Red Dwarf Programme Guide: A-Z |year=1993 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=A-z |isbn=0-86369-682-1}}</ref> The creators also employed a vocabulary of fictional [[Expletive attributive|expletive]]s in order to avoid using potentially offensive words in the show, and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language. "[[smeg (vulgarism)|Smeg]]", "gimboid", "goit", and variants of "smeg" such as "smegging", "smegger", and "smeg-head" were used.<ref name="Red Dwarf series I Writing">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =Red Dwarf series I Writing | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18}}</ref>

==Reception and achievements==
===Mixed reactions===
The changes that were made to the series' cast, setting, creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans and critics alike as to the quality of certain series.<ref name = "screenonline: Red Dwarf"/><ref>Lyons, Steve & Nazzaro, Joe. p. 38, 39. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993</ref> In the "Great Red Dwarf Debate", published in volume 2 issue 3 of the ''Red Dwarf Smegazine'', science fiction writers Steve Lyons and Joe Nazzaro both argued on the pros and cons of the early series against the later series. Lyons stated that what the show "once had was a unique balance of sci-fi comedy, which worked magnificently."<ref>Lyons, Steve. p. 38. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993</ref> Nazarro agreed that "the first two series are very original and very funny", but went on to say that "it wasn't until series III that the show hit its stride."<ref>Nazzaro, Joe. p. 39. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993</ref> Series VI is regarded as a continuation of the "[[Monster of the week]]" philosophy of series V, which was nevertheless considered to be visually impressive.<ref name="series VI review at Sci Fi Weekly">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =series VI review at Sci Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Discussions revolve around the quality of series VI, seen by viewers as just as good as the earlier series',<ref name="Red Dwarf VI review at Sci-Fi.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =Red Dwarf VI review at Sci-Fi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but has been criticised as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting.<ref name="Red Dwarf VI review by Gavrielle">{{cite web | url =http://www.reviewsbygavrielle.com/dwarf3.shtml | title =Red Dwarf VI review by Gavrielle | publisher =www.reviewsbygavrielle.com |accessdate =2008-02-01}}</ref>

The changes seen in series VII were seen by some as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from outright sitcom and into something approaching [[comedy drama]] was seen as a move in the wrong direction.<ref name="series VII review at DVD Active">{{cite web | url =http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/red-dwarf-vii.html | title =series VII review at DVD Active | publisher =www.dvdactive.com |accessdate =2008-02-11}}</ref> Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm.<ref name = "screenonline: Red Dwarf"/> There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of ''Red Dwarf'', as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive.<ref name="series VIII review at Sci Fi Weekly">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html | title =series VIII review at Sci Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060720213246/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html |archivedate = 20 July 2006}}</ref> There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however,<ref name="TV Reviews at SciFi.com">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue457/screen2.html | title =TV Reviews at SciFi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070703001116/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue457/screen2.html |archivedate = 3 July 2007}}</ref><ref name="series Reviews at DVD Direct">{{cite web | url =http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php | title =series Reviews at DVD Direct | publisher =www.dvdverdict.com |accessdate =2008-02-11}}</ref> and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.<ref name="screenonline: Red Dwarf">{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/560214/index.html | title =screenonline: Red Dwarf | publisher =www.screenonline.org.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11}}</ref>

==Spin-offs and merchandise==
The show's logo and characters have appeared on a wide range of merchandise.<ref name="Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 205"/><ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 219.</ref> ''Red Dwarf'' has also been spun off in a variety of different media formats.

===Novels===
[[File:German-novel-artwork-1s.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The German edition of ''Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers'', entitled ''Roter Zwerg''.]]
Working together under the name "Grant Naylor", the creators of the series collaboratively wrote two novels. The first, ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'', was published in November 1989, and incorporates plot lines from several episodes of the show's first two series. The second novel, ''[[Better Than Life]]'', followed in October 1990, and is largely based on the second-series episode of the same name. Together, the two novels provide expanded backstory and development of the series' principal characters and themes. Retaining the show's offbeat sense of humor, the novels share some similarity with Douglas Adams' ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', also a science fiction comedy series.

The authors began work on a sequel to ''Better than Life'', called ''The Last Human'', but Rob Grant was drawn away from ''Red Dwarf'' by an interest in other projects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Still owing [[Penguin Books|Penguin Publishing]] two more ''Red Dwarf'' novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to ''Better than Life''. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. ''[[Last Human]]'', by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel ''[[Backwards]]'', is more in keeping with the previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.<ref name="Series VI Aftermath"/>

An [[omnibus edition]] of the first two novels was released in 1992, including edits to the original text and extra material such as the original pilot script of the TV series.<ref name="Prog Guide p206">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 206.</ref> All four novels have been released in [[audiobook]] format; the first two read by Chris Barrie,<ref name="Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1897774109 | title =Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref><ref name="Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> Better Than Life">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1897774818 | title =Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> Better Than Life | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref> ''Last Human'' read by Craig Charles,<ref name="Amazon.co.uk: Last Human">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0007105657 | title =Amazon.co.uk: Last Human | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref> and ''Backwards'' read by  author Rob Grant.<ref name="Amazon.co.uk: Backwards (Red Dwarf)">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0140171509 | title =Amazon.co.uk: Backwards (Red Dwarf) | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref>

In December, 2009, ''Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers'' was released in Germany with the title ''Roter Zwerg'' (Red Dwarf in German).<ref>{{cite web|author=Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/07/03/german-novel-artwork/ |title=German Novel Artwork &#124; News |publisher=Red Dwarf |date= |accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref>

===Home video releases===
For the initial release of the VHS editions, episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' were separated and two tapes were released for each series, labelled 'byte one' and 'byte two'. These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos. For series V, "[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]" and "[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]" were given top billing on their respective video release.<ref name="Red Dwarf series V Aftermath">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf series V Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07}}</ref> For the second VHS volume of series I, "[[Confidence and Paranoia]]" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being "Waiting for God" which shared its name with the title of another comedy series (set in a retirement home). Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context. All eight series were made available on VHS, and three episodes of series VII were also released as special "Xtended" (sic) versions with extra scenes (including an original, unbroadcast ending for the episode "Tikka To Ride") and no [[laugh track]];<ref name="Red Dwarf series VII Aftermath">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf series VII Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref> the [[Red Dwarf Remastered|remastered]] versions of series I<U+2013>III were also released individually and in a complete box-set.<ref name="series I Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk">{{cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CVR6 | title =series I Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref><ref name="series III Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk">{{cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CW2Z | title =series III Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref><ref name="series I-III Remastered VHS Boxset at sendit.com">{{cite web | url =http://www.sendit.com/video/item/7000000047047| title=series I-III Remastered VHS Boxset at sendit.com | publisher =www.sendit.com |accessdate =2008-02-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080126152114/http://www.sendit.com/video/item/7000000047047 |archivedate = 26 January 2008}}</ref> Finally, two [[blooper|outtake]] videos were released, ''Smeg Ups'' in 1994, and its sequel ''Smeg Outs'' in 1995.<ref name="Smeg Ups">{{cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CPHB | title =Smeg Ups| publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref><ref name="Smeg Outs">{{cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CRCE | title =Smeg Outs | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref>

The eight series have since been released on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4, each with a bonus disc of extra material and each release from series III onwards being accompanied by an original documentary about the making of each respective series.<ref name="series III DVD review at Sci-Fi.com">{{cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue358/screen2.html | title =series III DVD review at Sci-Fi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822011531/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue358/screen2.html |archivedate = 22 August 2007}}</ref> Regions 2 and 4 have also seen the release of two ''Just The Shows'', digipack boxsets containing the episodes from series I<U+2013>IV (Volume 1) and V-VIII (Volume 2) with static menus and no extras.<ref name="Just the shows series I-IV at BBC shop">{{cite web | url =http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/bbcdvd1992 | title =Just the shows series I-IV at BBC shop | publisher=www.bbcshop.com |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref><ref name="Just the shows series V-VIII at BBC shop">{{cite web | url =http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/bbcdvd1550 | title =Just the shows series V-VIII at  BBC shop | publisher =www.bbcshop.com |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref> ''Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection'', containing the 1997 remastered episodes, as well as new documentaries for series I and II, was released in 2007. This release showcased a storyboard construction of "Bodysnatcher", an unfinished script from 1987, which was finally completed in 2007 by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor who were working together for the first time since 1993.<ref name="The Bodysnatcher Collection"/> In December 2008 an anniversary DVD set entitled ''Red Dwarf: All The Shows'' was released, reworking the vanilla disc content of the two Just The Shows sets within A4 packaging resembling a 'photo album', which carefully omitted information that no extras were included. This box-set was re-released in a smaller slip-case sized box, reverting to the ''Just the Shows'' title, in November 2009. The series is also available for download on [[iTunes]].

===Magazine===
[[File:red dwarf comic strip image.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rimmer with a greyscale appearance]]The ''Red Dwarf Magazine'' <U+2013> the magazine part of the title changed to "Smegazine" from issue 3 <U+2013> was launched in 1992 by [[Fleetway|Fleetway Editions]]. It comprised a mix of news, reviews, interviews, comic strips and competitions. The comic strips featured episode adaptations and original material, including further stories of popular characters like the Mr. Flibble, Polymorph and Ace Rimmer.

Notably, the comic strip stories' holographic characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in [[greyscale]]. This was at the request of Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the technique for the television series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce.<ref name="Prog Guide p217">Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 217.</ref> Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month,<ref name="Prog Guide p217"/> the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications.<ref name="Series VI Aftermath"/> A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.<ref name="last Smeg">Smeg-Editorial, p. 2, Red Dwarf Smegazine, Volume 2 Issue 9, January 1994</ref>

Another Red Dwarf magazine was started called ''Red Dwarf: Better Than Life'' which is only available through the ''Red Dwarf Official Fan Club''. It features cast interviews and the latest news. Each person gets four issues each year.

===U.S. version===
[[File:Red dwarf usa 9.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Cast of second Red Dwarf USA pilot]]
A pilot episode for an American version (known as '''''Red Dwarf USA''''') was produced through [[Universal Studios]] with the intention of broadcasting on [[NBC]] in 1992.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 228.</ref> The show essentially followed the same story as the [[The End (Red Dwarf)|first episode]] of the original series, using American actors for most of the main roles:<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p.225.</ref> [[Craig Bierko]] as Lister, [[Chris Eigeman]] as Rimmer, and [[Hinton Battle]] as Cat. Exceptions to this were Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten (a character who spoke with a flat accent reminiscent of American or Canadian intonations anyway), and the British actress [[Jane Leeves]], who played Holly. It was written by [[Linwood Boomer]] and directed by [[Jeffrey Melman]], with Grant and Naylor onboard as creators and executive producers.<ref name="Red Dwarf USA">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/history/red-dwarf-usa/ | title =Red Dwarf USA | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-06}}</ref> During filming of the pilot the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name="Red Dwarf USA"/>

The studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a "promo video" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as "a garage".<ref name="Red Dwarf USA"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat and Rimmer;<ref name="Red Dwarf USA"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fuscle respectively. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes.<ref name="Red Dwarf USA"/> Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name="Red Dwarf USA"/> (Farrell was cast almost immediately afterwards for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.)

The cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister who is portrayed in the British version as a likable slob but in the US version as somewhat clean cut. In the 2004 documentary ''Dwarfing USA'', [[Danny John-Jules]] said the only actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was [[John Belushi]]. In a 2009 interview on ''[[Kevin Pollak's Chat Show]]'', Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a "huge mistake" and also said a "John Belushi type" would have been better suited to the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?p=68|title=Kevin Pollak's Chat Show Episode 28 <U+2013> Craig Bierko|date=2 August 2009}}</ref>

The American pilot has been heavily bootlegged, but it has never been broadcast on TV in any country.

===Film===
Since the end of the eighth series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been attempting to make a feature length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was genuine and had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas.<ref name="Making The Movie">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/archive/making_the_movie.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070710221153/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/archive/making_the_movie.html | archivedate=2007-07-10 | title =Making The Movie | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07}}</ref> Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set in the distant future where ''Homo sapienoids'' - a fearsome flesh machine hybrid race&nbsp;<U+2014> had taken over the solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... ''Red Dwarf''.<ref name="The movie">{{cite web | url =http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm | title =Red Dwarf The movie | publisher =www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080204141520/http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm#filming <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate =2008-02-04}}</ref>

Naylor had scouted Australia to get an idea of locations and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005.<ref name="The movie"/> However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a ''Red Dwarf'' [[Dimension Jump (UK Convention)|Dimension Jump]] convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the [[UK Film Council|British Film Council]]. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.<ref name="Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> The Movie That Never Was">{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a44838/cult-spy-red-dwarf-the-movie-that-never-was.html | title =Red Dwarf&nbsp;<U+2014> The Movie That Never Was | publisher =www.digitalspy.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07}}</ref>

===Roleplaying game===
Deep7 LLC released ''Red Dwarf - The Roleplaying Game'' in February 2003 (although the printed copyright is 2002).<ref name="Deep7">{{cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG at Deep7 | publisher = Deep7 | url=http://www.deep7.com/product.php?cat=reddwarf | accessdate = 2008-09-29 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080913040308/http://www.deep7.com/product.php?cat=reddwarf <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2008-09-13}}</ref> Based on the series, the game allows its players to portray original characters within the Red Dwarf universe. Player characters can be human survivors, holograms, evolved house pets (cats, dogs, iguanas, rabbits, rats and mice), various types of mechanoid (Series 4000, Hudzen 10 and Waxdroids in the corebook, Series 3000 in the Extra Bits Book) or GELFs (Kinatawowi and Pleasure GELF in the corebook, "Vindaloovians" in the Extra Bits Book).

A total of three products were released for the game: the core 176-page rulebook, the ''AI Screen'' (analogous to the ''Game Master's Screen'' used in other [[roleplaying games]], also featuring the "Extra Bits Book" booklet), and the ''Series Sourcebook''.<ref name="GameWyrd">{{cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG at GameWyrd | publisher = GameWyrd |url=http://www.gamewyrd.com/review/469 | accessdate = 2008-09-29 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080820032605/http://www.gamewyrd.com/review/469 <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2008-08-20}}</ref> The ''Series Sourcebook'' contains plot summaries of each episode of every series as well as game rules for all major and minor characters from each series.

The game has been praised for staying true to the comedic nature of the series, for its entertaining writing, and for the detail to which the background material is explained.<ref name="GameWyrd"/><ref name="SciFiRPGReview">{{cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG review at scifi.com | publisher = scifi.com | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/games.html | accessdate = 2008-09-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513083215/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/games.html |archivedate = 13 May 2008}}</ref> However, some reviewers found the game mechanics to be simplistic and uninspiring compared to other science fiction roleplaying games on the market.<ref name="RealmsRPGReview">{{cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG review  at Realms | publisher = Realms.org.uk | url=http://www.realms.org.uk/cms/articles/reddwarfreview | accessdate = 2008-09-29}}</ref>

===Red Dwarf Night===
On 14 February 1998, the night before the tenth anniversary of the show's pilot episode broadcast, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] devoted an evening of programmes to the series, under the banner of ''Red Dwarf Night''. The evening consisted of a mixture of new and existing material, and was introduced and linked by actor and fan [[Patrick Stewart]]. In addition, a series of special take-offs on BBC2's [[Station identification|idents]], featuring the "2" logo falling in love with a [[skutter]], were used.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04}}</ref> The night began with ''Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg'', a spoof of the cookery programme ''[[Can't Cook, Won't Cook]]'', presented by that show's host [[Ainsley Harriott]] who had himself appeared as a GELF in the series VI episode "[[Emohawk: Polymorph II]]". Taking place outside the continuity of the series, two teams (Kryten and Lister versus Rimmer and Cat, although Cat quickly departs to be replaced by alter ego [[Duane Dibbley]]) were challenged to make the best chicken [[vindaloo]].<ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath"/>

After a compilation [[bloopers]] show, featuring out-takes, the next programme was ''Universe Challenge'', a spoof of [[University Challenge]]. Hosted by original ''University Challenge'' presenter [[Bamber Gascoigne]], the show had a team of knowledgeable ''Dwarf'' fans compete against a team consisting of Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Robert Llewellyn, Chlo<U+00EB> Annett and Danny John Jules.<ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath"/> This was followed by ''The Red Dwarf A-Z'', a half-hour documentary that chose a different aspect of the show to focus on for each letter of the alphabet. Talking heads on the episode included [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Terry Pratchett]], original producer [[K. Paul Jackson|Paul Jackson]], and [[Patrick Stewart]]. Finally, the night ended with a showing of the episode "Gunmen of the Apocalypse".<ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath"/>
