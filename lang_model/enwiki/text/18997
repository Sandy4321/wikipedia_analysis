==Biography==
===Early life===
Masashi Hamauzu was born in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. His mother was a Japanese piano teacher and his father was a German opera singer. He developed an interest in music while in kindergarten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/hamauzu/feb02interview.shtml|title=Interview with Masashi Hamauzu (RocketBaby - February 2002)|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> Growing up in Germany, Hamauzu received piano and singing lessons from his parents and created his first original compositions during high school. After his brother was born, the family moved to [[Osaka]], Japan. He enrolled in the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]], where he joined a student ensemble as a pianist. Hamauzu met his wife at the university, and they have one daughter. After graduating from university, he thought about becoming a classical musician, but he eventually found out that he wanted to work with game music instead.<ref name="SEMO">{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/hamauzu/biography.shtml|title=Masashi Hamauzu :: Biography|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|author=Totz; Chris|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

===Career===
A fan of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, he decided to apply for a job at [[Square Co.|Square]]. [[Nobuo Uematsu]] was impressed with his resum<U+00E9>, and employed Hamauzu as a trainee in 1996. His debut came with the 1996 title ''[[Front Mission: Gun Hazard]]'', with Uematsu, [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], and [[Junya Nakano]]. Later the same year, he created four tracks for another multi-composer game called ''[[Tobal No. 1]]''. Working with Nakano on these games, Hamauzu admired his musical style, and they became friends and have later collaborated on several titles.<ref name="SEMO"/> Hamauzu's first solo project came the next year with ''[[Chocobo#Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon|Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/hamauzu/sep03interview.shtml|title=Interview with Masashi Hamauzu (RocketBaby - September 2003)|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> Shortly after the game's release, he and Yasuo Sako created ''[[Coi Vanni Gialli]]'', an arranged album containing orchestral tracks from ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon''{{'}}s music. Although the game was a failure, its soundtrack and arranged album was praised. Hamauzu had a minor role in creating the soundtrack for the highly successful ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''; he was the synthesizer operator for the rendition of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s "The Creation", and provided bass vocals in the eight-person chorus for "One-Winged Angel".<ref name="SEMO"/>

In 1999, Hamauzu was assigned with scoring ''[[SaGa Frontier 2]]'', replacing the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series' long-time composer [[Kenji It<U+014D>]]. He spent some time conforming to the music It<U+014D> had established for the series, but he eventually realized that he wanted to use his own unique style. The project introduced him to synthesizer operator [[Ryo Yamazaki]], whom he has worked with on most of his subsequent soundtracks. Hamauzu also created ''[[Discography of the SaGa series#Piano Pieces "SF2" ~ Rhapsody on a Theme of SaGa Frontier 2|Piano Pieces "SF2" ~ Rhapsody on a Theme of SaGa Frontier 2]]'', an arranged album featuring piano and orchestral pieces of the game's music.<ref name="SEMO"/> Hamauzu and Nakano were chosen to assist Uematsu late in the production of the score for the critically acclaimed ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' in 2001. Although some fans of the series were indifferent to his contributions, his work was well-received in general. Hamauzu also created the [[Discography of Final Fantasy X#Piano Collections Final Fantasy X|Piano Collections]] album for the project, which he described as his most challenging work, and the track "feel", an arrangement of "Hymn of the Fayth", from the [[extended play]] ''[[Discography of Final Fantasy X#feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus|feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus]]''.<ref name="SEMO"/> He garnered worldwide recognition for his involvement with ''Final Fantasy X''{{'}}s music.

One year after working on ''Final Fantasy X''{{'}}s score, Hamauzu composed the critical failure ''[[Unlimited Saga]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/unlimitedsaga/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review|title=Unlimited Saga Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Brad|last=Shoemaker|date=2003-06-17|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> Following Uematsu's departure from Square Enix in October 2004, Hamauzu became the leading composer of the company's music team. In 2005, he scored the sequel to the 1998 title ''[[Brave Fencer Musashi]]'', entitled ''[[Musashi: Samurai Legend]]'', with Nakano and the duo Wavelink Zeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/musashisamurailegend/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=Musashi: Samurai Legend Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> He composed the highly anticipated but critically unsuccessful ''Final Fantasy VII'' follow-up, ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/dirgeofcerberusfinalfantasyvii/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> Later the same year, he arranged the ''[[Sailing to the World|Sailing to the World Piano Score]]'' at request from Mitsuda,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/sailingttw-piano/index.html|title=Sailing to the World Piano Score|publisher=[[RPGFan]]|first=Patrick|last=Gann|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> which was positively received by pianists and confirmed Hamauzu's position as the leading piano arranger of game music.<ref name="SEMO"/>

Hamauzu released the solo album ''Vielen Dank'' in 2007 after recording it in [[Leipzig]], Germany. It includes eleven piano pieces that he composed for fun after the production of ''Piano Pieces "SF2" ~ Rhapsody on a Theme of SaGa Frontier 2'' and 14 arrangements of his game compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/vielendank/index.html|title=Vielen Dank - Masashi Hamauzu|publisher=[[RPGFan]]|first=Patrick|last=Gann|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> Two pieces from the album were performed at the 2007 ''[[Symphonic Game Music Concerts|Symphonic Game Music Concert]]'' in Leipzig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmconcerts.com/main.php?section=news&subs=archive&lang=english&newsid=62|title=Masashi Hamauzu's music to be performed in Leipzig|publisher=VGMConcerts.com|date= 2007-04-30|accessdate=2008-12-14}}</ref> In 2008, he created the soundtrack for ''[[Sigma Harmonics]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/sigmaharmonics/tech_info.html|title=Sigma Harmonics Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> and he did not collaborate with Yamazaki in favor of Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name="SEMO"/> At the 2006 [[E3]] event, a Square Enix press conference revealed that Hamauzu would be returning to the ''Final Fantasy'' series, scoring the upcoming ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', with Uematsu providing the main theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/706/706153p1.html|title=E3 2006: FFXIII Staff Check|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Anoop|last=Gantayat|date=2006-05-09|accessdate= 2008-12-15}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Hamauzu's works are often reminiscent of [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Claude Debussy]] compositions, resembling [[classical music|classical]] and [[ambient music]]. His music frequently incorporates deliberate [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to provide an artistic and mood-setting effect. After pattern and harmony have set in, the unique elegance of the dissonance becomes apparent; the listener's perception of dissonance now evolves into a perception of consonance integral to the music. However, Hamauzu composes music in many different styles, often using multiple styles throughout the various pieces of a soundtrack. In ''Unlimited SaGa'', the style of his compositions mix classical marches, [[tango music]], electronic ambiance, instrumental solos, and [[jazz]].
