== Musical style ==
''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' said that ASAP Nast's style is deeply rooted in 1990's [[East Coast hip hop]], omitting the the [[trap (music genre)|trap]] and [[southern hip hop]] influence in his music, that some other ASAP Mob members have.<ref name="complex1"/> ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' called him a brash, rapid-fire rhymer.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> He has been credited as able to "adapt his flow to match beats of all styles and eras." His verses are usually boastful and full of multi-syllable rhyme schemes.<ref name="hotnewhiphop1"/>
