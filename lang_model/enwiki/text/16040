'''Secondary Highway 525''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 525''', is a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained secondary highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. It is a short, remote secondary highway that links [[Ontario Highway 596|Highway&nbsp;596]] to the [[Wabaseemoong Independent Nations|Wabaseemoong First Nations]] reserve. It is the second-westernmost secondary highway in the province, [[Ontario Highway 673|Highway&nbsp;673]] being the first. The route was commissioned by 1982 along what was formerly Highway&nbsp;596; a former use of the route number existed between 1956 and 1973 in [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]].

== Route description ==
Highway&nbsp;525 is a very remote highway in northwestern Ontario. There are no settlements along its {{convert|35.5|km|adj=on}} length, and the closest human habitation is [[Minaki]] near its southern terminus and [[Whitedog, Ontario|Whitedog]] near its northern terminus. The route begins west of Minaki, branching off from Highway&nbsp;596, which travels south to [[Kenora]]. It travels north along a wide strip of land bounded by Sand Lake to the east, and by Swan Lake and Tetu Lake to the west, all part of the [[Winnipeg River]] watershed. Zig-zagging in a generally northward direction, the highway passes through thick [[boreal forest]]. At approximately its midpoint, the route meets the Cygnet Lake road, which provides access to a remote camp. The highway continues north, curving west immediately before ending at the entrance to the Wabaseemoong (Islington) reserve.<ref name="km" /> The road continues into the reserve to provide access to [[Caribou Falls, Ontario|Caribou Falls]] and Whitedog.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

== History ==
The current Highway&nbsp;525 is not the original usage of the number. In 1956, the number was one of several dozen Secondary Highways designated by the [[Department of Highways]] to improve connections between King's Highways.<ref name="assumed1">{{cite news
