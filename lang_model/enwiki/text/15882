In [[Norse mythology]], '''Sumarr''' ([[Old Norse]] "[[Summer]]"<ref name=ORCHARD154>Orchard (1997:154).</ref>) and '''Vetr''' (Old Norse "[[Winter]]"<ref name=ORCHARD174>Orchard (1997:174).</ref>) are personified [[season]]s. Sumarr and Vetr, personified, are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both, the two are given genealogies, while in the ''Prose Edda'' the two figure into a number of [[kenning]]s used by various [[skald]]s.

===''Poetic Edda''===
In the stanza 26 of the  ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Vaf<U+00FE>r<U+00FA><U+00F0>nism<U+00E1>l]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as "[[List of names of Odin|Gagnr<U+00E1><U+00F0>r]]") asks the [[j<U+00F6>tunn]] [[Vaf<U+00FE>r<U+00FA><U+00F0>nir]]  from where warm Sumarr and Vetr come from, stating that they arrived "first among the Wise powers".<ref name=LARRINGTON44>Larrington (1996:44).</ref> In stanza 27, Vaf<U+00FE>r<U+00FA><U+00F0>nir responds:
:Wind-cool [Vindsvalr] he is called, Winter's [Vetr's] father,
:and Mild-One [Sv<U+00E1>su<U+00F0>r], the father of Summer [Sumarr].<ref name=LARRINGTON44/>
The second half of this stanza is missing from early manuscripts, but some later manuscripts feature the addition of:
:And both of these shall ever be
:Till the gods to destruction go.<ref name=BELLOWS75>Bellows (1936:75).</ref>

===''Prose Edda''===
In chapter 19 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Gangleri]] (king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) asks why there's an evident difference between summer and winter. The enthroned figure of High responds, and (after scolding him for asking a question everyone knows the answer to) states that the father of Sumarr is Sv<U+00E1>su<U+00F0>r, who is quite pleasant, while the father of Vetr is referred to as Vindsvalr or, alternately, Vindlj<U+00F3>ni, and that Vetr derives his countenance from his ancestors, as they are "cruel and cold-hearted kinsmen".<ref name=BYOCK30>Byock (2005:30).</ref>

Sumarr and Vetr are additionally personified in the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]'', where they are referred to in [[kenning]]s. Kennings for Sumarr are given in chapter 30, including "son of Sv<U+00E1>su<U+00F0>r", "comfort of the snakes", "growth of men", exemplified in an excerpt given from a work by the [[skald]] [[Egill Skallagr<U+00ED>msson]] where "Valley-fish's mercy" points to "Snake's mercy", which signifies "Summer".<ref name=FAULKES94>Faulkes (1995:94).</ref> Kennings are given for Vetr in chapter 26; "Son of Vindsvalr", "snake's death", and "storm season". Excerpts of works by the skalds [[Ormr Stein<U+00FE><U+00F3>rsson]] (who uses the kenning "Vindsvalr's son") and <U+00C1>sgr<U+00ED>mr (who employs the kenning "snake woe") are then given as examples.<ref name=FAULKES93>Faulkes (1995:93).</ref> Both Sumarr and Vetr are given as terms for "times" in chapter 63.<ref name=FAULKES144>Faulkes (1995:144).</ref>
