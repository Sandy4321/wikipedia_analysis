== History ==
[[Image:New England 1.svg|50px|left]]
[[Image:US 1.svg|60px|left]]
In 1922, state roads were given number designations in [[New England]] for the first time. Modern Route 130 was originally part of [[New England Route 1]]. In 1927, the [[U.S. Highway]] system was created and New England Route 1 became part of [[U.S. Route 1 (Connecticut)|U.S. Route 1]]. In 1932, an alternate route of US 1 {[[U.S. Route 1A]]) was designated along North Avenue, Boston Avenue and Barnum Avenue further inland (now modern US 1). In 1963, US 1A in the Bridgeport area was deleted and re-designated as US 1. The original US 1 alignment along Fairfield Avenue, State Street and Stratford Avenue became unsigned state roads, with designations SR 771 (Fairfield-Bridgeport) and SR 769 (Bridgeport-Stratford). In 1992, these were re-designated as modern Route 130.<ref>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctx130.html#130 Connecticut Routes, Route 130]</ref>
