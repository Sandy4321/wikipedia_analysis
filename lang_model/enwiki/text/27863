Alice (Sharada) and Anna (Bharati) are sisters who are spinsters and they own the huge estate. The home nurse, Sophiya (Navya Nair), cook (Sukumari), cook's son (Cochin Haneefa) and the priest (Nedumudi Venu) are the only people close to them. Soloman takes charge as the manager of the estate and soon wins over the two oldies. 

He realizes that they are two angels and he tries to bring back joy into their morbid life. Soon, Soloman becomes the apple of their eye and they both consider him as their own son. Meanwhile he falls in love with the home nurse Sophiya with whom he had regular fights. Their wedding is fixed and the sisters give away all their wealth to both of them. The real twist in the story occurs when Sophiya reveals to Soloman that her brother was a photographer who got murdered by some drug addict students. Then during a flashback it is revealed, Soloman has a dark and disturbing past. Soloman is actually falsely accused in a murder case of the photographer and is hiding from the police.

Unaware of all this, Soloman goes to the teachers and insists on them having payasam from him.
