'''Theodosius I''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Theodosius Augustus}};<ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Theodosius' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS THEODOSIVS AVGVSTVS.</ref> 11 January 347 <U+2013>  17 January 395), also known as '''Theodosius the Great''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 379 to 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern]] and the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]. During his reign, the [[Goths]] secured control of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] after the [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic War]], establishing their homeland south of the [[Danube]] within the empire's borders. He also issued decrees that effectively made [[Christianity]] the official [[state religion]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>''Cf. decree, infra''.</ref><ref name="EdictOfThessolonica">"Edict of Thessolonica": See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2</ref>

He is recognized by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as '''Saint Theodosius'''. He defeated the usurpers [[Magnus Maximus]] and [[Eugenius]] and fostered the destruction of some prominent pagan temples: the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]], the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], and the [[Vestal Virgins]] in [[Rome]]. After his death, Theodosius' sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] inherited the East and West halves respectively, and the Roman Empire was never again re-united.

Theodosius was born in [[Coca, Segovia|Cauca]] or [[Italica]], [[Hispania]],<ref>See the Hydatius and Zosimus's critics and other arguments by Alicia M. Canto, <U+00AB>Sobre el origen b<U+00E9>tico de Teodosio I el Grande, y su improbable nacimiento en Cauca de Gallaecia<U+00BB>, ''Latomus'' ([[Brussels]]) 65.2, 2006, p<U+00E1>gs. 388<U+2013>421, cf.[http://users.belgacom.net/latomus/revue.html]</ref> to senior military officer [[Count Theodosius|Theodosius the Elder]].<ref>[[Zosimus|Zos.]] ''Historia Nova'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=FSMAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=zosimus&ei=xzm1R-euDJ6SzQT309jGBQ#PPA200,M1 4.24.4].</ref> He accompanied his father to [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] to help quell the [[Great Conspiracy]] in 368. He was military commander (''[[dux]]'') of [[Moesia]], a Roman province on the lower [[Danube]], in 374. However, shortly thereafter, and at about the same time as the sudden disgrace and execution of his father, Theodosius retired to Spain. The reason for his retirement, and the relationship (if any) between it and his father's death is unclear. It is possible that he was dismissed from his command by the emperor [[Valentinian I]] after the loss of two of Theodosius' legions to the [[Sarmatians]] in late 374.

The death of Valentinian I in 375 created political pandemonium. Fearing further persecution on account of his family ties, Theodosius abruptly retired to his family estates in the province of [[Gallaecia]] (present day [[Galicia, Spain]]) where he adapted to the life of a provincial aristocrat.

From 364 to 375, the Roman Empire was governed by two co-emperors, the brothers [[Valentinian I]] and [[Valens]]; when Valentinian died in 375, his sons, [[Valentinian II]] and [[Gratian]], succeeded him as rulers of the Western Roman Empire. In 378, after [[Valens]] was killed in the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]], Gratian invited Theodosius to take command of the Illyrian army. As [[Valens]] had no successor, Gratian's appointment of Theodosius amounted to a ''de facto'' invitation for Theodosius to become ''co-Augustus'' for the East. Gratian was killed in a rebellion in 383, Theodosius then appointed his elder son, [[Arcadius]], his co-ruler for the East. After the death in 392 of Valentinian II, whom Theodosius had supported against a variety of usurpations, Theodosius ruled as sole Emperor, appointing his younger son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] Augustus as his co-ruler for the West ([[Milan]], on 23 January 393) and by defeating the usurper [[Eugenius]] on 6 September 394, at the [[Battle of the Frigidus]] ([[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] river, modern [[Slovenia]]) he restored peace.

==Family==
By his first wife, the probably Spanish [[Aelia Flaccilla]] Augustus, he had two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and a daughter, Aelia [[Pulcheria (daughter of Theodosius I)|Pulcheria]]; Arcadius was his heir in the East and Honorius in the West. Both Aelia Flaccilla and Pulcheria died in 385.

His second wife (but never declared ''Augusta'') was [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]], daughter of the emperor [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]. Theodosius and Galla had a son Gratian, born in 388 who died young and a daughter Aelia [[Galla Placidia]] (392<U+2013>450). Placidia was the only child who survived to adulthood and later became an Empress.

==Diplomatic policy with the Goths==
The [[Goths]] and their allies ([[Vandals|Vandali]], [[Taifals|Taifalae]], [[Bastarnae]] and the native [[Carpians|Carpi]]) entrenched in the [[province]]s of [[Dacia]] and eastern [[Pannonia|Pannonia Inferior]] consumed Theodosious' attention. The Gothic crisis was so dire that his co-Emperor Gratian relinquished control of the [[Illyria]]n provinces and retired to [[Trier]] in [[Gaul]] to let Theodosius operate without hindrance. A major weakness in the Roman position after the defeat at [[Adrianople]] was the recruiting of [[barbarian]]s to fight against other barbarians. In order to reconstruct the Roman Army of the West, Theodosius needed to find able bodied soldiers and so he turned to the most capable men readily at hand: the barbarians recently settled in the Empire. This caused many difficulties in the battle against barbarians since the newly recruited fighters had little or no loyalty to Theodosius.
[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Roman provinces along the Ister (Danube), showing [[Dacia]], [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]], with [[Sarmatia]] to the north and [[Germania]] to the northwest.]]

Theodosius was reduced to the costly expedient of shipping his recruits to [[Egypt]] and replacing them with more seasoned Romans, but there were still switches of allegiance that resulted in military setbacks. Gratian sent generals to clear the [[diocese]]s of Illyria ([[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]) of Goths, and Theodosius was able finally to enter [[Constantinople]] on  24 November 380, after two seasons in the field. The final treaties with the remaining Gothic forces, signed  3 October 382, permitted large contingents of primarily [[Thervingi]]an Goths to settle along the southern [[Danube]] frontier in the [[province]] of [[Thrace]] and largely govern themselves.

The Goths now settled within the Empire had, as a result of the treaties, military obligations to fight for the Romans as a national contingent, as opposed to being fully integrated into the Roman forces.<ref>Williams and Friell, p34.</ref> However, many Goths would serve in Roman legions and others, as ''[[foederati]],'' for a single campaign, while bands of Goths switching loyalties became a destabilizing factor in the internal struggles for control of the Empire.

In 390 the population of Thessalonica rioted in complaint against the presence of the local Gothic garrison. The [[Magister militum|garrison commander]] was killed in the violence, so [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|Theodosius ordered the Goths to kill all the spectators in the circus as retaliation]]; [[Theodoret]], a contemporary witness to these events, reports:
{{bquote|"...the anger of the Emperor rose to the highest pitch, and he gratified his vindictive desire for vengeance by unsheathing the sword most unjustly and tyrannically against all, slaying the innocent and guilty alike. It is said seven thousand perished without any forms of law, and without even having judicial sentence passed upon them; but that, like ears of wheat in the time of harvest, they were alike cut down."<ref>Theodoret, ''Ecclesiastical History''</ref>}}

Theodosius was threatened with excommunication by the bishop of Milan, [[Saint Ambrose]] for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]].<ref name="Attwater">Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints''. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. ISBN 0-14-051312-4.</ref> Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&nbsp;<U+2014> Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance.

In the last years of Theodosius' reign, one of the emerging leaders of the Goths, named [[Alaric I|Alaric]], participated in Theodosius' campaign against [[Eugenius]] in 394, only to resume his rebellious behavior against Theodosius' son and eastern successor, [[Arcadius]], shortly after Theodosius' death.

==Civil wars in the Empire==
[[File:Roman empire 395.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The administrative divisions of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395, under Theodosius I.]]

After the death of [[Gratian]] in 383, Theodosius' interests turned to the [[Western Roman Empire]], for the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] had taken all the provinces of the West except for Italy. This self-proclaimed threat was hostile to Theodosius' interests, since the reigning emperor [[Valentinian II]], Maximus' enemy, was his ally. Theodosius, however, was unable to do much about Maximus due to his still inadequate military capability and he was forced to keep his attention on local matters. However when Maximus began an invasion of Italy in 387, Theodosius was forced to take action.

The armies of Theodosius and Maximus fought at the [[Battle of the Save]] in 388, which saw Maximus defeated. On 28 August 388 Maximus was executed.<ref>Williams and Friell, p 64.</ref> Trouble arose again, after Valentinian was found hanging in his room. It was claimed to be a suicide by the ''[[magister militum]]'', [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]].

Arbogast, unable to assume the role of Emperor because of his non-Roman background, elected [[Eugenius]], a former teacher of rhetoric. Eugenius started a program of restoration of the [[Paganism|Pagan]] faith, and sought, in vain, Theodosius' recognition. In January 393, Theodosius gave his son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] the full rank of "Augustus" in the West, citing Eugenius' illegitimacy.<ref>Williams and Friell, p129.</ref>

Theodosius campaigned against Eugenius. The two armies faced at the [[Battle of Frigidus]] in September 394.<ref>Williams and Friell, p 134.</ref> The battle began on  5 September 394, with Theodosius' full frontal assault on Eugenius' forces.  Theodosius was repulsed on the first day, and Eugenius thought the battle to be all but over. However, in Theodosius' camp, the loss of the day decreased morale. It is said that Theodosius was visited by two "heavenly riders all in white" who gave him courage. The next day, the battle began again and Theodosius' forces were aided by a natural phenomenon known as the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]], which produces cyclonic winds. The Bora blew directly against the forces of Eugenius and disrupted the line.

Eugenius' camp was stormed, and Eugenius was captured and soon after executed. Thus Theodosius became the only emperor.

==Art patronage==
[[File:Theodosius colum, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Theodosius offers a [[laurel wreath]] to the victor, on the marble base of the Obelisk of [[Thutmosis III]] at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]].]]

Theodosius oversaw the removal in 390 of an Egyptian [[obelisk]] from Alexandria to Constantinople.  It is now known as the [[obelisk of Theodosius]] and still stands in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], the long [[racetrack]] that was the center of Constantinople's public life and scene of political turmoil. Re-erecting the monolith was a challenge for the technology that had been honed in the construction of [[siege engine]]s. The obelisk, still recognizably a [[Helios|solar symbol]], had been moved from [[Karnak]] to [[Alexandria]] with what is now the [[obelisks in rome|Lateran obelisk]] by [[Constantius II]]). 

The Lateran obelisk was shipped to Rome soon afterwards, but the other one then spent a generation lying at the docks due to the difficulty involved in attempting to ship it to Constantinople. Eventually, the obelisk was cracked in transit. The white [[marble]] base is entirely covered with [[bas-relief]]s documenting the Imperial household and the engineering feat of removing it to Constantinople. Theodosius and the Imperial family are separated from the nobles among the spectators in the [[Imperial box]], with a cover over them as a mark of their status. The naturalism of traditional Roman art in such scenes gave way in these reliefs to [[conceptual art]]: the ''idea'' of order, decorum and respective ranking, expressed in serried ranks of faces. This is seen as evidence of formal themes beginning to oust the  transitory details of mundane life, celebrated in Pagan [[portrait]]ure. Christianity had only just been adopted as the new state religion.

The ''Forum Tauri'' in Constantinople was renamed and redecorated as the [[Forum of Theodosius]], including a [[column of Theodosius|column]] and a [[triumphal arch]] in his honour.

==Nicene Christianity becomes the state religion==
<!-- This section is linked from [[First Council of Constantinople]] -->
Theodosius promoted [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity within the Empire. On  27 February 380, he declared  "[[Catholic Church (disambiguation)|Catholic Church]]" the only legitimate Imperial religion, ending official state support for the traditional religion.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2, Medieval Sourcebook:  Banning of Other Religions]</ref>

===Nicene Creed===
In 325, [[Constantine I]] facilitated the Church's bishops to convene the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], which affirmed the prevailing view that Jesus, the Son, was equal to the Father, one with the Father, and of the same substance (''[[Homoousian|homoousios]]'' in Greek). The council condemned the teachings of the heterodox theologian [[Arius]]: that the Son was a created being and inferior to God the Father, and that the Father and Son were of a ''similar'' substance (''[[homoiousios]]'' in Greek<U+2014>a difference of one [[iota]]) but not ''identical'' (see [[Nontrinitarian]]). Despite the council's ruling, controversy continued. By the time of Theodosius' accession, there were still several different Church factions that promoted alternative [[Christology]].

===Arians===
While no mainstream churchmen within the Empire explicitly adhered to [[Arius]] (a presbyter from Alexandria, Egypt) or his teachings,{{Dubious|reason=Council of Sirmium among other historical records indicates Arius had a lot of support|date=July 2010}} there were those who still used the ''homoiousios'' formula, as well as those who attempted to bypass the debate by merely saying that Jesus was like (''homoios'' in Greek) God the Father, without speaking of substance (''ousia''). All these non-Nicenes were frequently labeled as [[Arians]] (i.e., followers of Arius) by their opponents, though they would not have identified themselves as such.<ref>Lenski, Noel, ''Failure of Empire'', University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0-520-23332-8, pp235<U+2013>237.</ref>

[[File:TheodosiusI2Solidus1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Solidus of emperor Theodosius. The reverse depicts Theodosius and Valentinian II seated, both holding a globe.]]

The Emperor Valens had favored the group who used the ''homoios'' formula; this [[theology]] was prominent in much of the East and had under the sons of Constantine the Great gained a foothold in the West. Theodosius, on the other hand, cleaved closely to the [[Nicene Creed]] which was the interpretation that predominated in the West and was held by the important [[Church of Alexandria|Alexandrian church]].

===Establishment of Nicene Orthodoxy===
On  27 February 380 he, together with [[Gratian]] and [[Valentinian II]] published the so called "[[Edict of Thessalonica]]" (decree "''Cunctos populos''", [[Codex Theodosianus]] [[:la:s:Codex_Theodosianus_-_Liber_XVI#I.2|xvi.1.2]]) in order that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith). The move was mainly a thrust at the various beliefs that had arisen out of Arianism, but smaller dissident sects, such as the [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonians]], were also prohibited.

On  26 November 380, two days after he had arrived in Constantinople, Theodosius expelled the non-Nicene bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and appointed [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] patriarch of Antioch, and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], one of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] from [[Antioch]] (today in Turkey), patriarch of Constantinople. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop [[Acholius of Thessalonica]], during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world.

In May 381, Theodosius summoned a new ecumenical council at Constantinople (see [[First Council of Constantinople]]) to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicean orthodoxy.<ref>Williams and Friell, p54.</ref> "The council went on to define orthodoxy, including the mysterious Third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who, though equal to the Father, 'proceeded' from Him, whereas the Son was 'begotten' of Him."<ref name="p55">William and Friell, p55.</ref> The council also "condemned the Apollonarian and Macedonian heresies, clarified jurisdictions of the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] according to the civil boundaries of dioceses and ruled that Constantinople was second in precedence to Rome."<ref name="p55" />

The [[Battle of Adrianople#Course of battle|death of Valens]], the Arians' protector, probably damaged the standing of the Homoian faction.

==Conflicts with Pagans==
===Death of Western Roman Emperor Valentinian II===
On  16 May 392, [[Valentinian II]] was found hanged in his residence in the town of [[Vienne]] in [[Gaul]]. The Frankish soldier and Pagan [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], Valentinian's protector and [[magister militum]], maintained that it was suicide. Arbogast and Valentinian had frequently disputed rulership over the Western Roman Empire, and Valentinian was also noted to have complained of Arbogast's control over him to Theodosius. Thus when word of his death reached Constantinople, Theodosius believed, or at least suspected, that Arbogast was lying and had engineered Valentinian's demise. These suspicions were further fueled by Arbogast's elevation of [[Eugenius]], from pagan official, to the position of Western Emperor. Plus, [[Ambrose]], the Bishop of Milan, spoke some veiled accusations against Arbogast, in his funeral [[oration]] for Valentinian II.

Valentinian II's death sparked a civil war between Eugenius and Theodosius, over the rulership of the west, resulting in the [[Battle of the Frigidus]]. The resultant eastern victory there led to the final brief unification of the Roman Empire under Theodosius, and the ultimate irreparable division of the empire after his death.

===Proscription of Paganism===
{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I}}
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|left|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]
The Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I began in 381, after the first couple of years his reign in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 380s, Theodosius I reiterated Constantine's ban on [[Pagan]] sacrifice, prohibited [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]], pioneered the criminalization of Magistrates who did not enforce anti-Pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed Pagan temples.

Between 389-391 he promulgated the "Theodosian decrees," which establed a practical ban on paganism;<ref name="TheodosianCode16.10.11">Theodosian Code 16.10.11</ref> visits to the temples were forbidden,<ref name="Routery1997ch4">Routery, Michael (1997) [http://www.vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html ''The First Missionary War.

Theodosius refused to restore the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate House, as asked by pagan [[Roman Senate|Senators]].

In 392 he became Emperor of the whole Empire (the last one to do so). From this moment till the end of his reign in 395, while Pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration,<ref name="Zosimus4.59">Zosimus 4.59</ref><ref name="SymmachusRelatio3">Symmachus Relatio 3.</ref> he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the Empire, <ref name="Grindle1892pp29-30">Grindle, Gilbert (1892) ''The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire'', pp.29-30.

==Death==
Theodosius died, after suffering from a disease involving severe [[edema]], in [[Milan]] on  17 January 395. Ambrose organized and managed Theodosius's lying in state in Milan. Ambrose delivered a [[panegyric]] titled ''De Obitu Theodosii''<ref>Williams and Friell, p.139.</ref> before [[Stilicho]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in which Ambrose detailed the suppression of heresy and paganism by Theodosius. Theodosius was finally buried in Constantinople on 8 November 395.<ref>Williams and Friell, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>
