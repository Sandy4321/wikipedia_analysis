'''Tehran''' ({{IPA2|t<U+02B0>eh<U+02C8><U+027E><U+0252>n}}; [[Persian language|Persian]]: <U+062A><U+0647><U+0631><U+0627><U+0646> ''Tehr<U+0101>n'') is the capital and largest city of [[Iran]] and the administrative center of [[Tehran Province]].

More than half of Iran's industry is based in Tehran.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Industries include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, military weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading center for the sale of carpets and furniture. There is an oil refinery south of the city.

Tehran is a sprawling [[city]] at the foot of the [[Alborz]] mountain range with an immense network of highways unparalleled in [[western Asia]]. It is also the hub of the country's railway network. The city has numerous large museums, art centers, palace complexes and cultural centers.

In the 20th century, Tehran faced a large  migration of people from all around Iran. Today, the city contains a mix of various ethnic and religious minorities, and is filled with many historic [[mosque]]s, [[church]]es, [[synagogue]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]]s.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Tehran1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tehran]]
There are various theories pertaining to the origin of the name ''Tehran''. 

The official City of Tehran website says that "Tehran" comes from the Persian words "Tah" meaning "end or bottom" and "Ran" meaning "[mountain] slope"<U+2014>literally, bottom of the mountain slope.  Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (<U+062F><U+0627><U+0645><U+0646><U+0647> <U+06CC> <U+0628><U+06CC><U+0646> <U+062F><U+0648> <U+06A9><U+0648><U+0647>).

A second theory holds that the word "Tehran" is derived from ''Tiran/Tirgan'', "The Abode of Tir" (Tir being the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] deity equivalent to the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] deity [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]). The ancient [[Parthia]]n town of Tiran was a neighbor to the town of [[Mehran]] ("The Abode of Mehr/Mithra", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of [[Ray, Iran|Ray/Rhages]]. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside [[Greater Tehran]] as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran. 

The third theory is that Tehran means "a warm place", as opposed to "a cool place" (e.g. [[Shemiran]])<U+2014>a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means "warm mountain slope" (<U+062F><U+0627><U+0645><U+0646><U+0647> <U+06AF><U+0631><U+0645>).

==History==
[[Image:Toopkhooneh ghadeem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Toopkhaneh Square, Tehran, the early to mid-1900s.]]
[[Image:Azadi1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Azadi Square]] is currently the symbol of Tehran.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}]]
[[Image:Khalvat Karimkhani Golestan2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Khalvat [[Karim Khan Zand|Karimkhani]].]]
[[Excavations]]  place the existence of settlements in Tehran as far back as 6000 BC. Tehran was well known as a village in the 9th century, but was less well-known than the city of [[Ray, Iran|Rhages]] which was flourishing nearby in the pre-[[Mongols|Mongol]] era. In the 13th century, following the destruction of Ray by [[Mongols]], many of its inhabitants fled to Tehran. In some sources of the Mongol era, the city is mentioned as "Rhages's Tehran" . The city is later mentioned in [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]]'s ''Nuz'hat al-Qulub'' (written in 1340) as a famous village.

Don [[Ruy Gonz<U+00E1>les de Clavijo]], a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ambassador, was probably the first European to visit Tehran, stopping in July 1404, while on a journey to [[Samarkand]] (now in [[Uzbekistan]]) and the Mongol capital at the time. At this time, the city of Tehran was unwalled.

Tehran became a residence of the [[Safavids|Safavid]] rulers in the 17th century. [[Tahmasp I]] built a [[bazaar]] and a wall around the city, but it somewhat fell out of favor after [[Abbas I of Safavid|Abbas I]] turned sick when he was passing the city to go to a war with the [[Uzbeks]].

In the early of 18th century, [[Karim Khan Zand]] ordered a [[palace]], a [[harem (household)|harem]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, and a government office to be built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital, but later moved his government to [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]. Tehran finally became the capital of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] in 1795, when the [[Qajar]] king [[Agha Mohammad Khan]] was crowned in the city. It remains the capital to this day.

During [[World War II]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops entered the city. Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943, attended by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]].

Following the war, the city's older landmarks suffered under the rule of [[Mohammad Reza Shah]]. The Shah believed that ancient buildings such as large parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], Takieh-ye Dowlat, the Toopkhooneh Square (pictured to the right), the magnificent city fortifications and the old citadel among others should not be part of a modern city. They were systematically destroyed and modern 1950s and 1960s buildings were built in their place. Tehran bazar was divided in half and many historic buildings were destroyed in order to build wide straight avenues in the capital. Many excellent examples of Persian Gardens also became targets to new construction projects. The decision to carry these out is presently largely seen as a foolish mistake that hurt the visual fabric and the cultural identity of the city beyond repair. Apartment blocks are introduced in this period.

On [[September 8]] [[1978]], demonstrations against the Shah led to riots. The army reportedly opened fire on the demonstrating mob. Martial law was installed in the wake of the ensuing revolution, from 1978<U+2013>79.

During the 1980<U+2013>88 [[Iran-Iraq War]], Tehran was the scene of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and air strikes against random residential and industrial targets within the city, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties. Material damage was repaired soon after each strike. <br />
Tehran attracts war refugees in millions.

After the war, cheap Soviet-style apartments multiplied throughout the city without any plan. At present, little is left of Tehran's old quarters. 
Instead, modern high-rise buildings dominate the city's skyline and new modern apartments have and are replacing the few remaining old houses at a rapid pace. [[Architecture of Tehran|Tehran-style home architecture]] has almost vanished completely. This is often referred to as "Tehran Disaster".{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Demographics==  
[[Image:Teh Ir.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Tehran]]
The city of Tehran had a population of about 7 million people at the time of the last official census in 1996 <ref>http://www.sci.org.ir/content/userfiles/_sci_en/sci_en/sel/f2/CS_02_10.html</ref>. 

With its cosmopolitan air, Tehran houses diverse ethnic and linguistics groups from all over the country and represents the ethnic/linguistic composition of Iran (with a different percentage though). More than 60 percent of Tehranis were born outside Tehran.
 
Tehran is the largest Persian and Azeri speaking city in the world and Tehrani-spoken [[Persian language|Persian]] is the standard spoken form of [[Persian language]] used throughout the country.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Although indigenous people of tehran before 19th century were [[Mazandaranis]] (Still residing in the southern slops of [[Elburz]]), Today The majority of Tehran residents are [[Persian people|Persians]] who speak many different dialects of Persian corresponding to their hometown, including [[Esfahan]]i, [[Shiraz]]i, [[Yazd]]i, [[Khuzestani Persian|Khuzestani]], [[Yazdi|Dari]],[[Judeo-Persian]], etc. The second largest linguistic group is that of the [[Azeri|Azeri-speakers]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Other minority linguistic groups include [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]], [[Gilak people|Gilaks]], [[Lurs]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]],[[Qashqa'i]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Iranian Arabs|Arab]], [[Armenians in Iran|Armenian]], [[Bakhtiari]], [[Assyrians in Iran|Assyrian]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]] etc. There are also a number of a few long established linguistic minorities such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi-speaking]] sikhs & [[Domari|Domari-speaking]] [[Romani people|Romas]]. A number of Levantine Arabic speakers of Lebanese origin also live in Tehran.

The rush of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in the recent years have affected Tehran and now there are sizeable  [[Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Uzbek]], and Iraqi [[Arab people|Arab]] communities in Tehran who make up an important source of cheap work force for the development of the city.

The predominant majority of Tehranis are the followers of [[Shia Islam]] and the minorities include believers of different sects of [[Sunni Islam]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Bahai Faith]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]], including the adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Protestant Church]], Iranian Church, [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], [[Jama'at-e Rabbani]] Church, [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and [[Presbyterian Church]].

There are also small groups of  [[Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], [[Mandeans]], [[Spiritualists]], [[Atheists]], [[Azali]]s, [[Yazidis]], [[Yarsan]], [[Ismaili]], [[Secular islam|Secular Muslims]] and the followers of [[Sufism|Mystic Islam]].

==Modern Tehran==
:''See [[Architecture of Tehran]]''

The [[Azadi Tower]] is the first landmark visitors come across when arriving from the [[Mehrabad International Airport]]. The tower has for many years been an icon for Tehran and a national symbol of Iran.

Tehran suffers from extremely serious traffic congestion and pollution problems. Respiratory ailments such as [[asthma]] are very common. Tehran has become so congested over the past decade that the government has considered moving the nation's capital to another city to alleviate these problems and help de-centralize the economy and population.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} But because Iran's economy and politics are so centralized, millions have little choice but to live and work in Tehran.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The huge [[Tehran International Fair]] organizes many expositions. Its book expositions are especially popular. Tehran is also the seat of [[Majlis of Iran|Iran's Parliament]] (the ''Majlis''). And Tehran is also home to the world's fourth tallest free standing structure, the [[Borj-e Milad|Milad Tower]], and also Iran's tallest building, Tehran International Tower.

[[Image:Panorama 1 Large.jpg|center|800px|thumb|A panorama of Tehran]]

=== The Milad Complex ===

[[Image:Milad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Milad Complex and the [[Milad Tower]]]]
The Tehran International Trade and Conventions Center, also called The Milad Complex, is one of the largest structures in [[Iranian architecture]]. It is scheduled to be finished in late 2007.
The complex contains the world's 4th highest tower which has several restaurants, a five star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center, and an IT park . The complex seeks to respond to the needs of business in the globalized world of the 21st century by offering facilities combining trade, information, communication, convention and accommodation all in one place.
The Milad Tower is predicted to replace the long-time symbol of Tehran, the Azadi Tower.

==Location and Subdivisions==
Tehran county borders [[Shemiranat]] county to the north, [[Damavand]] county to the east, [[Eslamshahr]], [[Pakdasht]], and [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] counties to the south, and [[Karaj]] and [[Shahriar]] counties to the west.

===Neighborhoods and Districts of Tehran===

[[Image:Administrative map of Tehran.svg|right|300px|thumb|Municipal Districts of Tehran]]
The city of Tehran is divided into 22 municipal districts, each with its own administrative centers. 

Within these 22 districts, Tehran contains the following major neighborhoods :

[[Abbas Abad]], [[Afsariyeh]], [[Amir Abad]], [[Bagh Feiz]], [[Baharestan]], [[Darakeh]], [[Darband (Tehran)|Darband]], [[Dardasht]], [[Dar Abad]], [[Darrous]], [[Dehkadeh Olampik]], [[Ekhtiyariyeh]], [[Elahiyeh]], [[Evin]], [[Farmanieh]],[[Gheitariye]], [[Gholhak]], [[Gisha]], [[Gomrok]], [[Hasan Abad]], [[Jamaran]], [[Jannat Abad]], [[Javadiyeh]], [[Jomhuri]], [[Jordan, Tehran|Jordan]], [[Lavizan]], [[Narmak]], [[Navvab (district)|Navvab]], [[Nazi Abad]], [[Niavaran]], [[Park-e Shahr]], [[Pasdaran (District)|Pasdaran]], [[Punak]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], [[Sa'adat Abad]], [[Sadeghiyeh]], [[Seyed Khandan]], [[Sohrevardi (district)|Sohrevardi]], [[Shahrara]], [[Shahr-e ziba]], [[Shahrak-e Gharb]], [[Shemiran]], [[Tajrish]], [[Tehranpars]], [[Vanak]], [[Velenjak]], [[Yaft Abad]], [[Yusef Abad]], [[Zafaraniyeh]], etc.

====The Older Neighborhoods of Tehran====
Tehran's old city fabric changed dramatically during the [[Pahlavi]] era. Some of the older remaining districts of Tehran are: [[Udlajan]], [[Sangelaj]], [[Tehran's Grand Bazaar|Bazaar]], [[Chaleh Meydan]], [[Doulat]]. Chaleh Meydan is the oldest neighborhood of the aforementioned...

==Economy==
{{seealso|Economy of Iran}}
About 30% of Iran<U+2019>s public-sector workforce and 45% of large industrial firms are located in Tehran and almost half of these workers work for the government.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers, shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers. Few foreign companies operate in Tehran because of the [[Islamic government]] and its poor relations with the west. But before the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] many western companies were active in this region. Today many modern industries of this city include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading center for the sale of carpets and furniture. There is an oil refinery near Ray, south of the city. Tehran has three airports, including Mehrabad International Airport, [[Imam Khomeini International Airport]], and Ghal'eh Morghi airfield. 

Tehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis, and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The [[Tehran Stock Exchange]], which is a full member of the [[Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs]] (FIBV) and a founding member of the [[Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges]], was one of the world's best performing stock exchanges in recent years.<ref>[[BBC]]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3129995.stm</ref>

==Transportation==
{{seealso|Transport in Iran}}
[[Image:iran-travel132.jpg|right|160px|thumb|Traffic in Tehran.]]
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:TehranTraffic2.jpg|right|160px|thumb|Traffic in Tehran.]] -->
[[Image:Tehran subway.jpg|right|160px|thumb|Tehran currently has 3 operational metro lines (Line 1, 2 and 5)]]
[[Image:Tehran Metro Cover.PNG|right|160px|thumb|Current [[Tehran Metro]] coverage of the metropolitan area]]
The metropolis of Tehran enjoys a huge network of highways (280 km) and of interchanges<U+2019> ramps & loops (180km). In 2007 there were 130 kilometers of highways and 120 kilometers of ramps and loops under construction.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

In 2001 a [[metro]] system that had been in planning since the 1970s opened the first two of seven envisaged lines. Work has been slow and coverage remains very limited. Development of the [[Tehran Metro|Tehran metro system]] had been interrupted by the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] and the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. Problems arising from the late completion of the metro led to buses taking on the role of the metro lines, serving mainly long distance routes. Taxis filled the void for local journeys. The taxis only drive on main avenues, and only within the local area, so it may be necessary to take several taxis to get to one's final destination. This has all led to extreme congestion and air pollution within the city.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Tehran is served by [[Mehrabad International Airport]], the old airport which doubles as a military base located in the western part of the city, and [[Imam Khomeini International Airport]], 50 kilometres (31&nbsp;mi) south, which handles flights from the [[Persian Gulf]] but which will eventually handle all international flights. The new airport is more than overdue, but is efficient, although security concerns have made the governments of Britain and Australia warn their foreign nationals in Iran.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Tehran also has a central train station with connecting services round the clock to various cities in the country. There are four bus terminals that also provide connections at low fares. These are the ''South'', ''East'', ''West'', and ''Bei-haghi Park-Drive'' Terminals.

While the center of the city houses the government ministries and headquarters, the commercial centers are more located toward [[Valiasr Street]], [[Taleghani Ave]], and [[Beheshti Ave]] further north. Although administratively separate, [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Shemiran]], and [[Karaj]] are often considered part of the larger Tehran metropolitan area.

==Pollution==
{{seealso |Environmental issues in Iran}}
[[Image:Tehran Pollution.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Smog is easily seen in Tehran.]]
Tehran suffers from severe air pollution and the city is often covered by [[smog]] making breathing difficult and causing widespread pulmonary illnesses. It is estimated that about 27 people die each day from pollution-related diseases.<ref>The [[BBC]]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/09/060909_mv-pollution-tehran.shtml</ref> According to local officials, 3,600 people died in a single month due to the hazardous air quality.<ref>The [[BBC]]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6245463.stm</ref>

The air pollution is due to several different reasons{{Fact|date=June 2007}}: 1) Economical: most Iranian industries are located on the outskirts of Tehran. The city is also overrun with old and aging cars which do not meet today's emission regulations. Furthermore, Iran's busiest airport, [[Mehrabad International Airport]], is located in the west of the city; 2) Infrastructure: Tehran has a poor public transportation network. Buses and metros do not cover every area of the city. Most people are then obliged to either use private cars or hire taxis. This has created severe traffic and congestion; 3) Geographical: Tehran is bound in the north by the massive [[Alborz]] mountain range that is stopping the flow of the humid Caspian wind. As a result, [[thermal inversion]] that traps Tehran's polluted air is frequently observed. The lack of humidity and clouds makes Tehran a very sunny city. The UV radiations then combined with the existing pollutants significantly raise the level of the [[ozone]].
 
The government, however, is engaged in a battle to reduce the air pollution.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} It has for instance encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on [[compressed natural gas]]. Furthermore, since 1979 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has setup a "Traffic Zone" (<U+0637><U+0631><U+062D> <U+062A><U+0631><U+0627><U+0641><U+06CC><U+06A9>) covering the city center during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit. The government is also trying to raise people's awareness about the hazards of the pollution. One method that is currently been employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the current level of [[particulate matter]] (PM10), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The board also displays the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI), which is a general indication of air quality based on the measurements of the above-mentioned five pollutants. The Pollution Indicator Boards classify the level of each pollutants as either safe, hazardous or dangerous.

==Education and Research==
{{Seealso|Education in Iran|List of colleges and universities in Tehran}}

Tehran is the biggest and most important educational center of Iran. Today There are nearly 50 major colleges and universities in total in [[Greater Tehran]].

Since the establishment of [[Darolfonoon]] in the mid 1800s, Tehran has amassed a large number of institutions of higher education. Some of these institutions have played crucial roles in the unfolding of Iranian political events. [[Tehran University|The University of Tehran]] is the earliest state university and the largest university of Iran. [[Samuel M. Jordan]], whom Jordan Avenue in Tehran is named after, was also one of the founding pioneers of the [[Alborz High School|American College of Tehran]]. 

Tehran also is home to Iran's largest military academy, and several religious schools and seminaries.

==Sport==
{{Seealso|Sport in Iran}}
Tehran was the first city in the Middle East to host the [[Asian Games]]. The 7th Asian Summer Games in 1974, was held with the participation of 2,363 athletes and officials from 25 countries.

Tehran is also the site of Iran's national football stadium on [[Azadi|Azadi Sport Complex]] with 100,000 [[seating capacity]]. Many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held here. In 2005, [[FIFA]] ordered Iran to limit spectators allowed into Azadi stadium because of a fatal crush and inadequate safety procedures. Other stadiums in Tehran are [[Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium]], Takhti Stadium, and Shahid Shirudi Stadium, among others.

[[Image:Dizin05.jpg|thumb|right|International Snowboard championship in [[Dizin]]. The ski resort of Dizin is situated to the north of Tehran in the [[Alborz Mountains]] range.]] Within 10 minutes driving distance from Tehran lies a ski resort. [[Tochal]] is the world's fifth highest ski resort, at over 3,730 metres (12,240&nbsp;ft) at its highest ''7th station''. The resort was completed in 1976 shortly before the overthrow of the Shah.

Here, one must first ride the eight kilometre (five mile) long gondola lift which covers a huge vertical. The 7th station has three slopes. The resort's longest slope is the south side U shaped slope which goes from the 7th station to 5th station. The other two slopes are located on the north side of the 7th station. Here, there are two parallel chair ski lifts that go up to 3,900 metres (12,795&nbsp;ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000&nbsp;m/13,125&nbsp;ft), rising higher than the gondola 7th station. This altitude is higher than any of the European resorts.

From the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the 5,671 metre (18,606&nbsp;ft) high Mt. Damavand, a dormant volcano.

At the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is Tochal hotel, located at 3,500&nbsp;metres (11,483&nbsp;ft) altitude. From there a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 metres (12,500&nbsp;ft) of Shahneshin peak, where the third slope of Tochal is.

Tochal 7th station has skiing eight months of the year. But there are also some glaciers and year-round snow fields near Tehran where skiing began in 1938, thanks to the efforts of two German railway engineers. Today, 12 ski resorts operate in Iran, but the most famous are [[Tochal]], [[Dizin]], and [[Shemshak]], all within one to three hours of Tehran.
