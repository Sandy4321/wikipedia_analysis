==Biography==
James was born in [[Toronto, Ontario]] and grew up playing [[ball hockey]] with boys in Toronto.<ref name = "obha"/> When she first tried to play ice hockey, she had great difficulty finding a team that would give her any ice time, particularly when girls were mocked for trying to play. She attended [[Seneca College]], where she won numerous titles in ice hockey and [[softball]] and had her jersey (#8) retired.<ref name = "award">{{cite web | url = http://www.owha.on.ca/pdf/0405ExecutiveReport/Page14-ANGELAJAMES.pdf | title = 2005 HOCKEY CANADA FEMALE HOCKEY BREAKTHROUGH AWARD | publisher = [[Hockey Canada]] | accessdate = 2008-05-27 | format = pdf}}</ref>  

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she played in the Central Ontario Women's Hockey League, where she dominated her opponents. Robin Brown, host of [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''Inside the Track'', described her style as aggressive, like [[Mark Messier]], with the pure goal-scoring talents of [[Mike Bossy]].<ref name = "robin brown">{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/brown/2008/05/first_star_in_modern_canadian.html | title = First star in modern Canadian women's hockey gets her due, sort of | last = Brown | first = Robin | publisher = ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' | date = 2008-05-07 | accessdate = 2008-05-28}}</ref> In 1990, she was selected to Canada's team for the inaugural women's championship in Ottawa, where she led the team to the gold medal. She played in three more world championships afterward, earning eight MVP awards.<ref name = "obha"/> In a controversial decision, she was excluded from [[Canada national women's ice hockey team|Canada's team]] in the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics#Women|1998 Winter Olympics]], the first time women's ice hockey was included at that competition.<ref name = "robin brown"/> James, from 1987 until she was cut from Hockey Canada in December 1997, recorded 22 goals and 12 assists for Hockey Canada. 

Currently, she is the Director of Athletics for Seneca College at its [[King]] campus, and has been involved in hockey as a [[referee]].<ref>http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/Women/2004/12/02/756112.html</ref> James is openly [[lesbian]].<ref>[http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/3739 The Dominion: Outside Edge]</ref>

==Recognition==
In 2005, [[Hockey Canada]] honoured James with the female breakthrough award, given for making significant contributions to the promotion and/or development of female hockey in Canada. She was acknowledged for her efforts to promote and develop the game for females, and for her great skill within the game. Along with highlighting her excellence, Hockey Canada also noted that she has played at every position, including [[goaltender]], where she recorded a shutout.<ref name = "award"/> James has coached the [[North York Aeros]], and she has officiated in the [[Ontario Women's Hockey Association]].

When asked ''"which woman had the greatest impact on women's hockey?"'', several people included James in their responses. Shelley Coolidge of the [[Canadian Hockey Association]] stated, "Four players. They would be [[Dawn McGuire]], [[Shirley Cameron]], [[France St. Louis]] and Angela James. The four pioneers would be [[Glynis Peters]], [[Fran Rider]], [[Karen Wallace]], and [[Susan Dalziel]]". Gold medalist [[Andria Hunter]] said, "This is a very hard decision. The first ones that come to mind are Angela James and Cammi Granato, for what they accomplished on the ice, and [[Manon Rheaume]] for the exposure she gave the sport." Hockey author [[Brian McFarlane]] responded, "Manon Rheaume, who broke the gender barrier in professional men's hockey, Angela James for her longevity, and [[Bobbie Rosenfeld]] for her considerable work on and off the ice in the first part of the 20th century".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hhof.com/html/wmspla02.shtml | title = Notable Women hockey Players | publisher = [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] | accessdate = 2008-05-27}}</ref>

She was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2008, along with [[Phillipe Bozon]], [[Cammi Granato]], [[Geraldine Heaney]], [[Igor Larionov]], [[Mario Lemieux]], and builder [[Art Berglund]]. In 2008, the [[Angela James Bowl]] was created in her honour. The trophy is awarded to the Canadian Women's Hockey League's top scorer. On June 22, 2010 James was included in the 2010 [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] class; she and [[Cammi Granato]] became the first women inducted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/international/article/827150--angela-james-going-to-hockey-hall-of-fame |title= Angela James going to Hockey Hall of Fame|author=Paul Hunter |date=June 23, 2010 |work= |publisher= Toronto Star |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> James was formally inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 8, 2010.
