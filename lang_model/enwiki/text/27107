'''Thomas Sullivan''' a.k.a. '''''"Tommy"''''' ([[January 1]], [[1922]] [[South Boston, Massachusetts]]-[[December 24]], [[1957]] [[South Boston, Massachusetts]] was a [[Irish-American]] professional [[heavyweight]] boxer who was murdered by the [[Winter Hill Gang]]. In [[Joseph Barboza]]'s autobiography "Barboza", Thomas is wrongly identified as "Rocky", not "Tommy".

==Biography==

Thomas Sullivan was born to a first genertaion emigrant simply identified as "Mary Sullivan". He was known in the neighborhood as a "tough puncher" who later went to work as a [[longshoreman]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and lived with his mother on East Fifth Street. During the bar brawl with Edward McLaughlin Tommy showed immense strength and lifted up one end of the car and propped one of the wheels up on the curb allowing him access to the bloodied and battered cowering Edward McLaughlin. He was born out of [[wedlock]] and grew up never knowing who his biological father was, who left he and his mother at a very young age. He resided at his childhood home with his mother and took care of her as she grew older. Mary Sullivan was a doting mother who supported her only son Tommy throughout his professional boxing career. It is suggested that after he stopped his boxing career that he suffered from bouts of [[alcoholism]]. He became well known around Boston during his successful boxing career by people, including notorious [[Patriarca crime family]] members and associates like [[Joseph Barboza]], although he never became involved in organized crime himself and mantained a clean boxing record. He worked as a longshoreman with [[Winter Hill Gang]] member Thomas J. Ballou who was a bodyguard for Buddy McLean and [[Joseph Barboza]].

==Barroom Brawl==

Two weeks before he was murdered, he made the mistake of getting into a vicious bar room brawl with [[Edward McLaughlin]]. By mob associates it was considered a good battle because both McLaughlin and Sullivan were ex-professionals, but Sullivan had a more successful bout than McLaughlin and had been a main event fighter. The trouble arose from a heated argument that soon turned violent. Edward hit Sullivan from behind with a length of iron pipe, knocking him to the floor. Edward swung again but he rolled out of the way and got to his feet, his face badly bloodied from the blindsided attack. One of Sullivan's punches during the fight tore McLaughlin's ear. The fight played out in the barrroom and then made it's way out into the street. Edward, now badly beaten, finally gave up and rolled under a car parked in the street to get away. Tommy was relentless in his attack on the gangster, he lifted up one end of the car and propped one of the wheels up on the curb allowing him access to McLaughlin.

==Boxing Career==

On [[March 17]], [[1942]] Tommy had his first professional boxing match against Johnny Lawless in [[Portland, Maine]]. During this match Lawless retired in his corner after the second round, due to a laceration over his eye. On [[June 9]], [[1942]] he fought Dave Hoblitzel in [[Portland, Maine]]. The bout was stopped by the referees, since it was felt by boxing officials in attendance that neither man was trying. On [[March 18]], [[1946]] he was fought Jimmy Fields in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Fields fought the fight against Sullivan under the ring monicker "John Henry Eskew". Before a crowd of 10,817, Eskew dropped Sullivan for a count of two in the second round. An angry Sullivan gave Eskew a brutal beating over the next two rounds leaving him draped over the ropes in the forth round and winning by a technical knockout. On [[December 14]], [[1946]] Tommy was matched up against Al Priest in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. This was the largest gate ever attracted at an indoor fight in Boston up to that time. 13,250 spectators attended the sport, the ring accumulated $59,944 in total. On [[June 2]], [[1947]] he fought against Coley Welch. He successfully knocked down Welch twice in the third round and one in the seventh round. He fought with an orthodox stance and boxed 143 rounds over the span of his short career winning twenty of them with fourteen knock outs and two losses.

==Brutal Gangland Slaying==

On [[December 24]], [[1957]] Thomas was called to the side of a car that was idling in the street near his East Fifth Street home at 6:35 PM and was shot five times, killing him. It was originally believed that one of the gunman's shots mowed down Tommy in front of an old cemetery but Medical Examiner Dr. Richard Ford revealed that three shots had nearly torn off his head and two of the shots had lodged in his shoulder. During the murder investigation, detectives became convinced that his murder was connected with the Boston Mafia War between the McLaughlin Gang and the [[Patriarca crime family]]. Two suspects, including Edward McLaughlin were brought in to questioning about the murder. One provided an air tight alibi clearing him of any suspicion in the murder while McLaughlin remained under suspicion. The case eventually went cold and no one was ever charged or convicted in the murder of Sullivan.
