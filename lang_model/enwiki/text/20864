'''WREK''' ("'''Wreck'''", from the [[Rambling Wreck]]) is the [[List of radio stations in Georgia|radio station]] staffed by the students of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].  It is located at 91.1 [[Megahertz|MHz]] and on channel 17 on the Georgia Tech cable TV network, [[GTCN]]. Starting as a 10-watt [[list of broadcast station classes|class D]], it now broadcasts a 40,000 [[Watt]]s [[effective radiated power|ERP]] signal throughout metropolitan Atlanta, making it among the ten highest-power [[college radio]] [[radio station|stations]] in the [[United States]].

In [[2007]], WREK applied to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to increase its [[effective radiated power]] to the maximum power of 100,000 [[Watt]]s (from its current 40,000 Watts) with a directional antenna pattern designed to avoid interference with specific distant stations (as required).  This coverage increase will greatly improve the radio station's coverage to encompass more of the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].  That application has since been approved, and the station plans to build out the improved coverage by replacing its antenna system before the summer of 2010.

In March 2008, WREK replaced its current 20-year-old transmitter with a brand new unit capable of three times the signal power and providing [[HD Radio]] capability.  The addition of an [[HD Radio]] broadcast has made WREK among the first student-run, student-funded stations in the nation to add digital broadcasting capability.  It has also allowed WREK to add a second continuous channel of programming ("WREK HD2") in Fall 2008. <ref name="techtimeline">{{cite web| title = New Transmitter Delivered | publisher = WREK | url=http://www.wrek.org/newtransmitter | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}</ref>

==Programming==
WREK slogans include "music you don't hear on the radio" and "quality diverse radio."

Programming is [[student]]-run and extremely [[diverse]], including everything from [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] to [[world music|world]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] to [[blues]], [[European classical music|classical]] and [[jazz]] to [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[noise music|noise]], and similarly diverse community programming (''[[Church of the Subgenius]]''). Locally produced programming includes ''Tech Talk'', a talk show hosted by and focusing on concerns of Georgia Tech students; the ''Ramblin' Wreck Report'', a Georgia Tech sports talk show hosted by students; ''Destroy All Music'', clatter-improv with pink noise freakouts; ''The Mobius''[http://themobius.livejournal.com], an experimental electronic show featuring music and in-studio performances of new and established artists that run the electronic gamut; ''The Electric Boogaloo'', a funksperience; ''Live@WREK'', a live music show; and ''Continental Drift'', Atlanta's longest running international music radio program.

WREK also broadcasts play-by-play coverage of Georgia Tech [[college athletics|intercollegiate athletics]], including [[baseball]], women's [[basketball]], and [[volleyball]]. In fall 2004, the station agreed to partner with ISP Sports to [[simulcast]] network coverage of selected Georgia Tech [[American football|football]] and men's [[basketball]] games to augment [[WQXI (AM)|WQXI's]] diminished AM nighttime coverage in metro Atlanta.  The deal also led to the simulcast of selected WREK-originated women's basketball broadcasts on [[XM Radio]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

In December 2002, WREK broadcast the entire 50-disc ''[[Merzbox]]'' by the [[Japan]]ese [[experimental music]] artist [[Merzbow]]. An article in ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' described the Merzbow Marathon as "what may be the most obscure and counterintuitive move in the history of radio."

Continuing their tradition of unorthodox radio broadcasts, WREK chose to air the long-running heavy metal show ''Wrekage'' for the entire 24 hour broadcast day on [[June 6]] [[2006]] (6/6/6).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrekage.org|title=WREKage|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Heavy metal was played in chronological order from midnight to midnight. As an extra nod to the mystic number ''[[666 (number)]]'', ''[[Iron Maiden]]'''s ''The Number of the Beast'' was aired at 6:06 a.m. and p.m.

In Fall 2007, the critics of [[Creative Loafing]] declared WREK to be the Best Overall Radio Station in the Atlanta metropolitan area.  The article describing their reasoning declared WREK to be "strange in a good way.  The station<U+2019>s format is noncommercial and nonconforming.  Few stations in the city can compete with WREK<U+2019>s eclectic playlist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafingbestof.com/gbase/BestOf/BestOfAwards?Award=oid%3A397380 |title=Best of Atlanta 2007|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref>

==Technical Details==
{{Expand-section|date=November 2008}}
WREK's transmitter is a Harris HT/HD+ which outputs a 6,600 W [[transmitter power output|TPO]] signal into a high-gain 12-bay [[Jampro]] model JSCP [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], resulting in an [[effective radiated power]] of 40,000 [[Watt]]s. The antenna is located on a 300-foot (90-meter) self-supporting Jampro [[tower]] adjacent to the Undergraduate Living Center and Woodruff Hall on Georgia Tech's west campus, connected to the studio in the Student Center via a wireless, 950.0&nbsp;MHz [[studio-transmitter link]], WQAQ311, and a digital, fiber-optic link.

==History==
{{Expand-section|date=February 2007}}
Georgia Tech was the home of early [[radio station]] [[WGST (AM)|WGST]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] (Georgia School of Technology) from 1924 to 1930.<ref name="techtimeline">{{cite web| title = Tech Timeline | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/ | accessdate = 2007-03-27}}</ref>

WREK first signed on the air on March 25, [[1968]], broadcasting at 10 Watts from a donated tower atop the [[Blake Ragsdale Van Leer|Van Leer]] Electrical Engineering building on [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s campus. The [[studio]] was located in the top floor of that building and consisted of donated equipment from [[WSM-FM]] [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrek.org/?q=history6|title=General Manager Richard Crouch's narrative on the birth of WREK|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Chief Engineer and then-student Geoff Mendenhall designed and built a 425[[Watt|W]] power amplifier which, once type certified by the [[FCC]] in August 1968, brought WREK to 3,400W [[Effective radiated power|ERP]]. Mendenhall has since moved on to build [[transmitter]]s at [[Harris Corporation]].<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrek.org/?q=history|title=WREK History|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

In [[1978]] WREK's tower and studio were relocated. A new, 300&nbsp;foot tower was built on the western edge of the Georgia Tech campus, and the studio moved to the annex of the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]], where it would remain until [[2004]]. That facility was home to 920 AM [[WGST (AM)|WGST]] (from [[Georgia School of Technology]], GT's earlier name) from [[1956]] until [[1975]], when that station's license was sold against the school's will as "surplus property" by the [[Georgia Board of Regents]]. Visitors to WREK's Coliseum studios were often startled by its walls, which were covered by thick layers of [[poster]]s, set lists, and other [[music]] [[memorabilia]], as well as the giant [[electromechanical]] [[broadcast automation]] machines and other large racks of monitoring and control equipment. WREK's studios relocated to the Student Center Commons (formerly the Georgia Tech Bookstore building) in August 2004.<ref name="history"/>

WREK began [[Streaming media|streaming]] its compressed (8-bit [[uLaw]]) broadcast over the [[Internet]] on [[November 7]] of [[1994]], making it one of the first [[Internet radio]] stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrek.org/?q=wreknet-first|title=wrek-net: we got here first|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> The station now streams in [[MP3]] format and features a two-week-long running [[archive]] of its broadcast on the schedule page of its website.
