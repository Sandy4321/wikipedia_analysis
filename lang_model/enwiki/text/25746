==Early Life==
The youngest of three, Houston was born on international waters on a military ship at sea in route to a U.S. base in [[Japan]]. Her father, Lemo Houston, was [[African Native Americans|African Native American]]/[[Blackfoot]]-[[Pikuni]] [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] originally from [[Linden, Alabama]].

Her parents met in [[Kobe]] in 1946, beginning their nine year courtship at the disapproval of Velina's maternal grandfather who committed suicide as a result of his daughter's decision. After the couple married, they eventually severed ties with both their families. The couple went on to adopt their only son Joji Kawada George Adam Houston, an Amerasian, in [[Tokyo]] after he was left orphaned at eight years old during the U.S. occupation. 

In 1949 Velina's father returned to the United States; soon after he served in the [[Korean War]] in 1951. At the age of two, Velina, her parents, sister Hilda Rika Hatsuyo, and brother Joji Kawada temporarily moved to [[New York]] where they lived with her father's relatives. Their new American experience was met with being entirely rejected and harshly discriminated against by Americans and Japanese from both within and outside of their family.  Lemo was then transferred to [[Fort Riley]], and the family eventually settled in [[Junction City, Kansas]], a small town adjacent to the [[military base]], living a [[Culture of Japan|culturally Japanese]] lifestyle at the insistence of her Velina's mother, Setsuko. In 1969, as a result of combat-related stress and alcoholism, Velina's father's died.  Setsuko continued raising her family in [[Junction City]], a community consisting of hundreds of mostly [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[European people|European]] immigrant women who married [[American people|Americans]] after [[World War II]]. The family continued to have little influence of American culture from any extended family.
