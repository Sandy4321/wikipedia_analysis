The '''Leavenworth Constitution''' was one of four [[Kansas]] state constitutions proposed during the era of [[Bleeding Kansas]].  The Leavenworth Constitution was drafted by a convention of [[Free-Staters]], and was the most progressive of the four proposed constitutions.  The conspicuous aspects of this Constitution were a Bill of Rights that referred to "''all men''" (making no distinction between the rights of white men and African-American men), the banning of slavery from the state, and a basic framework for the rights of women.

The constitutional convention that framed the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February, [[1858]], during the pendency of the [[Lecompton Constitution]] in Congress.  The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858, and by the people at an election held May 18, 1858.

The Leavenworth Constitution did not have a great impact on the [[history of Kansas]] as the United States Senate did not approve of the codified laws in the written document.  The other proposed state constitutions were the [[Topeka Constitution]] (1855), the [[Lecompton Constitution]] (1857) and the [[Wyandotte Constitution]] (1859).
