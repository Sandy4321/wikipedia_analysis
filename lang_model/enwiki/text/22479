==Background==
During a break from Crowded House following the Canadian leg of the tour in support of their second album, ''[[Temple of Low Men]]'', band-leader [[Neil Finn]] began recording songs with his older brother and former [[Split Enz]] band mate [[Tim Finn]]. These songs were originally intended for a [[Finn Brothers]] album. Once these sessions were complete, Neil teamed back up with [[Nick Seymour]] and [[Paul Hester]] to write and record Crowded House's third album. [[Capitol Records]] rejected most of the new Crowded House songs, so Neil asked Tim if the band could use some of the new Finn Brothers songs. Tim agreed, on condition that he would join the band, although he has since indicated he meant this as a joke. Whatever the truth of that claim, the group that returned to the studio included Tim as a full band member.<ref name=Bourke>''Bourke'', 1997</ref>

The album was titled ''Woodface'' and was released in July 1991. It was co-produced by [[Mitchell Froom]] and Neil Finn, and mixed by [[Bob Clearmountain]]. Eight tracks were co-written by Neil and Tim Finn and mainly feature the brothers harmonising on lead vocals, although Neil takes the lead on "Four Seasons In One Day" and Tim sings "All I Ask", which later featured in [[AIDS]] awareness commercials in Australia.<ref name=Bourke/> Five other tracks were solo compositions by Neil Finn and the remaining two were written by Paul Hester, including "I'm Still Here", a hidden track. Former [[Beach Boys]] drummer [[Ricky Fataar]] is credited on three of the Finn Brothers songs, "All I Ask", "There Goes God" and "Weather With You".

During the UK leg of the ''Woodface'' tour, Tim left the band.<ref name=Mcfarlane>''McFarlane'', 1999</ref> Multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Hart]], who had played some keyboards on ''Woodface'', was recruited to replace Tim for the remaining dates. The final date of this tour at [[The Town & Country Club]] in London was recorded and given a limited release in Australia, while individual tracks were used as B-sides for the album's singles in other countries.<ref>[http://www.amws.com.au/c/crowded-house/discography/discography.html "Crowded House Discography"] ''amws.com.au'' - 12 January 1994</ref>

===Singles===
"The first single, "[[Chocolate Cake (song)|Chocolate Cake]]", was a humorous comment on American excess, which perhaps unsurprisingly failed to make the US ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' Singles Chart. It did, however, peak at #2 on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name=WusBB>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=crowded house|chart=Alternative Songs}} "Crowded House > Chart History > Alternative Songs"] ''Billboard''</ref> Although the second single, "Fall at Your Feet", entered the lower reaches of the ''Hot 100''<ref name=WusS/> and "[[It's Only Natural (song)|It's Only Natural]]" peaked at #5 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart,<ref name=WusBB/> the poor performance of the singles from ''Woodface'' in the US reflected the band's declining poularity there. Outside the US, the singles from ''Woodface'' were more successful, especially in Canada, the UK,<ref name=Wuk/> Australia,<ref name=Waus/> New Zealand<ref name=Wnz/> and the Netherlands,<ref name=Wned/> where all five singles from the album charted.
