{{Nihongo|'''Yamazaki Susumu'''|<U+5C71><U+5D0E> <U+70DD>||1833? - February 6, 1868}} was a [[Shinsengumi]] officer and [[spy]], otherwise known as a {{nihongo|''kansatsu''|<U+76E3><U+5BDF>|inspector}}.

He was a [[ronin]] from [[Osaka]] and an expert in ''Katori Ryu''.  In 1863, he officially joined the Shinsengumi and in 1864, Yamazaki and [[Shimada Kai]] were assigned by [[Kondo Isami]] to investigate the situation which led to the [[Ikedaya Jiken]] on [[July 8]]. However, there is a theory that Yamazaki's participation in the Ikedaya Jiken is merely fiction by [[Shimozawa Kan]] and [[Shiba Ryotaro]].  

His occupation whilst in [[Kyoto]] was as a doctor and the Shinsengumi had originally used his pharamacy as their base before moving on to its later headquarters at [[Nishihonganji]] (See [[Yamanami Keisuke]]).

Yamazaki was said to be excellent in [[literary]] and [[military art]]s, having been taught by his uncle. His scholastic talent was necessary when discussing politics with a court noble. 

In 1865, he accompanied Kondo to [[Hiroshima]]. It is believed that Yamazaki did not return to [[Kyoto]] with Kondo until the next year in order to further investigate [[Ch<U+014D>sh<U+016B> Domain|Ch<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'s status.

Yamazaki studied medicine under [[Matsumoto Jun (physician) | Matsumoto  Ry<U+014D>jun]]. According to Matsumoto, Yamazaki was a gentle and taciturn man.

In 1867, Yamazaki became a [[hatamoto]] along with the rest of the Shinsengumi.

During the [[Battle of Toba-Fushimi]] in 1868, Yamazaki was severely injured and died on February 6. The exact location of his death is debatable, though it is believed he had drowned whilst escaping. He had Kondo and [[Hijikata Toshizo]]'s full confidence and was one of the most faithful members of the Shinsengumi till the very end of his life.

==Yamazaki in fiction==
Yamazaki is featured in ''[[Gintama]]'' ([[anime]]/[[manga]]),  ''[[Peacemaker Kurogane]]'' (anime/manga), ''[[Soshite, Haru no Tsuki]]'', ''[[Kaze Hikaru]]'' (manga),  ''[[Getsumei Seiki]]'' (manga), ''[[Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi]]'' (video game series) and ''[[Hakuouki: Shinsengumi Kitan]]'' (anime/[[otome game]]). He is also depicted in the 1999 film ''[[Taboo (1999 film)|Gohatto]]''. 

Even though the real Yamazaki was not a [[ninja]], his anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be a well-trained ninja including Han'nya (a character loosely based on Yamazaki) from the anime/manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]''. Additionally, the character Yamazaki Sagaru in the anime and manga ''Gintama'' is roughly based on Yamazaki.
