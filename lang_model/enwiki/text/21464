His philosophy is often divided between his early period, exemplified by the ''Tractatus'', and later period, articulated in the ''Philosophical Investigations''. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world, and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the conclusions of the ''Tractatus'', arguing that the meaning of words is constituted by the function they perform within any given [[language-game]].

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are widely diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: ''"He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he were writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."''<ref name="autogenerated6">Malcolm, p. 6.</ref>

==Background==
===The Wittgensteins===
{{See|Karl Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Karl Wittgenstein]] was one of the richest men in Europe.<ref name=Bramann/>]]
According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-grandfather was Moses Meier, a Jewish land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [[Bad Laasphe]] in the [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Principality of Wittgenstein]], Westphalia.<ref>See [[:de:Schloss Wittgenstein|Schloss Wittgenstein]]. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer.</ref> In July 1808, [[Napoleon]] issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [[Jewish surname|family surname]], and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.<ref>Bartley, pp. 199<U+2013>200.</ref> His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein<U+2014>who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background<U+2014>married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to Protestantism just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.<ref>Monk, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Ludwig's grandmother, Fanny Figdor, was a first cousin of the famous violinist [[Joseph Joachim]].<ref>Monk, p .5.</ref>  They had 11 children<U+2014> among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Wittgenstein (1847<U+2013>1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.<ref name=Bramann>Bramann, Jorn K. and Moran, John. [http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/KarlWittgenstein.htm "Karl Wittgenstein, Business Tycoon and Art Patron"], Frostburg State University, accessed 2 September 2010.</ref><ref name="autogenerated63">Edmonds, Eidinow, "Wittgenstein's Poker", page 63</ref> Thanks to Karl, the Wittgensteins became the second wealthiest family in the [[Habsburg Empire]], behind only the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name="autogenerated63"/> As a result of his decision in 1898 to invest substantially overseas, particularly in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the US, the family was to an extent shielded from the hyperinflation that hit Austria in 1922.<ref>Monk, p. 7.</ref> Their wealth did still diminish due to post-1918 hyperinflation and the [[Great Depression]], although even as late as 1938 they owned 13 mansions in Vienna alone.<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow, "Wittgenstein's Poker", page 102</ref>

Wittgenstein's mother was Leopoldine Kalmus. Her father was [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Jewish]] and her mother was [[Austria|Austrian]]-[[Slovene]] [[Catholic]]<U+2014>she was Ludwig's maternal grandparent and only non-Jewish grandparent, whose ancestry was [[Austrian]]<ref>http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/04/06/090406crbo_books_gottlieb</ref><ref>B. McGuinness, Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889-1921</ref><ref>http://mt.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/schenker/profile/person/wittgenstein_leopold.html</ref> and an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]] on her maternal side. Ludwig was born at 8:30pm on 26 April 1889 in the so-called "Wittgenstein Palace" at Alleegasse 16, now the Argentinierstrasse, near the [[St. Charles's Church, Vienna|Karlskirche]].<ref>For his mother's Roman Catholic background, see [http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre1.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Background"], Wittgenstein archive, University of Cambridge, accessed 2 September 2010.
*For his time and place of birth, see Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 57.</ref>  Karl and Poldi, as she was known, had nine children in all. There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]]<U+2014>who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in [[World War I]]<U+2014>and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.<ref name=Bartley16>Bartley, William Warren. ''Wittgenstein''. Open Court, 1994, p. 16, first published 1973.</ref>

The children were baptized as Catholics, and raised in an exceptionally intense environment. The family was at the center of Vienna's cultural life; [[Bruno Walter]] described the life at the Wittgensteins' palace as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture".<ref name=Monk8>Monk, p. 8.</ref> Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Auguste Rodin]] and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]]. [[Gustav Klimt]] painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms.<ref name=Monk8/><ref>McGuinness, p. 18.</ref>

For Ludwig, who highly valued precision and discipline, [[contemporary music]] was never considered acceptable at all. "Music", he said to his friend Drury in 1930, "came to a full stop with Brahms; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery."<ref>Theodore Redpath, Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Student<U+2019>s Memoir, London: Duckworth, 1990, p. 112</ref> Ludwig himself had [[absolute pitch]] perception,<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow, "Wittgenstein's Poker"</ref> and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.<ref name=Monk443/> He also learnt to play the [[clarinet]] in his thirties.<ref name=Monk15/>

===Family temperament; brothers' suicides===
[[File:The Wittgensteins 1890.jpg|thumb|left|upright|From left, Helene, Rudi, Hermine, Ludwig (the baby), [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Gretl]], [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]], Hans, and Kurt, around 1890]]
[[Ray Monk]] writes that Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's industrial empire.<ref name=Monk11>Monk, p. 11ff.</ref> Three of the five brothers would later commit suicide.<ref name=Kenny>Kenny, Anthony.

[[Anthony Gottlieb]] tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the seven grand pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your skepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"<ref name=Gottlieb>Gottlieb, Anthony.

[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein siblings.jpg|thumb|Ludwig (bottom-right), Paul, and their sisters, late 1890s]]
The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, Waugh writes, Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [[Key signature|keys]]. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], most likely having committed suicide.<ref>Waugh, pp. 24<U+2013>26.
*Also see Monk, p. 11ff.</ref>

Two years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [[Berlin Academy]], the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play Thomas Koschat's "Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich ("Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I"),<ref>For the Koschat song, see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLMBkWWavJo "Verlassen bin ich"] YouTube, accessed 11 September 2010.</ref> before mixing himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]]. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which from 1871 until 1969 prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.<ref>Waugh, pp. 22<U+2013>23.

The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted ''en masse''.<ref name=Monk11/> According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "the germ of disgust for life within himself".<ref>Waugh, p. 128.</ref> Paul also considered suicide, as did Ludwig.<ref name=Gottlieb/> Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky.

==1903<U+2013>1906: Realschule in Linz==
===Realschule in Linz===
[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz]]
Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school.  After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Alexander Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tuition to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[K.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils.<ref name=Waugh33>Waugh, p. 33.
*McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.
*K.u.k. stood for "[[Kaiserlich und k<U+00F6>niglich]]''.</ref> In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of a Dr. Srigl, a master at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.<ref name=McGuinness51>McGuinness, p. 51.</ref>

On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.<ref>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.</ref>  Historian [[Brigitte Hamann]] writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [[High German]] with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.<ref name=Hamann15>Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000 (first published 1996 in German) pp. 15<U+2013>16, 79.</ref>  Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "''Wittgenstein wandelt wehm<U+00FC>tig widriger Winde wegen Wienw<U+00E4>rts''"<ref name=Monk15>Monk, pp.14<U+2013>15.</ref><!-- Monk can only be used as a source for the original German because this is incorrectly translated by Monk as "Wittgenstein wends his woeful windy way Vienna-wards"--> ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark - 5 - in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.<ref name=McGuinness51/> He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."<ref name=McGuinness51/>

===Jewish background and Hitler===
{{See|History of the Jews in Austria}}
There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews, and the issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because [[Adolf Hitler]] was at the same school for part of the same time.<ref name=McGuinnessStern>For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as completely German, not Jewish, see McGuinness, Brian. "Wittgenstein and the Idea of Jewishness", and for an opposing view, see Stern, David. [http://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&hl=en&ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], both in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 231ff and p 237ff respectively.</ref> [[Laurence Goldstein]] argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler, vicious and aggressive, would have hated and envied Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ...".<ref>Goldstein, Lawrence. [http://books.google.com/books?id=EvHPNoKvmf0C&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=envy,+hatred+and+mistrust+that+stammering,+precocious,+precious,+aristocratic+upstart+who&source=bl&ots=NpkvtgtJzp&sig=XyiqF4HpNfq7eWruuYiZItO5jEg&hl=en&ei=fm-GTK-HIIKfnAeb4uzqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=envy%2C%20hatred%20and%20mistrust%20that%20stammering%2C%20precocious%2C%20precious%2C%20aristocratic%20upstart%20who&f=false ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and his Relevance to Modern Thought'']. Duckworth, 1999, p. 167ff. Also see [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2659846 "Clear and Queering Thinking"], review in ''Mind'', Oxford University Press, 2001.</ref> Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.<ref>McGinn, Marie. "Hi Ludwig", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000.</ref>

Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had been held back a year, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the ''Realschule''.<ref>Hitler started at the school on 17 September 1900, repeated the first year in 1901, and left in the autumn of 1905; see Kersaw, Ian. ''Hitler, 1889-1936''. W. W. Norton & Company, 2000, p. 16ff.

In his own writings<ref>See e.g. (MS 154)</ref> Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."<ref>''Culture and Value'', Ludwig Wittgenstein, (Oxford 1998), page 16e (see also, pages 15e-19e)</ref> While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic",<ref>M.O<U+2019>C. Drury, <U+201C>Conversations with Wittgenstein<U+201D>, in ''Recollections of Wittgenstein'', ed. R. Rhees, New York: Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1984,p. 161.</ref> as [[Hans Sluga]] has argued, if so, "his was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in [[Otto Weininger|Weininger's]] case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."<ref>Hans D. Sluga, ''The Cambridge companion to Wittgenstein'', (Cambridge, 1996) page 2</ref>

===Loss of faith===
It was while he was at the ''Realschule'' that he decided he had lost his faith in God.<ref name=Monk18>Monk, p. 18.</ref> He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of confession. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk writes that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.<ref name=Monk18/> As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism.<ref name="autogenerated6"/> In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end".<ref>Culture & Value, p.24, 1933-4</ref>

===Influence of Otto Weininger===
[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880<U+2013>1903)]]
While a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' ([[Sex and Character]]).
Weininger (1880<U+2013>1903), who was both Jewish and homosexual, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that the essence of woman is sexual. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and the love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one<U+2014>to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.<ref name=Monk19>Monk, pp. 19<U+2013>26.</ref> Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the ''way'' in which they were wrong that was interesting.<ref>p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008</ref>

==1906<U+2013>1913: University==
===Engineering at Berlin and Manchester===
[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|left|thumb|The old [[Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of a professor there, Dr Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a diploma on 5 May 1908, after developing an interest in aeronautics.<ref>Monk, p. 27.</ref> He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to do his doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near Glossop.<ref name=Grouse>Monk, p. 29.
</ref> He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911 and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.<ref name=Monk30>Monk, pp. 30<U+2013>35.</ref>
[[File:The Grouse Inn near Glossop.jpg|right|thumb|Wittgenstein stayed at the Grouse Inn in 1908 while engaged in research near [[Glossop]].<ref name=Grouse/>]]

It was at this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).<ref>Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194-223, 258<U+2013>289.</ref> Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.<ref name=Monk30/> He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation".<ref name=Monk30/> In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing; the work did not survive, perhaps because, as he said, Frege wiped the floor with him.<ref name=Monk36>Monk, p. 36ff.</ref> He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."<ref name=Kanterian36>Kanterian, p. 36.</ref>

===Arrival at Cambridge===
[[File:WrenLibraryInterior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Wren Library, [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].]]
Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].<ref name=ConnorRobertson>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html  "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University, accessed 2 September 2010.</ref> Russell was having tea with C.K. Ogden, when, according to Russell, "... an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics & has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."<ref name=Monk36/> He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E.H. Neville]], and H.T.J. Norton.<ref name=Monk36/> Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."<ref name=McGuinness88>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: A Life : Young Ludwig 1889<U+2013>1921''. University of California Press, 1988, pp. 88<U+2013>89.</ref>

Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."<ref name=McGuinness88/> Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."<ref name=Monk41>Monk, p. 41.</ref> The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized his own work: "His criticism, 'tho I don't think he realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I  have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''. Routledge, 1998, p. 281.</ref>

===Moral Sciences Club and Apostles===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|150px|Bertrand Russell, in 1907]]
In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."<ref>Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], "Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.
*Also see Klagge, James Carl and Nordmann, Alfred (eds.) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions''. Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.</ref> He dominated the society and stopped attending entirely in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.<ref name=Edmonds22>Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 22<U+2013>28.</ref>

The club became legendary within philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was "Are there philosophical problems?", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein was apparently infuriated and started waving a hot poker at Popper, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one<U+2014>"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"<U+2014>at which point Russell had to tell Wittgenstein to put the poker down and Wittgenstein stormed out. It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.<ref>Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

[[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.<ref>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: A Life: Young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 118.</ref>

===Sexuality and relationship with David Pinsent===
Wittgenstein later confessed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.<ref>Monk, pp. 369.</ref> Wittgenstein is also widely regarded to have fallen in love with at least three men: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.<ref>Monk, pp. 583<U+2013>586.</ref> Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein became infatuated with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they did not have children.<ref>Monk, pp. 238-40 and 318</ref>

It was Russell who introduced Wittgenstein to David Pinsent (1891<U+2013>1918) in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.<ref>Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.</ref> The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912<U+2014>the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including first class travel, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent<U+2014>and later to Norway. Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality - sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.<ref>Monk, p. 58ff. *See Pinsent, David Hume and Von Wright, G.H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912-1914''. Blackwell, 1990.</ref> In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No<U+2014>Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"<ref name=Kanterian40>Kanterian, p. 40.</ref></blockquote>

He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "[h]e expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"<ref name=Kanterian40/> The last time they saw each other was at a Birmingham railway station on 8 October 1913, when they said goodbye before Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.

==1913<U+2013>1920: World War I and the ''Tractatus''==
===Work on ''Logik''===
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|The original manuscript of Wittgenstein's ''Notes on Logic'' (1914) on display at the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and on receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.<ref>Monk, p. 71.</ref> He donated some of his money, initially anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=ConnorRobertson/>

At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally-known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever".<ref>Monk, p. 262.</ref> In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.<ref name=Edmonds45/> When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then<U+2014>by God<U+2014>''you'' might go there."<ref>Monk, p. 103.</ref> Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.<ref name=McGuinness200>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: A Life : Young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 200.</ref> The two did not speak again until 1929.<ref name=Edmonds45>Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John.

===Military service===

On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], first serving on a ship and then in an artillery workshop. In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the Austrian 7th Army, where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].<ref name=Monk137>Monk, pp.137<U+2013>142.</ref> In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria<U+2013>Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism", which "won the total admiration of the troops."<ref>Waugh, p. 114.</ref>  In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front,  where he won several more medals for bravery including the Silver Medal for Valour, First Class.<ref name=Monk137/>  In 1918 he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords&nbsp;<U+2014> it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.<ref>Monk, p. 154.</ref>

Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.<ref name="Klagge2010">{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James Carl|title=Wittgenstein in exile|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YMzajTUpEp0C&pg=PA68|accessdate=9 December 2011|date=2010-12-22|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01534-9|pages=68}}</ref> He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''The Gospel in Brief'' at a bookshop in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels".<ref>Monk, pp. 44, 116, 382<U+2013>384.
*Also see Bill Schardt & David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.</ref>
In 1916 Wittgenstein read [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' so often that he knew whole passages of it by heart, particularly the speeches of the elder Zossima, who represented for him a powerful Christian ideal, a holy man <U+2033>who could see directly into the souls of other people<U+2033>.

Russell said he returned from the war a changed man, one with a deeply mystical and ascetic attitude.<ref>Monk, p. 183.</ref>

===Completion of the ''Tractatus''===
In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (The Proposition) to the publishers Johada and Siegel.<ref name=Bartley33>Bartley, pp. 33<U+2013>39, 45.</ref>

A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Johada and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.<ref>Bartley, pp. 33<U+2013>34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent", ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', 15 May 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley." Courtesy of [http://mikeinmono.blogspot.com/2009/08/that-sprawling-ink-blot.html "Wittgenstein in Birmingham"], mikeinmono, 3 August 2009, accessed 7 September 2010.</ref> Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, was captured by Allied forces on 3 November in Trentino. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.

He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizeable portfolio of investments in the US and the Netherlands. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.<ref name=Bartley33/>

==1920<U+2013>1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==
===Teacher training in Vienna, the Prater===
In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.<ref name=Monk169>Monk, p. 169ff.</ref> [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow, "Wittgenstein's Poker", page 68</ref>

He moved out of the family home and into lodgings in ''Untere Viaduktgasse'' in Vienna's third district, and it was during this period that, according to  [[William Warren Bartley]], a professor of philosophy at Stanford, Wittgenstein engaged in a series of casual homosexual encounters in an area of the city called the ''[[Prater]]'', within walking distance of his lodgings. It is a controversial claim, one that Bartley first made in 1973 in his biography ''Wittgenstein'', and denied at the time by Wittgenstein's executors and friends in England.<ref>See for example Hacking, Ian. "The Uncommercial Traveller", ''The Times Higher Educational Supplement'', 8 April 1983, and Bartley's response in the same publication 29 April 1983, p. 35.</ref> Bartley did not have written sources to back his claims, but writes that he obtained the information from conversation with Wittgenstein's friends, and it was this activity, he argues, that Wittgenstein was referring to when he wrote to the architect [[Paul Engelmann]] in May 1920: "Things have gone utterly miserably for me lately. Of course only because of my own baseness and rottenness. I have continually thought about taking my own life, and now too this thought still haunts me. 'I have sunk to the bottom'. May you never be in that position!"<ref>Bartley, pp. 40<U+2013>44.</ref>

===Teaching posts in Austria===
In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity as a Wittgenstein was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response his brother Paul wrote: "It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."<ref>Waugh, page150</ref>

In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."<ref>Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.</ref> He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations".<ref>[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n21/norman-malcolm/wittgensteins-confessions "Wittgenstein<U+2019>s Confessions"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 3 No. 21, 19 November 1981.</ref>

To the less abled, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.<ref>Monk, p. 195.</ref> They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;<ref name=Bartley107>Bartley, p. 107.</ref> this was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.<ref>Monk, pp. 196, 198.</ref>

===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===

|style="text-align: left;"|The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.

Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained

|}
While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''Tractatus'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.<ref>For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.</ref> In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s<U+2014>i.e. by language<U+2014>(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."<ref>Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.</ref> But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.<ref>Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, p. 35ff.</ref>

An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<ref name="archiveTractatus"/> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as "situation". The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness. See:

An aim of the ''Tractatus'' is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully, and therefore the limits of what can be thought. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "what can we say at all can be said clearly", he argues.  Anything beyond that<U+2014>religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical<U+2014>cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.<ref name=Grayling16>Grayling, A. C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 16ff.</ref> He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather<U+2014>not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."<ref>''Tractatus'' (Ogden translation), preface.</ref>

The book is 75 pages long<U+2014>"As to the shortness of the book, I am ''awfully sorry for it'' ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me", he told Ogden<U+2014>and presents seven numbered propositions (1<U+2013>7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):<ref>For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.</ref>

===Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg===
[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|upright|thumb|Frank Ramsey visited Wittgenstein in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]] in September 1923.]]
In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, Hassbach, but the people there were just as bad<U+2014>"These people are not human ''at all'' but loathsome worms", he wrote to a friend<U+2014>and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human".

[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.<ref name=Monk212>Monk, pp. 212, 214<U+2013>216, 220<U+2013>221.</ref> He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.<ref>Mellor, D.H. [http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/3484/5/RamseyText.html "Cambridge Philosophers I: F. P. Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243<U+2013>262.</ref> After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.<ref name=Monk212/> Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: "[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity."<ref name=Monk212/></blockquote>

===Haidbauer incident, Otterthal===
{{main|Haidbauer incident}}
He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''W<U+00F6>rterbuch f<U+00FC>r Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by H<U+00F6>lder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.<ref name=archiveTractatus>[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive], accessed 4 September 2010.</ref> A first edition sold in 2005 for <U+00A3>75,000.<ref name=Ezard>Ezard, John. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 "Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2005.</ref>

An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.<ref name=Monk225>Monk, pp. 224, 232<U+2013>233.</ref> Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"<ref name=Monk225/>

Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay, but Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.<ref name=Monk225/> Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig H<U+00E4>nsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia.<ref>Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.</ref>

Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year,  Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja", though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it - to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."<ref>Monk, pp. 370<U+2013>371.</ref>

===The Vienna Circle===
{{See also|Vienna Circle}}
The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=Monk212/> From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle who his work had inspired.  In his autobiography, [[Rudolph Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems."  As for Wittgenstein:
{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation...the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment of analysis of it would be a profanation.<ref>Rudulph Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A. Schlipp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Rudolph Carnap'', The Library of Living Philosophers, Volume 11, La Salle Open Court, 1963, pages 25-27</ref>}}

[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|Wittgenstein worked on [[Haus Wittgenstein]] between 1926 and 1929.]]
In 1926, Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of H<U+00FC>tteldorf, where he had also enquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''.  Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.".<ref name=Jeffries>Jeffries, Stuart. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html "A dwelling for the gods"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2002.</ref>

It took him a year to design the door handles, and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."<ref name=Jeffries/>

The house was finished by December 1928, and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."<ref name=Lewis>Hyde, Lewis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Hyde-t.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=&st=nyt "Making It"]. ''The New York Times'', 6 April 2008.</ref> Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open - that is lacking."<ref name="Monk, page 240">Monk, page 240</ref> Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.<ref name="Monk, page 240"/>

==1929<U+2013>1941: Fellowship at Cambridge==
===PhD and fellowship===
At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."<ref>Monk, p. 255.</ref> Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis. It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."<ref>Monk, p. 271.</ref> Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius;  but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."<ref>R. B. Braithwaite ''George Edward Moore, 1873 - 1958'', in Alice Ambrose and Morris Lazerowitz. ''G.E. Moore: Essays in Retrospect''. Allen & Unwin, 1970.</ref> Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College.

===Anschluss===
{{See|Anschluss|Nuremberg Laws|Mischling Test}}
From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,<ref>[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html Ludwig Wittgenstein: Return to Cambridge] from the Cambridge Wittgenstein Archive</ref> where he worked on the ''Philosophical Investigations''. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[<U+00C9>amon de Valera]], himself a mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to an academy for advanced mathematics.

While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.<ref name=Waugh137>Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204<U+2013>209.</ref>

After the Anschluss, Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer<U+2019>s daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not a Jew, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.<ref>Waugh, pp. 224<U+2013>226.</ref>

Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.<ref>For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David. [http://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&hl=en&ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 237ff.</ref>

A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.<ref>Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. ''Wittgenstein's Poker''. Faber and Faber, 2001, pp. 98, 105.</ref> Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim the gold, foreign currency, and stocks held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings.  After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.<ref name=Gottlieb/>

===Professor of philosophy===
After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700&nbsp;kg of gold.<ref>Edmonds, David and Eidinow, John. "[[Wittgenstein<U+2019>s Poker]]", Faber and Faber, London 2001, p. 98.</ref> There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].<ref>Moran, John. "Wittgenstein and Russia" ''New Left Review'' 73, May<U+2013>June, 1972, pp. 83<U+2013>96.</ref>

Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' - perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial."<ref>Malcolm, p. 23-4.</ref>}}

Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes."<ref>Malcolm, p. 25.</ref>}}

After work, Wittgenstein would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Western]]s, where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories.<ref>Hoffmann, Josef. [http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html "Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis"], ''CADS'', no. 44, October 2003.</ref> Norman Malcolm wrote that he would rush to the cinema when class ended.<ref>Malcolm, p. 26.</ref>

By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and Whitehead's ''Principia Mathematica''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]].<ref>Diamond, Cora (ed.). ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics''. University Of Chicago Press, 1989.</ref>

===World War II and Guy's Hospital===
Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.<ref>For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28</ref>

In September 1941 he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards<U+2014>where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.<ref name=Monk431/>

The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him<U+2014>at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings<U+2014>but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.<ref>Monk, p. 432.</ref> Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."<ref name=Monk431>Monk, p. 431ff.</ref>

He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!"<ref name=Monk443/> Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.<ref name=Monk443>Monk, pp. 442<U+2013>443.</ref>

While Wittgenstein was at Guy<U+2019>s he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with Dr R T Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study and in November 1942 Grant and Reeve moved to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], in order to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of <U+00A3>4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]<ref name="Schardt">[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt , Newcastle Philosophical Society, Retrieved December 2011</ref>) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.<ref name=Monk447>Monk, p. 447ff.</ref>

He resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and travelled to Ireland in 1947 and 1948, staying in Ross's Hotel in Dublin and a farmhouse in Red Cross, in County Wicklow, where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R. Seeking solitude he moved to Rosro, a holiday cottage in Connemara owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.<ref name=archivefinalyears/>

He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March & I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at "Storey's End", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]
He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[Prostate cancer|cancer of the prostate]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us", he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into "Storey's End", at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan was at first afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.<ref name=archivefinalyears>[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive, accessed 8 September 2010.
*Also see Malcolm, p. 79ff.</ref>

By the beginning of 1951 it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once & and that mental life can cease before the rest does."<ref>Malcolm, p. 79ff.</ref> In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.<ref name=archivefinalyears/> He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April, 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.<U+2014>Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."<ref name=Malcolm80>Malcolm, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref>
[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]]]]

He began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!". Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm describes this as a "strangely moving utterance".<ref name=Malcolm80/> Four of his former students arrived at his bedside<U+2014>Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], Yorick Smythies, and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics, and at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. He was given a Catholic burial at [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|St. Giles's Church]], Cambridge. Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.<ref name=Monk576>Monk, pp. 576<U+2013>580.</ref>

==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''==
{{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}}
[[File:Duckrabbit.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a "duckrabbit", discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]
The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933<U+2013>1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language, and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.

''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday".<ref>PI, <U+00A7>38.</ref>

According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<ref>PI, <U+00A7>107.</ref> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear."<ref>PI, <U+00A7>133.</ref>

==Legacy==
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are widely diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], "He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he were writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."<ref name="autogenerated6">Malcolm, p. 6.</ref>

In 1999, the Baruch Poll ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "...the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations".<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/>

==In popular culture==
In 1993 Wittgenstein was the subject of the film ''[[Wittgenstein (film)|Wittgenstein]]'' by the English director [[Derek Jarman]]. The film is loosely based on his life story as well as his philosophical thinking. The adult Wittgenstein is played by the Welsh actor [[Karl Johnson]]. [[Terry Eagleton]], a critic, called him the philosopher of poets and composers, playwrights and novelists.<ref>For ethical and religious themes, see Barrett, Cyril. ''Wittgenstein on Ethics and Religious Belief''. Blackwell, 1991, p. 138.</ref>
