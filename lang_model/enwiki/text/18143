'''Cadastral divisions of Australia''' refers to the parts of [[Australia]] which are divided into the [[cadastral]] units of [[counties]], [[parishes]], [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], and other divisions for the purposes of land ownership. Most property titles in Australia are listed as being in the parish and county. The whole of the eastern states of [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]] were divided into counties in the nineteenth century. Parts of [[South Australia]] (south-east) and [[Western Australia]] (south-west) were similarly divided, and there were also five counties in a small part of the [[Northern Territory]].  There are a total of 597 counties in Australia, but there are no counties for most of the sparsely inhabited central and western parts of the country.  Counties in Australia have no administrative or political function, unlike those in [[Counties in England|England]] and the [[County (United States)|United States]].  Australia instead uses [[Local Government Areas in Australia|Local Government Areas]], including [[shires]], [[boroughs]] and [[municipalities]] according to the state, as the second level subdivision. 

Counties were used since the earliest British settlement in Australia, with Sydney shown in the [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|county of Cumberland]] since the first days of the colony.  Many of the counties have English names, often the names of counties in England, such as Devon, Dorset, Cornwall and Kent counties in Tasmania.  Less frequently, some have [[Aboriginal]] names such as Yungnulgra county in New South Wales, and Croajingolong county in Victoria.  

The use of counties was popular in Australia in the nineteenth century, with many maps of Australian colonies showing the counties <ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm1975 New country and rail road map of New South Wales [cartographic material] : showing rail roads, coach roads, cities, towns &c.
1887. MAP RM 1975.]</ref>, and towns and cities often listed in their county.  Legal cases referenced counties [http://www.law.mq.edu.au/scnsw/Cases1831-32/html/r_v_webber__1831.htm], and many genealogical records for Australia in the nineteenth century list the county and parish for location of birth, deaths and marriages.[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~yewenyi/23693.htm] [http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=yewenyi&id=I329]. The [[1911 Britannica]] also describes Australian towns and cities as being in their respective county, including most of the capital cities:
[[Melbourne]], Bourke county [http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Melbourne,_Australia];[[Sydney]], Cumberland county [http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Sydney,_Australia];[[Brisbane]], Stanley county [http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Brisbane]; [[Adelaide]], Adelaide county; and [[Hobart]], Buckingham county [http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hobart].  However it is not mentioned that [[Perth]] is located in the county of Perth[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Perth,_Australia], as even by this time counties were infrequently used in Western Australia, where they did not cover all of the settled areas, unlike the other states.

Counties have since gone out of use in Australia, and are rarely used or even known by most of the population today.  Part of the reason is that counties are based on the size of land, rather than population, so in a large country where most of the population live in cities on the coast, they have little relevance.  The counties which contain the capital cities have millions of people, while those in remote areas have a very small population.  The county of Cumberland which contains Sydney, for instance, has a larger population than all the other counties in New South Wales combined. 

Some of the county names live on by being the same name of current day local government areas, general region names, towns or establishments in the area. For instance, the current [[Shire of Plantagenet]] and [[Shire of Victoria Plains]] in Western Australia are in the similar area to the county of Plantagenet and county of Victoria, respectively.  The modern city of [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]] in Tasmania is located in the county of Devon.  Some regions do promote the county name such as [http://www.argylecounty.com.au/ Argyle County], while Cadell County (roughly in the [[Murray Shire Council|Murray Shire]] area) is still the name for a [http://cadellvineyard.tripod.com/ vineyard] and [http://hotelkey.com/hotel-hh-21772-en/hotel-cadell-county-motor-lodge.html motor lodge] in the same area.
