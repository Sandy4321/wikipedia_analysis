==Career in singing==
===Mid-1970s through the 1980s===
Starting in 1977, the Miami Sound Machine with Gloria Fajardo began recording and releasing various albums, 45s, and 12"s on the Audiofon Records label in Miami. The first album from 1977 was entitled "Live Again Renacer" and was released with two different covers. After several more releases on the Audiofon label as well as the RCA Victor label and Miami Sound Machine's own label MSM Records, the band was signed to Discos CBS International and released several albums, 45s, and 12"s beginning with 1980's self-titled album "Miami Sound Machine".

On March 24, 2010, Gloria led a march through the [[Calle Ocho]] in Miami to support Cuba's ''Las Damas De Blanco'' (''[[Ladies in White]]'').<ref>http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/24/1545843/gloria-estefan-will-lead-a-march.html</ref> Estefan did this to make people remember the movement's Havana march of 2003, where women protested on behalf of 75 victims of Castro's dictatorship.

Closer to the year's end, Gloria made part of a project for a benefit for the Urban Arts Partnership in [[New York]] on its 10th edition, ''24 Hours Of Play In Broadway'',<ref>http://www.gloriaestefan.com/www/news/461-gloria-signs-up-for-q24-hour-plays-on-broadwayq.html</ref> she made a special role in a play named ''I Think You'll Love This One'', which was written by a 20-year-old winner of the Montblanc writers project, Elizabeth Cruz Cortes.<ref>http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/gloria-estefans-one-day-broadway-career</ref> Her fellow actors were [[Elijah Wood]], [[Diane Neal]] and [[Alicia Witt]]. Estefan's performance was praised by critics and by the director of the play.

==Upcoming projects==
Estefan is currently working on a new dance oriented studio album which is set for a 2011 release and is described by Estefan as a project in the vein of her 1998 hit album "[[Gloria!]]". She is collaborating with producers [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]] from [[The Neptunes]] and [[Will.I.Am]] from [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. She will also make a guest appearance on the forthcoming album by [[Sheila E]].<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/trappings-of-success-tainted-sheila-e/story-fn52nri7-1225867255880</ref>

==Career outside of singing==
===Film and television appearances===
Estefan has appeared in two movies, ''[[Music of the Heart]]'' (1999) and ''[[For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story]]'' (2000).  Estefan made a cameo appearance with her husband in ''[[Marley & Me (film)|Marley & Me]]'' in 2008.

Estefan was cast to star as [[Connie Francis]], a U.S. pop singer of the 1950s and early 1960s, in ''Who's Sorry Now?'', based on Francis<U+2019> life. Filming supposedly began in late 2008, according to Parade Magazine (March 23, 2008). Estefan, in an interview with www.allheadlinenews.com, stated the film would be released in 2009. As of December 2009, the film has been dropped as Connie Francis had [[irreconcilable differences]] with Estefan over the film's writer. Francis wanted to hire writer [[Robert L. Freedman]], who had written the [[Emmy Award]] winning mini-series ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]''. Estefan refused to consider him, which according to Francis ended the project collaboration.<ref>''Daeida Magazine'' (December 2009) <U+2013> Interview by: David Ybarra pg. 26 [http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_2010_Archive_Holiday2009.html LINK]</ref>
