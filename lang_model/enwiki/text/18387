"'''A Kind of Magic'''" is a [[rock music|rock]] song by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], written by [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] for the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]''. The song reached number three in the [[UK Singles Chart]], top ten in a number of European countries, and #42 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song is the opening track on the band's compilation albums, ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|Greatest Hits II]]'', and ''[[Classic Queen]]''.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/queen/albums.jhtml?albumId=72769 Queen Album: Classic Queen] MTV.

==Recording==
===Name===
The phrase "a kind of magic" is used in ''Highlander'' by [[Connor MacLeod]] ([[Christopher Lambert]]) as a description of his immortality. Roger Taylor liked the phrase so much that he used it as inspiration for the song. There are references to the film in the lyrics: "one prize, one goal"; "no mortal man"; and "there can be only one".

===Composition===
[[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Taylor]] wrote the melody and chords for the version that appeared in the film, which [[Brian May]] described as "quite lugubrious and heavy."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purvis|first1=Georg|title=Queen Complete Works|date=2011|publisher=Titan Books|location=London|page=209}}</ref> [[Freddie Mercury]] composed a new bass line, added instrumental breaks, and changed the song's order to make it more chart friendly. Mercury and [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]] produced this new version. The song was still credited only to Taylor. Whilst Taylor's version is at the end of the film, Mercury's version appears on the album. Taylor's version of ''A Kind of Magic'' did not see official release until it was included on the extra EP for the 2011 special edition of the album.

Brian May confirmed in the book he co-wrote about [[Red Special|his homemade guitar]] (2014) that a three-part harmony bit on guitar was actually recorded by Taylor, using May's guitar.

==Live performances==
The song was a live favourite on [[Magic Tour (Queen)|The Magic Tour]] of the same year, which proved to be Queen's last tour before the death of Freddie Mercury.

Taylor often included the song in solo set lists, and those with his band [[The Cross (band)|The Cross]]. On the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]] of Europe, Taylor took lead vocals for the song at some concerts.

==Music video==
The music video for this song was directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]], director of ''Highlander''. Notable is that Brian May did not use his famous [[Red Special]] guitar in the music video, but instead a 1984 copy. In the video, Mercury is dressed as a magician type figure. He enters an abandoned theatre (The [[Playhouse Theatre]] in London) where May, Taylor and [[John Deacon]] (all dressed as stereotypical tramps) are asleep until awakened by Mercury's entrance. Mercury transforms the hobos into the Queen members, dressed regularly with their instruments, then back to hobos again as he leaves. Throughout the video, cartoon images dance to the beat of the song which was produced by the Walt Disney Corporation. As May later remembered, the theater was old and derelict, and lacking central heating, so the band were quite cold during the March filming.  

==Legacy==
The single was certified platinum in [[Brazil]] for more than 100,000 digital downloads of the single.<ref>[http://www.abpd.org.br/certificados_interna.asp ABPD | Associa<U+00E7><U+0103>o Brasileira de Produtores de Disco<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On [[Last.fm]] the song has more than 48,000 hits and is the sixteenth most listened Queen song ever.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/+charts Queen<U+2019>s Charts <U+2014> Top Songs by Queen <U+2014> Last.fm<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Queen's compilations ''The Platinum Collection'', ''Classic Queen'', and ''Greatest Hits II'' all make an unsubstantiated claim that the song reached #1 in 35 countries around the world,<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Platinum Collection |titlelink=The Platinum Collection (Queen album) |others=[[Queen (band)|Queen]] |year=2000 |first=Jim |last=Jenkins |author2=Smith, Jacky|author3=Davis, Andy|author4=Symes, Phil |page=11 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Parlophone]] |id=7243 5 29883 2 7 }}</ref> but to date, there is no known territory where the song did reach the top position.
