The countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

The host country (Canada) is highlighted in lavender blue and the greatest number of medals in each medal category (gold, silver, bronze, and total) is in boldface.
