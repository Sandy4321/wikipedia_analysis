The order Primates has traditionally been divided into two main groupings: [[prosimian]]s and [[simian|anthropoid]]s (simians). Prosimians have characteristics more like those of the earliest primates, and include the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]], [[Lorisoidea|lorisoids]], and [[tarsier]]s. Simians include monkeys, apes and [[Homo|hominin]]s. More recently, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] have preferred to split primates into the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]], or wet-nosed primates, consisting of nontarsier prosimians, and the suborder [[Haplorhini]], or dry-nosed primates, consisting of tarsiers and the simians. Simians are divided into two groups: [[Catarrhini|catarrhine]] (narrow-nosed) monkeys and [[ape]]s of Africa and southeastern Asia and platyrrhine ("flat-nosed") or [[New World monkey]]s of South and Central America. Catarrhines consist of [[Old World monkey]]s (such as [[baboon]]s and [[macaque]]s), [[gibbon]]s and [[great ape]]s; New World monkeys include the [[Capuchin monkey|capuchin]], [[howler monkey|howler]] and [[squirrel monkey]]s. Humans are the only extant catarrhines to have spread successfully outside of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia, although fossil evidence shows many other species were formerly present in Europe. New primate species are still being discovered. More than 25 species were [[Primates described in the 2000s|taxonomically described in the decade of the 2000s]] and eleven have been [[Primates described in the 2010s|described since 2010]].

Considered [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] mammals, primates exhibit a wide range of characteristics. Some primates (including some great apes and baboons) are primarily terrestrial rather than [[arboreal]], but all species possess adaptations for climbing trees. Locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree, walking on two or four limbs, [[knuckle-walking]], and swinging between branches of trees ([[brachiation]]). Primates are characterized by large brains relative to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic]] vision at the expense of smell, the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. [[Trichromacy|Three-color vision]] has developed in some primates. Most also have [[thumb|opposable thumbs]] and some have [[Prehensility|prehensile]] tails. Many species are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; differences include body mass, canine tooth size, and coloration. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals and reach maturity later, but have longer lifespans. Depending on the species, adults may live in solitude, in mated pairs, or in groups of up to hundreds of members.

==Historical and modern terminology==
The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused. For example, "ape" has been used either as an alternative for "monkey" or for any tailless, relatively humanlike primate.<ref name=EB11Ape>{{Citation |last=Anon. |year=1911 |contribution=Ape |title=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |publication-place=New York |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri02chisrich#page/160/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-10 |edition=11th |volume=XIX }}</ref>

Sir [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark]] was one of the [[primatologists]] who developed the idea of trends in primate evolution, and the living members of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading to humans.<ref name=Dixson1981>{{Citation |last=Dixson |first=A.F. |year=1981 |title=The Natural History of the Gorilla |publication-place=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicholson |isbn=978-0-297-77895-0 }}<!--pp needed--></ref> Commonly used names for groups of primates, for example "[[prosimian]]s", "[[monkey]]s", "[[lesser ape]]s" and "[[great ape]]s", reflect this arrangement. According to our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the primates, several of these groups are [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]], meaning although all the species in the group descend from a common ancestor, the group does not include all the descendants of that ancestor.<ref>Definitions of [[paraphyly]] vary; for the one used here see e.g. {{Citation |last=Stace |first=Clive A. |year=2010 |title=Classification by molecules: What's in it for field botanists? |journal=Watsonia |volume=28 |pages=103<U+2013>122 |url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/Wats28p103.pdf |accessdate=2010-02-07 }}, p. 106</ref>

By contrast with approaches such as those of Le Gros Clark, modern classifications typically use groups that are [[monophyly|monophyletic]], since they include ''all'' the descendants of a common ancestor.<ref>Definitions of [[monophyly]] vary; for the one used here see e.g. {{Citation |last=Mishler |first=Brent D |year=2009 |editor-last=Ayala |editor-first=F.J. |editor2-last=Arp |editor2-first=R. |contribution=Species are not Uniquely Real Biological Entities |title=Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Biology |pages=110<U+2013>122 |isbn=978-1-4443-1492-2 |accessdate=2011-04-19 |doi=10.1002/9781444314922.ch6 |lastauthoramp=yes }}, p. 114</ref> The diagram below shows one possible classification of the living primates,<ref name=Cartmill2011>{{cite book | last1 = Cartmill | first1 = M. | last2 = Smith | first2 = F.

All the groups that have scientific names are monophyletic (i.e. they are [[clade]]s), so the scientific classification reflects evolutionary history. Some of the traditional groups shown on the right, which form an "ascending series", are paraphyletic:
* "prosimians" contain two monophyletic groups, the suborder Strepsirrhini (lemurs, lorises and allies), as well as the tarsiers, which are a sister group to the infraorder Anthropoidea (also called Simiiformes).
* "monkeys" consist of two monophyletic groups, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, but exclude hominoids (superfamily Hominoidea).
* "apes" as a whole, and the "great apes" in particular, are not monophyletic because they exclude humans.

Thus, the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea. In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans, and there is no single common name for all the members of the group. One possibility is to create a new common name, in this case "hominoids". Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional terms. For example, in a 2005 book, the [[vertebrate]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] Benton wrote, "The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans",<ref name=Benton2005p371>{{Citation |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate palaeontology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SyJO3vpCk8AC |accessdate=2011-07-10 }}, p. 371</ref> thereby using "apes" to mean "hominoids". The group traditionally called "apes" must then be called the "nonhuman apes".

{{As of|2011|July}}, there is no consensus as to which approach to follow, whether to accept traditional paraphyletic common names or whether to use monophyletic names, either new ones or adaptations of old ones. Both approaches will be found in biological sources, often in the same work. Thus, although Benton defines "apes" to include humans, he also repeatedly uses "ape-like" to mean "like an ape rather than a human", and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil writes of "claims that ''[[Orrorin]]'' ... was an ape rather than a human".<ref name=Benton2005p371>{{Citation |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate palaeontology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SyJO3vpCk8AC |accessdate=2011-07-10 }}; e.g. p. 378, p. 379, p. 380</ref>

Until recently, the [[aye-aye]] has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini.<ref name="MSW3" /> Theories had been proposed that its family, Daubentoniidae, was either a lemuriform primate (meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises split) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines.

Primates generally have five digits on each limb ([[Dactyly#Pentadactyly|pentadactyly]]), with keratin [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] on the end of each finger and toe. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have [[tactile pad|sensitive pads]] on the [[distal phalanges|fingertips]].

In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a [[relict]] of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop [[brachiation]] (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike nails on the second toe of each foot, called [[toilet-claw]]s, which they use for grooming.<ref name="pough">{{cite book |author=Pough, F. W., Janis, C. M. & Heiser, J.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
{{Main|Sexual dimorphism in non-human primates}}
[[File:Hamadryas Baboon.jpg|thumb|right|Distinct sexual size dimorphism can be seen between the female and two male [[Hamadryas baboon]]s.]]

[[Sexual dimorphism]] is often exhibited in [[simian]]s, though to a greater degree in Old World species (apes and some monkeys) than New World species. Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism. Primates usually have dimorphism in [[Body weight|body mass]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ralls, K. |year=1976 |title=Mammals in Which Females are Larger Than Males |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=51 |issue=2 |doi=10.1086/409310 | pages=245<U+2013>76 |pmid=785524}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Lindstedtand & Boyce | year=1985 | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=125 |pages=873 |doi = 10.1086/284385 |title = Seasonality, Fasting Endurance, and Body Size in Mammals | last2=Boyce | first2=Mark S. | issue=6}}</ref> and canine tooth size<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frisch, J.

Comparative analyses have generated a more complete understanding of the relationship between [[sexual selection]], [[natural selection]], and mating systems in primates.

=== Locomotion ===
[[File:Diademed ready to push off.jpg|thumb|[[Diademed sifaka]], a lemur that is a vertical clinger and leaper]]

Primate species move by [[brachiation]], [[bipedalism]], [[Jumping|leaping]], arboreal and terrestrial [[quadruped]]alism, [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[knuckle-walking]] or by a combination of these methods. Several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers and leapers. These include many [[Galago|bushbabies]], all [[Indriidae|indriids]] (i.e., [[sifaka]]s, [[avahi (genus)|avahis]] and [[indri]]s), [[sportive lemur]]s, and all [[tarsier]]s.<ref name="Sussman1999">{{cite book|title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 1: Lorises, Lemurs and Tarsiers|author=Sussman, R.

Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds, while some are leapers. Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers. [[Gibbon]]s, [[muriqui]]s and [[spider monkey]]s all brachiate extensively,<ref name="Strier2007" /> with gibbons sometimes doing so in remarkably acrobatic fashion. [[Woolly monkey]]s also brachiate at times.<ref name="Sussman2003" /> [[Orangutan]]s use a similar form of locomotion called quadramanous climbing, in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through the trees.<ref name="Strier2007" /> [[Chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s knuckle walk,<ref name="Strier2007" /> and can move bipedally for short distances. Although numerous species, such as [[australopithecine]]s and [[Homo (genus)|early hominids]], have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion, humans are the only extant species with this trait.<ref name="GlazierFlowerday2003">{{Cite book | first1 = S.

== Behavior ==

=== Social systems ===
Primates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kappeler|first=Peter|coauthors=C. van Schaik|title=Primate social systems|year=2003}}</ref> [[Richard Wrangham]] stated that [[Social structure|social systems]] of non-human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wrangham, R. W. |authorlink=Richard Wrangham |chapter=Mutualism, kinship and social evolution |year=1982 |title=Current Problems in Sociobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=269<U+2013>289 |isbn=0-521-24203-7}}</ref> He proposed four categories:
* Female transfer systems&nbsp;<U+2013> females move away from the group in which they were born. Females of a group will not be closely related whereas males will have remained with their natal groups, and this close association may be influential in social behavior. The groups formed are generally quite small. This organization can be seen in chimpanzees, where the males, who are typically related, will cooperate in defense of the group's territory. Among New World Monkeys, [[spider monkey]]s and [[muriqui]]s use this system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Fiore, A. D. & Campbell, C. J.|chapter=The Atelines|year=2007|pages=175|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Campbell, C. J., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K. C., Panger, M. & Bearder, S. K.|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4}}</ref>
[[File:Ringstaartmakis - Ring-tailed Lemur.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A social huddle of ring-tailed lemurs.  The two individuals on the right exposing their white ventral surface are sunning themselves.]]

* Male transfer systems&nbsp;<U+2013> while the females remain in their natal groups, the males will emigrate as adolescents. [[Polygyny|Polygynous]] and multi-male societies are classed in this category. Group sizes are usually larger. This system is common among the [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[Cercopithecinae|cercopithecine monkeys]].<ref name="Strier2007" />
* Monogamous species&nbsp;<U+2013> a male<U+2013>female bond, sometimes accompanied by a juvenile offspring. There is shared responsibility of parental care and territorial defense. The offspring leaves the parents' territory during adolescence. [[Gibbon]]s essentially use this system, although "monogamy" in this context does not necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Bartlett, T. Q.|chapter=The Hylobatidae|year=2007|editor=Campbell, C. J., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K. C., Panger, M. & Bearder, S. K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4|pages=283}}</ref>
* Solitary species&nbsp;<U+2013> often males who defend territories that include the home ranges of several females. This type of organization is found in the prosimians such as the [[slow loris]]. [[Orangutan]]s do not defend their territory but effectively have this organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective|author=Knott, C. D. & Kahlenberg, S.

K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517133-4|pages=294}}</ref>

Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with [[howler monkey]]s both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related.<ref name="Sussman2003" /> Some prosimians, [[Colobinae|colobine]] monkeys and [[Callitrichinae|callitrichid]] monkeys use this system.<ref name="Strier2007" />

=== Interspecific associations ===
Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild. Some of these associations have been extensively studied. In the [[Ta<U+00EF> National Park|Tai Forest]] of Africa several species coordinate anti-predator behavior.

=== Life history ===
[[File:Crab-eating Macaque nursing.jpg|A [[Crab-eating macaque]] breastfeeding her baby|thumb|400px]]
Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals.<ref name="Strier2007" /> All primate infants are [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] by their mothers (with the exception of some human cultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed formula) and rely on them for grooming and transportation.<ref name="Strier2007" /> In some species, infants are protected and transported by males in the group, particularly males who may be their fathers.<ref name="Strier2007" /> Other relatives of the infant, such as siblings and aunts, may participate in its care as well.<ref name="Strier2007" /> Most primate mothers cease [[ovulation]] while breastfeeding an infant; once the infant is [[Weaning|weaned]] the mother can reproduce again.<ref name="Strier2007" /> This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt to continue breastfeeding.<ref name="Strier2007" /> 

[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] is common in polygynous species such as [[gray langur]]s and gorillas. Adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs so the female will return to estrus and thus they can sire offspring of their own. Social monogamy in some species may have evolved to combat this behavior.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Opie, Christopher;  Atkinson, Quentin D.; Dunbarc, Robin I. M.; Shultz, Susanne|year=2013|title=Male infanticide leads to social monogamy in primates|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1307903110|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/13328.full}}</ref> [[Promiscuity]] may also lessen the risk of infanticide since paternity becomes uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal|author=De Ruiter, Jan R.; Van Hooff, Jan A.

Primates have a longer [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size.<ref name="Strier2007" /> Some primates such as [[galago]]s and [[new world monkey]]s use tree-holes for nesting, and park juveniles in leafy patches while foraging. Other primates follow a strategy of "riding", i,e. carrying individuals on the body while feeding. Adults may construct and/or use nesting sites, sometimes accompanied by juveniles, for the purpose of resting, a behavior which has developed secondarily in the great apes.<ref name="Kappeler1998">{{cite journal |last1=Kappeler |first1=Peter M. |year=1998 |title=Nests, Tree Holes, and the Evolution of Primate Life Histories |journal=American Journal of Primatology |publisher=Wiley-Liss, Inc. |volume= |issue=46 |pages=7<U+2013>33 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-2345%281998%2946:1%3C7::AID-AJP3%3E3.0.CO;2-%23/abstract |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)46:1<7::AID-AJP3>3.0.CO;2-# |accessdate=9 February 2012|format=abstract}}</ref><ref name="Ross2001">{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1991 |title=Park or ride?

Primates exploit a variety of food sources. It has been said that many characteristics of modern primates, including humans, derive from an early ancestor's practice of taking most of its food from the tropical canopy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Milton |first1 = K. |year=1993 |title = Diet and Primate Evolution |url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/miltonlab/pdfs/diet_primate_evolution.pdf |journal=Scientific American |volume=269 |issue=2 |pages=86<U+2013>93 |pmid=8351513}}</ref> Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s for energy.<ref name="Strier2007" /> However, they require other foods, such as leaves or insects, for [[amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and [[mineral]]s. Primates in the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]] (non-tarsier prosimians) are able to synthesize [[vitamin C]], like most other mammals, while primates of the suborder [[Haplorrhini]] (tarsiers, monkeys and apes) have lost this ability, and require the vitamin in their diet.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Vitamin C biosynthesis in prosimians: Evidence for the anthropoid affinity of Tarsius | author = Pollock, J.

Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods, such as fruit, leaves, gum or [[insect]]s.<ref name="Strier2007" /> For example, leaf eaters such as [[howler monkey]]s, [[black-and-white colobus]]es and [[sportive lemur]]s have extended digestive tracts which enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult to digest.<ref name="Strier2007" /> [[Marmoset]]s, which are gum eaters, have strong [[incisor]] teeth, enabling them to open tree bark to get to the gum, and claws rather than nails, enabling them to cling to trees while feeding.<ref name="Strier2007" /> The [[aye-aye]] combines rodent-like teeth with a long, thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker. It taps on trees to find insect larvae, then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvae out.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milliken, G. W., Ward, J.

====Hunting====
[[Tarsier]]s are the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[obligate carnivore|obligate carnivorous]] primates, exclusively eating insects, crustaceans, small vertebrates and snakes (including [[Venomous snake|venomous]] species).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tarsiers Past, Present and Future|chapter=Introduction|author=Wright, P., Simmons, E. & Gursky, S.|editor=Wright, P., Simmons, E. & Gursky, S.|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3236-1|pages=1}}</ref> [[Capuchin monkey]]s can exploit many different types of plant matter, including fruit, leaves, flowers, buds, nectar and seeds, but also eat insects and other [[invertebrate]]s, bird eggs, and small vertebrates such as birds, [[lizard]]s, [[squirrel]]s and [[bat]]s.<ref name="Sussman2003" />  Crab-eating macaques typically do not consume crabs; Although fruits and seeds make up 60 - 90% of their diet, they sometimes prey on vertebrates including bird chicks, nesting female birds, lizards, frogs and fish.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The [[common chimpanzee]] has a varied diet that includes predation on other primate species, such as the [[western red colobus]] monkey.<ref name="tai2">{{cite book|title=Monkeys of the Ta<U+00EF> Forest : an African primate community|chapter=Interactions between Red Colobus Monkeys and Chimpanzees|author=Bshary, R.|editor=McGraw, W., Zuberbuhler, K. & Noe, R.|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81633-5|pages=155<U+2013>170}}</ref><ref name="chimpcolobus">{{cite book|title=Chimpanzee and red colobus : the ecology of predator and prey|author=Stanford, C.|year=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00722-0|pages=130<U+2013>138, 233}}</ref> This sometimes involves tool use.

Researchers documented 22 occasions where wild chimpanzees fashioned sticks into "spears" to hunt [[Senegal bushbaby|lesser bush babies]] (''Galago senegalensis'').  In each case, a chimpanzee modified a branch by breaking off one or two ends and, frequently using its teeth, sharpened the stick.  The tools, on average, were about 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) long and 1.1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) in circumference.  The chimpanzee then jabbed the spear into hollows in tree trunks where bush babies sleep.  There was a single case in which a chimpanzee successfully extracted a bush baby with the tool.

===As prey===
Predators of primates include various species of [[carnivora]]ns, [[birds of prey]], [[reptile]]s and other primates. Even gorillas have been recorded as prey. Predators of primates have diverse hunting strategies and as such, primates have evolved several different [[antipredator adaptation]]s including [[crypsis]], [[Alarm signal|alarm calls]] and [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]]. Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may have shaped group size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fichtel, Claudia|contribution=Predation|year=2012|title=The Evolution of Primate Societies|editor=Mitani, John C.; Call, Josep;  Kappeler, Peter M.; Palombit, Ryne A.; Silk, Joan B|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=169<U+2013>84|isbn=0-226-53172-4}}</ref> With their technology and increased intelligence, modern humans are nearly free of threats from predators and are themselves [[apex predators]].

===Tool use and manufacture===
{{Main|Tool use by animals}}

====Tool use====
[[File:Gorilla tool use.png|thumb|right|250px|A gorilla using a stick possibly to gauge the depth of water]]
There are many reports of primates using tools, both in the wild or when captive.  The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.

In 1960, [[Jane Goodall]] observed a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a [[termite]] mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass as a tool to <U+201C>fish<U+201D> or "dip" for termites.<ref name="The Jane Goodall Institute1">{{cite web|url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees/tool-use-hunting-other-discoveries|title=Tool use, hunting & other discoveries|publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute|accessdate=Aug 1, 2013}}</ref> There are more limited reports of the closely related bonobo using tools in the wild; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use tools as readily as chimpanzees when in captivity,<ref name="ApeTag">{{cite web|url=http://www.clemetzoo.com/apetag/Bonobos.html|title=Bonobos|publisher=ApeTag|year=2010|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}</ref>  It has been reported that both female chimpanzees and bonobos use tools more avidly than males.<ref>Gruber, T., Clay, Z. and Zuberb<U+00FC>hler, K., (2010). A comparison of bonobo and chimpanzee tool use: evidence for a female bias in the ''Pan'' lineage. Animal Behaviour, 80: 1023-1033.[http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/publications/articles/Gruber_etal_2010.pdf]</ref>  Orangutans in [[Borneo]] scoop catfish out of small ponds.  Anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn on their own to jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/04/orangutan-tools-fishing/|title=Orangutans use simple tools to catch fish|author=Bower, B.|year=2011|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref>  There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild.  An adult female Western lowland gorilla used a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her  crossing a pool of water.  Another adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge.<ref>Breuer, T., Ndoundou-Hockemba, M. and Fishlock, V., (2005).  First observation of tool use in wild gorillas. PLoS Biol. Nov;3(11):e380 [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030380]</ref>

The black-striped capuchin was the first non-ape primate for which tool use was documented in the wild; individuals were observed cracking nuts by placing them on a stone anvil and hitting them with another large stone.<ref name="Fragaszy">Fragaszy, D., Izar, P., Visalberghi, E., Ottoni, E.B., de Oliveira, M.G., (2004).

DOI: 10.1002/ajp.20085</ref>  In Thailand and Myanmar, [[crab-eating macaque]]s use stone tools to open nuts, oysters and other bivalves, and various types of sea snails.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gumert|first=MD|coauthors=Kluck, M., Malaivijitnond, S.|title=The physical characteristics and usage patterns of stone axe and pounding hammers used by long-tailed macaques in the Andaman Sea region of Thailand|journal=American Journal of Primatology|year=2009|volume=71|pages=594<U+2013>608}}</ref>  Chacma baboons use stones as weapons; Stoning by these baboons is done from the rocky walls of the canyon where they sleep and retreat when they are threatened. Stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side of the cliff or fall directly to the canyon floor.<ref>Hamilton, W.J., Buskirk, R.E. and Buskirk, W.H., (1975). Defensive stoning by baboons. Nature, 256: 488-489. doi:10.1038/256488a0</ref>

Although they have not been observed to use tools in the wild, lemurs in controlled settings have been shown to be capable of understanding the functional properties of the objects they had been trained to use as tools, performing as well as tool-using haplorhines.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fichtel | first1 = C. | last2 = Kappeler | first2 = P.

====Tool manufacture====
Tool manufacture is much rarer than simple tool use and probably represents higher cognitive functioning.  Soon after her initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves and using the stems to fish for insects.  This change of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery.  Prior to this, scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools, and that this ability was what separated humans from other animals.<ref name="The Jane Goodall Institute1" />  Both bonobos and chimpanzees have also been observed making "sponges" out of leaves and moss that suck up water and are used as grooming tools.  Sumatran orangutans have been observed making and using tools. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30&nbsp;cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites.<ref name="OrangutanIslands">{{cite web|url=http://orangutanislands.com/sumatra-orangutans.htm|title=Sumatran orangutans|publisher=OrangutanIslands.com|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>van Schaik, C., Fox, E. and Sitompul, A., (1996). Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans. Naturwissenschaften, 83: 186<U+2013>188</ref>  In the wild, mandrills have been observed to clean their ears with modified tools.

Some species are partially [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], such as [[baboon]]s and [[patas monkey]]s, and a few species are fully terrestrial, such as [[gelada]]s and [[human]]s. Non-human primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats in the tropical latitudes of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and South America, including [[rainforest]]s, [[mangrove]] forests, and [[montane forest]]s. There are some examples of non-human primates that live outside of the tropics; the mountain-dwelling [[Japanese macaque]] lives in the north of [[Honsh<U+016B>]] where there is snow-cover eight months of the year; the [[Barbary macaque]] lives in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Algeria and Morocco.

NHPs are kept in [[zoo]]s around the globe. Historically, zoos were primarily a form of entertainment, but more recently have shifted their focus to conservation, education and research. Many zoos now feature naturalistic exhibits and educational material for the public; in the United States many participate in the [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP), developed by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA), to maximize [[genetic diversity]] through captive breeding. Zoos and other [[animal welfare]] supporters generally oppose animal rights initiatives and the GAP's insistence that all NHPs be released from captivity for two primary reasons. First, captive-born primates lack the knowledge and experience to survive in the wild if released. Second, zoos provide living space for primates and other animals threatened with extinction in the wild.
