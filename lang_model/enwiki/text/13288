'''{{Audio|He-Mordechai_Vanunu.ogg|Mordechai Vanunu}}''' ({{lang-he|<U+05DE><U+05E8><U+05D3><U+05DB><U+05D9> <U+05D5><U+05D0><U+05E0><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D5>}}; born [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], [[October 13]] [[1954]]), also known by his [[baptism]]al name '''John Crossman''', is a former [[Israel]]i [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] technician who revealed details of [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel's nuclear weapons program]] to the [[History of British newspapers|British press]] in 1986. He was subsequently abducted in [[Rome]] by Israeli [[Mossad]] agents and smuggled to [[Israel]], where he was [[Secret trial|tried in secret]] and convicted of [[treason]].

Mordechai Vanunu spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in [[solitary confinement]]. Vanunu was released from [[prison]] in 2004, subject to a broad array of restrictions on his speech and movement. Since then he has been briefly arrested several times for multiple violations of those restrictions, including giving various interviews to foreign journalists and attempting to leave Israel. The court proceedings are ongoing, as well as Vanunu's appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] of the restrictions on his speech and movement.

On [[February 22]] [[2006]] in a Jerusalem court it was revealed that Israel had asked [[Microsoft]] to hand over all the details of Vanunu's Hotmail account before a court order had been obtained [http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2006%20Opinion%20Editorials/February/24%20o/Microsoft,%20Israel%20and%20Vanunu%20By%20Eileen%20Fleming.htm].

Vanunu was seen by some [[human rights]] groups as a [[prisoner of conscience]]. In its press release of [[April 19]] [[2005]], [[Amnesty International]] said "If Mordechai Vanunu were to be imprisoned for breaching the restrictions imposed on him, Amnesty International would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience."<ref> {{cite web

==Early life==
Vanunu was born in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]] to a [[Jew]]ish family; his father was a [[rabbi]]. In 1963, at the age of nine, he emigrated under the [[Law of Return]] with his parents and 11 brothers and sisters to Israel. Vanunu completed his three years of military service in the [[sapper]] unit of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], with the rank of [[sergeant]]. After completing his service, Vanunu became a [[philosophy]] student at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], where he became critical of many policies of the Israeli government, forming a group called "''Campus''" with four other Jewish students and five [[Arab]] students. Vanunu was also affiliated with a group called "''Movement for the Advancement of Peace''." He never graduated from the university.

==Negev Nuclear Research Center==
[[Image:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|200px|Vanunu's photograph of a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press.]]
Between 1976 and 1985, Vanunu was employed as a nuclear plant technician at the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]], an Israeli facility which, according to the majority of defense experts, is used for manufacturing nuclear weapons and nuclear research;<ref>{{cite journal

Most worldwide intelligence agencies estimate that Israel developed nuclear weapons as early as the 1960s, but the country has purposely maintained a "[[policy of deliberate ambiguity]]", neither acknowledging nor denying that it possesses the weapons. It was during his employment there that one of the left-wing groups in which Vanunu held membership, protested against Israel's 1981 destruction of Iraq's [[Osirak|Osiraq]] nuclear reactor, which was believed to be part of the Iraqi nuclear weapons development program. The [[Jerusalem Post]] stated that Vanunu took active part in these protests,<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> arguing that this showed that he was motivated by antipathy to Israel in his later actions. Vanunu has not responded to these claims.

It is believed that at Dimona, Vanunu became increasingly troubled about the widely believed [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israeli nuclear weapons program]] on which he worked. When he was laid off from Dimona in 1985, Vanunu left Israel. He arrived at [[Nepal]] and considered a [[religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Buddhism]], later traveling to [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]. In 1986, he traveled to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. While there, Vanunu lived in a [[hostel]] in [[Kings Cross, Sydney, Australia|Kings Cross]] and worked in odd jobs, first as a hotel dishwasher and later as a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver.

Vanunu began to attend the local church, [[Sydney Anglicans|St. John's]]. There he met the Reverend John McKnight, who worked with the homeless and drug addicts. Vanunu converted to [[Christianity]] and was baptized as '''John Crossman''' into the [[Anglican Church of Australia]], making him further estranged from his family.

==Disclosure, abduction, and publication==
[[Image:Vanuunu-Article.jpg|thumb|200px|On [[October 5]], [[1986]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' ran the story on its front page under the headline: "Revealed: the secrets of Israel's nuclear arsenal."]]
While in Sydney, he met [[Peter Hounam]], a journalist from ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in London. In early September 1986, Vanunu flew to [[London]] with Hounam, and in violation of his non-disclosure agreement, revealed to ''The Sunday Times'' his knowledge of the Israeli nuclear program, including photographs he had secretly taken at the Dimona site. Anxious to avoid being duped by another [[Hitler Diaries]]-sized hoax, ''The Sunday Times'' spent extensive time verifying Vanunu<U+2019>s story with leading [[nuclear weapon]] experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor|Theodore Taylor]], who concluded that Israel had almost certainly begun manufacturing [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Vanunu gave detailed descriptions of [[lithium-6]] separation and [[lithium hydride]] production required for the [[Teller-Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] [[nuclear weapon design]]. Vanunu described the [[plutonium]] processing used, giving a production rate of about 30 [[kg]] per year, and stated that Israel used about 4 kg per weapon.<ref>{{cite news

Vanunu states in his letters that he intended to share the money received from the newspaper for the information with the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]. Apparently frustrated by the delay while Hounam was completing his research, Vanunu approached a rival newspaper, the tabloid ''[[The Daily Mirror|Sunday Mirror]]'', whose owner was [[Robert Maxwell]]. In 1991, a self-described former [[Mossad]] officer called [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] alleged that Maxwell had tipped off the Mossad, possibly through British secret services, about Vanunu. It is also possible that they were alerted by enquiries made to the Israeli Embassy in London by ''Sunday Mirror'' journalists.

The Israeli government under prime minister [[Shimon Peres]], who was personally responsible for the establishment of Israel's nuclear reactor, decided to detain Vanunu, but determined that to avoid harming its good relationship with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] diplomatic ties Vanunu should be persuaded to leave [[United Kingdom|UK]] territory under his own volition. Knowing Vanunu's interest in women, on [[September 30]], an Israeli Mossad agent, [[Cheryl Bentov]], operating under the name of "Cindy" and masquerading as an American tourist, persuaded him to fly to [[Rome]] with her on a holiday. Once in Rome, Mossad agents captured him, drugged him and smuggled him to Israel on a [[cargo ship|freighter]], beginning what was to be more than a decade of [[solitary confinement]] in Israeli prisons.

On [[October 5]], the ''Sunday Times'' published the information he had revealed, and estimated that Israel had produced more than 100 nuclear [[warhead]]s.

==Imprisonment==
[[Image:764px-Vanunu-Hand big.jpg|thumb|200px|Vanunu revealed details of his detention by writing on his hand: "Vanunu M was hijacked in Rome. ITL. 30.9.86, 21:00. Came to Rome by fly BA504."]]
Vanunu was put on trial in Israel on charges of [[treason]] and [[espionage]]. The trial, held ''[[in camera]]'' (in secret), took place at the District Court in [[Jerusalem]] before Chief Justice Eliahu Noam and judges Zvi Tal and Shalom Brener. He was not permitted contact with the media but he wrote the details of his capture (or "hijacking" as he put it) on the palm of his hand, and while being transported he held his hand against the van's window so that waiting journalists could get the information ([http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Israel/Vanunu3.jpg photo]).

On [[February 27]] [[1988]], the court sentenced him to 18 years' imprisonment from the date of his capture. The Israeli government refused to release the transcript of the court case until, after the threat of legal action, it agreed to let censored extracts be published in ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'', an Israeli newspaper, in late 1999.

The death penalty in Israel is restricted to special circumstances. In 2004, former Mossad director [[Shabtai Shavit]] told [[Reuters]] that the option of [[extrajudicial execution]] was considered in 1986, but rejected because "Jews don't do that to other Jews".<ref>{{cite news

The Israeli government kept him in near total isolation for more than 11 years, allegedly out of concern that he might reveal more Israeli nuclear secrets and because he was still bound by the contract that swore him to secrecy on the subject. While in prison, he refused psychiatric treatment. Many critics argue that Vanunu had no additional information that would pose a real security threat to Israel, and that the Israeli government's real motivation is a desire to avoid political embarrassment for itself and allies such as the [[United States]]. [[Ray Kidder]], then a senior American nuclear scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], has said:

{{cquote|On the basis of this research and my own professional experience, I am ready to challenge any official assertion that Mr. Vanunu possesses any technical nuclear information not already made public.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.nonviolence.org/vanunu/archive2/jan26.html
 |title=U.S. Expert: It's Safe to Release Vanunu
 |publisher=Nonviolence.org (from [[Ha'aretz]])
 |date=[[January 26]][[2000]]
}}</ref>}}

Others also questioned that a technician without a college degree would have any new valuable technical information.

His last appeal against his conviction, to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] in 1990, failed.

While in prison, Vanunu says, he took part in small acts of rebellion, such as refusing to talk with the guards, reading only English-language newspapers, and watching only [[BBC television]]. He even refused to eat food when it was served to him so as to maintain a small portion of his life not under Israeli control. "He is the most stubborn, principled, and tough person I have ever met," said his [[lawyer]], Avigdor Feldman.

==Release==
In 2004, shortly before his scheduled release, Vanunu remained defiant under interrogation by the security service [[Shabak]]. In recordings of the interview made public after his release, he is heard saying "I am neither a traitor nor a spy, I only wanted the world to know what was happening." He also said, "We don't need a [[Jewish state]]. There needs to be a Palestinian state. Jews can, and have lived anywhere, so a Jewish State is not necessary."<ref name=Vanunu_defiant/>

Vanunu was released from prison on [[April 21]] [[2004]]. He indicated a desire to completely dissociate himself from Israel, initially refusing to speak in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and planning to move to Europe or the US<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.serve.com/vanunu/20060113jakarta.html

}}</ref> as soon as the Israeli government would permit him to do so. He denounced most of his family, but maintains a relationship with at least one of his brothers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

A number of restrictions were placed upon Vanunu by Israeli authorities, who stated their reason was fear of him spreading further state secrets and that he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement. These stipulate that he:

*has to register to live in an Israeli city of his choice.
*has to give notice to the authorities if he wishes to travel to another city.
*is not allowed to leave Israel. This restriction has since been extended to April 2006,<ref> {{cite news

 |title=Israel extends Vanunu travel ban 
 |date=[[April 19]] [[2005]]
 |publisher=[[BBC]]
}}</ref> and yet again to April 2007 due to his violations of court rulings. While a court found in 2005 that he should be free to go to the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]], the 2006 restrictions explicitly forbade him to visit either, reversing the court's initial decision.
*is not allowed to contact foreigners either by phone or in person or by e-mail.
*is not allowed to enter or approach any embassy, visit any port of entry, or come within 500 metres of any international border crossing.

Vanunu says that his knowledge is now all outdated, and that he has nothing more he could possibly reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions, since his release Vanunu has freely given interviews to the foreign press, including a live phone interview to [[BBC Radio Scotland]].  

On [[April 22]] [[2004]], Vanunu asked the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]] for a Norwegian [[passport]] and [[refugee|asylum]] in [[Norway]] for "humanitarian reasons," according to Norwegian news agencies. He also sent applications to other countries, and stated that he would accept asylum in any country because he fears for his life. Former conservative Norwegian Prime Minister [[K<U+00E5>re Willoch]] has asked the conservative government to give Vanunu asylum, and the [[University of Troms<U+00F8>]] has offered him a job. This application, as well as an application for asylum in [[Sweden]] has been rejected, since neither country accepts absentee asylum applications. He also unsuccessfully requested asylum in [[Ireland]], which would require him to first be allowed to leave Israel. It has been reported that he also approached Russia and China about political asylum, but it is not known whether he has submitted official asylum applications to these countries. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Since his release, Vanunu has appeared in Israeli courts on numerous occasions on charges of having broken the sanction. He was arrested and detained for attempting to go to [[Bethlehem]], on at least one occasion his room in [[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem|St. George's Cathedral]] was raided by policemen and his belongings were confiscated. In 2006, [[Microsoft]] was accused<ref> {{cite news

}}</ref> of helping Israeli police to obtain documents incriminating Vanunu.

International calls for his freedom of movement and freedom of speech made by organizations supporting Vanunu have been either ignored or rejected by Israel.

==Latest arrests==
===2004===
*On [[November 11]] [[2004]], Vanunu was arrested by the International Investigations Unit of the [[Israeli police]] at around 9am while eating breakfast. The arrest stemmed from an ongoing probe examining suspicions of leaking national secrets and violating legal rulings since his release from prison. Police officers wearing [[bulletproof vest]]s and carrying [[machine gun]]s entered into the walled compound of St. George's Anglican Church in [[East Jerusalem]], where Vanunu had been renting a room since his release. Police removed papers and a computer from his room. After a few hours' detention, Vanunu was put under [[house arrest]], which was to last seven days.<ref> {{cite news

==Most recent trials==

On [[April 13]] [[2007]], Vanunu was informed that the Israeli government has continued his house arrest in Jerusalem and has renewed all the restrictions against him, for the fourth time and third year of captivity in east Jerusalem. 

On [[April 30]] [[2007]], Vanunu was convicted of violating the order barring foreign contacts and traveling outside Jerusalem.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853978.html Vanunu convicted of violating order barring foreign contacts], Nir Hasson, Haaretz, April 30, 2007 (accessed April 30, 2007)</ref>

==Vanunu's human rights==
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN in 1948 was ratified by Israel and was contingent upon their statehood. 

Article 13-2 affirms: "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own."

The Israeli government refuses to allow Vanunu to leave claiming he still has a secret he has yet to tell about the underground WMD program in the Negev. Vanunu has not set foot into the Dimona for 21 years and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Inspectors never have.

In March 2006, Vanunu informed this reporter, "The Dimona is 46 years old; reactors last 25 to 30 years. The Dimona has never been inspected and Israel has never signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty but all the Arab states have...when I worked there they only produced when the air was blowing towards Jordan ten miles away. No one knows what is happening now." 

On [[March 29]] [[2007]], The Jerusalem Post quoted Yonatan Leibowitz, Greenpeace Mediterranean Communications Director, "Despite Israel's policy of nuclear ambiguity, international reports maintain that this country contains nuclear facilities. Israelis have the right to know where these facilities are and the right to understand the serious risks to health and the environment posed by these installations. Ambiguous policies about the possible existence of a nuclear program in Israel only serve to destabilize the region."
 
Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Israel agreed to uphold states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion: this right includes freedom to change his religion."

During this reporter's June 2005 interview with Vanunu he emphasized, "When I decided to expose Israel's nuclear weapons I acted out of conscience and to warn the world to prevent a nuclear holocaust...I am also regarded as a traitor because I was baptized a Christian. 

"My Christian conversion was also considered as treason and led to me receiving more time in jail than any murderer has ever served. The Israelis have this very beautiful article about freedom and liberty but they want to destroy anyone who criticizes them for revealing the truth to the world. The world must look and see what kind of democracy Israel is when one speaks out the truth." 

In 2004, Vanunu stated, "...from the beginning they put me in total isolation for seven weeks after my kidnapping they even didn't admit I am in an Israeli prison...they put me in total isolation. The first two years, they keep me in a small room, filled with light 24 hours and camera inside. I couldn't sleep for two years; they tried to break my nerves. I demanded to meet a priest. They give me a priest, but without able to speak to him or him speak to me, only through notes. A ShinBet man sitting near the priest, reading the notes. I'm sending him notes, they're reading them. We couldn't meet as a human being. Eleven and a half years I was in total isolation alone in a cell." http://www.democracynow.org/static/vanunu.shtml

"Israel is the only State that approved torture of detainees...there are dictators who use torture, but Israel is the only State that supported torture until 1999. That is when International, Israeli and Palestinian pressure groups forced the issue and Barack was confronted about it when he visited the United States...The methods and photos from Abu Grahib and Guantanamo were no shock to any Palestinian who had been in prison between 1967 and the '80's. All the methods used in Abu Grahib were normal procedures against Palestinians. In 1999 Internationals, Palestinians and Israelis for human rights threatened a boycott against Israel and that is what forced the Supreme Court to address the torture issue. They did not ban torture and the General Prosecutor can choose not to prosecute those who still use it." [Ala Jaradat, Director of ADAMEER [Arabic for Conscience] to this reporter, January 5, 2006, in Ramallah ]

Article 9 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights commands that, "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

On Christmas Eve 2004, Vanunu was arrested while in a taxi attempting to travel the few miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem to attend mass at the Church of The Nativity. Instead of going to church, he was hauled into jail and charged with; "attempting to leave the country."

Article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights acknowledges, 
"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

On February 22, 2006 in a Jerusalem court it was revealed that Israel had led Microsoft to hand over all the details of Vanunu's Hotmail account by alluding Vanunu was being investigated for espionage and before a court order had been obtained. 

Vanunu wrote: "Microsoft obeyed the orders and gave them all the details...three months before I was arrested and my computers were confiscated...it is strange to ask Microsoft to give this information before obtaining the court order to listen to my private conversations. It means they wanted to go through my emails in secret, or maybe, with the help of the secret services, the Shaback, Mossad." 

Attorney Michael Sfard repeatedly requested Police Representative Mr. Peterburg, to specifically state what type of espionage activity Vanunu was accused of.  According to Vanunu, "The policeman did not have any answers and said that he brought all the evidence to the court. When Sfard asked him again about any material related to the 'espionage' charge, Peterburg had no answers. 

"Sfard proved that the police had misled the judges who gave the orders to arrest me: to search my room, to go through my email, to confiscate my computers and that they misled Microsoft to believe they are helping in a case of espionage. The State came to the court with two special secret Government orders; Hisaion [documents or information that are deemed confidential by the government and kept from the court, the defendant, and lawyers.] This allows the prosecution to keep documents related to my court hearing secret. One was from the Minister for Interior Security and one from the Minister of Defense." 

Vanunu's secretly taped police interrogations, his 2004 Christmas Eve arrest for "attempting to leave the country" while traveling the four miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, the confiscation of his private property by thirty IDF that stormed into his room at St. George's Cathedral, according to Vanunu, have all "been done...under the false and misleading statements to the courts of 'suspicion of espionage', and yet they are not charging me with spy crimes... and the fact is that I have not committed any crimes."

==Support, awards, and honors==
The [[European Parliament]] has condemned Israel's treatment of Vanunu, and referred to his detention by Mossad agents as a gross violation of Italian [[sovereignty]] and international law. [[Amnesty International]] described his treatment as constituting "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment [...] such as is prohibited by [[International human rights instruments|international law]]."

Vanunu received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 1987, and was given an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Troms<U+00F8>]] in 2001. He was nominated by [[Joseph Rotblat]] for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] every year from 1988 to 2004. In 2005 he received the Peace Prize of the Norwegian People (''Folkets fredspris''). Previous recipients of this prize includes [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] (1991), [[Alva Myrdal]] (1982), [[Mairead Corrigan]] and [[Betty Williams (Northern Irish)|Betty Williams]]. The [[University of Troms<U+00F8>]] awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]] in 2000.

In September 2004, artist and musician [[Yoko Ono]] has given Mordechai Vanunu a peace prize founded in her late husband, [[John Lennon]]<U+2019>s memory.

In December 2004, as a statement of solidarity, he was elected by the students of the [[University of Glasgow]] to serve for three years as [[Rector of Glasgow University|Rector]]<ref> {{cite news
