'''''Super Collider''''' is the fourteenth studio album by American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Megadeth]]. It was released on June 4, 2013<ref name="ReleaseDate">{{cite web|title=Megadeth - New Album Street Date Revealed; Pre-Order Available|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/201066|work=Bravewords.com|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> and is Megadeth's first album to be released on frontman [[Dave Mustaine]]'s own label, Tradecraft,<ref name="LoudwireFeb12" /> after the band's split with [[Roadrunner Records]]. On April 23, 2013, the  title track was released on iTunes as the album's lead single.<ref name="SuperSingleBlab">{{cite web|title=Megadeth: 'Super Collider' Title Track To Be Released This Week - Apr. 21, 2013|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=189027|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> The album also features a guest appearance from [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] and [[Device (metal band)|Device]] vocalist [[David Draiman]].

The album debuted at number six on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="BWBKCharts">{{cite web|title=Megadeth - Super Collider Achieves Top 10 Chart Debuts In The US, Canada|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/205579|work=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref> making it the band's highest-charting album since 1994's ''[[Youthanasia]]''. As of November 2013, it has sold approximately 70,000 copies in the U.S.<ref name=Sales>{{cite web|title=Megadeth: Behind-The-Scenes Footage From Mexico Concert |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/megadeth-behind-the-scenes-footage-from-mexico-concert/|work=Blabbermouth.net|work=Roadrunner Records|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> The album received a largely negative response from critics and has a [[Metacritic]] rating of 38/100.

==Background, writing and recording==
On July 17, 2012, a [[Twitter|tweet]] from the Twitter account for Megadeth's mascot [[Vic Rattlehead]] implied that frontman [[Dave Mustaine]] had begun writing lyrics for a followup album to 2011's ''[[Thirteen (Megadeth album)|Thirteen]]''.<ref name="VicTweet">{{cite web|title=Twitter - Vic4Prez (Official page of Megadeth's Vic Rattlehead)|url=https://twitter.com/Vic4Prez/status/225399050692866049|work=Twitter.com|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', Mustaine confirmed that the band had been working on new material, commenting: "Some of it's a little darker, some of it's a little faster."<ref name="NMEInterview">{{cite web|title=Megadeth's Dave Mustaine: 'I'm totally ready for our next record'|url=http://www.nme.com/news/megadeth/64319|work=NME.com|publisher=NME|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>

Later Mustaine announced that the band was preparing to start work on the album, and suggested early 2013 as a tentative release, on a new label, as the band had split from their previous label, [[Roadrunner Records]].<ref name="AlexJonesInterview">{{cite web|title=Dave Mustaine: We Are in the Fight of Our Lives|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dpf9mxSFJQ|work=Youtube.com - TheAlexJonesChannel|publisher=[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Infowars.com]]|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> The band's previous contract with that label was only for three albums, expiring after the release of ''Thirteen''.<ref name="AucklandInterview">{{cite web | work=3News| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Megadeths-Dave-Mustaine---full-interview-/tabid/368/articleID/190363/Default.aspx| title= Megadeth's Dave Mustaine <U+2013> full interview <U+2013> Video|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>

On October 27, Mustaine revealed that the band was planning to enter the studio to begin [[music tracker|tracking]] the album in the first week of November 2012,<ref name="StartRecording">{{cite web|title=Megadeth To Start Recording New Album Next Week - Oct. 27, 2012|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=181445|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> before leaving the studio for the American leg of the ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' 20th anniversary tour. However, drummer Shawn Drover later suggested that recording for the album wouldn't begin until early 2013, and also suggested that the album would possibly be released in the summer of that year, rather than Mustaine's initial projection of a late-spring release. Drover said the band was in the process of composing material and determining what riffs to use on the record.<ref name="AtlanticCity">{{cite web|last=DiGiacomo|first=Robert|title=Megadeth Revisits 'Extinction': Heavy metal legends offer classic album in entirety at House of Blues on Friday night|url=http://www.atlanticcityinsiders.com/headliners/megadeth-revisits-extinction-heavy-metal-legends-offer-classic-album-in/article_0e9d896e-2d0f-11e2-a1f8-0019bb2963f4.html|work=Atlantic City Insider|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> On December 24, 2012, Mustaine announced that three new songs were "tracked and almost done".<ref name="BWBK24Dec">{{cite web|title=Megadeth - "Three Songs Tracked"|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/196017|work=Bravewords.com|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> Mustaine later announced via the Vic Rattlehead Twitter page that he had chosen a title and cover art for the new album,<ref name="VicTweet2">{{cite web|title=Twitter - Vic4Prez (Official page of Megadeth's Vic Rattlehead)|url=https://twitter.com/Vic4Prez/status/262638173845327872|work=Twitter.com|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> though neither was revealed at that time.

On February 12, 2013, the album's title was revealed as ''Super Collider''. About two weeks later, Mustaine announced several song titles in an interview, discussing some of those songs in the process. Mustaine also revealed that fourteen songs were being worked on in total.<ref name="ShockwavesInterview">{{cite web|title=''Shockwaves'' podcast, episode 64 (featuring an interview with Dave Mustaine)|url=http://www.hardradio.com/shockwaves/podcasts/podcast64.m4a|work=Hardradio.com|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> Recording for the album was completed in mid-March.<ref name="RecordingFinished">{{cite web|title=Megadeth Completes Recording New Album - Mar. 13, 2013|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=187419|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>

''Super Collider'' was released in several versions domestically. There are two versions of the CD: a standard edition and a [[Best Buy]]-exclusive edition which features three bonus tracks along with 3D cover art. Additionally, standard and limited vinyl editions were made available, as well.<ref name="Kingmaker" />

==Songs==
On April 23, 2013, "Super Collider" was released as the album's lead single through [[iTunes]].<ref name="SuperSingleBlab"/> Several days earlier, the track debuted on an edition of the ''[[Full Metal Jackie]]'' radio show.<ref name="SuperSingleLoud">{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Megadeth Unleash Title Track from Upcoming Album 'Super Collider'|url=http://loudwire.com/megadeth-title-track-super-collider/|work=Loudwire.com|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> A video was also produced for the song.<ref name="SCVideo">{{cite web|title=Megadeth Films 'Super Collider' Video - May 11, 2013|url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=189813|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> The track deviates from a more traditional metal in favor of a more radio-oriented rock sound,<ref name=SuperSingleLoud/> which Mustaine claims was done to show Universal that the band could write and play more commercially accessible material.<ref name=CRRInterview>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Jeb|title=Dave Mustaine of Megadeth: Stone Cold Sober & Sweating Bullets!|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_interview.php?id=985|work=Classic Rock Revisited|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> Mustaine also stated that while the track drew some inspiration from [[collider|particle colliders]] and the search for the "[[Higgs boson|God particle]]", the lyrical meaning was less scientific.<ref name="ShockwavesInterview" />

On May 18, 2013 "Kingmaker" was announced and released for streaming via YouTube.<ref name="Kingmaker">{{cite web|title=Megadeth: New Song 'Kingmaker' Available For Streaming - May 18, 2013|url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=190114|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> Mustaine has revealed that "Kingmaker" was written about [[analgesic|painkiller]] abuse and dependency.<ref name="ShockwavesInterview" /> He also said that he had altered the lyrics many times so they can "fit the intention" of the song.<ref name=CRRInterview/>

Mustaine has elaborated on the subject matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that "Forget to Remember" was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]''.  "The Blackest Crow" has a [[Southern rock|Southern]] influence and features a [[slide guitar]],<ref name="ShockwavesInterview" /> while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and made requests to [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Miranda Lambert]]; however, neither appeared on the song.<ref name="BlackestCrow">{{cite web|last=Childers|first=Chad|title=Megadeth Unveil Bluegrass-Twinged 'The Blackest Crow' and Guitar-Heavy 'Built for War'|url=http://loudwire.com/megadeth-the-blackest-crow-built-for-war/|work=Loudwire.com|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>  "Don't Turn Your Back..." was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as "the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help you look for it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Jason|title=Megadeth's Dave Mustaine: Believe It or Not, He's a Humanitarian|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/06/dave_mustaine_haiti_humanitarian.php|work=LAWeekly Blogs|publisher=LAWeekly|accessdate=5 June 2013}}</ref>

On October 8, 2013, "Built for War" was featured on an episode of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 5)|NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. According to Mustaine, the song is about arson.<ref name=BuiltForWar>{{cite web|title=Megadeth's 'Built for War' Featured in ''NCIS: Los Angeles'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/megadeths-built-for-war-featured-in-ncis-los-angeles/|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>

"[[Cold Sweat (Thin Lizzy song)|Cold Sweat]]" is a [[Thin Lizzy]] cover, originally appearing on ''[[Thunder and Lightning (album)|Thunder and Lightning]]'' (1983). Excluding bonus tracks, it is the first cover song to appear on a Megadeth album since "[[Anarchy in the UK]]", a  [[Sex Pistols]] cover, was included on ''[[So Far, So Good... So What!]]'' in 1988. According to Mustaine, he had been wanting to cover the song since the early 1990s.<ref name=CRRInterview/>

===Critical response===
The album met with mostly negative reception from music critics. Much of the criticism of the album centers around Mustaine's lyrics and/or vocals<ref name="ExclaimReview" /> and the return to more commercial-sounding material,<ref name="ExclaimReview" /> from the heavier approach that the band had taken on the last several releases. Some reviewers compared ''Super Collider'' to ''[[Risk (Megadeth album)|Risk]]'',<ref name="LoudwireReview">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/megadeth-super-collider-album-review/|title=Megadeth, 'Super Collider' - Album Review|work=[[Loudwire]]|first=Chad|last=Bowar|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="MSReview">{{cite web|title=Megadeth Super Collider Review|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=11838|work=Metal Storm|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> the band's much-critiqued 1999 studio effort which saw Mustaine attempting to take more commercial ''risks'' with the band's music. Many critics named "Kingmaker" as a highlight, even those who took a generally dismissive view of the rest of the album.

Positive comments did come from [[Allmusic]] reviewer James Christopher Monger and ''[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]]'' reviewer Mark Gromen. Monger commented that the album had a few good songs ("Kingmaker", "Built for War" and "The Blackest Crow"), but commented that the remainder of the album "is so mired in midtempo drudgery and familiar hard rock (not thrash) tropes that it never really connects", giving the album a 2.5/5 star rating.<ref name="AllmusicReview">{{cite web|last=Monger|first=James Christopher|title=Super Collider - Megadeth|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/super-collider-mw0002525169|work=Allmusic|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref> Gromen showed more sympathy towards the album, and commented that although it is more of a rock record than recent albums such as ''[[United Abominations]]'' or ''[[Endgame (Megadeth album)|Endgame]]'', he felt that one song, "Built for War", had a "''[[Rust in Peace]]'' feel." Gromen did criticize "Burn!" for having mundane lyrics.<ref name="BWBKReview">{{cite web|last=Gromen|first=Mark|title=Hardwares: Megadeth - Super Collider Reviewed|url=http://www.bravewords.com/hardwares/1002439|work=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref>

Another generally positive review came from ''[[Blabbermouth.net]]'' reviewer Ray Van Horn, Jr., who gave the album a 7.5/10 score despite noting that he felt the album had numerous flaws. Specific praise was directed at many of Ellefson's bass parts, as well as much of the guitar solo work on the album. Van Horn declared that the album is no ''Risk'' despite the insistence of other critics and fans, but expressed uncertainty as to which sonic direction the band might take in the future.<ref name="BlabReview">{{cite web|last=Van Horn|first=Ray Jr.|title=CD Reviews - Megadeth - Super Collider (Tradecraft/UMe)|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=2579|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref> Chad Bowar of ''[[Loudwire]]'' had a mixed overall opinion on the album and mainly criticized the album for being more akin to ''Risk'' and ''[[The World Needs a Hero]]'' than other recent albums. Bowar gave reserved praise for the tracks "Kingmaker" and the band's cover of "Cold Sweat".<ref name="LoudwireReview" />

Other reviewers generally took a more dismissive view of the album, and many of them gave the album a rating of around 5/10 or lower.<ref name="LanternReview">{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Patrick|title=Album review: 'Super Collider' causes Megadeth to become Megadead to fans|url=http://www.thelantern.com/a-e/album-review-super-collider-causes-megadeth-to-become-megadead-to-fans-1.3045588|work=[[The Lantern]]|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=MSReview/><ref name="PopMatters">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Dean|title=Megadeth: Super Collider|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/172404-megadeth-super-collider/|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=PopMatters|date=13 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="SpinReview">{{cite web|last=Eddy|first=Chuck|title=Megadeth, <U+2018>Super Collider<U+2019>|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/megadeth-super-collider-tradecraft-UME/|work=[[Spin (magazine){{!}}Spin.com]]|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> Greg Pratt of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' described much of the material on the album as being an attempt on Mustaine's part to both maintain credibility with his fanbase and score a radio hit at the same time, a result that Pratt concluded was impossible. Pratt took a negative view of several songs on the album, describing "Off the Edge" as "unlovable", "The Blackest Crow" as "an unfocused mess", and the title track as having a radio-oriented sound, much to his dislike. However, he did describe "Kingmaker" as "relentless", and commented that it sounded similar to material from ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' (1992).<ref name="ExclaimReview">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/megadeth-super_collider|title=Megadeth - Super Collider|work=[[Exclaim!]]|first=Greg|last=Pratt|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

===Commercial performance===
In spite of the lackluster reception by critics, ''Super Collider'' debuted at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 29,000 copies in the U.S. in its first week. Although it sold fewer copies than its predecessor ''[[Thirteen (Megadeth album)|Thirteen]]'' (42,000), it charted higher after the first week, as ''Thirteen'' debuted at number eleven. This makes the album Megadeth's highest-charting album in the U.S. since ''[[Youthanasia]]'', which peaked at number four in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Queens of the Stone Age Get First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1566508/queens-of-the-stone-age-get-first-no-1-album-on-billboard-200-chart|work=Billboard|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref> Five months after its release, U.S. sales for ''Super Collider'' stood at about 70,000 copies.<ref name=Sales/>
