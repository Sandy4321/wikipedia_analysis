'''Prince Georges V. Matchabelli''' or '''Giorgi Machabeli''' ({{lang-ka|<U+10D2><U+10D8><U+10DD><U+10E0><U+10D2><U+10D8> <U+10DB><U+10D0><U+10E9><U+10D0><U+10D1><U+10D4><U+10DA><U+10D8>}}) (July 23, 1885 - March 31, 1935) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] prince and diplomat, who fled [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]] and immigrated to the [[United States]] after the 1921 [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Bolshevik takeover of Georgia]]. 

Matchabelli was a member of the noble family of [[Machabeli]] from Georgia, then part of [[Imperial Russia]]. He was one of the founding members of the Georgian Liberation Committee organized in [[Berlin]] in 1914. The Committee intended to garner the [[German Empire|German]] support for Georgia's struggle for independence from the [[Russian Empire]].

In 1916 Matchabelli married [[Norina Matchabelli|Norina Gilli]] (born in Florence, Italy) who had become famous for her portrayal of "The Madonna" in [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt's]] unique 1911 pantomime spectacle play "[[Das Mirakel (play)|The Miracle]]." He briefly served as the ambassador of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] to [[Italy]]. With the establishment of Soviet rule in Georgia in 1921, Matchabelli fled his homeland and immigrated with his wife Norina to the [[United States]]. The prince was an amateur [[chemist]] and in 1924 he and his wife, now known as Princess Norina Matchabelli, established the [[Prince Matchabelli|Prince Matchabelli Perfume Company]]. Norina designed the crown shaped perfume vial in the likeness of the Matchabelli crown and in 1926 the scent "Ave Maria" was named for her. The company became known for color-coded, crown-shaped bottles that housed such classics as ''Wind Song'', ''Ave Maria'', and ''Princess Norina''. The Matchabellis divorced in 1933. <ref name="find">{{cite web| title=Georges Matchabelli| url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8553178| publisher=findagrave.com| date=24 March 2004| accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

From 1932 until his death, Matchabelli also served as President of the Georgian Association in the United States.<ref name="georgian">{{cite web| title=Georgian Association History| url=http://www.georgianassociation.org/History.asp| date=| accessdate=2011-04-26| publisher=GeorgianAssociation.org}}</ref> Georges died in 1935 and was buried in Mount Olive Cemetery in [[Queens]], [[New York]].<ref name="forgotten">{{cite web| title=Forgotten New York Tour of Maspeth| author=Kevin Walsh with Christina Wilkinson| work=Juniper Berry| url=http://www.junipercivic.com/historyArticle.asp?nid=46| publisher=Juniper Park Civic Association| date=19 November 2006| accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>  In 1936, Norina sold the company to perfume manufacturer Saul Ganz for $250,000. <ref name="nyt">{{cite news| work=New York Times| date=2 June 1986| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A0DE0D81E3BF931A35755C0A960948260| title=Man, 76, Is a Suicide; His Wife Is Near Death| publisher=nytimes.com| accessdate=2011-04-26|}}</ref>
