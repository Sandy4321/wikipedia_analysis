== Political career ==
Bj<U+00F6>rklund early became active in the [[Liberal Youth of Sweden]], the youth wing of the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]]. He served as chairman of the [[<U+00C4>lvsborg|Southern <U+00C4>lvsborg]] district in the early 1980s and as second deputy chairman of the organization from 1985 to 1987. He was elected to the board of the Liberal Party as a representative of the youth wing in 1987, and as an independent in 1990. Bj<U+00F6>rklund then engaged in Stockholm local politics and served as opposition councillor ({{lang-sv|oppositionsborgarr<U+00E5>d}}) in [[Stockholm Municipality]] from 1994 to 1998 and again from 2002 to 2006. From 1998 to 2002 he served as Stockholm [[Municipal Commissioner]] for Schools ({{lang-sv|skolborgarr<U+00E5>d}}).

Prior to both the [[Swedish general election, 2002|2002]] and [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]]s, Bj<U+00F6>rklund was chairman of the [[Alliance for Sweden|centre-right alliance]]'s working group on education policy.
