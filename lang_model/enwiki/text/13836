'''''Diabolus in Musica''''' is the seventh [[studio album]] by American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. Released on  [[June 9]], [[1998]], it is the second studio album to feature drummer [[Paul Bostaph]]. Although receiving mixed critical reviews, the album sold 46,000 copies in its first week to peak at number 31 on the [[Billboard 200]].

Guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] wrote most of the album's content which has been described as Slayer's most experimental album. The album's title is a Latin term for "The Devil's Music", a musical [[scale (music)|scale]] which was outlawed in the 1400s. Lyrical themes explored on the album include religion, deviants, death, maniacs, war, and serial killers.

==Writing and recording==
Slayer guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] described the writing process as, "When we were writing this album I was looking for something to beat; I wanted something to beat, but nothing impresses me right now. Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, so I just had to come up with my own shit."<ref name="Back And Black"/> The album was produced by [[Rick Rubin]] and was recorded at Oceanway Studios.<ref name="AlbumNotes">''Diabolus in Musica'' album notes, [[June 9]], [[1998]]. American Recordings.</ref>

Adrien Begrand of ''[[Popmatters]]'' felt Slayer introduced characteristics to its music including [[Guitar tunings|tuned down guitars]], murky [[chord]] structures, and churning beats.  He believed these characteristics were adopted with the growth of the burgeoning [[nu-metal]] scene.<ref name="The Devil in Music"/> Drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] claims the album is his favorite as he thought the album was "as experimental as Slayer got".<ref name=" PAUL BOSTAPH of Exodus, ex-Slayer  ">{{cite web

==Album title and lyrical themes==
''Diabolus in Musica'' is a Latin term for "The Devil's Music". It was a a musical [[scale (music)|scale]] which was outlawed by churches in the 1400s, as they believed it would bring out the devil in people<U+2014>pertaining to the scale's name. Although not sure if it was true, Slayer vocalist and bassist [[Tom Araya]] discovered that people were executed for writing and using the scale.<ref name="Back And Black">{{cite web

Araya held concern about the lyrics that King penned to "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's viewpoint was; "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist <U+2014> you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it <U+2014> I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's just a part of being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'"<ref>{{cite web| title = Slayer's King says Rick Rubin's collaboration with Metallica was a 'slap in the face' |author=|author=Bienstock, Richard| publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2006-07-01]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54475

Reviewing 2003 Slayer box set ''[[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse]]'', Adrien Begrand of ''[[PopMatters]]'' dubbed the album "a unique record, as Slayer adopts many of the characteristics of the burgeoning nu-metal scene (tuned down guitars, murky chord structures, churning beats), and incorporating it with their trademark sound. It's as if they're stepping in to show the young bands how to do it right, as songs like 'Bitter Peace', 'Death's Head', and the terrific 'Stain of Mind' blow away anything that young pretenders like Slipknot have put out."<ref name="The Devil in Music">{{cite web|title =The Devil in Music| author = Begrand, Adrien| publisher= Popmatters.com|date=2004-01-23|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/slayer-soundtrack.shtml|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> 

However, not all reviewers were so positive. Reviewing Slayer's 2001 album ''[[God Hates Us All]]'', [[Blabbermouth.net]] reviewer Borijov Krgin described ''Diabolus in Musica'' as "a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output."<ref name="Blabbermouth Review">{{cite web
