The '''Second Sino-Japanese War''' (July 7, 1937&nbsp;<U+2013> September 9, 1945), called so after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, was a military conflict fought primarily between the [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|Republic of China]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] from 1937 to 1941. China fought Japan with some economic help from Germany (see [[Sino-German cooperation (1911<U+2013>1941)|Sino-German cooperation]]), the Soviet Union (see [[Soviet Volunteer Group]]) and the United States (see [[American Volunteer Group]]). After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of [[World War II]] as a major front of what is broadly known as the [[Pacific War]]. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bix |first=Herbert P. |title=The Showa Emperor's 'Monologue' and the Problem of War Responsibility |journal=Journal of Japanese Studies |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1992 |pages=295<U+2013>363 |doi=10.2307/132824 }}</ref> It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937<U+2013>1941 period is taken into account.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The war was the result of a decades-long Japanese [[Imperialism|imperialist]] policy aiming to dominate China politically and militarily and to secure its vast raw material reserves and other economic resources, particularly food and labour. Before 1937, China and Japan fought in small, localized engagements, so-called "incidents". In 1931, the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan's [[Kwantung Army]] followed the [[Mukden Incident]]. The last of these incidents was the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 1937, marking the beginning of [[total war]] between the two countries.

Initially the Japanese scored major victories in [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai after heavy fighting]], and by the end of 1937 captured the Chinese capital of [[Nanking]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in [[Battle of Wuhan|Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] in the Chinese interior. By 1939 the war had reached [[stalemate]] after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]].  The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], which performed harassment and sabotage operations against the Japanese using guerrilla warfare tactics. On the 7th of December 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], and the following day (8<sup>th</sup> December) the United States declared war on Japan.  The United States began to aid China via airlift materiel over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]].  In 1944 Japan launched [[Operation Ichi-Go|a massive invasion]] and conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]], but eventually [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]] after [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet invasion]] of Japanese-held [[Manchuria]].

===Name===

In the Chinese language, the war is most commonly known as the War of Resistance Against Japan ({{zh
|t=<U+6297><U+65E5><U+6230><U+722D>
|s=<U+6297><U+65E5><U+6218><U+4E89>}}), and also known as the Eight Years' War of Resistance(<U+516B><U+5E74><U+6297><U+6218>/<U+516B><U+5E74><U+6297><U+6230>), simply War of Resistance (<U+6297><U+6218>/<U+6297><U+6230>), or Second Sino-Japanese War (<U+7B2C><U+4E8C><U+6B21><U+4E2D><U+65E5><U+6218><U+4E89>/<U+7B2C><U+4E8C><U+6B21><U+4E2D><U+65E5><U+6230><U+722D>).

In Japan, nowadays, the name {{Nihongo|"Japan<U+2013>China War"|<U+65E5><U+4E2D><U+6230><U+722D>|Nitch<U+016B> Sens<U+014D>}} is most commonly used because of its perceived objectivity. In Japan today, it is written as <U+65E5><U+4E2D><U+6226><U+4E89> in ''[[shinjitai]]''. When the invasion of [[China proper]] began in earnest in July 1937 near [[Beijing]], the [[Empire of Japan|government of Japan]] used {{Nihongo|"The North China Incident"|<U+5317><U+652F><U+4E8B><U+8B8A>/<U+83EF><U+5317><U+4E8B><U+8B8A>|Hokushi Jihen/Kahoku Jihen}}, and with the outbreak of the [[Battle of Shanghai]] the following month, it was changed to {{Nihongo|"The China Incident"|<U+652F><U+90A3><U+4E8B><U+8B8A>|[[Shina (word)|Shina]] Jihen}}.

The word {{Nihongo|"incident"|<U+4E8B><U+8B8A>|jihen}} was used by Japan, as neither country had made a formal [[declaration of war]]. Especially Japan wanted to avoid intervention by other countries, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum; the United States was also its biggest supplier of [[steel]]. If the fighting had been formally expressed that it had already escalated to "general war", [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] would have been legally obliged to impose an [[embargo]] on Japan in observance of the US [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]].

===Other names===
In [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|Japanese propaganda]], the invasion of China became a {{nihongo|"[[religious war|holy war]]"|<U+8056><U+6226>|seisen}}, the first step of the {{Nihongo3|eight corners of the world under one roof|<U+516B><U+7D18><U+4E00><U+5B87>|Hakk<U+014D> ichiu}}. In 1940, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] launched the [[Taisei Yokusankai]]. When both sides formally declared war in December 1941, the name was replaced by {{Nihongo|"[[Pacific War|Greater East Asia War]]"|<U+5927><U+6771><U+4E9E><U+6230><U+722D>|Dait<U+014D>a Sens<U+014D>}}.

Although the Japanese government still uses the term "China Incident" in formal documents{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, the word ''[[Shina (word)|Shina]]'' is considered derogatory by China and therefore the media in Japan often paraphrase with other expressions like {{Nihongo|"The Japan<U+2013>China Incident"|<U+65E5><U+83EF><U+4E8B><U+8B8A>|Nikka Jiken|<U+65E5><U+652F><U+4E8B><U+8B8A> ''Nisshi Jiken''}}, which were used by media as early as the 1930s.

The name "Second Sino-Japanese War" is not usually used in Japan, as the {{Nihongo|[[First Sino-Japanese War]]|<U+65E5><U+6E05><U+6226><U+4E89>|Nisshin<U+2013>Sens<U+014D>}} between Japan and the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1894 is not regarded as having obvious direct linkage to the second{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, between Japan and the [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|Republic of China]].

==Background==

===First Sino-Japanese War===
The origin of the Second Sino-Japanese War can be traced to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95, in which China, then under the [[Qing Dynasty]], was defeated by Japan and was forced to cede [[Formosa]], and to recognize the nominal independence (in fact, Japanese control) of Korea in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The Qing Dynasty was on the brink of collapse from internal revolts and foreign [[imperialism]], while Japan had emerged as a [[great power]] through its effective measures of [[modernization]].<ref>Wilson, Dick, When Tigers Fight: The story of the Sino-Japanese War, 1937<U+2013>1945, p.5</ref>

===The Republic of China===
The [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|Republic of China]] was founded in 1912, following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the Qing Dynasty. However, central authority disintegrated and the Republic's authority succumbed to that of [[Warlord era|regional warlords]]. Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.<ref>Wilson, Dick, p.4</ref> Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in an effort to wipe each other out. For example, the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] of [[Manchuria]] openly cooperated with the Japanese for military and economic assistance.<ref name="Foreign News: Revenge?-TIME-MAGAZINE">{{Cite news

|publisher=[[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]]
|date=13 August 1923}}</ref>

===Twenty-One Demands===
In 1915, Japan issued the ''[[Twenty-One Demands]]'' to extort further political and commercial privilege from China.<ref>Hoyt, Edwin P., Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict, p.45</ref> Following World War I, Japan acquired the [[German Empire]]'s [[sphere of influence]] in [[Shandong]]<ref>Palmer and Colton, A History of Modern World, p.725</ref> (Shantung), leading to nationwide anti-Japanese [[May Fourth Movement|protests and mass demonstrations]] in China, but China under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]] remained fragmented and unable to resist foreign incursions.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.33</ref> To unite China and eradicate regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] of 1926<U+2013>28.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.57</ref>

===Jinan Incident===
The Kuomintang's [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) swept through China until it was checked in Shandong, where Beiyang warlord [[Zhang Zongchang]], backed by the Japanese, attempted to stop the NRA's advance. This battle culminated in the [[Jinan Incident]] of 1928 in which the National Revolutionary Army and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were engaged in a short conflict that resulted in Kuomintang's withdrawal from Jinan.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.79, p.82</ref>

===Zhang Zuolin and Chiang Kai Shek===
In the same year, Zhang Zuolin was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] when he became less willing to cooperate with Japan.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol.1, p.121</ref> Afterwards Zhang's son [[Zhang Xueliang]] quickly took over control of Manchuria, and despite strong Japanese lobbying efforts to continue the resistance against the KMT, he soon [[Chinese reunification (1928)|declared his allegiance]] to the Kuomintang government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], which resulted in the nominal unification of China at the end of 1928.<ref>Taylor, Jay, p.83</ref>

===Communist Party of China===
In 1930, large-scale [[Central Plains War|civil war]] broke out between warlords who had fought in alliance with the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition and the central government under Chiang. In addition, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] (CCP, or Communist Party of China) revolted against the central government following a [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|purge of its members]] by the KMT in 1927. The Chinese government diverted much attention into fighting these civil wars, following a policy of "first internal pacification, then external resistance"({{zh icon}}:{{lang|zh-Hant| <U+6518><U+5916><U+5FC5><U+5148><U+5B89><U+5185>}}).

==Course of the war==

===Invasion of Manchuria, interventions in China===
{{anchor|occupation}}
 [[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during Mukden Incident]] [[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|right|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]

The chaotic situation in China provided excellent opportunities for Japanese expansionism. Japan saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the influence of many Western countries in [[Great Depression|Depression]] era [[tariff]]s), and as a protective [[buffer state]] against the Soviet Union in [[Siberia]].  [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] (<U+4E5D><U+4E00><U+516B><U+4E8B><U+8B8A>) in September 1931. After five months of fighting, the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] was established in 1932, with the last emperor of China, [[Puyi]], installed as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, and causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. [[Appeasement]] being the predominant policy of the day, no country was willing to take action against Japan beyond tepid censure.

Incessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought a battle known as the [[January 28 Incident]]. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the anti-Japanese [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies|volunteer armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.

In 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region, the [[Tanggu Truce]] taking place in its aftermath, giving Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japanese aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].

Japan increasingly exploited internal conflicts in China to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. This was precipitated by the fact that even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=<U+83EF><U+5317><U+7279><U+6B8A><U+5316>|p=h<U+00FA>ab<U+011B>it<U+00E8>sh<U+016B>h<U+00F9>a}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan Province|Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].

This Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He<U+2013>Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin<U+2013>Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei<U+2013>Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] (<U+8499><U+53E4><U+8ECD><U+653F><U+5E9C>) was formed on May 12, 1936, Japan providing all necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933<U+2013>1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].

===Full scale invasion of China===
[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|right|Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]]. More than 5000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939<ref>Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, 2001, p.364</ref>]]

On the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Lugou (or Marco Polo) bridge, a crucial access route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle, in which [[Battle of Beiping<U+2013>Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to  Japanese forces. The initial skirmishes at the bridge, known as the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], is recognized by most historians as the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo were initially reluctant to escalate the conflict into full scale war, being content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The KMT, however, determined that the "breaking point" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937<U+2013>1945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marines]] in Shanghai on August 13, 1937, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) had to commit over 200,000 troops, along with numerous naval vessels and aircraft, to capture the city. After more than three months of intense fighting, their casualties far exceeded initial expectations.<ref>Fu Jing-hui, An Introduction of Chinese and Foreign History of War, 2003, p.109<U+2013>111</ref>

Building on the hard won victory in Shanghai, the IJA captured the KMT capital city of [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) and [[Battle of Xinkou|Northern Shanxi]] by the end of 1937. These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese. Historians estimate up to 300,000 Chinese (mostly civilians) were [[mass murder]]ed and tortured in unspeakable methods and tens of thousands of women raped (themselves also slaughtered without mercy) during the notorious [[Nanking Massacre]] (also known as the "Rape of Nanking"), after the [[Battle of Nanking|fall of Nanking]] from December 13, 1937 to late January 1938; some Japanese [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Japanese war crimes|deny]] that the massacre occurred.

At the start of 1938, the leadership in Tokyo still hoped to limit the scope of the conflict to occupy areas around Shanghai, Nanjing and most of northern China. They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]]. Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deploy almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which by now was the political, economic and military center of China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) and forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.<ref>Ray Huang, Chiang Kai-shek Diary from a Macro History Perspective, 1994, p.168</ref> The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to pre-1937 borders.

With Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the air branches of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|navy]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.

From the beginning of 1939 the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939<U+2013>1940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], the NRA was defeated in this offensive. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.

After 1940 the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve its occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly [[Puppet state|puppet governments]] favourable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, the most prominent being the [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]] headed by former KMT premier [[Wang Jingwei]]. However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Japanese army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left them very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was the ability to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.

By 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and [[Vietnam]], but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas. Japan had suffered high casualties from unexpectedly stubborn Chinese resistance, and neither side could make any swift progress in a manner resembling the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] and Western Europe to [[Nazi Germany]].

===Chinese resistance strategy===

[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]

The basis of Chinese strategy before the entrance of Western Allies can be divided into two periods:

'''First Period''': 7 July 1937 ([[Marco Polo Bridge Incident|Battle of Lugou Bridge]])&nbsp;<U+2013> 25 October 1938 ([[Battle of Wuhan|Fall of Wuhan]]).

Unlike Japan, China was unprepared for [[total war]] and had little military-industrial strength, no [[Armoured warfare|mechanized divisions]], and few [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured forces]].<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/china_armour.html |title= Chinese Nationalist Armour in World War II |date=1999-2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941<U+2013>1942}}</ref> Up until the mid-1930s China had hoped that the [[League of Nations]] would provide countermeasures to Japan's aggression. In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: "''the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart''". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CCP was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.

Even under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand at [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.

Afterwards China began to adopt the strategy of "trading space for time" ({{zh icon}}: {{lang|zh-Hant|<U+4EE5><U+7A7A><U+9593><U+63DB><U+53D6><U+6642><U+9593>}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]],  Japanese advances began to stall in late 1938.

'''Second Period''': 25 October 1938 (Fall of Wuhan)&nbsp;<U+2013> December 1941 (before the Allies' [[declaration of war]] on Japan).

During this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible, thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy "winning by outlasting". The National Revolutionary Army adopted the concept of "magnetic warfare" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.

Local Chinese resistance forces, organised separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940 the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Japanese army and led them to employ the "[[Three Alls Policy]]" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|<U+4E09><U+5149><U+653F><U+7B56>}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S<U+0101>ngu<U+0101>ng Zh<U+00E8>ngc<U+00E8>'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank<U+014D> Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.

By 1941 Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had successfully retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities ("points and lines"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerillas roamed freely. This stalemate situation made a decisive victory seem impossible to the Japanese.

===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===

[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap.]]

After the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the "young marshal" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to "improvise" while not offering support.  After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing the [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.

On 12 December 1936 a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CCP. To secure the release of Chiang, the Kuomintang agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on 24 December, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CCP and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]. The CCP's Red Army fought with KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].

Despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled "collaborators" and attacked by CCP forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June, 1939.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.259</ref> Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.

Afterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CCP's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CCP power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CCP doctrine that came to be formalized as "[[Mao Zedong Thought]]". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CCP and fighting the Japanese at the same time<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news

===Foreign support for China===
{{See also|Motives of the Second Sino-Japanese War}}

[[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union provided aid to China at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. By 1940 the United States had become China's main diplomatic, financial and military supporter.<ref>Michael Schaller, ''The U. S. Crusade in China, 1938'' (1979)</ref>

====German support====
{{main|Sino-German cooperation (1911<U+2013>1941)}}
Prior to the outbreak of the war, Germany and China had close economic and military cooperation, with Germany helping China modernize its industry and military in exchange for raw materials. More than half of German arms exports during its rearmament period were to China. Nevertheless, the proposed 30 new [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army]] failed to materialize after Germany withdrew its support in 1938. By that time [[Adolf Hitler]] was forming an alliance with Japan against the Soviet Union.

====Soviet support====
[[File:Soviet volunteer.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] with Chinese insignia. I-16 was the main fighter plane used by the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] and [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet volunteers]].]]

After the signing of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] between Germany and Japan, the Soviet Union hoped to keep China in the war as a way of deterring the Japanese from invading [[Siberia]], thus saving itself from the threat of a [[two-front war]]. In September 1937, the Soviet leadership signed the [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] and approved [[Operation Zet]], the formation of a [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet volunteer air force]]. As part of this secret operation, Soviet technicians upgraded and ran some of China's transportation systems. [[Bomber]]s, [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]],  supplies and advisors arrived, including Soviet general [[Vasily Chuikov]], the future victor of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Prior to the entrance of the Western allies, the Russians provided the largest amount of foreign aid to China, totalling some $250 million in credits for munitions and other supplies. In April 1941, Soviet aid ended as a result of the [[Soviet<U+2013>Japanese Neutrality Pact]] and the beginning of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. This pact enabled the Soviet Union to avoid fighting against Germany and Japan at the same time. In total, 3,665 Soviet advisors and pilots served in China,<ref>Taylor, Jay, ''The Generalissimo'', p.156.</ref> and 227 of them died fighting there.<ref>http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_4.html</ref>

Japan lost a separate local confrontation with the Soviet Union at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in May - September 1939. The defeat left the Japanese army reluctant to fight the Soviets again.<ref>Douglas Varner, ''To the Banks of the Halha: The Nomohan Incident and the Northern Limits of the Japanese Empire'' (2008)</ref>

====Allied support====

[[File:REB-AVG-CHIT-1.jpg|thumb|200px|A "[[blood chit]]" issued to AVG pilots requesting all Chinese to offer rescue and protection.]]

From December 1937 events such as the [[Panay incident|Japanese attack on the USS ''Panay'']] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and [[French Third Republic|France]] to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to the [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|Republic of China]]. Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned [[iron ore]] exports in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/3~221 |title=Memorandum by Mr J.

At the same time, the U.S. government extended a trade agreement with Japan for six months, then fully restored it. Under the agreement, Japan purchased trucks for the Kwantung Army,<ref>US Congress.

Japan [[Invasion of French Indochina|invaded and occupied the northern part of French Indochina]] (present-day [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]]) in September 1940 to prevent China from receiving the 10,000 tons of materials delivered monthly by the Allies via the [[Haiphong<U+2013>Yunnan Fou Railway]] line.

On June 22, 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Notwithstanding non-aggression pacts or trade connections, Hitler's assault threw the world into a frenzy of re-aligning political outlooks and strategic prospects.

On July 21 Japan occupied the southern part of French Indochina (Southern Vietnam and Cambodia), contravening a 1940 "Gentlemen's Agreement" not to move into southern French Indochina. From bases in Cambodia and Southern Vietnam, Japanese planes could attack Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. As the Japanese occupation of Northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into Southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.

On 24 July 1941 Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the USA and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. This was a decisive moment in the Second Sino-Japanese war. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long term basis. It set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies, including the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

[[File:Flying Tigers Bite Back.ogg|thumb|right|US Air Forces video:Flying Tigers Bite Back]]
In mid-1941, the United States government financed the creation of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG), or [[Flying Tigers]], to replace the withdrawn Soviet volunteers and aircraft. Contrary to popular perception, the Flying Tigers did not enter actual combat until after the United States had declared war on Japan. Led by [[Claire Lee Chennault]], their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their shark painted [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]] fighters earned them wide recognition at a time when the Allies were suffering heavy losses, and soon afterwards their dogfighting tactics would be adopted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]].

===Entrance of Western Allies===

[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A U.S. poster advocating to help China fight on.]]

Within a few days of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], China formally declared war against Japan, Germany and Italy,<ref name="China Declares War">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> and almost immediately Chinese troops achieved another decisive victory in the [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|Battle of Changsha]], which earned the Chinese government much prestige from the Allies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China as the world's "[[Four Policemen]]", elevating the international status of China to an unprecedented height after a century of humiliation at the hands of various imperialist powers.

Chiang Kai-shek continued to receive supplies from the United States as the Chinese conflict was merged into the [[Pacific War|Asian theatre of World War II]]. However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan<U+2013>Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over "[[The Hump]]".

Most of China's own industry had already been captured or destroyed by Japan, and the Soviet Union refused to allow the United States to supply China through [[Kazakhstan]] into [[Xinjiang]] as the Xinjiang warlord [[Sheng Shicai]] had turned [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] in 1942 with Chiang's approval. For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of materiel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives in [[Battle of West Hubei|Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].

Chiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and Hans van de Ven) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, "Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243<U+2013>259.</ref>

Longstanding differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' "[[Europe first|Europe First]]" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in a 1942 meeting with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.299-300.</ref>

American and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China (Canadian-born Chinese having not yet been granted citizenship were trained by the British army). Employing their racial background as a disguise, their mandate was to blend in with local citizens and wage a campaign of sabotage. Activities focused on destruction of Japanese transportation of supplies (signaling bomber destruction of railroads, bridges).<ref>Roy MacLaren, 1981, p.200-220</ref>

The United States saw the Chinese theater as a means to tie up a large number of Japanese troops, as well as being a location for American airbases from which to strike the Japanese home islands. In 1944, with the Japanese position in the Pacific deteriorating rapidly, the IJA mobilized over 400,000 men and launched [[Operation Ichi-Go]], their largest offensive of World War II, to attack the American airbases in China and link up the railway between Manchuria and Vietnam. This brought major cities in Hunan, Henan and Guangxi under Japanese occupation. The failure of Chinese forces to defend these areas encouraged Stilwell to attempt to gain overall command of the Chinese army, and his subsequent showdown with Chiang led to his replacement by Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]].

By the end of 1944 [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese troops]] under the command of [[Sun Li-jen]] attacking from India, and those under [[Wei Lihuang]] attacking from [[Yunnan]], joined forces in [[Mong-Yu]], successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the [[Ledo Road]], China's vital supply artery.<ref>Ray Huang, 1994, p.420</ref> In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook [[Battle of West Hunan|Hunan]] and [[Second Guangxi Campaign|Guangxi]]. With the Chinese army progressing well in training and equipment, Wedemeyer planned to launch Operation Carbonado in summer 1945 to retake Guangdong, thus obtaining a coastal port, and from there drive northwards toward Shanghai. However, the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] hastened Japanese surrender and these plans were not put into action.

==Intrusion into French Indochina==
{{see also|Invasion of French Indochina|Second French Indochina Campaign}}
The Chinese [[Kuomintang]] also supported the Vietnamese [[Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang]] in its battle against French and Japanese imperialism.

In [[Guangxi]] Chinese military leaders were organizing Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army.<ref name="William J.

The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General [[Zhang Fakui]] created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese.

[[Franklin D.

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General [[Lu Han]] were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iF3MG43x--0C&pg=PA30&dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&hl=en&ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&f=false|title=America's war in Vietnam: a short narrative history|author=Larry H.

==Contemporaneous wars being fought by China==
The Chinese were not entirely devoting all their resources to the Japanese, because they were fighting several other wars at the same time.

The Soviet Union attacked the Republic of China in 1937 during the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. The Muslim General Ma Hushan of the Kuomintang [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] resisted the Soviet invasion, which was being led by Russian troops commanded by Muslim General [[Ma Zhanshan]], previously one of Chiang Kaishek's suboordinates.

General Ma Hushan was expecting some sort of help from Nanjing, as he exchanged messages with Chiang regarding Soviet attack. Both the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Xinjiang War erupting simultaneously rendered Chiang and Ma Hushan on their own to confront the Japanese and Soviet forces.

The Republic of China government was fully aware of the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang province, and Soviet troops moving around Xinjiang and Gansu, but was forced to mask these manoeuvers to the public as "Japanese propaganda" to avoid an international incident and for continued military supplies from the Soviets.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&dq=ma+hongkui+japanese+abolish+prince&q=soviet+border+japanese+proganda#v=onepage&q=soviet%20border%20japanese%20propaganda&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|isbn=0-415-58264-4|page=58|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

Because the pro-Soviet governor [[Sheng Shicai]] controlled [[Xinjiang]], which was garrisoned with Soviet troops in [[Turfan]], which bordered [[Gansu]], the Chinese government had to keep troops stationed there as well.

The Muslim General [[Ma Buqing]] was in virtual control of the [[Gansu]] corridor at this time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=DEZKTPtzgfvwBramnT8&ct=result&id=y3oeAAAAMAAJ&dq=salar+army++Ma+pu-fang&q=Ma+pu-fang|title=Asia, Volume 40|author=|year=1940|publisher=Asia Magazine|location=|page=|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because the Soviet threat was great, Chiang made some arrangements regarding Ma's position.

After Ma evacuated his positions in Gansu, Kuomintang troops from central China flooded the area, and infiltrated Soviet occupied Xinjiang, gradually reclaiming it and forcing Sheng Shicai to break with the Soviets. The Kuomintang ordered Ma Bufang several times to march his troops into Xinjiang to intimidate the pro-Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai. This helped provide protection for Chinese settling in Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvPUAAAAMAAJ&q=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&dq=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&hl=en&ei=S8q0TLCeFsH98Aa758nHCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA|title=A regional handbook on Northwest China, Volume 1|author=Human Relations Area Files, inc|year=1956|publisher=Printed by the Human Relations Area Files|location=|isbn=|page=74|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

The [[Ili Rebellion]] broke out in [[Xinjiang]] when the Kuomintang Chinese Muslim Officer [[Liu Bin-Di]] was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur Rebels in November 1944.

==Use of chemical and bacteriological weapons==

and a resolution adopted by the [[League of Nations]] on May 14, 1938, condemning the use of poison gas by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] frequently used chemical weapons during the war.

[[File:Japanese artillery soldiers with gas masks, Changsha, 1941.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Japanese troops stage a poison gas attack in China.]]
According to historians [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] himself, transmitted by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the [[Battle of Wuhan]] from August to October 1938.<ref>Y. Yoshimi and S. Matsuno, ''Dokugasusen Kankei Shiry<U+014D> II (Materials on poison gas warfare), Kaisetsu, H<U+014D>kan 2, Jugonen Sens<U+014D> Gokuhi Shiry<U+014D>shu'', 1997, p.27<U+2013>29</ref> They were also used during the [[Battle of Changde|invasion of Changde]].

Bix|Herbert Bix]], Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2001, p.360<U+2013>364</ref>

[[Biological warfare|Bacteriological weapons]] provided by [[Shir<U+014D> Ishii]]'s [[Unit 731|units]] were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed [[Ningbo]] with [[flea]]s carrying the [[bubonic plague]].<ref>''Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims'', [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html], http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/wwii.html, A time-line of World War II, Scaruffi Piero.

These attacks caused epidemic plague outbreaks.<ref>Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, pages 220<U+2013>221.</ref>

==Ethnic minorities==

Japan attempted to reach out to ethnic minorities to rally to their side, but only succeeded with certain [[Manchu]], [[Mongol]], and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] elements.

==Conclusion and aftermath==

===End of Pacific War and surrender of Japanese troops in China===
{{Main|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Japanese Instrument of Surrender}}

[[File:Japanese Surrender China 1945.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese troops surrendering to the Chinese.]]
[[File:Japanese Instrument of Surrender September 1945.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[China Expeditionary Army]] [[Yasuji Okamura]] presenting the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] to general [[He Yingqin]] at [[Nanjing]] on 9 September 1945]]

The [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] put an end to the Sino-Japanese War (and World War II) by attacking the Japanese with a new weapon (on America's part) and an incursion into Manchuria (on the Soviet Union's part). On August 6, an American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber, the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', dropped the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] used in combat on [[Hiroshima]], killing tens of thousands and leveling the city. On August 9, the Soviet Union renounced its [[Soviet<U+2013>Japanese Neutrality Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Japan and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|attacked the Japanese in Manchuria]], fulfilling its [[Yalta Conference]] pledge to attack the Japanese within three months after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]]. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups. On that same day, a second equally destructive atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on [[Nagasaki]].

In less than two weeks the [[Kwantung Army]], which was the primary Japanese fighting force,<ref>http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/glantz3/glantz3.asp</ref><ref>Robert A. Pape. Why Japan Surrendered. ''International Security'', Vol. 18, No. 2 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 154<U+2013>201</ref> consisting of over a million men but lacking in adequate armor, artillery, or air support, had been destroyed by the Soviets.  [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] officially [[Surrender of Japan|capitulated]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on August 15, 1945, and the official surrender was signed aboard the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} on September 2.

After the Allied victory in the Pacific, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding [[Manchuria]]), [[Formosa]] and [[French Indochina]] north of 16<U+00B0> north latitude to surrender to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.

===Post-war struggle and resumption of civil war===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
[[File:Liuchow 1945.jpg|right|thumb|The Chinese return to [[Liuzhou]] in July 1945]]
[[File:1946 Mao and Chiang.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] and Mao Zedong in 1946.]]

In 1945, [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|China]] emerged from the war nominally a great military power but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling [[inflation]], and by corruption in the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] government that included [[War profiteering|profiteering]], [[speculation]] and [[hoarding]].

Furthermore, as part of the [[Yalta Conference]], allowing a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[sphere of influence]] in [[Manchuria]], the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was [[Famine|starvation]] in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.

The problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At [[Yan'an]] and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, [[Mao Zedong]] was able to adapt [[Marxism<U+2013>Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.

The [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting [[guerrilla warfare]] in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organizational and [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]], the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.

Mao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Nationalist government after the war.

However, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Japanese army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out between the Nationalists and Communists following that, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.

===Peace treaty and Taiwan===
[[File:Taiwan Strait.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[Taiwan Strait]] and the island of [[Formosa]].]]
{{Main|Legal status of Taiwan}}
[[Formosa]] and the [[Penghu]] islands were put under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name="unhcr.org">[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples&nbsp;<U+2013> Taiwan : Overview] UNHCR</ref> The ROC proclaimed Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25, 1945. However, due to the unresolved [[Chinese Civil War]], neither the newly established [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in [[mainland China]] nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement.<ref>name="aao.sinica.edu.tw" [http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_e/Year2007/human12.pdf] Disputes over Taiwanese Sovereignty and the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty Since World War II</ref> Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.

In 1952, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was signed separately between the ROC and Japan that basically followed the same guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the [[Taiwanese people]] and the juridicial person should be the people and the juridicial person of the ROC.<ref name="unhcr.org"/> Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] which specifically accepted the [[Potsdam Declaration]] which refers to the [[Cairo Declaration]]. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.<ref>[http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=453676] FOCUS: Taiwan<U+2013>Japan ties back on shaky ground as Taipei snubs Tokyo envoy</ref>

===Aftermath===
[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place.]]

The question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.

In the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP or CPC), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/photo/2005-09/03/content_3439239.htm |title=<U+6297><U+6218><U+80DC><U+5229><U+5927><U+4E8B><U+8BB0>:<U+5171><U+4EA7><U+515A><U+6297><U+65E5><U+6B66><U+88C5><U+6218><U+53F2>[<U+7EC4><U+56FE>&#93; |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CCP has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CCP engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to "acknowledge" the Nationalists and the Communists as "equal" contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name="China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender<U+2014>New York Times">{{Cite news

Other scholars document quite a different view. Such studies find evidence that the Communists actually played a minuscule role in the war against the Japanese compared to the Nationalists, and preserved their strength for a final showdown with the Kuomintang (KMT).<ref>Chang and Ming, July 12, 2005, pg. 8; and Chang and Halliday, pg. 233, 246, 286<U+2013>287</ref> This view point gives the KMT credit for the brunt of the fighting, which is confirmed by Communists leader [[Zhou Enlai]]'s secret report to [[Joseph Stalin]] in January 1940. This report stated that out of more than one million Chinese soldiers killed or wounded since the war began in 1937, only 40,000 were from the Communists [[Eighth Route Army]] and [[New Fourth Army]]. In other words, by the CCP's own account, the Communists had suffered a mere three percent of total casualties half way into the war.<ref>Dallin and Firsov, Dimitrov and Stalin, pp.115, 120</ref>

This is because the Communists were not the main participants in any of the 22 major battles between China and Japan (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) and usually avoided open warfare (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions), preferring to fight in small squads to harass the Japanese supply lines. In comparison, right from the beginning of the war the Nationalists committed their best troops (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] from the Japanese, and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese and declared that the CCP should "save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, "The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32<U+2013>36</ref>

====Chinese/Japanese relations====
Today, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan. The war remains a major roadblock for [[People's Republic of China<U+2013>Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]], and many people, particularly in China, harbor grudges over the war and related issues.

Issues regarding the current historical outlook on the war exist. For example, the Japanese government has been accused of [[historical revisionism]] by allowing the approval of a few [[Japanese textbook controversy|school textbooks]] omitting or glossing over Japan's militant past, although the most recent controversial book, the ''New History Textbook'' was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan<ref>Sven Saaler: Politics, Memory and Public Opinion: The History Textbook Controversy and Japanese Society. Munich: 2005</ref> and despite the efforts of the Japanese nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the [[Nanking Massacre]], [[Unit 731]], and the [[comfort women]] of World War II, all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s841387.htm</ref>  In response to criticism of Japanese textbook revisionism, the PRC government has been accused of using the war to stir up already growing [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s in order to spur [[Chinese nationalism|nationalistic feelings]].

====Aftermath in Taiwan====
Traditionally, the [[Republic of China]] government has held celebrations marking the [[Victory Day]] on September 9 (now known as [[Armed Forces Day]]) and Taiwan's [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25.  However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2000|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war has been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.

Meanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.

===Japanese casualties===
Contemporary studies from the Beijing Central Compilation and Translation Press have revealed that the Japanese suffered a total of 2,227,200 casualties, including 1,055,000 dead and 1,172,000 injured. These numbers were largely based on Japanese statistics.<ref name="Press"/>

The Japanese recorded around 1.1 to 1.9 million military casualties during all of World War II (which include killed, wounded and missing). The official death-toll of Japanese KIA in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000 men. The combined Chinese forces claimed to have killed at most 1.77 million Japanese soldiers during the eight-year war.

Another source from Hilary Conroy claim that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of the 1,130,000 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers who died during World War II, 39 percent died in China.<ref name="Coox pp. 308"/>

Then in "War Without Mercy", John Dower claim that a total of 396,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers. Another 54,000 soldiers also died after the war had ended, mostly from illness and starvation.<ref name="Coox pp. 308">ed. Coox, Alvin and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 308.</ref> Of the 1,740,955 Japanese soldiers who died during World War II, 22 percent died in China.<ref>Dower, John ''War Without Mercy'', pp. 297.</ref>

Current Japanese statistics, however, lack complete estimates for the wounded. From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 393,000 were killed in China and 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940. Chinese forces also report that by May 1945, 22,293 Japanese soldiers were captured as prisoners. Many more Japanese soldiers surrendered when the war ended.<ref name="Coox pp. 308"/><ref>Dower, John ''War Without Mercy'', pp. 297</ref>

Both Nationalist and Communist Chinese sources report that their respective forces were responsible for the deaths of over 1.7 million Japanese soldiers.<ref name="ReferenceA">Chung Wu Taipei "History of the Sino-Japanese war (1937<U+2013>1945)" 1972 pp 565</ref> The Communist claim, which almost equate total Japanese deaths in all of World War II, was ridiculed by Nationalist authorities as propaganda since the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] was outnumbered by the Japanese Army by approximately 3 to 1. Nationalist War Minister [[He Yingqin]] himself contested the claim, finding it impossible for a force of "untrained, undisciplined, poorly equipped" guerrillas to have killed so many enemy soldiers.<ref>ed. Coox, Alvin and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 296.</ref>

The National Chinese authorities ridiculed Japanese estimates of Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true amount of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=riuRTN_fKcT6lwfU3tXjAQ&ct=result&id=6Rknr9XSMggC&dq=was+ridiculed+by+Nationalist+authorities+as+japanese&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald|title=China monthly review, Volume 95|author=|year=1940|publisher=Millard Publishing Co.|page=187|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks%3A1&q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=google search of the source |publisher=Google.com |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks%3A1&q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald+cheat+the+japanese+people&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=(source continued) |publisher=Google.com |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>

====National Revolutionary Army====
{{Main|National Revolutionary Army}}
[[File:Republic of China Army Flag.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[National Revolutionary Army]].]]

With Chiang Kai-shek as the highest commander, the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) is recognized as the unified armed force of China during the war. Throughout its lifespan, it employed approximately 4,300,000 regulars, in 370 [[Division (military)|Standard Divisions]] ({{zh|t=<U+6B63><U+5F0F><U+5E2B>}}), 46 New Divisions ({{zh|t=<U+65B0><U+7DE8><U+5E2B>}}), 12 [[Cavalry|Cavalry Divisions]] ({{zh|t=<U+9A0E><U+5175><U+5E2B>}}), eight New Cavalry Divisions ({{zh|t=<U+65B0><U+7DE8><U+9A0E><U+5175><U+5E2B>}}), 66 Temporary Divisions ({{zh|t=<U+66AB><U+7DE8><U+5E2B>}}), and 13 [[Military reserve force|Reserve Divisions]] ({{zh|t=<U+9810><U+5099><U+5E2B>}}), for a grand total of 515 divisions.

However, many divisions were formed from two or more other divisions, and many were not active at the same time. The number of active divisions, at the start of the war in 1937, was about 170 NRA divisions. The average NRA division had 4,000<U+2013>5,000 troops. A Chinese army was roughly the equivalent to a Japanese division in terms of manpower but the Chinese forces largely lacked artillery, heavy weapons, and motorized transport.

The shortage of military hardware meant that three to four Chinese armies had the firepower of only one Japanese division. Because of these material constraints, available artillery and heavy weapons were usually assigned to specialist brigades rather than to the general division, which caused more problems as the Chinese command structure lacked precise coordination. The relative fighting strength of a Chinese division was even weaker when relative capacity in aspects of warfare, such as [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[logistics]], [[Military communications|communications]], and medical services, are taken into account.

Although Chiang Kai-shek is recognized as the highest commander in name, his power on NRA was in the effect limited. This was due to NRA was an alliance of powers such as warlords, regional militarists and communists. Before the alliance was formed under the pressure of Japanese invasion, these powers had their own land, struggled or allied with each other under their own interests and mutual conflicts were common. Because of this, NRA could be unofficially divided into 3 groups, Central Army, Regional Army and Communist forces.

Loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, the Central Army({{zh|t=<U+4E2D><U+592E><U+8ECD>}}) was best equipped. Most of officers in Central Army were trained by the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], where Chiang Kai-shek served as the first president. Before the war, the Central Army mainly controlled east China.

The Regional Army({{zh|t=<U+7701><U+8ECD>}}) consisted of various types of strengths from all the parts of China. Before the war, these strengths governed certain places and most of them admitted Chiang Kai-shek's leader position. However, they didn't really follow Chiang's command, nor receive Chiang's assist. They generally ran independently. The notable strengths under this category included [[New Guangxi clique|Guangxi]], [[Shanxi clique|Shanxi]], [[Yunnan clique|Yunnan]] and [[Ma clique]].

After [[Xi'an Incident]], Chiang paused his invasion to Chinese Red Army led by communists. Communists incorporated into NRA and formed [[Eighth Route Army]] and [[New Fourth Army]] of NRA. Although during the entire war communists fought under the name of NRA, their de facto commander was [[Mao Zedong]]. Communists also led a large number of militias during the war.<ref name="Horner2003"/>

The National Revolutionary Army expanded from about 1.2 million in 1937 to 5.7 million in August 1945, organized in 300 divisions.<ref name="Horner2003">{{cite book|author=David Murray Horner|title=The Second World War: The Pacific|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DShPzguQ64UC&pg=PA14|accessdate=6 March 2011|date=24 July 2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-96845-4|pages=14<U+2013>15}}</ref>

===Japanese forces===

====Imperial Japanese Army====
{{Main|Imperial Japanese Army}}
[[File:War flag of the Imperial Japanese Army.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].]]

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had approximately 3,200,000 regulars. More Japanese troops were quartered in China than deployed elsewhere in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] during the war. Japanese divisions ranged from 20,000 men in its divisions numbered less than 100, to 10,000 men in divisions numbered greater than 100.

At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the IJA had 51 divisions, of which 35 were in China, and 39 independent brigades, of which all but one were in China. This represented roughly 80% of the IJA's manpower.

By October 1944 the IJA in China was divided into three strategic groupings. 
* The China Expeditionary Army was dislocated along the coast. Its primary component was the 13th Army with four divisions and two brigades.
* The North China Area Army occupied the north-eastern China. It included the Kwantung Army with two divisions and six brigades, the Mongolian Garrison Army with one division and one brigade, and the 1st Army with two divisions and six brigades.
* The Sixth Area Army occupying the inland zone south of the Yellow River included: the 12th Army with four divisions, including one armoured, and one infantry brigade; 34th Army with one division and four brigades along the Yangtze valley; 11th Army with ten divisions; 23rd Army with two divisions and five brigades.

====Collaborationist Chinese Army====
{{Main|Collaborationist Chinese Army}}
The Chinese armies allied to Japan had only 78,000 people in 1938, but had grown to around 649,640 men by 1943,<ref>Jowett, Phillip, Rays of the Rising Sun, pg.130<U+2013>133.</ref> and reached a maximum strength of 900,000 troops before the end of the war. Almost all of them belonged to [[Manchukuo]], [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] ([[Beijing]]), [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] ([[Nanjing]]) and the later Nanjing Nationalist Government ([[Wang Jingwei regime]]). These collaborator troops were mainly assigned to garrison and logistics duties in their own territories, and were rarely fielded in combat because of low morale and Japanese distrust. They fared very poorly in skirmishes against both Chinese NRA and Communist forces.

==Military equipment==

===National Revolutionary Army===
{{See also|Development of Chinese armoured forces (1927<U+2013>1945)|List of aircraft used in China before 1937|Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937<U+2013>1945)|List of World War II firearms of China}}

The Central Army possessed 80 Army infantry divisions with approximately 8,000 men each, nine independent [[brigade]]s, nine cavalry divisions, two [[Artillery|artillery brigades]], 16 artillery [[regiment]]s and three armored battalions. The [[Republic of China Navy|Chinese Navy]] displaced only 59,000 tonnes and the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] comprised only about 700 obsolete aircraft.

For regular provincial Chinese divisions their standard rifles were the [[Hanyang 88]] (copy of [[Gewehr 88]]). Central army divisions were typically equipped with the [[Chiang Kai-Shek rifle]] (copy of [[Gewehr 98|Mauser Standard Model]]) and Czechoslovakian [[vz. 24]]. However, for most of the German-trained divisions, the standard firearms were German-made [[8 mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Karabiner 98k]]. The standard [[light machine gun]] was a local copy of the Czech [[8 mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[Brno ZB26]]. There were also Belgian and French light machine guns. Provincial units generally did not possess any machine guns. Central Army units had one LMG per platoon on average. German-trained divisions ideally had 1 LMG per squad. Surprisingly, the NRA did not purchase any [[MG 34|Maschinengewehr 34]]s from [[Germany]], but did produce their own copies of them. [[Heavy machine gun]]s were mainly locally-made Type 24 [[water-cooled]] [[Maxim gun]]s, which were the Chinese copies of the German [[MG08]], and [[M1917 Browning machine gun]]s chambered for the standard 8mm Mauser round. On average, every Central Army [[battalion]] would get one heavy machine gun (about a third to half of what actual German divisions got during [[World War II]]). The standard weapon for NCOs and officers was the [[7 mm caliber|7.63 mm]] [[Mauser C96]] [[semi-automatic pistol]], or [[full-automatic]] [[Mauser M1932]]/M712 [[machine pistol]]. These full-automatic versions were used as substitutes for submachine guns (such as the [[MP18]]) and rifles that were in short supply within the Chinese army prior to the end of World War II. Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War, particularly in the early years, the NRA also extensively used captured Japanese weapons and equipment as their own were in short supply. Some <U+00E9>lite units also used Lend-Lease US equipment as the war progressed.

Generally speaking, the regular provincial army divisions did not possess any artillery. However, some Central Army divisions were equipped with 37&nbsp;mm [[PaK 35/36]] [[anti-tank gun]]s, and/or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s from [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], [[Madsen]], and [[Solothurn S-18/100|Solothurn]]. Each infantry division had 6 French [[Edgar Brandt|Brandt]] 81&nbsp;mm mortars and 6 Solothurn 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]]s. Some independent brigades and artillery regiments were equipped with [[Bofors]] [[72 mm L/14]], or [[Krupp]] 72&nbsp;mm [[L/29]] [[mountain gun]]s and there were 24 [[Rheinmetall]] 150&nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/32 sFH 18]] [[howitzer]]s (bought in 1934) and 24 Krupp 150&nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/30 sFH 18]] howitzers (bought in 1936). At the start of the war, the NRA and the Tax Police Regiment had three tank battalions armed with German [[Panzer I]] light tanks and [[L3/33|CV-33]] tankettes. After defeat in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] the remaining tanks, together with several hundred [[T-26]] and [[BT-5]] tanks acquired from the Soviet Union were reorganised into the 200th Division.

Infantry uniforms were basically redesigned [[Zhongshan suit]]s. [[Puttee]]s were standard for soldiers and officers alike since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn field caps. The helmets were the most distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German [[Stahlhelm#M1935.2F1940|M35]] helmets (standard issue for the Wehrmacht until late in the European theatre) rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, each with the [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]] emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both elite German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets include the [[Adrian helmet]], [[Brodie helmet]] and later [[M1 helmet]]. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition, ammunition pouches or harness, a [[hip flask|water flask]], [[combat knife|combat knives]], food bag, and a [[gas mask]].

On the other hand, warlord forces varied greatly in terms of equipment and training. Some warlord troops were notoriously under-equipped, such as [[Shanxi]]'s [[Dadao]] (<U+5927><U+5200>, a one-edged sword type close combat weapon) Team and the [[Yunnan clique]]. Some, however, were highly professional forces with their own air force and navies. The quality of the [[New Guangxi clique]] was almost on par with the Central Army, as the [[Guangzhou]] region was wealthy and the local army could afford foreign instructors and arms. The Muslim [[Ma clique]] to the northwest was famed for its well-trained [[cavalry]] divisions.

===Imperial Japanese Army===
{{See also|List of Japanese infantry weapons used in the Second-Sino Japanese War|List of armour used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War|List of Japanese aircraft in use during the Second Sino-Japanese War}}
Although Japan possessed significant mobile operational capacity, it did not possess capability for maintaining a long sustained war. At the beginning of the war, the Imperial Japanese Army comprised 17 divisions, each composed of approximately 22,000 men, 5,800 horses, 9,500 rifles and [[submachine gun]]s, 600 heavy machine guns of assorted types, 108 artillery pieces, and 600 plus of light armor two-men tanks. [[Special forces]] were also available. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] displaced a total of 1,900,000 tonnes, ranking third in the world, and possessed 2,700 aircraft at the time. Each Japanese division was the equivalent in fighting strength of four Chinese regular divisions (at the beginning of the [[Battle of Shanghai]]).
