==Appearances==
He lives in Kermit's mansion, working as a valet or manservant to [[Kermit the Frog]] after the break up of the Muppets. '80s Robot also functions as a chauffeur, and uses his databanks and search engine to locate the Muppet troupe. As his name implies, the character resembles the many robots who dominated the toy, novelty, and pop culture landscape in the 1980s. He uses slang from the era, and offers such beverages as [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] and [[New Coke]]. '80s Robot is said to bear an uncanny resemblance to [[Omnibot]] 2000, a robot toy made by [[Tomy]] in the 1980s.<ref>Wright, Blake.
