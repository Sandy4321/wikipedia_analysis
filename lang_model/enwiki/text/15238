The '''fourth metacarpal bone''' ('''metacarpal bone of the ring finger''') is shorter and smaller than the third. 

The base is small and quadrilateral; its superior surface presents two facets, a large one medially for articulation with the [[hamate]], and a small one laterally for the [[capitate]]. 

On the radial side are two oval facets, for articulation with the [[third metacarpal]]; and on the ulnar side a single concave facet, for the [[fifth metacarpal]].

==Clinical relevance==
A shortend fourth metacarspal bone can be a [[symptom]] of [[Kallmann syndrome]], a [[Heredity|genetic]] condition which results in the failure to commence or the non-completion of [[puberty]].
A short fourth metacarpal bone can also be found in [[ Turner syndrome]], a disorder involving sex chromosomes.

A [[Bone fracture|fracture]] of the fourth and/or [[fifth metacarpal bone]]s transverse neck secondary due to axial loading is known as a [[boxer's fracture]].<ref name = "ERS">Shultz, S.

==Ossification==
The ossification process begins in the shaft during prenatal life, and in the head between 11th and 37th months<ref name=Ajay>{{cite journal|last=Balachandran|first=Ajay|author2=Anooj Krishna|author3= Moumitha Kartha|author4= Libu G.
