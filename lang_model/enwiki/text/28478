'''MV ''Polarbj<U+00F8>rn''''' is a Norwegian [[icebreaker]] built in 2001. From April 2011, she has been chartered to the [[Royal Navy]] as the ice patrol ship '''HMS ''Protector'''''. She was commissioned into the Navy on 23 June 2011.<ref>[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/news-and-events/new_ice_patrol_ship_.htm Royal Navy] New Ice Patrol Ship</ref> Previously she operated under charter as a polar research and a subsea support vessel.

==Layout==
''Polarbj<U+00F8>rn'' was designed for long Antarctic expeditions and for supporting subsea work.<ref name="rieber">{{cite web| url=http://www.rieber-shipping.no/?page=69&show=364| title=Polarbj<U+00F8>rn| publisher=GC Rieber Shipping| accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> She is equipped to [[dynamic positioning|DP2 class]]<ref name="rieber"/> and has accommodation for 100. Large cargo holds and open deck areas provide storage capacity for [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] and related equipment. A 50-ton knuckle-boom crane and the 25-ton stern A-frame allow equipment to be deployed over the side and over the stern. Prior to the Royal Navy charter, she underwent a ten-day refit in Odense, Denmark. The helipad, originally above her bridge, was repositioned over the stern.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ukarmedforcescommentary.blogspot.com/2011/05/and-here-is-hms-protector.html| title=And here is HMS Protector| publisher=UK Armed Forces Commentary| date=20 May 2011| accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>

==Service==
''Polarbj<U+00F8>rn'' worked in the "spot" market, on short-term charter. During 2009, the vessel was chartered for [[Exploration geophysics|electromagnetic survey]] work in the [[North Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scandoil.com/moxie-bm2/news/spot_news/gc-rieber-subsea-ship-orders-mark-acceptance.shtml| title=GC Rieber subsea ship orders mark "acceptance"| date=16 January 2009| publisher=Scandinavian Oil-Gas Online| accessdate=27 February  2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverpetroleum.com/int/news-archive/petromarker-electromagnetic-em-campaign| title=PetroMarker electromagnetic (EM) campaign| date=20 July 2009| publisher=Discover Petroleum| accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> She was exposed to a downturn in business during 2010, with only a 33% utilisation.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://presentator.s3.amazonaws.com/gcrieber/6386fe00838a4fe99b66a581fd9b26a1/view.html| title=Fourth Quarter 2010 Presentation| format=webcast| publisher=GC Rieber Shipping ASA| accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>

''Polarbj<U+00F8>rn'' has been chartered to the [[Royal Navy]]<ref name="rieber"/> for three years from April 2011 as a temporary replacement for the ice patrol ship, {{HMS|Endurance|A171|6}}, and she has been renamed {{HMS|Protector}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/hms_protector_will_be_endurance_replacement_1_2358055| title=HMS Protector will be Endurance replacement| date=7 January 2011| publisher=The News (Portsmouth)| accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Replacement for HMS Endurance announced|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/ReplacementForHmsEnduranceAnnounced.htm|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=5 April 2011|date=25 March 2011}}</ref> Following her charter, she underwent a brief refit to ready her for her role within the Royal Navy; the main work involved the repositioning of the flight deck from the top of the superstructure to the stern, the installation of a multi-beam echo sounder for survey work, an overhaul of the engines and gearboxes, armament, and the carriage of the ancilliary vessels and vehicles (survey boats, all-terrain vehicles) used in support of the [[British Antarctic Survey]].<ref>[http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2011/05/hms-protector-ready/ HMS ''Protector'' ready] - Think Defence, 26/05/11</ref> During September 2011, ''Protector'' embarked on operational sea training in preparation for her first deployment in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/antarctic-patrol-ship/hms-endurance/news/protector_prepares_f.htm|title=''Protector'' prepares for her maiden mission|publisher=Royal Navy|date=1 September 2011|accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>
