==History==
Some time near the beginning of the twentieth century, Grosse Ile Township constructed a hand-operated [[swing bridge]] at the intersection of Park Road (now Parke Lane) with the Thorofare Canal.<ref name = "state">{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154_11188-28900--,00.html|title=Parke Lane Rd. / Thorofare Canal  Bridge|publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation|accessdate= July 8, 2010}}</ref>  However, by 1929, the old bridge was deteriorating<ref name = "state1">{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/18572.htm|title=Parke Lane Road Bridge |publisher= Michigan State Housing Development Authority|accessdate= July 8, 2010}}</ref> and the increasing volume of traffic and weight of vehicles had rendered the lightweight swing bridge obsolete.  In 1929/1930, the Wayne County Road Commission replaced the old bridge with a concrete cantilevered-arch span.<ref name = "state"/>

==Description==
The Parke Lane Road <U+2013> Thorofare Canal Bridge is 99 feet long, with span length of 51 feet and width of 36 feet.<ref name = "state1"/>  The bridge itself is of a rare [[Cantilever bridge|cantilevered]] concrete arch design.<ref name = "hb">{{cite web|title=Parke Lane Bridge |publisher = HistoricBridges.org|url=http://www.historicbridges.org/michigan/parke/|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> The traditional [[arch bridge]] design requires a complete arch; in contrast, the cantilevered arch design is divided into two structurally independent half-arches which are each cantilevered from one side.<ref name = "hb"/>  A slab is suspended between the two cantilevered sections; in the Parke Lane Road <U+2013> Thorofare Canal Bridge, this section is 18 feet long.<ref name = "hb"/>  Close inspection of side walls of the bridge reveals two seams marking the end of the cantilevered arms.<ref name = "hb"/>

A concrete [[balustrade]] with urn-shaped spindles runs along each side of the roadway, terminating at each end in an octagonal lamp stand.<ref name = "state1"/>  Orange pebble aggregate is included in the spindle concrete mix for color and texture.<ref name = "state1"/>

==Significance==
This bridge is significant as an outstanding product of the Wayne County Road Commission's bridge engineers because of its aesthetically pleasing design matched to the surroundings and as a representative of the unusual concrete cantilevered-arch construction.<ref name = "state"/>
