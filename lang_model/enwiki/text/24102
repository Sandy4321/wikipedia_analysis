The statue of '''''Laoco<U+00F6>n and His Sons''''' ({{lang-it|Gruppo del Laocoonte}}), also called the '''''Laoco<U+00F6>n Group''''', has been one of the most famous ancient sculptures ever since it was excavated in Rome in 1506 and placed on public display in the Vatican, where it remains.  Exceptionally, it appears to be identifiable with a statue praised in the highest terms by the main Roman writer on art, [[Pliny the Elder]].  The group are near life-size and the work is a little over 2m in height<ref name=Janson>[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames & Hudson]], p. 159. ISBN 0500237018</ref><ref name=HF>[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 196. ISBN 9781856695848</ref> and shows the Trojan priest [[Laoco<U+00F6>n]] and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being strangled by sea serpents.

Pliny gives the work to three Greek sculptors from the island of [[Rhodes]]: [[Agesander of Rhodes|Agesander]], [[Athenodoros of Kleitor|Athenodoros]] and [[Polydorus (sculptor)|Polydorus]], but does not give a date or patron.  In style it is "one of the finest examples of the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] baroque" and certainly in the Greek tradition,<ref>Boardman, 199</ref> but it is not known whether it is an original work or a copy of an earlier sculpture, or made for a Greek or Roman commission, although it is now usually seen as a copy made in the early Imperial period.<ref>Clark, 219-221 was an early proponent of this view; see also Barkan, caption opp. p 1, Janson etc</ref>  Various dates have been suggested for the statue, ranging from about 200 BC to 60 AD.<ref>Boardman, 199 says "about 200 BC"; Spivey feels it may have been commissioned by Titus.</ref> Inscriptions found at [[Lindos]] in Rhodes date Agesander and Athenedoros to a period after 42 BC, making the years 42 to 20 BC perhaps the most likely date for the Laoco<U+00F6>n statue's creation.<ref>Stewart, Andrew W. (1996), "Hagesander, Athanodorus and Polydorus", in Hornblower, Simon, Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> 

==Subject==
Though not mentioned by [[Homer]], the story of Laoco<U+00F6>n had been the subject of a tragedy, now lost, by [[Sophocles]] and was mentioned by other Greek writers. Laoco<U+00F6>n was a Trojan priest of [[Poseidon]] who was killed with both his sons after attempting to expose the ruse of the [[Trojan Horse]] by striking it with a spear. Alternatively he was killed for having had sex with his wife in the temple of Poseidon.  In most versions, the snakes were sent by [[Poseidon]]<ref>William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', Taylor and Walton, 1846, p. 776</ref> although Athena or Apollo were credited in some versions, and were interpreted by the Trojans as proof that the horse was a sacred object. The most famous account of these events is in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see the ''Aeneid'' quotation at the entry [[Laoco<U+00F6>n]]), but this dates from between 29 and 19 BC, which is very possibly later than the sculpture.

==History==
The figure of [[Alcyoneus]] on the [[Pergamon Altar]] (dated ca 180-160 BC) is shown in a pose and situation (including serpents) which is very similar to those of Laoco<U+00F6>n in the sculpture group. It has been suggested that the three Rhodians were copyists, possibly of a [[bronze sculpture]] from [[Pergamon]], created around 200 BC.<ref>Stewart, Andrew W. (1996), "Hagesander, Athanodorus and Polydorus", in Hornblower, Simon, Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> Pliny in his ''Natural History'' (XXXVI, 37) states that it was located in the palace of the emperor [[Titus]], and it is possible that it remained in the same place until 1506 (see "Findspot" section below). He also asserts that it was carved from a single piece of marble, though when found it was discovered to comprise seven interlocking pieces.<ref>Richard Brilliant, ''My Laoco<U+00F6>n - alternative claims in the interpretation of artworks'',  University of California Press, 2000, p.29</ref><ref name="OCD">{{Citation  | last = Rose  | first = Herbert Jennings  | author-link =   | contribution = Laoco<U+00F6>n  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url = }}</ref>

The statue was probably originally commissioned for the home of a wealthy Roman. It was unearthed in 1506 in the vineyard of Felice De Fredis; informed of the fact, [[Pope Julius II]], an enthusiastic classicist, acquired and placed it in the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere Garden]] at the Vatican ({{coord|41|54|15|N|12|27|17|E|type:landmark_region:VA|display=inline}}), now part of the Vatican Museums, which regard this as the start of their history. Michelangelo was called to the site of the unearthing of the statue immediately after its discovery.<ref>Barkan, 1-3</ref> In 2005 Lynn Catterson argued that the sculpture was a forgery created by [[Michelangelo]].<ref>Catterson, Lynn, "Michelangelo's 'Laoco<U+00F6>n?'"

===Restorations===
When the statue was discovered, Laoco<U+00F6>n's right arm was missing, along with part of the hand of one child and the right arm of the other, and various sections of snake. The older son, on the right, was detached from the other two figures. Artists and connoisseurs debated how the missing parts should be interpreted. Michelangelo suggested that the missing right arms were originally bent back over the shoulder. Others, however, believed it was more appropriate to show the right arms extended outwards in a heroic gesture. The Pope held an informal contest among sculptors to make replacement right arms, which was judged by [[Raphael]]. The winner, in the outstretched position, was attached to the statue.

In 1906 [[Ludwig Pollak]], archaeologist, art dealer and director of the [[Museo Barracco]], discovered a fragment of a marble arm in a builder<U+2018>s yard in Rome, close to the findspot of the group. Noting a stylistic similarity to the Laoco<U+00F6>n group he presented it to the Vatican Museums: it remained in their storerooms  for half a century. In the 1950s the museum decided that this arm<U+2014>bent, as Michelangelo had suggested<U+2014>had originally belonged to this Laoco<U+00F6>n. In the 1980s the statue was dismantled and reassembled with the new arm incorporated.<ref>See {{citation|last=Beard|first=Mary|newspaper=[[Times Literary Supplement]]|title=Arms and the Man: The restoration and reinvention of classical sculpture|date=2 February 2001|url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25829-2465943_2,00.html}}. Beard, in fact, is highly sceptical of the identification, noting that <U+2018>the new arm does not directly join with the father's broken shoulder (a wedge of plaster has had to be inserted); it appears to be on a smaller scale and in a slightly differently coloured marble<U+2019>.  On the wedge, Barkan, 11 notes that in the restoration of c. 1540 "the original shoulder was severely sliced back" to fit the new section.</ref> The restored portions of the children's arm and hand were removed. In the course of disassembly, it was possible to observe breaks, cuttings, metal tenons, and dowel holes which suggested that in Antiquity, a more compact, three-dimensional pyramidal grouping of the three figures had been used or at least contemplated. The more open, planographic composition along a plane, used in the restoration of the Laoco<U+00F6>n group, has been interpreted as "apparently the result of serial reworkings by Roman Imperial as well as Renaissance and modern craftsmen". A different reconstruction was proposed in 1989, to give "a more cohesive, baroque-looking and diagonally-set pyramidal composition".<ref>Seymour Howard, "Laocoon Re-restored", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''93'''.3 (July 1989, pp. 417<U+2013>422), pp. 422 and 417 quoted in turn.</ref> 

There are many copies of the statue, including a well-known one in the [[Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes|Grand Palace]] of the [[Knights of St. John]] in [[Rhodes]]. Many still show the arm in the outstretched position, but the copy in Rhodes has been corrected.

==Influence==
[[File:Caricature of the Laocoon group as apes.jpg|thumb|Titian's parody of the Laoco<U+00F6>n as a group of apes]]
The discovery of the ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'' made a great impression on Italian sculptors and significantly influenced the course of [[Italian Renaissance]] art. [[Michelangelo]] is known to have been particularly impressed by the massive scale of the work and its sensuous [[Hellenistic]] aesthetic, particularly its depiction of the male figures. The influence of the ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'' is evidenced in many of Michelangelo's later works, such as the ''Rebellious Slave'' and the ''[[Dying Slave]]'', created for the tomb of [[Pope Julius II]]. The tragic nobility of this statue is one of the themes in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s essay on literature and [[aesthetics]], ''Laoko<U+00F6>n'', one of the early classics of art criticism.

The [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptor [[Baccio Bandinelli]] was commissioned to make a copy by [[Pope Leo X]]. Bandinelli's version, which was often copied and distributed in small bronzes, is at the [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence.<ref>([http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bandinel/laocoon.html BANDINELLI, Baccio]. Web Gallery of Art. Retrieved on March 27, 2009.</ref> A bronze casting, made for [[Francis I of France]] at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] from a mold taken from the original under the supervision of [[Primaticcio]], is at the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre]].

A woodcut, possibly after a drawing by [[Titian]], parodied the sculpture by portraying three apes instead of humans. It has often been interpreted as a satire on the clumsiness of Bandinelli's copy, but it has also been suggested that it was a commentary on debates of the time about similarities between human and ape anatomy.<ref>H. W. Janson, "Titian's Laocoon Caricature and the Vesalian-Galenist Controversy", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 28, No. 1 (Mar., 1946), pp. 49-53</ref>

The original was seized and taken to Paris by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] after his conquest of Italy in 1799, and installed in a place of honour in the [[Mus<U+00E9>e Napol<U+00E9>on (Paris)|Mus<U+00E9>e Napol<U+00E9>on]] at the [[Louvre]], where it was one of the inspirations of [[neoclassicism]] in French art. Following the fall of Napoleon, it was returned by the British to the Vatican in 1816.

===Laoco<U+00F6>n as an ideal of art===
[[Image:Laocoon blake.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's Laoco<U+00F6>n print, c. 1820.]]

Pliny's description of Laoco<U+00F6>n as "a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced"<ref>Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2001.08.34, review of Richard Brilliant, ''My Laoco<U+00F6>n: Alternative Claims''.</ref> has led to a tradition which debates this claim that the sculpture is the greatest of all artworks. [[Johann Joachim Winkelmann]] (1717-1768) wrote about the paradox of admiring beauty while seeing a scene of death and failure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The most influential contribution to the debate, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s essay ''Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry'', examines the differences between visual and literary art by comparing the sculpture with Virgil's verse. He argues that the artists could not realistically depict the physical suffering of the victims, as this would be too painful. Instead, they had to express suffering while retaining beauty.

The most unusual intervention in the debate, [[William Blake]]'s annotated print ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'', surrounds the image with graffiti-like commentary in several languages, written in multiple directions. Blake presents the sculpture as a mediocre copy of a lost Israelite original, describing it as "Jehovah & his two Sons Satan & Adam as they were copied from the Cherubim Of Solomons Temple by three Rhodians & applied to Natural Fact or History of Ilium".<ref>[http://squibix.net/blake/m/laocoon/withnotes.html Blake's comments]
</ref> This reflects Blake's theory that the imitation of ancient Greek and Roman art was destructive to the creative imagination, and that Classical sculpture represented a banal naturalism in contrast to Judeo-Christian spiritual art.   

The central figure of ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'' served as loose inspiration for the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] in [[Horatio Greenough]]'s ''[[The Rescue (statue)|The Rescue]]'' (1837<U+2013>1850) which stood before the east facade of the [[United States Capitol]] for over 100 years.<ref>[[:File:GreenoughRescue.jpg|''The Rescue'' by Greenough]]</ref>

Near the end of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Ebenezer Scrooge self-describes "making a perfect Laoco<U+00F6>n of himself with his stockings" - which directly references the statue of Laoco<U+00F6>n, since Scrooge is in such a rush to get dressed that he becomes entangled in his clothes.

In 1910 the critic [[Irving Babbit]] used the title ''The New Laokoon: An Essay on the Confusion of the Arts'' for an essay on contemporary culture at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1940 [[Clement Greenberg]] adapted the concept for his own essay entitled ''Towards a Newer Laoco<U+00F6>n'' in which he argued that abstract art now provided an ideal for artists to measure their work against.  A 2007 exhibition<ref>[http://www.henry-moore.org/hmi/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2007/towards-a-new-laocoon ''Towards a New Laocoon''], [[Henry Moore Institute]]</ref> at the [[Henry Moore Institute]] in turn copied this title while exhibiting work by modern artists influenced by the sculpture.  [[Richard Brilliant]] published a book called ''My Laoco<U+00F6>n: Alternative Claims in the Interpretation of Artworks'' in 2000.

==Findspot==
[[File:Pianta regio III da Lanciani.jpg|thumb|left|The findspot was about where the R in SERVIUS is on this map, east of the [[Sette Sale]]]]
The location where the buried statue was found in 1506 was always known to be "in the vineyard of Felice De Fredis" on the [[Oppian Hill]] (the southern spur of the [[Esquiline Hill]]), as noted in the document recording his sale of the group to the Pope.  But over time the knowledge of precisely where that was was lost, beyond vague statements such as it being "near the site of the [[Domus Aurea]]" (the palace of the [[Nero|Emperor Nero]]); in modern terms near the [[Colosseum]].  An inscribed plaque in the church of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]] records De Fredis' burial there in 1529, covering his finding of the group but giving no occupation.  Recent new research, published in 2010, has recovered two documents in the municipal archives (badly indexed, and so missed by earlier researchers), which has enabled a much more precise location for the find.<ref>Volpe and Parisi</ref>

The first of these was the record of De Fredis' purchase of the vineyard of about 1.5 [[hectare]]s from a convent for 135 [[ducat]]s on 14 November 1504, exactly 14 months before the statue was found.  The second, from 1527, makes it clear that there is now a house on the property, and clarifies the location. The house is shown on a map of 1748, and still survives as a substantial building of three storeys, today in the courtyard of a convent.  The area remained mainly agricultural until the 19th century, but is now entirely built up. It is speculated that De Fredis began building soon after his purchase, and as the group was reported to have been found some four metres below ground, at a depth unlikely to be reached by normal vineyard digging operations, it seems likely that it was discovered when digging the foundations for the house, or possibly a well for it.<ref>Volpe and Parisi</ref>

The findspot was inside and very close to the [[Servian Wall]], which was still maintained in the 1st century AD (possibly converted to an [[aqueduct]]), though no longer the city boundary, as building had spread well beyond it.  The spot was within the [[Gardens of Maecenas]], created by [[Gaius Maecenas]] the ally of [[Augustus]] and patron of the arts.  He bequeathed the gardens to Augustus in 8 BC, and it is known that [[Tiberius]] lived there after he returned to Rome as heir to Augustus in 2 AD.  Pliny said the ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'' was in his time at the palace of [[Titus]], then heir to his father [[Vespasian]], but it is not known where this was; the imperial estate of the Gardens of Maecenas may be a plausible candidate.  If the ''Laoco<U+00F6>n'' group was already in the location of the later findspot by the time Pliny saw it, it might have arrived there under Maecenas or any of the emperors.<ref>Volpe and Parisi</ref>
