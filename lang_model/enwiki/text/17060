'''''Stargate Worlds''''' (abbreviated as '''''SGW''''')<ref name="SGW">{{cite web |author= |url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/1167/ |title=Check out the SGW page at Gamespot |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> is a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[video game]] in-development by [[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] (CME) in association with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) and published by FireSky for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The game's setting is mainly borrowed from [[military science fiction]] series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. The game will focus on a premise set around an ancient device called the "[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]". The game details and estimated release date is not clear as of yet. The video game is currently undergoing closed beta testing.<ref name="beta_patch_notes">{{cite web |author=|authorlink=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/1252/ |title=Closed Beta Sneak Peek |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> 

The ''Stargate'' franchise has spawned other media including [[List of Stargate literature|books]], [[television series]], [[feature film|films]], and [[List of Stargate comics|comic books]]. These supplements to the film and series trilogies comprise another universe than the series and the film, and have resulted in significant development of the series' [[fictional universe]]. These media kept the franchise going in the interim between the film and series trilogies. In 2006, both CME and MGM announced the release of video game set in the Stargate universe. In 2008, FireSky announced its participation in the process of releasing ''Stargate Worlds''.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_April_17/ai_n25333277/ |title=New Interactive Publishing House, FireSky, Building a Distinct Breed of Online Games |publisher=''Business Wire'' |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

On March 25, 2010 FireSky announced on their website that CME/CMG had entered [[receivership]].

==Development==
[[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] and [[Metro<U+2013>Goldwyn<U+2013>Mayer]] (MGM) announced in February, 2006 that work had begun on a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG).<ref>{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/02/mgm_announces_stargate_mmorpg.shtml |title=MGM announces ''Stargate'' MMORPG |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=February 1, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> CME released several [[concept art]] images from ''Stargate Worlds'' in late 2006 along with announcing the use of [[Unreal engine#Unreal Engine 3.0|Unreal Engine 3.0]].

At the moment, there seems to be much confusion about the release of ''Stargate Worlds''. In an interview with ''[[GateWorld]]'', Wright said he had "doubts" if the game would be released at all. Marketing manager from FireSky announced that the game is still in development, even if people say otherwise. He further stated that they were arranging deals to cover their "financial responsibilities and fund the remainder of development," of the video game.<ref>{{cite web |author=Onyett, Charles |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/971/971123p1.html |title=''Stargate Worlds'' Still in Development |publisher=''IGN'' |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> 

Registrations are currently being accepted for a [[closed beta]] version, with participants to be drawn randomly from the pool of registrants.  Registration is limited to those aged 18 and over.<ref>{{cite web |author=Read, David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/04/istargate_worldsi_commences_clos.shtml |title=''Stargate Worlds'' commences closed beta |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 12, 2010. Development of the game is currently on hold. <ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://forums.stargateworlds.com/showthread.php?t=35925 |title=Stargate Worlds Development Information. |publisher=''stargateworlds forum'' |date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

==Setting==
''Stargate Worlds'' will be based on the popular science fiction show ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Original plans were to run it in sync with the show, but the show was cancelled in 2006, though at least three direct-to-DVD films are being made (one being based on ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''), continuing the storyline.<ref name="Gateworld_Report">{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |authorlink=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/istargate_sg-1i_cancelled_iatlan.shtml |title=Stargate SG-1 cancelled, Atlantis renewed |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=August 21, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> The game will take place in the earlier seasons of the show, before the Atlantis expedition and before the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] story arc.<ref name="StargateWorlds_NewsArchive">{{cite web |author=Balentine, Kevin |authorlink=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/3/638/ |title=Balentine: 'Worlds is pre-Ori' |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref>

At release, the game will revolve around the Milky Way Galaxy during in the storyline of the ongoing conflict between the [[Tau'ri]] and the [[Goa'uld]]. Playable races as shown at this time will include [[Mythology of Stargate|Tau'ri]], [[Goa'uld]], [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]], and the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]]. The combat will incorporate some elements that are familiar to players of [[first person shooter]]s. Players will use an array of ranged weaponry of both earth and alien origin. Combat will emphasize tactics to defeat opponents both AI and human controlled. The AI is being designed to provide players with a significant challenge which is praised by many critics.<ref name="combatsys">{{cite web |author=Staff |authorlink=|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/stargateworlds/news.html?sid=6184182 |title=Stargate Worlds Q&A - First Look Behind the Stargate |publisher=''GameSpot'' |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

===Archetypes===
The [[Character class|archetypes]] in the game are designed to fit with the modern ranged-weapon combat system of the game. According to the developers there will be no specific healer class in the game, and all archetypes will have the ability to be a medic, although some archetypes will be better than others at healing and reviving.<ref name="podcast interview">{{cite web |author= |authorlink=|url=http://www.virginworlds.com/pg.php?n=5991 |title=VirginWorlds Podcast #60 - GDC Day Five (Part 2) |publisher=''Virgin Worlds'' |date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Specialization within the different archetypes will lead to more flexibility within a group.<ref name="TTH1">{{cite web |author=Ethec |authorlink=|url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=display&ceid=438 |title=The Archetype System in Stargate Worlds |publisher=''Ten Ton Hammer'' |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> A robust tech tree will make each archetype that much more customizable and replayable.<ref name="warcryfing">{{cite web |author=Miller, Jay "AiuaX" |authorlink=|url=http://www.warcry.com/news/view/63538 |title=Stargate Worlds Questions & Answers #1 |publisher=''War Cry'' |date=May 22, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

The archetypes of ''Stargate Worlds'', will according to the developers be very "flexible" in their abilities and usage. Each archetype will have three specialization trees which will define a particular play style over time, although players will be able to mix and match skills from these.<ref name="interview">{{cite web |author= Marce, Xaviar |authorlink=|url=http://www.mmoginfo.com/pc/Stargate_Worlds/QnA_51_1.html |title=Stargate Worlds Questions & Answers #1 |publisher=''MMOG Info'' |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> No end game [[Instance dungeon|instance]] will need a particular class to be successful, although the developers have yet to rule out a particular play style being necessary for certain instances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/download/10/568/ |title=Developer Q&A Podcast - Episode 2 |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

With the game un-released major development is still on work on the different archetypes, they will be a subject to change.<ref name="TTH1" /> Both the scientist and the archaeologist will excel in non-combat gameplay with various types of puzzles to solve and gain access to new advances.<ref name ="Gamersinfonet">{{cite web |author=Ophelea | authorlink=|url=http://www.gamersinfo.net/articles/1295-preview---stargate-worlds |title=Interview <U+2013> Preview - Stargate Worlds |publisher=''Gamers Info'' |date=October 18, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> In addition, there are likely to be quests specifically for those and other archetypes.<ref name ="TTH2">{{cite web |author=Jeff "Ethec"|authorlink=|url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=display&ceid=297 |title=A Stargate Worlds Interview with Joe Ybarra |publisher=''Ten Ton Hammer'' |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> Each archetype will have its own starting area. In addition to learning how to play the archetype, this starting zone will also give the player a backstory that comes from the [[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|first six seasons]] of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Genender, Laura|authorlink=|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm?LOADFEATURE=1560&PAGE=1&SETVIEW=features&GAMEID=242&bhcp=1 |title=Stargate Worlds - Dev Chat Log |publisher=''MMORPG'' |date=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

*'''Archaeologists''' ([[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] archetype) will specialize in ancient cultures and languages. They will be able to 'blend in with the locals' to gather intelligence or ambush the enemy. This 'blending in' uses Asgard holographic technology to assume the appearance of others.<ref name="TTH1" />  It is likely that the archaeologist will also be able to engage in diplomacy, something discussed by the developers previously.<ref name="stargate_game">{{cite web |author=Balentine, Kevin |url=http://www.stargate-game.com/mmo-news/cme-press-junket-transcript-feb-2006.html |title=Press Conference Call |publisher=''Stargate-Game'' |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Archaeologists can also be quite adept in aggro management, perhaps by being superb negotiators or good at hiding, making them good solo characters, in addition to their ability to solve puzzles<ref name="TTH1" /> that are currently slated to be in the form of minigames. In addition to using their diplomatic abilities in PvE situations, they may also be able to use them to their advantage in PvP interactions, although how this will work is unknown.
*'''Asgard''' will be physically frail, but will be masters of technology and will have a strong science ability.<ref name="podcast interview"/> They depend on clone technology to survive and thrive. By calling upon different types of drones to attack, defend, heal, or analyze, the Asgard becomes a true jack-of-all-trades. When faced with dire circumstances, the Asgard can also bring in their mighty starships to devastate the enemy with orbital bombardments<ref name="TTH1" /> in the form of a special attack.<ref name="podcast interview"/>  By being able to fit into a number of different roles, it is likely the Asgard will choose their 'class' by specializing in a different type of drone technology. The Asgard will be a faction-specific class, thus there will not be any "evil" Asgard until the Atlantis Expansion is released.
*'''Goa'uld''' will gain much of their power from their servants. With the ability to command several different types of minions, the Goa'uld can become almost as versatile as the Asgard. These minions will include Jaffa and possibly human servants.<ref>An Audio Podcast: [http://www.stargateworlds.com/download/10/560/ Developer Q&A Part 1] <U+2013> June 29 2007</ref> In addition to their minions, Goa'ulds also have access to poisons that can be used to cripple enemies. They can also specialize in Ashrak technologies, such as phase cloaking, becoming masters of stealthy attacks.<ref name="TTH1" /> As the evil counterparts to the Asgard, the Goa'uld may be able to call in their Ha'tak bombers to bombard the enemy as a special attack.<ref name="podcast interview"/> The Goa'uld character will be the symbiote, and players will, at times and at a "cost", be able to choose to enter a new host. However player Goa'uld will not be able to take over other players' hosts.
*'''Jaffa''' ([[Teal'c]] archetype) in the game are much like the Jaffa in the [[Stargate SG-1|show]]. In addition to its devastating ranged attack, the Jaffa staff weapon can also be used in melee combat. Displaying  solidarity and teamwork, Jaffa can use their oaths to strengthen their allies, especially other Jaffa. With their physical strength, Jaffa are highly resistant to special attacks and can continue fighting even when injured.<ref name="TTH1" /><br>[[Jaffa]] can be either of the SGU or Praxis factions as :
** Loyal Jaffa (Praxis)
** Free Jaffa (SGU)
*'''Scientist''' ([[Samantha Carter|Samantha "Sam" Carter]] archetype) will be a combination of pure scientist and engineer.<ref name ="TTH2" /> Scientists can specialize in analyzing, repairing, and using technologies. They can also use new technologies to craft personal upgrades. Their battlefield utility comes from the ability to construct devices such as gun turrets, shields, and target inhibitors. They can also specialize in healing and resurrection technology. Like the archaeologist, the scientist can also solve puzzles, but of a technological nature.<ref name="TTH1" /> These puzzles will be in the form of minigames.
*'''Soldiers''' ([[Jack O'Neill|Jonathan "Jack" O'Neill]] archetype) is valuable for protection when stepping through the stargate. With the ability to specialize in a variety of weapons, including grenades, automatic weapons, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers, their job is to unleash firepower on enemies. With additional training, they can also learn basic healing, how to use alien weaponry, and lead teams.<ref name="TTH1" />
*'''Commando''' class will be giving up access to the variety of weapons a soldier class uses, a commando class gains access to stealth, demolitions, and the sniper rifle. The commando can disrupt, confuse, and neutralize enemies. In addition to being able to stealth, commandos also have technology to detect stealthed enemies. The commando will be at least one of the archetypes able to deploy and detect traps.

==Release==

Due to events beyond the control of the developers the project has been put on Hold until funding can be found to complete the project.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://forums.stargateworlds.com/showthread.php?t=35925 |title=Stargate Worlds Development Information. |publisher=''stargateworlds forum'' |date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

In addition to regular content updates, the possibility of expansion packs has been discussed. Currently there is no information on how much the expansions will cost.

It is unknown if the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] will be playable characters.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ophelea |url=http://www.gamersinfo.net/index.php?art/id:1326 |title=Interview <U+2013> Preview - Stargate Worlds |date=October 18, 2006 |work=GamersInfo |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Pitts | first=Russ |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/69288-Joe-Ybarra-on-Stargate-Worlds-Part-One |title=Joe Ybarra on Stargate Worlds: Part One |date=March 5, 2007 |work=The Escapist Magazine |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref>

Player-controlled ships will not be in the initial release.
