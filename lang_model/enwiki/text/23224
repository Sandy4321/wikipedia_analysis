A '''persistent vegetative state''' (PVS) is a condition of patients with severe [[brain damage]] in whom [[coma]] has progressed to a state of wakefulness without detectable [[awareness]].

== History ==
The syndrome was first described in 1940 by [[Ernst Kretschmer]] who called it ''apallic Syndrome''.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ernst Kretschmer | title=Das apallische Syndrom | journal=Neurol. Psychiat | volume=169 | pages=576-579 | year=1940}}</ref>

The term ''persistent vegetative state'' was coined in [[1972]] by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Vertebral column|spinal]] [[surgeon]] Bryan Jennett and [[United States|American]] [[neurologist]] Fred Plum to describe a syndrome that seemed to have been made possible by [[medicine]]'s increased capacities to keep patients' bodies alive.<ref name="Jennett">{{cite book | author=Bryan Jennett | title=The Vegetative State: Medical facts, ethical and legal dilemmas | publisher=University of Glasgow: Scotland | url=http://assets.cambridge.org/052144/1587/sample/0521441587ws.pdf | accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref><ref name="Jennett1972">{{cite journal | author=B Jennett and F Plum | title=Persistent vegetative state after brain damage: A syndrome in search of a name | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=1 | issue=7753 | pages=734-737 | year=1972 | pmid=4111204}}</ref>

== Classification ==
Terminology in this area is somewhat confused.  While the term ''persistent vegetative state'' is the most frequent in media usage and legal provisions, it is discouraged by [[neurologist]]s, who favour the terminology of the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians (RCP)]] which refers only to the ''vegetative state'', the ''continuing vegetative state'', and the ''permanent vegetative state''.<ref name="rcp">{{cite book | title=Guidance on diagnosis and management: Report of a working party of the Royal College of Physicians | publisher=[[Royal College of Physicians]]: London | year=1996}}</ref> This typology distinguishes various stages of the condition rather than using one term for them all. In his most recent book ''[[The Vegetative State]]'', Jennett himself adopts this usage, on the grounds that "the 'persistent' component of this term ... may seem to suggest irreversibility".<ref name="Jennett"/> The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has suggested "post coma unresponsiveness" as an alternative term.<ref>{{cite book | title=Post-coma unresponsiveness (Vegetative State): a clinical framework for diagnosis | publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC): Canberra | year=2003 | url=http://www.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/synopses/hpr23syn.htm}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
PVS patients appear to be [[unconsciousness|unconscious]], unaware, and unresponsive to any external stimuli, except, possibly, pain stimuli.<ref name="taskforce1">{{cite journal | author=Unknown | title=Medical aspects of the persistent vegetative state (part 1 of report of the Multi-Society Task Force on PVS) | journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume=330 | issue=21 | pages=1499-1508 | pmid=7818633 | month=May | year=1994}}</ref><ref name="taskforce2">{{cite journal | author=Unknown | title=Medical aspects of the persistent vegetative state (part 2 of report of the Multi-Society Task Force on PVS) | journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume=330 | issue=22 | pages=1572-1579 | pmid=8177248 | month=Jun | year=1994}}</ref> Unlike [[coma]], in which the patient's eyes are closed, PVS patients often open their eyes. Their eyes might be in a relatively fixed position, or track moving objects, or move in a ''disconjugate'' (i.e. completely unsynchronised) manner. They may experience [[sleep]]-wake cycles, or be in a state of chronic wakefulness. They may exhibit some behaviors that can be construed as arising from partial consciousness, such as grinding their teeth, swallowing, smiling, shedding tears, grunting, moaning, or screaming without any apparent external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].<ref name="taskforce1"/><ref name="taskforce2"/>

== Causes ==
There are three different causes of PVS: brain injuries which may be either acute and [[traumatic brain injury|traumatic]], or non-traumatic; [[neurodegenerative disorder|degenerative]] and [[metabolic disorder|metabolic]] brain disorders, and severe congenital abnormalities of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="taskforce1"/>

== Diagnosis ==
{{expand|date=November 2007}}
Patients are usually considered to be in a vegetative state if they are [[unconsciousness|unconscious]], unaware, and unresponsive to any external stimuli, except, possibly, pain stimuli.<ref name="taskforce1"/><ref name="taskforce2"/> Patients who do not emerge from a vegetative state within 30 days are said to be in a persistent vegetative state.<ref name="Jennett"/> PVS differs from [[coma]] in that the eyes of PVS patients are often open and can move, though not necessarily in synchrony with one another. PVS patients are seemingly incapable of engaging in any deliberate behaviour, in contrast to patients diagnosed with the [[minimally conscious state]].

=== Misdiagnoses ===
Misdiagnosis of PVS is not uncommon. One study of 40 patients in the [[United Kingdom]] reported that 43% of those patients classified as in a PVS were misdiagnosed and another 33% able to recover whilst the study was underway.<ref>{{cite journal | author=K Andrews, L Murphy, R Munday, and C Littlewood | title=Misdiagnosis of the vegetative state: retrospective study in a rehabilitation unit | journal=[[British Medical Journal]] | volume=313 | pages=13-16 | date=[[1996-07-06]] | pmid=8664760 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/313/7048/13}}</ref> Some cases of PVS may actually be cases of patients being in an undiagnosed [[minimally conscious state]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Giacino JT, et al. | title=Unknown title | journal=Neurology | volume=58 | year=2002 | pages=349-353}}</ref> Since the exact diagnostic criteria of the minimally conscious state were formulated only in 2002, there may be chronic patients diagnosed as PVS before the notion of the minimally conscious state became known.

Can there be conscious awareness in vegetative state? Three completely different aspects of this issue should be distinguished. First, some patients can be conscious simply because they are misdiagnosed (see above). In fact, they are not in vegetative state. Second, sometimes a patient was correctly diagnosed but, then, examined during a beginning recovery. Third, perhaps some day the very notion of the vegetative state will change so as to include elements of conscious awareness. Inability to disentangle these three cases leads to confusion. An example of such confusion is the response to a recent experiment using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] which revealed that a woman diagnosed with PVS was able to activate predictable portions of her brain in response to the tester's requests that she imagine herself playing tennis or moving from room to room in her house. The brain activity in response to these instructions was indistinguishable from those of healthy patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Owen AM, Coleman MR, Boly M, Davis MH, Laureys S, and Pickard JD | title=Detecting awareness in the vegetative state | journal=Science | volume=313 | issue=5792 | pages=p.1402 | date=[[2006-09-08]] | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16959998&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum}}</ref> Because such activations can be obtained only if a patient has clear awareness and concentrated attention, the diagnosis of PVS was obviously an error. Therefore, the experiment did not show awareness in vegetative state in any reasonable sense of the word; rather, it showed that magnetic resonance imaging, combined with sophisticated stimulation, can effectively be used to disclose major diagnostic errors.

== Treatment ==
As of April 2007, no treatment for vegetative state exists that would satisfy the efficiency criteria of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Several methods have been proposed which can roughly be subdivided into four categories: pharmacological methods, surgery, physical therapy, and various stimulation techniques. Pharmacological therapy mainly uses activating substances such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] or [[methylphenidate]]. Promising results have been reported on dopaminergic drugs, particularly [[amantadine]]. Presently the first randomized controlled trial amantadine versus placebo is running; its results have not been published yet. Surgical methods such as deep brain stimulation are rarely used. Stimulation techniques include sensory stimulation, sensory regulation, music and musicokinetic therapy, social-tactile interaction, etc.

There is currently anecdotal evidence that the [[imidazopyridine]] hypnotic drug [[zolpidem]] (stilnox) can have positive behavioral effects in some PVS patients.<ref>{{cite episode | title=The Waking Pill | series=''ONE Life'', [[BBC 1]] TV | airdate=2007-10-31 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7070601.stm}}</ref> The first such putative case is Louis Viljoen who was hit by a vehicle in 1994 leaving him in a PVS state. Five years later when Viljoen was having involuntary spasms in his left arm, his physician, H Wally Nel, treated him with zolpidem. 25 minutes after the treatment, Viljoen started murmuring and then conversing, albeit not fluently, with his mother. In [[magnetic resonance image]]s of his brain before and after treatment with zolpidem, the damaged brain regions, which appeared black and dead before treatment, began to light up with neural activity afterwards. Following seven years of further treatment with zolpidem, Viljoen can now speak in complex sentences and move his head and arms. The physician, Nel, who treated Viljoen claims to have treated 150 further PVS patients with zolpidem and seen improvements in approximately 60% of them.<ref name="pmid10721397">{{cite journal | author = Clauss RP, G<U+00FC>ldenpfennig WM, Nel HW, Sathekge MM, Venkannagari RR | title = Extraordinary arousal from semi-comatose state on zolpidem: A case report | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume=90 | issue=1 | pages=68<U+2013>72 | year=2000 | pmid=10721397 | doi = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="guardian">{{cite news | first=Helen | last=Pidd | title=Reborn | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=[[2006-09-12]] | year=2006 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,,1870279,00.html}}</ref> A clinical trial of zolpidem involving over 360 PVS patients worldwide is currently underway, and 60% of these patients are showing signs of improvement.<ref>{{cite news | first=Aislinn | last=Simpson | title=Sleeping pill Zolpidem awakens girl from coma | publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | date=[[2007-10-31]] | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ncoma131.htm | accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> Additionally, stroke victims and patients with head injuries or brain damage following [[oxygen deprivation]], such as near-drowning victims, have reported significant improvements in speech, motor functions, and concentration after treatment with zolpidem.<ref name="guardian"/>

Controversy has been caused by the discovery that many nursing homes and hospitals give ''unheated oxygen'' to non-responsive patients via [[tracheal intubation]].  This bypasses the warming of the upper respiratory tract and causes a chilling of [[aorta|aortic blood]] and chilling of the brain.  In a small number of PVS cases, removal of the chilled oxygen has been followed by recovery from the PVS.  Additional research has been recommended to determine if this chilling effect may either delay recovery or even may contribute to brain damage.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ford GP and Reardon DC | title=Prolonged unintended brain cooling may inhibit recovery from brain injuries: case study and literature review | journal=Med Sci Monit. | volume=12 | issue=8 | year=2006 | month=Aug | pages=CS74-79 | url=http://www.medscimonit.com/pub/vol_12/no_8/8795.pdf | epub=Epub 2006 Jul 12}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
Many patients emerge spontaneously from a vegetative state within a few weeks.<ref name="Jennett"/> The chances of recovery depend on the extent of injury to the brain and the patient's age&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;younger patients having a better chance of recovery than older patients. Generally, adults have a 50 percent chance and children a 60 percent chance of recovering consciousness from a PVS within the first 6 months. After a year, the chances that a PVS patient will regain consciousness are very low and most patients who do recover consciousness experience significant disability. The longer a patient is in a PVS, the more severe the resulting disabilities are likely to be. Rehabilitation can contribute to recovery, but many patients never progress to the point of being able to take care of themselves.

Recovery after long periods of time in a PVS has been reported on several occasions and are often treated as spectacular events. On 7 March 2007, a woman named Christa Lilly awakened from a vegetative state after six years with her eyes being open most of the time, tracking moving objects. She spoke to family and a local news group saying she was fine. The hardest part she said was learning how to speak again. Lilly then slipped back into the vegetative state after three days.<ref>{{cite news | author=Aug<U+00E9>, Karen and Emery, Erin | date=[[2007-03-08]] | title=Woman awakes after 6-year coma, slips back | news=The Denver Post | url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_5380394}}</ref>

The most common cause of death for PVS patients is a [[secondary infection]] such as [[pneumonia]] which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.

== Epidemiology ==
In the [[United States]], it is estimated that there may be between 15,000-40,000 patients who are in a persistent vegetative state, but due to poor nursing home records exact figures are hard to determine.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hirsch, Joy |  title=Raising consciousness | The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume=115 | issue=5 | date=[[2005-05-02]] | pages=p.1102 | publisher=American Society for Clinical Investigation |url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/1102}}</ref>  

== Legal definition ==
As opposed to [[brain death]], PVS is not recognized as [[death]] in any known legal system. This legal [[grey area]] has led to several court cases involving people in a PVS, those who believe that they should be [[right to die|allowed to die]], and those who are equally determined that, if recovery is possible, care should continue.  Well-known cases include [[Paul Brophy]], [[Sunny von B<U+00FC>low]] and [[Tony Bland]], whose case created a precedent in the UK.  The highly publicised case of [[Terri Schiavo]] in the [[United States]] involved disputes over a diagnosis of PVS given by several court-appointed doctors. Ultimately the court challenges were unsuccessful and Schiavo's [[feeding tube]] was removed, leading to her subsequent death.
