'''''Mighty Final Fight''''' is a [[fighting game|beat 'em up]] released by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1993. It is based on the 1989 [[arcade game]] ''[[Final Fight]]'', but is not exactly a port of the game. It stands out from the original ''Final Fight'' due to its [[super deformed]] character designs, in which the characters are depicted in a comical child-like manner compared to the realistic character designs of the original game. All three of the main characters from the original game are featured in this game along with childlike counterparts of the enemies.

The game has also been released in the compilation ''[[Capcom Classics Mini-Mix]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]].

==Story==
Being a parody of the original ''Final Fight'', the game's premise is exactly the same as the original ''Final Fight''. [[Mike Haggar]]'s daughter is [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by the Mad Gear gang, leading her father, along with [[Cody Travers|Cody]] and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]] on a rescue mission to save her. However, the story is depicted in a much more comical fashion than the original game. The gang kidnaps Jessica, not to manipulate Haggar, but rather because their leader Belger is infatuated with her and that he wants to marry her while taking over the city from within the process.

==Gameplay==
Much like the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] version of ''Final Fight'', the game does not offer any cooperative game modes and is strictly a [[single player]] affair. However, unlike that version, Cody, Haggar and Guy are all [[playable character|playable]]. Each character has virtually all his techniques from the arcade version (esp. the life-depleting death blows). The extra feat is that once Experience Level 4 is reached, each character may perform a hidden technique performed by simultaneously pressing Forward + Attack. These new techniques have Cody's [[Qi|chi]] blast, Guy's dual kicks, and Haggar's body splash. Each character also has his signature weapon of preference, found within rolling drums. Such weapons are: Cody's knife, Guy's shuriken, and Haggar's mallet.

Players earn [[experience point]]s by killing thugs to boost their levels like an [[Computer role-playing game|RPG]]. Level-ups during battle heal a player's health to 100%. Subsequently, the player's HP, offense, defense, and speed increases, enabling him to survive longer and learn the coveted hidden potential powers. Stronger characters increase their level more slowly than others. Points can also be earned by picking food when in full health aside from goon-bashing. At the Maximum Level (6), the player can inflict very large amounts of damage with even the simplest combo.

The cute super-deformed child-like sprites and brilliantly colorful backgrounds can be visually compared with those in the NES port of [[Double Dragon II]].

==Stages==
* '''SLUM''': The Slums based straight from the arcade FF's slums. It is guarded by the Rastafarian thug, '''''Thrasher'''''. He is '''''Damnd''''' in the original Final Fight. Note that the second area is actually the rooftops in contrast to the arcade version's abandoned basement (which serves as Thraser's secret hideout).
* '''RIVERSIDE''': The Riverside is reigned by the Japanist warrior, '''''Katana''''', armed with twin blades. He is '''''Sodom''''' in the arcade FF. The round might be possibly based from the arcade FF's Bay Area. Even though this game has its own Bay Area, the location is totally different. 
* '''OLD TOWN''': The town hides a secret arena that is guarded by the wild wrestler '''''Abigail'''''. Presumably this is the arcade FF's Uptown. In contrast, instead of going up, you go down to fight the boss in an underground ring (much like the Sodom arena or Andore arena in the arcade FF).
* '''FACTORY''': The underground tavern beneath the factory premises is reigned by the Blood Armor '''''Muramasa''''', Katana's vengeful and stronger brother. After being mortally wounded and disarmed of swords, he can charge around the screen, damaging the player upon contact.
* '''BAY AREA''': Unlike the arcade FF's Bay Area, this round occurs within a huge cruise liner that hides the remaining Mad Gear, 2 intermediate bosses and the final boss.
**'''AREA 1''': '''''Abigail''''' returns to exact revenge from his first defeat.
**'''AREA 2''': Ebon Armor '''''Masamune'''''; same moves but stronger than his brother Muramasa.
**'''FINAL AREA''': '''''Cyborg Belger'''''. With his robotic modifications, Horace Belger is determined to rule all of Metro City and that he'll eliminate anyone who stands in his way.

==Playable characters==
The three main protagonists, in a cartoonish ''SD'' (Super Deformed) or ''CB'' (Child Body) illustrations.

*'''Advantage''': Balanced power and speed. Requires a total of 574 Experience Points to attain Maximum Level.

===Guy===
*'''Profile''': Descended From Ninja, Guy attacks enemies with great agility.
*'''Advantage''': Unmatched speed. Requires a total of 478 Experience Points to attain Maximum Level.
*'''Sure-Kill Technique''': ''Bushinryuu Senpuu-Kyaku'' or Warrior God Style Hurricane Kick
*'''Hidden Technique''': Guy kicks a melee target by the face, followed by a fiery kick that knocks the target down for massive damage.
*'''Hidden Weapon''': The ''shuriken'' (combat stars). Guy receives 8 charges per shuriken pick-up.
*'''Special Ability''': ''Eye of Bushin''. Guy accurately throws combat stars upon targets for massive damage.

===Haggar===
*'''Profile''': The hot-tempered wrestler and mayor of Metro City.
*'''Advantage''': Unmatched power. Requires a total of 688 Experience Points to attain Maximum Level.
*'''Sure-Kill Technique''': Spinning Clothesline
*'''Hidden Technique''': Haggar feints a target off-guard with a body splash, thus boosting the damage of all subsequent attacks done afterwards.
*'''Hidden Weapon''': The ''double-handed mallet''.
*'''Special Ability''': Haggar exploits his wrestling skills to throw enemies with fervent ease. 
**'''Backdrop''': Haggar performs a German Suplex that slams his opponent from behind. 
**'''Piledriver''': Haggar grabs an opponent, leaps several feet into the air and smashes him down on the ground for massive damage.

==Enemy characters==
The enemy characters from ''Mighty Final Fight'' are analogues to their counterparts from ''Final Fight''. However, with the exception Andore and the [[boss (video games)|bosses]], they're considered different characters and as such, are aptly named differently. One of the most noticeable difference is that Poison Kiss ([[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]]'s counterpart) is a female, rather than a [[transsexual]] like Poison. She is often mistaken to be the same character, due to fact that she has "Poison" as part of her name. Poison Kiss was kept in the [[North America]]n release of ''Mighty Final Fight''. Bill Bull, Rolento and Edi E. are the only characters from original game that don't have any counterparts in this game.

*'''IRON (Bred)''': Usual cannon fodder and basic thug. A simple jab may not be much, but at later rounds they can jab thrice in a row.
*'''GALE (J)''': Fast street boxers who love to stride behind you and strike with fast jabs, making them all the more lethal.
*'''POISON KISS (Poison)''': Lithe female gangsters guised as cops. They attack by face-slapping or a quick somersault.
*'''TEQUILA (El Gado)''': Strong knife-adept assassins. They strike with sliding kicks or an airborne rolling knife attack.
*'''SERGE (Axl)''': Stronger goons. Not only they attack with a heavy-damaging kick, but can also deflect your attacks. His outfit resembles Rolento's.
*'''ANDORE''': Strongest-tier thugs. These bare-chested musclemen reign with their long-reach punches and full-screen shoulder tackles.
*'''THRASHER''' (Damnd in Japan): The Rastafarian thug who leaps around the warehouse or hammer his opponent to death with rapid bashes.
*'''KATANA''' (Sodom in Japan): The obsessed American Japanophile [[Sodom (Final Fight)|Sodom]], resurfaces in blood-red (Muramasa) and finally in ebon-black (Masamune). He viciously attacks with his katanas, and his stronger brothers charge around the screen once he is disarmed by losing half of his health.
*'''ABIGAIL''': A mad wrestler who drains life out of his opponents. Airborne attacks are countered with an uppercut. If angered, he channels his fury into a fatal charging punch.
*'''BELGER''': The big boss of Mad Gear. This [[cyborg]] reincarnation uses fist missiles and shocker arm as his weapons of choice.
