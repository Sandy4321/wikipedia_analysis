The '''''Marylander''''' was a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) afternoon [[passenger train]] between [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], operated by the B&O in partnership with the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] between [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Other intermediate cities served were [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=RB>Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., ''Royal Blue Line''.

Operating as #524 northbound and #525 southbound, the trains were called the ''New York Express'' and the ''Washington Express'', respectively, in the 1910s and 1920s. The ''Marylander'' and its predecessors offered a high level of passenger amenities, such as parlor cars with private drawing rooms, full [[dining car]] service, deluxe [[lounge car]]s, and onboard radio and telephone service. The ''Marylander'' made history in 1948 when it was the first moving train to offer onboard television reception.<ref name=NYT48>{{cite news|title=Train Television Shows Ball Game |date=October 8, 1948 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=F70A17FB3E59157A93CAA9178BD95F4C8485F9|format=pdf |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> It was one of B&O's faster trains on the route, maintaining a four-hour schedule until its discontinuation in October 1956 due to declining patronage.

==History==
First introduced by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) as one of the New York&ndash;Washington [[Royal Blue (train)|Royal Blue Line]] trains in the 1890s, the ''Marylander'' began life as Train #524, the ''New York Express'', departing Washington at 1&nbsp;p.m. Southbound, the ''Washington Express'' operated as Train #525 with a mid-afternoon departure from Jersey City.<ref name=RB2>Harwood, ''Royal Blue Line'', pp. 121&ndash;126.</ref>

By the late 1920s, Trains #524 and #525 were among the B&O's ten daily passenger trains in each direction between Washington and New York. On May 29, 1929, the B&O dubbed its mid-afternoon deluxe Washington-New York train the ''[[Columbian (B&O train)|Columbian]]''.<ref name=RB2 /> By the early 1930s, intense competition from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in the New York&ndash;Washington market prompted the B&O to air condition the train in 1932, the first railroad to do so.<ref name=RB /> Also introduced were the richly-appointed ''Martha Washington''-series [[dining car]]s, celebrated for their decor and fresh [[Chesapeake Bay]] cuisine served on Dresden china in ornate cars with glass chandeliers and colonial-style furnishings. Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins.<ref name=Kratville>William W. Kratville, ''Steam, Steel & Limiteds''. Omaha, Neb.: Barnhart Press, 1962, p. 93.</ref> In September 1941, the B&O introduced a new Washington&ndash;Chicago all-coach train, calling it the ''Columbian''.<ref name=RB3>Harwood, ''Royal Blue Line'', p. 153.</ref> The ''Columbian's'' former afternoon schedule between New York and Washington was renamed the ''Marylander''.<ref name=Kratville /><ref name=RB3 />

Along with most other rail passenger services in the U.S. during [[World War II]], the ''Marylander'' enjoyed a surge in passenger traffic between 1942 and 1945 as volume doubled to {{nowrap|1.2 million}} passengers annually on B&O's eight daily New York&ndash;Washington trains.<ref name=RB /> Following the end of the war, however, passenger volumes soon dropped below prewar levels and B&O discontinued one of its eight daily New York&ndash;Washington trains. Between the late 1940s and the mid-1950s, the ''Marylander'' and the line's flagship [[Royal Blue (train)|''Royal Blue'']] continued to serve New York, along with three New York&ndash;[[St. Louis, Missouri]] trains:  the ''[[Metropolitan Special]]'', ''[[National Limited]]'', and ''[[Diplomat (train)|Diplomat]]'', and two [[Chicago]] trains: the [[Capitol Limited (B&O train)|''Capitol Limited'']] and ''[[Shenandoah (B&O train)|Shenandoah]]''.<ref name=Guide>''[[Official Guide of the Railways]]''. New York: National Railway Publication Co., February 1956, pp. 414&ndash;418.</ref>

===Onboard television===
On October 7, 1948, the ''Marylander'' made history when a live television broadcast was first shown aboard a moving train, using a receiver operated by [[Bendix Corporation]] technicians.<ref name=NYT48 /> The second game of the [[1948 World Series]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] between the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] was watched by the ''Marylander''{{'}}s passengers, along with a [[Federal Communications Commission]]er, news reporters, and B&O officials. As the New York-bound train departed Washington's [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] at 1:35 p.m. and hurtled northward on B&O's right-of-way through Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey at an average speed of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0}}, technicians tuned the receiver to the strongest signal. An [[Associated Press]] reporter observing the demonstration said, "Technically, it was surprisingly good."<ref name=NYT48 /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the following day that "only when the train passed under bridges or steel structures, or was out of the range of television transmitters, was there any indication that the receiver was operating under unusual circumstances".<ref name=NYT48 /> A B&O official observing the experiment said that reception was mostly "as good as one finds in the average home".<ref name=NYT48 />

===Demise===
The overwhelming market dominance of the Pennsylvania Railroad was evident when it introduced the {{nowrap|18-car}} [[stainless steel]] ''Morning Congressional'' and ''Afternoon Congressional'' streamliners in 1952.<ref name=RB /> By the late 1950s, most U.S. passenger trains suffered a steep decline in patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and automobiles, utilizing improved [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]]s. The ''Marylander'' and B&O's other New York&ndash;Washington passenger trains were no exception, as operating deficits approached {{nowrap|$5 million}} annually and passenger volume declined by almost half between 1946 and 1957.<ref name=DPM /><ref name=Rasmuss>{{cite web |author=Frederick N. Rasmussen  |title=Lonesome whistle blew for last time |publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' |date=2008-04-27 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/ideas/bal-id.backstory27apr27,0,3493326.column |accessdate=2008-04-30 |page=21A }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> As financial losses mounted, the B&O discontinued the ''Marylander'' in October, 1956.<ref name=RB /> Less than two years later, on April 26, 1958, the railroad discontinued all of its remaining passenger trains between Baltimore and New York, ending service altogether to the latter city.

==En route==
In Baltimore, the ''Marylander'' used the B&O's [[Mount Royal Station]] ({{coord|39.3055|N|76.6197|W|}}), at the north end of the Howard Street tunnel in the fashionable [[Bolton Hill]] neighborhood. [[Image:Mt Royal Station Baltimore.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Royal Station, Baltimore]] Designed by Baltimore architect [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin|E. Francis Baldwin]] and opened in 1896, Mount Royal Station is a blend of modified [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] styling and built of Maryland granite trimmed with Indiana limestone, with a red tile roof and a {{convert|150|ft|m|0|sing=on}} [[clocktower]]. The station's interior featured marble mosaic flooring, a fireplace, and rocking chairs.<ref>Stephen J. Salamon, David P. Oroszi, and David P. Ori, ''Baltimore and Ohio &ndash; Reflections of the Capitol Dome''. Silver Spring, Md.: Old Line Graphics, 1993 (ISBN 1-879314-08-8), p. 24.</ref> 

Because the B&O had no direct rail service across the [[Hudson River]] into [[New York City]], the ''Marylander'' and B&O's other New York-bound trains terminated at the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s Jersey City Terminal. Passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform.  These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]], where they proceeded to various "stations" around the city on four different routes, including the Vanderbilt Hotel, [[Wanamaker's]], [[Columbus Circle]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].<ref name=RB2 />

==Schedule and equipment==
The ''Marylander'' operated on afternoon schedules in both directions, with a 1&nbsp;p.m. departure from [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Washington, D.C., Union Station]] and a 5&nbsp;p.m. departure from Jersey City, arriving at its destination four hours later.<ref name=RB /> In the ''Marylander''{{'}}s final year of operation, the ''[[Official Guide of the Railways|Official Guide]]'' listed the following schedule for train #&nbsp;525, the southbound ''Marylander'', as of February 1956 (unconditional stops denoted in blue, bus connections in yellow):
