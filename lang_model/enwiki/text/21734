== History ==
After the discovery of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896, it was generally believed that atmospheric electricity, [[ionization]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], was caused only by [[radiation]] from radioactive elements in the ground or the radioactive gases or isotopes of [[radon]] they produce. Measurements of ionization rates at increasing heights above the ground during the decade from 1900 to 1910 showed a decrease that could be explained as due to absorption of the ionizing radiation by the intervening air.

=== Discovery ===
In 1909 [[Theodor Wulf]] developed an [[electrometer]], a device to measure the rate of ion production inside a hermetically sealed container, and used it to show higher levels of radiation at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] than at its base. However, his paper published in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' was not widely accepted. In 1911 [[Domenico Pacini]] observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake, over the sea, and at a depth of 3 meters from the surface. Pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth.<ref>

The Hess balloon flight took place on 7 August 1912.  By sheer coincidence, exactly 100 years later on 7 August 2012, the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] rover used its [[Radiation assessment detector|Radiation Assessment Detector]] (RAD) instrument to begin measuring the radiation levels on another planet for the first time. On 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible [[manned mission to Mars]] may involve a great [[radiation|radiation risk]] based on the amount of [[radiation|energetic particle radiation]] detected by the [[Radiation assessment detector|RAD]] on the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] while traveling from the [[Earth]] to [[Mars]] in 2011-2012.<ref name="SCI-20130531a" /><ref name="SCI-20130531b" /><ref name="NYT-20130530" />

=== Identification ===
In the 1920s the term "cosmic rays" was coined by [[Robert Millikan]] who made measurements of ionization due to cosmic rays from deep under water to high altitudes and around the globe. Millikan believed that his measurements proved that the primary cosmic rays were gamma rays, i.e., energetic photons. And he proposed a theory that they were  produced in interstellar space as by-products of the fusion of hydrogen atoms into the heavier elements, and that secondary [[electron]]s were produced in the atmosphere by [[Compton scattering]] of gamma rays. But then, in 1927, J. Clay found evidence,<ref name=clay-1927>{{cite journal | title=Title unknown | author=Clay, J. | journal=Proceedings of the Section of Sciences, Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam | year=1927 | volume=30 | page=633}}</ref> later confirmed in many experiments, of a variation of cosmic ray intensity with latitude, which indicated that the primary cosmic rays are deflected by the geomagnetic field and must therefore be charged particles, not photons. In 1929, [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Werner Kolh<U+00F6>rster|Kolh<U+00F6>rster]] discovered charged cosmic-ray particles that could penetrate 4.1&nbsp;cm of gold.<ref name=bothe-korlhorster-1929>{{cite journal | title=Das Wesen der H<U+00F6>henstrahlung | author=Bothe, Walther and Werner Kolh<U+00F6>rster | journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik |date=November 1929 | volume=56 |issue=11<U+2013>12 | pages=751<U+2013>777 | doi=10.1007/BF01340137|bibcode = 1929ZPhy...56..751B }}</ref> Charged particles of such high energy could not possibly be produced by photons from Millikan's proposed interstellar fusion process.

In 1930, [[Bruno Rossi]] predicted a difference between the intensities of cosmic rays arriving from the east and the west that depends upon the charge of the primary particles - the so-called "east-west effect."<ref name=rossi-1930>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v36/i3/p606_1 | title=On the Magnetic Deflection of Cosmic Rays | author=Rossi, Bruno | journal=Physical Review |date=August 1930 | volume=36 | issue=3 | page=606 | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.36.606|bibcode = 1930PhRv...36..606R }}</ref> Three independent experiments<ref name=johnson-1933>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v43/i10/p834_1 | title=The Azimuthal Asymmetry of the Cosmic Radiation | author=Johnson, Thomas H. | journal=Physical Review |date=May 1933 | volume=43 | issue=10 | pages=834<U+2013>835 | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.43.834|bibcode = 1933PhRv...43..834J }}</ref><ref name=alvarez-compton-1933>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v43/i10/p835_1 | title=A Positively Charged Component of Cosmic Rays |author=Alvarez, Luis; Compton, Arthur Holly | journal=Physical Review |date=May 1933 | volume=43 | issue=10 | pages=835<U+2013>836 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.43.835|bibcode = 1933PhRv...43..835A | last2=Compton }}</ref><ref name=rossi-1934>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v45/i2/p212_1 | title=Directional Measurements on the Cosmic Rays Near the Geomagnetic Equator |author=Rossi, Bruno | journal=Physical Review |date=May 1934 | volume=45 | issue=3 | pages=212<U+2013>214 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.212|bibcode = 1934PhRv...45..212R }}</ref> found that the intensity is, in fact, greater from the west, proving that most primaries are positive. During the years from 1930 to 1945, a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and [[muon]]s. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei ([[alpha particle]]s) and 1% are heavier nuclei of the elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.<ref name=freier-1948>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v74/i2/p213_1| title=Evidence for Heavy Nuclei in the Primary Cosmic radiation |author=Freier, Phyllis ''et al.'' | journal=Physical Review |date=July 1948| volume=74 | issue=2 | pages=213<U+2013>217 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.213 | last2=Lofgren | first2=E. | last3=Ney | first3=E. | last4=Oppenheimer | first4=F. | last5=Bradt | first5=H. | last6=Peters | first6=B.|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74..213F }}</ref><ref name=freier-1948>{{cite journal | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v74/i12/p1828_1| title=Investigation of the Primary Cosmic Radiation with Nuclear Photographic Emulsions |author=Freier, Phyllis ''et al.'' |journal=Physical Review |date=December 1948| volume=74 | issue=12 | pages=1828<U+2013>1837|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1828 | last2=Peters | first2=B.|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1828B }}</ref>

During a test of his equipment for measuring the east-west effect, Rossi observed that the rate of near-simultaneous discharges of two widely separated [[Geiger counter]]s was larger than the expected accidental rate. In his report on the experiment, Rossi wrote "...&nbsp;it seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by very extensive showers of particles, which causes coincidences between the counters, even placed at large distances from one another."<ref name=rossi-1934>{{cite journal | title=Misure sulla distribuzione angolare di intensita della radiazione penetrante all'Asmara | author=Rossi, Bruno | journal=Ricerca Scientifica | year=1934 | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=579<U+2013>589}}</ref> In 1937 [[Pierre Victor Auger|Pierre Auger]], unaware of Rossi's earlier report, detected the same phenomenon and investigated it in some detail. He concluded that high-energy primary cosmic-ray particles interact with air nuclei high in the atmosphere, initiating a cascade of secondary interactions that ultimately yield a shower of electrons, and photons that reach ground level.

Soviet physicist Sergey Vernov was the first to use [[radiosonde]]s to perform cosmic ray readings with an instrument carried to high altitude by a balloon. On 1 April 1935, he took measurements at heights up to 13.6 kilometers using a pair of [[Geiger counter]]s in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers.<ref>

[[Homi J. Bhabha]] derived an expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as [[Bhabha scattering]]. His classic paper, jointly with [[Walter Heitler]], published in 1937 described how primary cosmic rays from space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler explained the cosmic ray shower formation by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs.

=== Energy distribution ===
Measurements of the energy and arrival directions of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of "density sampling" and "fast timing" of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 by members of the Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name=rossi-1961>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRev.122.637}}</ref> The experiment employed eleven [[Scintillator|scintillation detectors]] arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter on the grounds of the Agassiz Station of the [[Harvard College Observatory]]. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;eV. A huge air shower experiment called the [[Pierre Auger Observatory|Auger Project]] is currently operated at a site on the [[pampa]]s of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by [[James Cronin]], winner of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] from the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]] of the [[University of Leeds]]. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays.<ref name=auger-website>{{cite web | url=http://www.auger.org/observatory/ | title=Auger Observatory: A New Astrophysics Facility Rises from the Pampa | publisher=Auger Project | work=Pierre Auger Observatory | accessdate=2013-04-29 | author=Auger Project}}</ref> The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical [[Greisen<U+2013>Zatsepin<U+2013>Kuzmin limit]] to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the big bang origin of the universe.

In November 2007, the Auger Project team announced some preliminary results. These showed that the directions of origin of the 27 highest-energy events were strongly correlated with the locations of [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs). The results support the theory that at the centre of each AGN is a large [[black hole]] exerting a magnetic field strong enough to accelerate a bare proton to energies of 10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;eV and higher.<ref name=riesselmann-2007>{{cite journal | url=http://www.auger.org/observatory/outreach/on_the_trail.pdf | title=On the trail of cosmic bullets | author=Riesselmann, Kurt | journal=Symmetry |date=October<U+2013>November 2007 | volume=4 | issue=8<U+2013>9 | pages=16<U+2013>23}}</ref>

High-energy gamma rays (>50 MeV photons) were finally discovered in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO-3 satellite in 1967.<ref name=kraushaar-1972>{{cite journal | title=Title unknown | author=Kraushaar, W.

Since then, numerous satellite gamma-ray observatories have mapped the gamma-ray sky.  The most recent is the Fermi Observatory, which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy, and numerous point-like extra-galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere.

== Sources of cosmic rays ==
Early speculation on the sources of cosmic rays included a 1934 proposal by Baade and [[Fritz Zwicky|Zwicky]] suggesting cosmic rays originating from supernovae.<ref name=BaadeZwicky1934>{{cite jstor|86841}}</ref>  A 1948 proposal by [[Horace W. Babcock]] suggested that magnetic variable stars could be a source of cosmic rays.<ref name=babcock-1948>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRev.74.489}}</ref> Subsequently in 1951, Y. Sediko ''et al.'' identified the [[Crab Nebula]] as a source of cosmic rays.<ref name=sediko-1951>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRev.83.658.2}}</ref> Since then, a wide variety of potential sources for cosmic rays began to surface, including [[supernova]]e, [[active galactic nuclei]], [[quasar]]s, and [[gamma-ray burst]]s.<ref name=cosmicraysources>{{cite web|last=Gibb|first=Meredith|title=Cosmic Rays|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/cosmic_rays.html|work=Imagine the Universe|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=17 March 2013|date=3 February 2010}}</ref>
[[File:PIA16938-RadiationSources-InterplanetarySpace.jpg|thumb|left|Sources of Ionizing Radiation in Interplanetary Space.]]
Later experiments have helped to identify the sources of cosmic rays with greater certainty. In 2009, a paper presented at the [[International Cosmic Ray Conference]] (ICRC) by scientists at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] showed [[ultra-high energy cosmic ray]]s (UHECRs) originating from a location in the sky very close to the [[radio galaxy]] [[Centaurus A]], although the authors specifically stated that further investigation would be required to confirm Cen A as a source of cosmic rays.<ref name=auger-2009-1>{{cite conference | url=http://www.auger.org/technical_info/ICRC2009/arxiv_astrophysics.pdf | title=Correlation of the Highest Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects in Pierre Auger Observatory Data | accessdate=17 March 2013 | author=Hague, J.

[[File:Atmospheric Collision.svg|right|400 px|thumb|Primary cosmic particle collides with a molecule of atmosphere.]]
Cosmic rays originate as primary cosmic rays, which are those originally produced in various astrophysical processes. Primary cosmic rays are composed primarily of protons and [[alpha particle]]s (99%), with a small amount of heavier nuclei (~1%) and an extremely minute proportion of [[positron]]s and [[antiproton]]s.<ref name=goddard-2012 /> Secondary cosmic rays, caused by a decay of primary cosmic rays as they impact an atmosphere, include [[neutron]]s, [[pion]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[muon]]s. Of these four, the latter three were first detected in cosmic rays.

===Primary cosmic rays===
Primary cosmic rays primarily originate from outside the [[Solar System]] and sometimes even the [[Milky Way]]. When they interact with Earth's atmosphere, they are converted to secondary particles. The mass ratio of helium to hydrogen nuclei, 28%, is similar to the primordial [[elemental abundance]] ratio of these elements, 24%.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are nuclear synthesis end products, products of the [[Big Bang]],{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} primarily [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]. These light nuclei appear in cosmic rays in much greater abundance (~1%) than in the solar atmosphere, where they are only about 10<sup><U+2212>11</sup> as abundant as [[helium]].

This abundance difference is a result of the way secondary cosmic rays are formed. Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] in a process termed [[cosmic ray spallation]]. Spallation is also responsible for the abundances of [[scandium]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]], and [[manganese]] [[ion]]s in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with [[interstellar medium|interstellar matter]].<ref name=koch-2012>{{cite journal | title=The relative abundances of the elements scandium to manganese in relativistic cosmic rays and the possible radioactive decay of manganese 54 | author=Koch, L.; Engelmann, J.

====Primary cosmic ray antimatter====
Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few [[antiproton]]s in primary cosmic rays, but these do not appear to be the products of large amounts of [[antimatter]] in the [[Big Bang]], or indeed complex antimatter in the later Universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two types of elementary anti-particles, both newly made in energetic processes.

Preliminary results from the presently-operating [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (''AMS-02'') on board the [[International Space Station]] show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 GeV to 250 GeV, with the fraction of positrons to electrons increasing at higher energies. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive [[dark matter]] particles.

Antiprotons arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Secondary antiprotons and propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy and heliosphere | author=Moskalenko, I.

There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as anti-helium nuclei (anti-alpha) particles, in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[Antihelium#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1<U+00D7>10<sup><U+2212>6</sup> for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Physics Reports |volume=366 |issue=6 |pages=331<U+2013>405 |date=August 2002 |author=AMS Collaboration |last2=Aguilar |first2=M. |last3=Alcaraz |first3=J. |last4=Allaby |first4=J. |last5=Alpat |first5=B. |last6=Ambrosi |first6=G. |last7=Anderhub |first7=H. |last8=Ao |first8=L. |last9=Arefiev |first9=A. |last10=Azzarello |title=The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station: Part I <U+2013> results from the test flight on the space shuttle |bibcode=2002PhR...366..331A |doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(02)00013-3 |first10=E. |last11=Babucci |first11=L. |last12=Baldini |first12=M. |last13=Basile |first13=D. |last14=Barancourt |first14=F. |last15=Barao |first15=G. |last16=Barbier |first16=G. |last17=Barreira |first17=R. |last18=Battiston |first18=R. |last19=Becker |first19=U. |last20=Becker |first20=L. |last21=Bellagamba |first21=P. |last22=B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9> |first22=J. |last23=Berdugo |first23=P. |last24=Berges |first24=B. |last25=Bertucci |first25=A. |last26=Biland |first26=S. |last27=Bizzaglia |first27=S. |last28=Blasko |first28=G. |last29=Boella |first29=M. |last30=Boschini |first30=M.|display-authors=29 }}</ref>

}}

=== Secondary cosmic rays ===
When cosmic rays enter the [[Earth's atmosphere]] they collide with [[molecule]]s, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces a cascade of lighter particles, a so-called [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] secondary radiation that rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, protons, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morison|first=Ian|title=Introduction to Astronomy and Cosmology|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-03333-3|page=198}}</ref> All of the produced particles stay within about one degree of the primary particle's path.

Typical particles produced in such collisions are [[neutron]]s and charged [[meson]]s such as positive or negative [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s. Some of these subsequently decay into [[muons]], which are able to reach the surface of the Earth, and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines. The muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors, such as [[cloud chamber]]s, [[bubble chamber]]s or [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time is an indication that all of the particles came from that event.

Cosmic rays impacting other planetary bodies in the Solar System are detected indirectly by observing high energy [[gamma ray]] emissions by gamma-ray telescope. These are distinguished from radioactive decay processes by their higher energies above &nbsp;about 10&nbsp;MeV.

===Cosmic-ray flux===
[[File:SpaceEnvironmentOverview From 19830101.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An overview of the space environment shows the relationship between the solar activity and galactic cosmic rays.<ref>{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] |url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html}}</ref>]]
The [[flux]] of incoming cosmic rays at the upper atmosphere is dependent on the [[solar wind]], the [[Earth's magnetic field]], and the energy of the cosmic rays. At distances of ~94&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun, the solar wind undergoes a transition, called the [[termination shock]], from supersonic to subsonic speeds. The region between the termination shock and the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] acts as a barrier to cosmic rays, decreasing the flux at lower energies (<U+2264> 1&nbsp;GeV) by about&nbsp;90%. However, the strength of the solar wind is not constant, and hence it has been observed that cosmic ray flux is correlated with solar activity.

In addition, the Earth's magnetic field acts to deflect cosmic rays from its surface, giving rise to the observation that the flux is apparently dependent on [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[azimuth|azimuth angle]]. The magnetic field lines deflect the cosmic rays towards the poles, giving rise to the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]].

The combined effects of all of the factors mentioned contribute to the flux of cosmic rays at Earth's surface. For 1 GeV particles, the rate of arrival is about 10,000 per square meter per second. At 1 TeV the rate is 1 particle per square meter per second. At 10 [[PeV]] there are only a few particles per square meter per year. Particles above 10 [[EeV]] arrive only at a rate of about one particle per square kilometer per year, and above 100 EeV at a rate of about one particle per square kilometer per century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auger.org/cosmic_rays/faq.html#how_many |title=Pierre Auger Observatory |publisher=Auger.org |date=|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

In the past, it was believed that the cosmic ray flux remained fairly constant over time. However, recent research suggests 1.5 to 2-fold millennium-timescale changes in the cosmic ray flux in the past forty thousand years.<ref>

The magnitude of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very comparable to that of other deep space energies: cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron-volt per cubic centimeter of interstellar space, or ~1 eV/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0.3 eV/cm<sup>3</sup>, the galactic magnetic field energy density (assumed 3 microgauss) which is ~0.25 eV/cm<sup>3</sup>, or the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) radiation energy density at ~ 0.25 eV/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite book|title=Planets, Stars, and Stellar Systems|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-8817-8|author=Castellina, Antonella; Donato, Fiorenza|edition=1|authorlink=Astrophysics of Galactic charged cosmic rays|editor=Oswalt, T.D McLean, I.S.; Bond, H.E.; French, L.; Kalas, P.; Barstow, M.; Gilmore,G.F.; Keel, W.}}</ref>

== Detection methods ==
[[File:VERITAS array.jpg|thumb|600px|The [[VERITAS]] array of air Cherenkov telescopes.]]There are several ground-based methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use. The first detection method is called the air Cherenkov telescope, designed to detect low-energy (<200&nbsp;GeV) cosmic rays by means of analyzing their [[Cherenkov radiation]], which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster than the [[speed of light]] in their medium, the atmosphere.<ref name=losalamos-2002>{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/milagro/detecting.shtml | title=The Detection of Cosmic Rays | publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory | work=Milagro Gamma-Ray Observatory | accessdate=22 February 2013 | date=3 April 2002}}</ref> While these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, and have very small fields of view and are only active for a few percent of the time. Another Cherenkov telescope uses water as a medium through which particles pass and produce Cherenkov radiation to make them detectable.<ref name=michiganstate>{{cite web |url=http://www.nscl.msu.edu/files/PAN%20cosmic%20ray%20articles.pdf | title=What are cosmic rays? |publisher=Michigan State University National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory | accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

Extensive air shower (EAS) arrays, a second detection method, measure the charged particles which pass through them. EAS arrays measure much higher-energy cosmic rays than air Cherenkov telescopes, and can observe a broad area of the sky and can be active about 90% of the time. However, they are less able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air Cherenkov telescopes. EAS arrays employ plastic [[scintillator]]s in order to detect particles.

Another method was developed by Robert Fleischer, [[P. Buford Price|P.&nbsp;Buford Price]], and [[Robert M. Walker (physicist)|Robert&nbsp;M. Walker]] for use in high-altitude balloons.<ref name="FPW">

}}</ref> In this method, sheets of clear plastic, like 0.25&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] [[Lexan]] polycarbonate, are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude. The nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or [[ionization]] in the plastic. At the top of the plastic stack the ionization is less, due to the high cosmic ray speed. As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack, the ionization increases along the path. The resulting plastic sheets are "etched" or slowly dissolved in warm caustic [[sodium hydroxide]] solution, that removes the surface material at a slow, known rate. The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic. The net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic. The etch pits are measured under a high-power microscope (typically 1600x oil-immersion), and the etch rate is plotted as a function of the depth in the stacked plastic.

This technique yields a unique curve for each atomic nucleus from 1 to&nbsp;92, allowing identification of both the charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack. The more extensive the ionization along the path, the higher the charge. In addition to its uses for cosmic-ray detection, the technique is also used to detect nuclei created as products of [[nuclear fission]].

A fourth method involves the use of [[cloud chamber]]s<ref name=chess-2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.cornell.edu/Outreach/document/cloudchamber.pdf | title=Cloud Chambers and Cosmic Rays: A Lesson Plan and Laboratory Activity for the High School Science Classroom | publisher=[[Cornell University]] [[Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics]] | year=2006 | accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref> to detect the secondary muons created when a pion decays. Cloud chambers in particular can be built from widely available materials and can be constructed even in a high-school laboratory. A fifth method, involving [[bubble chamber]]s, can be used to detect cosmic ray particles.<ref name=chu-1970>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.24.917}}</ref>

=== Changes in atmospheric chemistry ===
Cosmic rays ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, which leads to a number of chemical reactions. One of the reactions results in ozone depletion. Cosmic rays are also responsible for the continuous production of a number of [[Radionuclide|unstable isotopes]] in the Earth's atmosphere, such as [[carbon-14]], via the reaction:

=== Role in ambient radiation ===
Cosmic rays constitute a fraction of the annual radiation exposure of human beings on the Earth, averaging 0.39 mSv out of a total of 3 mSv per year (13% of total background) for the Earth's population. However, the background radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, from 0.3 mSv per year for sea-level areas to 1.0 mSv per year for higher-altitude cities, raising cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of total background radiation exposure for populations of said cities. Airline crews flying long distance high-altitude routes can be exposed to 2.2 mSv of extra radiation each year due to cosmic rays, nearly doubling their total ionizing radiation exposure.

=== Effect on electronics ===
Cosmic rays have sufficient energy to alter the states of circuit components in [[electronics|electronic]] [[integrated circuit]]s, causing transient errors to occur, such as corrupted data in [[random access memory|electronic memory devices]], or incorrect performance of [[CPU]]s, often referred to as "[[soft error]]s" (not to be confused with software errors caused by programming mistakes/bugs). This has been a problem in extremely high-altitude [[electronics]], such as in [[satellite]]s, but with [[transistor]]s becoming smaller and smaller, this is becoming an increasing concern in ground-level electronics as well.<ref>[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/401/curtis.html ''IBM experiments in soft fails in computer electronics (1978<U+2013>1994)''], from [http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd40-1.html ''Terrestrial cosmic rays and soft errors''], IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1996. Retrieved 16 April 2008.</ref> Studies by [[IBM]] in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] per month.<ref>{{cite web |author = [[Scientific American]]|coauthors = |date = 2008-07-21|title = Solar Storms: Fast Facts|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=solar-storms-fast-facts|publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]]|accessdate = 2009-12-08}}</ref> To alleviate this problem, the [[Intel Corporation]] has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high-density [[microprocessor]]s, allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic-ray event.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7335322.stm ''Intel plans to tackle cosmic ray threat''], BBC News Online, 8 April 2008. Retrieved 16 April 2008.</ref>

Cosmic rays are suspected as a possible cause of an in-flight incident in 2008 where an [[Airbus A330]] airliner of [[Qantas]] twice [[Qantas Flight 72|plunged hundreds of feet]] after an unexplained malfunction in its flight control system. Many passengers and crew members were injured, some seriously. After this incident, the accident investigators determined that the airliner's flight control system had received a data spike that could not be explained, and that all systems were in perfect working order. This has prompted a software upgrade to all A330 and A340 airliners, worldwide, so that any data spikes in this system are filtered out electronically.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,26370596-5014090,00.html ''Cosmic rays may have hit Qantas plane off the coast of North West Australia''], News.com.au, 18 November 2009.

=== Significance to space travel ===
{{Main|Health threat from cosmic rays}}
[[Galactic cosmic ray]]s are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft.
Cosmic rays also pose a threat to electronics placed aboard outgoing probes. In 2010, a malfunction aboard the [[Voyager 2]] space probe was credited to a single flipped bit, probably caused by a cosmic ray. Strategies such as physical or magnetic shielding for spacecraft have been considered in order to minimize the damage to electronics and human beings caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=globus-2002>{{cite web | url=http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html |title=Appendix E: Mass Shielding | publisher=NASA | work=Space Settlements: A Design Study | date=10 July 2002 |accessdate=24 February 2013 | author=Globus, Al}}</ref><ref name=atkinson-2005>{{cite news | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/308/1 |title=Magnetic shielding for spacecraft | work=The Space Review | date=24 January 2005 | accessdate=24 February 2013 | author=Atkinson, Nancy}}</ref>

=== Role in lightning ===
Cosmic rays have been implicated in the triggering of electrical breakdown in [[lightning]]. It has been proposed that essentially all lightning is triggered through a relativistic process, "[[runaway breakdown]]", seeded by cosmic ray secondaries. Subsequent development of the lightning discharge then occurs through "conventional breakdown" mechanisms.<ref>[http://www.aip.org/pt/vol-58/iss-5/p37.shtml ''Runaway Breakdown and the Mysteries of Lightning''], Physics Today, May 2005.</ref>

=== Postulated role in climate change ===
{{POV-section|date=February 2014}} 
A role of cosmic rays directly or via solar-induced modulations in climate change was suggested by [[Edward P.

H. | pmid = 20566872 | pmc = 2901439 | last2 = Prall }}</ref> the idea has been revived in recent years, most notably by [[Henrik Svensmark]], who has argued that because solar variations modulate the cosmic ray flux on Earth, they would consequently affect the rate of cloud formation and hence the climate.<ref>{{cite web | last = Long | first = Marion | title = Sun's Shifts May Cause Global Warming | publisher = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | date = 25 June 2007 | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jul/the-discover-interview-henrik-svensmark/ | accessdate = 7 July 2013}}</ref>  Nevertheless, it has been noted by climate scientists actively publishing in the field{{who|date=April 2014}} that Svensmark has inconsistently altered data on most of his published work on the subject, an example being adjustment of cloud data that understates error in lower cloud data, but not in high cloud data.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Benestad | first = Rasmus E. | title = 'Cosmoclimatology' <U+2013> tired old arguments in new clothes | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/cosmoclimatology-tired-old-arguments-in-new-clothes/ | accessdate = 13 November 2013 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The 2007 IPCC synthesis report, however, strongly attributes a major role in the ongoing global warming to human-produced gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons, and has stated that models including natural forcings only (including aerosol forcings, which cosmic rays are considered by some to contribute to) would result in far less warming than has actually been observed or predicted in models including anthropogenic forcings.<ref name=IPCC-2007>{{cite conference

Svensmark, being one of several scientists [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|outspokenly opposed against the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming]], has found eminence among the popular culture movement that [[Climate change denial|denies the scientific consensus]].  Despite this, Svensmark's work exaggerating the magnitude of the effect of GCR on global warming continues to be refuted in the mainstream science.<ref>{{cite web | last = Plait | first = Phil | title = No, a new study does not show cosmic-rays are connected to global warming | publisher = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | date = 31 August 2011 | url = http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/31/no-a-new-study-does-not-show-cosmic-rays-are-connected-to-global-warming/ | accessdate = 7 July 2013}}</ref>  For instance, a November 2013 study showed that less than 14 percent of global warming since the 1950s could be attributed to cosmic ray rate, and while the models showed a small correlation every 22 years, the cosmic ray rate did not match the changes in temperature, indicating that it was not a causal relationship.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sloan | first = T. | last2 = Wolfendale | first2 = A.W. | title = Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate | publisher = [[Environmental Research Letters]] | date = November 7, 2013 | doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045022 }}</ref>
