[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|250px|[[J. Howard Miller]]'s "We Can Do It!" poster from 1943]]
"'''We Can Do It!'''" is an American [[Second World War|wartime]] [[propaganda]] poster produced by [[J. Howard Miller]] in 1943 for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] as an inspirational image to boost worker morale. The poster is generally thought to be based on a [[black-and-white]] [[News agency|wire service]] photograph taken of a [[Michigan]] factory worker named [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff]].

The poster was seen very little during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called "We Can Do It!" but also called "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The "We Can Do It!" image was used to promote [[feminism]] and other political issues beginning in the 1980s.<ref name=MythMisconception2006>{{cite journal |first1=James J. |last1=Kimble |first2=Lester C. |last2=Olson |title=Visual Rhetoric Representing Rosie the Riveter: Myth and Misconception in J.

It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the first woman becoming [[prime minister of Australia]]. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].<ref name=MythMisconception2006/>

After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder.<ref name=Design4Victory>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SSNo6on0F8EC&pg=PA78 |page=78 |title=Design for Victory: World War II posters on the American home front |first1=William L. |last1=Bird |first2=Harry R. |last2=Rubenstein |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=1998 |isbn=1-56898-140-6}}</ref> Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.

==Background==
[[File:TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT - KEEP `EM FIRING - NARA - 515856.jpg|thumb|upright|A propaganda poster from 1942 encouraging unity between labor and management of [[General Motors|GM]]]]
After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the US government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as [[General Motors]] (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the [[United Auto Workers]] union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, "Together We Can Do It!" and "Keep 'Em Firing!"<ref name=BirdRubenstein58>Bird/Rubenstein 1998, [http://books.google.com/books?id=gaRRtWEH2pgC&pg=PA58 p. 58].</ref> In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.<ref name=BirdRubenstein58/>

===Westinghouse Electric===
In 1942, [[Pittsburgh]] artist [[J. Howard Miller]] was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers.<ref name=MythMisconception2006/><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7h4T1DWEECUC&pg=PA62 |page=62 |title=Smokey, Rosie, and You! |first1=David A. |last1=Ehrlich |first2=Alan R. |last2=Minton |first3=Diane |last3=Stoy |publisher=Hillcrest Publishing Group |year=2007 |isbn=1-934248-33-9}}</ref> The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words "Any Questions About Your Work?&nbsp;... Ask your Supervisor."<ref name=MythMisconception2006/><ref name=Design4Victory/>

==Rosie the Riveter==
{{Main|Rosie the Riveter}}
During World War II, the "We Can Do It!" poster was not connected to the 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter", nor to the widely seen [[Norman Rockwell]] painting called ''Rosie the Riveter'' that appeared on the cover of the [[Memorial Day]] issue of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed "Rosie" who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades.<ref name=latimes/><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&pg=PA606 |page=606 |title=World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia |volume=1 |first1=William H. |last1=Young |first2=Nancy K. |last2=Young |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=0-313-35652-1}}</ref> Other "Rosie" images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but "We Can Do It!" was not part of it.<ref name=Secrets2011/>

Rockwell's emblematic ''Rosie the Riveter'' painting was loaned by the ''Post'' to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] for use in posters and campaigns promoting [[war bond]]s. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value<U+2014>it sold for nearly $5&nbsp;million in 2002.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F5wukQLkavoC&pg=PA399 |page=399 |title=American Women during World War II: an encyclopedia |last=Weatherford |first=Doris |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=0-415-99475-6 |year=2009}}</ref> Conversely, the lack of protection for the "We Can Do It!" image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth.<ref name=loc/>

Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female [[riveter]]s during the war, so the recent association with "Rosie the Riveter" was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at [[We Can Do It!#Westinghouse Electric|women who were making helmet liners]] out of [[Micarta]]. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named "Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker."<ref name=CushingDrescher2009/>

==Geraldine Hoff photograph==
[[File:Geraldine Hoff Doyle.jpg|1942 photograph of [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff]]|thumb|right|upright]]
Miller is believed by many to have based the "We Can Do It!" poster on a monochrome [[United Press International]] (UPI) photograph taken of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], factory worker [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff]] in early 1942 when she was 17.<ref name=latimes/><ref name=NYT2010>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30doyle.html |title=Geraldine Doyle, Iconic Face of World War II, Dies at 86 |date=December 29, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Timothy |work=The New York Times }}</ref><ref name=NPR>{{cite web|last=Memmot |first=Mark |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/30/132484640/michigan-woman-who-inspired-wwii-rosie-poster-has-died |title=Michigan Woman Who Inspired WWII 'Rosie' Poster Has Died |publisher=NPR |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}</ref> The photograph of Hoff shows her wearing a polka-dotted [[bandana]] on her head, standing up and leaning over a [[Stamping (metalworking)|metal-stamping machine]], and operating it with her hands at thigh level firmly on the controls.<ref name=NPR/> Hoff left her factory job soon after the publicity photograph was taken; she heard that the metal-stamping machine had injured the hand of the previous operator, and she did not want to ruin her ability to play the [[cello]].<ref name=latimes>{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-geraldine-hoff-doyle-20101231,0,1376340.story |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle dies at 86; inspiration behind a famous wartime poster |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 31, 2010}}</ref> She obtained a new job as a [[timekeeper]] for another factory.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Michigan History Magazine |volume=78 |pages=54<U+2013>55 |year=1994 |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle |last=Schimpf |first=Sheila |publisher=Michigan Department of State}}</ref>

If Miller was inspired by the UPI photograph at all, he freely re-interpreted it to create the poster, putting Hoff's right hand up in a clenched fist, her left hand rolling up the right sleeve. Miller turned Hoff's head to face the viewer, and made her more muscular. He also put a Westinghouse employee identification badge on her collar.<ref name=MythMisconception2006/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/01/04/myth-making-and-the-we-can-do-it-poster/ |last=Sharp |first=Gwen |date=January 4, 2011 |title=Myth-Making and the 'We Can Do It!'

Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that he doubted Doyle's connection to the image. He said Miller was not in the habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of ''Rosie the Riveter: Women working on the home front in World War II'', said that she and Ruch could not determine whether the UPI photo of Doyle had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pennycolman.com/my-books/rosie-the-riveter-image/ |title=Rosie the Riveter Image |date=December 30, 2010 |last=Coleman |first=Penny |publisher=PennyColeman.com |accessdate=January 24, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428052725/http://www.pennycolman.com/my-books/rosie-the-riveter-image/|archivedate=April 28, 2011}}</ref>

In 1982, Doyle saw the "We Can Do It!" poster reproduced in a magazine article, possibly "Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake", a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post Magazine'']] article about posters in the collection of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Brennan |title=Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake |work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]] |date=May 23, 1982 |page=35}}</ref> Doyle immediately recognized it as an image of herself, though she had never seen it before.<ref name=NYT2010/>

In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote [[feminism]].

[[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters.

Doyle gained a degree of notice from the connection to the iconic image. From time to time, she visited the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] to sign posters and greet well-wishers. She said it was probably best that she had not known in her youth that she was represented on a famous poster: "I couldn't have handled all the excitement then."<ref name=latimes/>
