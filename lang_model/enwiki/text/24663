'''Digital forensics''' (sometimes ''Digital forensic science'') is a branch of [[forensic science]] encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices.<ref name="ijde-2002" /><ref name="carrier" /> The term was originally used as a synonym for [[Computer forensics]] but has expanded to cover other devices capable of [[Computer data storage|storing digital data]].<ref name="ijde-2002" /> Digital forensic investigations are generally much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the aim is usually to provide answers to a series of simpler questions).<ref name="df-basics"/> The discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s and it was not until the early 2000s that national policies were created.

The discipline includes several sub-branches; [[Computer forensics]], [[Network forensics]], [[Database forensics]], [[Mobile device forensics]] and Firewall forensics

==History==

In response to growth in computer crime (and the introduction of specific computer crime laws) during the 1980s and 90s law enforcement agencies began to establish specialized investigative groups, usually at the national level.<ref name="casey" /> During the 1990s demand for the national resources was high leading to the creation of regional and even local units. According to GL Palmer<ref name="palmer" /> and M Reith<ref name="ijde-2002" /> digital forensics evolved, during this time, from a number of ad-hoc tools and techniques rather than from the scientific community (in contrast to other forensic sciences). The rapid development of the discipline resulted in a lack of standardization and training. In his 1995 book,<ref name="rosenblatt" /><ref name="casey"/> "High-Technology Crime: Investigating Cases Involving Computers", K Rosenblatt writes:
{{cquote| Seizing, preserving, and analyzing evidence stored on a computer is the greatest forensic challenge  facing law enforcement in the 1990's. Although most forensic tests, such as fingerprinting and DNA testing, are performed by specially trained experts the task of collecting and analyzing computer evidence is often assigned to patrol officers and detectives}}
In 2002, in response to this need, the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) published it's "Best practices for Computer Forensics"<ref name="SWGDE" />

==Branches==
{{Expand|section|date=August 2010}}
Digital forensics includes several sub-branches relating to the investigation of various types of devices, media or artefacts.

===Computer forensics===
{{Main|Computer forensics}}

The goal of computer forensics is to explain the current state of a digital artifact; such as a computer system, storage medium or electronic document.<ref name="cf-education">{{cite web|title=Computer forensics education|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1.9510&rep=rep1&type=pdf|publisher=IEEE Security & Privacy|accessdate=26 July 2010|author=A Yasinsac|coauthors=RF Erbacher, DG Marks, MM Pollitt|year=2003}}</ref> The discipline usually covers computers, [[embedded system]]s (digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).

===Mobile device forensics===
{{Main|Mobile device forensics}}

Mobile device forensics is a sub-branch of digital forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or data from a [[mobile device]]. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. [[GSM]]) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communcations (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data.<ref name="casey" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Technology Crime Investigation :: Mobile forensics|url=http://www.daemon.be/maarten/forensics.html#mob|accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref>

===Network forensics===
{{Main|Network forensics}}

Network forensics relates to  to the monitoring and analysis of [[computer network]] traffic for the purposes of information gathering, legal evidence or intrusion detection.<ref>Gary Palmer, A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research, Report from DFRWS 2001, First Digital Forensic Research Workshop, Utica, New York, August 7 <U+2013> 8, 2001,  Page(s) 27<U+2013>30</ref>

===Information forensics===
{{Main|Information forensics}}

Information forensics is the science of investigation into systemic processes that produce [[information]]. 

===Database forensics===
{{Main|Database forensics}}

Database forensics is a branch of digital forensics relating to in-depth exploration of databases and their related meta-data.

===Firewall forensics===

Firewall forensics relates to the forensic analysis of firewall logs.
