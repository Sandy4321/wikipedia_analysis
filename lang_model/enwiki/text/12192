The following is a list of appearances made by '''kitsune''' (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. For information on ''kitsune'' in traditional Japanese culture, please see [[kitsune|the main article]].

Embedded in popular folklore as they are, ''[[kitsune]]'' have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works.  A few Western authors have also made use of the ''kitsune'' legends.  In [[anime]], ''kitsune'' are often depicted as ''[[kemonomimi]]'', usually as female, seductive, and fond of alcohol.  Specific depictions of ''kitsune'' include:

* [[Jewel Staite]] plays the role of a creature referred to as a "kitsune" in the "Girl Next Door" episode of [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)]].  Other than the fox-like eyes and claws, this version of a kitsune holds little in common with the traditional interpretation.

==''Kitsune'' in animation and comics==
* [[Shuichi Minamino]] <U+2014> the human alias of Kurama, a main character of ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'' <U+2014> is the reincarnation of a ''kitsune'' thief named Y<U+014D>ko Kurama.

* [[Shippo]] from ''[[InuYasha]]''.  As a nod to the shapeshifting abilities sometimes attributed to ''kitsune'', Shippo is capable of taking many forms through use of a green leaf on his head, in the manner of the [[tanuki]].
