Seip receives statewide honor for advocacy for children, seniors

 

HARRISBURG, Oct. 19 <U+2013> State Rep. Tim Seip recently received the State Social Worker of the Year award from the National Association of Social Workers <U+2013> Pennsylvania Chapter. 

 

Seip, the only licensed health-care professional in the House of Representatives, was chosen for the award for his advocacy for vulnerable Pennsylvanians, especially children and senior citizens.

 

Seip was unable to receive the award at an Oct. 3 event the association held in Mansfield since he had to be in Harrisburg to vote on budget-related legislation. Jenna Mehnert, executive director of the Pennsylvania chapter, presented him with the award Wednesday at the state Capitol.

 

Before Seip was first elected to the House in 2006, he was employed as a social worker for the Senior Behavioral Health Unit of the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Pottsville. Seip also served as the lead therapist for the Family Support Unit of ReDCo and was the Schuylkill County CASSP coordinator, where he worked with children and families in coordinating all of Schuylkill County<U+2019>s child-serving systems. Additionally, Seip worked as a social worker at the State Correctional Institution at Frackville in the Mental Health Unit.

 

Seip serves as secretary of the House Health and Human Services Committee and as a member of the House Environmental Resources and Energy, Finance and Labor Relations committees. He also serves on the board of directors of the Center for Rural Pennsylvania.

 

A lifelong Schuylkill County resident, he lives with his wife Starr and daughter Elisa in Washington Township, Schuylkill County.
