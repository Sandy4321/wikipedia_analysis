__NOTOC__ <!-- toc was bigger than the article! -->
'''Castle Bytham''' is a picturesque village of around 300 houses in [[South Kesteven]] in south [[Lincolnshire]] at {{gbmapping|SK990185}}. Overlooking the village is an 11th century [[Normans|Norman]] castle mound; the castle itself was destroyed by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in February 1221, even though he was only fourteen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Monuments listing for the castle|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=325283}}</ref> The site in Saxon times was owned by [[Morcar]], also known as Morkere, the brother-in-law of [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]]. His grandson married [[Lady Godiva]].

At one time the village was an important commercial centre for the surrounding agricultural communities, but it is now largely a [[Commuter town|dormitory]], although a number of farming families remain with a much reduced workforce.<ref name=ca>{{cite web|url=http://www.southkesteven.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=3799&p=0|title=SKDC conservation area report}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:UK CastleBytham.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Village sign in Castle Bytham]]
The nearest town is [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] (even though Castle Bytham is in the [[Grantham]] postal area, with a [[Nottingham]] [[Postal code|postcode]]). The village is very close to the [[Rutland]] boundary. The civil parish extends much to the north-west of the village, up to ''[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/121743 Woolley's Lane]'', including [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/121724 Red Barn Quarry], owned by Bullimores. It also extends westwards to include all of [[Morkery Wood]] - named after the Saxon earl Morcar mentioned above. Southwards, the civil parish extends to (and includes) Pillowsyke Holt, a piece of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/363150 woodland] near [[Careby Aunby and Holywell#Holywell|Holywell]]. Eastwards, the parish extends for about half a mile, where it includes Lawn Wood<ref name=LWT>{{Cite web|title=Lincolnshire wildlife trust - Lawn Wood|url=http://www.lincstrust.org.uk/reserves/nr/reserve.php?mapref=102}}</ref> which has been a nature reserve since 1995, joining two neighbouring meadows that were donated to [[Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust]] in 1993. The meadows are a good site for buttercups and [[yellow rattle]], and are managed to encourage butterflies, including the [[The Ringlet|ringlet]], and the [[Meadow Brown|meadow brown]]. The wood is mainly oak and [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], but includes [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Crataegus laevigata|midland hawthorn]] and the uncommon [[Sorbus torminalis|wild service tree]]; woodland flora such as [[Anemone nemorosa|wood anemone]], [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]] and [[Orchis mascula|early purple orchid]] also found there. [[Fallow Deer|Fallow deer]] and [[Red Deer|red deer]] are frequently seen in the reserve.<ref name=LWT/>

===Surrounding area===
About {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} to the east lies [[Little Bytham]]. The two villages used to be called West and East Bytham.<ref name=ca/>

To the west, on the western side of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] road, is [[South Witham]] near the source of the [[River Witham]].  

Between the village and the A1 the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust maintains an important wildlife reserve at Tortoiseshell Wood<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincolnshire wildlife trust - Tortoiseshell wood|url=http://www.lincstrust.org.uk/reserves/nr/reserve.php?mapref=57}}</ref> (which borders on to the west of the civil parish) and some of the road verges are protected for wildlife by [[Lincolnshire County Council]].

West of the village, towards [[Clipsham]], is a Yew Tree Avenue maintained by the [[Forestry Commission]], the trees cut into large [[topiary]] forms.

==The Community==

Castle Bytham has an active community that supports several events each year in the sizeable Village Hall.  The annual Midsummer Fair has raised over <U+00A3>40,000 for local causes, including a Christmas lunch for pensioners and a children's party, and various other infrastructure refinements have been made to the village from the proceeds.  Efforts are currently being made to improve the village recreation ground for the benefit of the local youngsters and more wide-ranging enhancements are suggested in the Parish Plan, which is due to be published soon (June 2010).

The village supports a shop in Pinfold Road, however the Post Office counter was closed in 2008 despite local opposition. This [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/269753 post office] had served a number of smaller villages nearby without such ameneties; these include [[Creeton]], [[Swinstead]], [[Swayfield]], [[Little Bytham]] and [[Clipsham]] <U+2013> it has now been replaced by a once-a-week 'outreach' service.  

There are two remaining pubs in the village: the ''[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1277263 Fox & Hounds]'' and the ''[http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=250 Castle Inn]''. Others, such as the New Inn in Station Road, were converted to housing in the 1960s.<ref name=ca/>

===Former railway station===
The village had a [[Castle Bytham railway station|railway station]] on the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]], the remains of which can still be seen. This station was rather unusual, being a single platform in a deep cutting through the village. The station was not originally planned by the railway, but was added after considerable local lobbying.<ref>{{cite book|title=Building a Railway: Bourne to Saxby|editor1-first=Stewart|editor1-last=Squires|editor2-first=Ken|editor2-last= Hollamby|publisher=Lincoln Record Society|year=2009|isbn=978-0901503862}}</ref><ref name=MP>{{cite book|title=Branch lines around Spalding: M&GN Saxby to Long Sutton|last=Back|first=Micheal|publisher=Middleton Press| year=2009}}</ref> It remained open, as did the goods yard on the other side of the road, until the line closed in 1959.<ref>{{cite book|title=British Railways Past and Present - 27  Lincolnshire|author=Roger Hill & Carey Vessey|publisher=Past & Present Publishing|year= 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=506989 |title=National monument record: railway station}}</ref><ref name=MP/><ref name=ca/>  West of the village the line of the railway now formshttp://parishes.lincolnshire.gov.uk/CastleBytham/ a road crossing under the A1.

==History==
[[Image:Castle Bytham Maypole Montage.jpg|thumb|right|<small>[[May Day]] celebrations, banned under the Commonwealth, were revived in 1660. The [[maypole]] at Castle Bytham was inscribed to commemorate the date when it was later cut in half for use as a ladder in the church tower</small>]]
*''See [[Bytham River]] for details of the postulated [[ice age]] watercourse that takes its name from the village.''

The church is dedicated to [[Saint James the Great|St James]] and is one of a group of parishes in the rural deanery of [[Beltisloe]]. It contains an unusual memento of the [[English Restoration]]: a ladder, formerly used in the tower, with a carved inscription which reads ''THIS WARE THE MAY POVL 1660'' (''see photographs''), suggesting that [[May Day|May celebrations]] were held in the village (as they were throughout the country) to mark the return to the throne of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].

There was at one time a [[Methodism|Methodist]] chapel in High Street (now a private house), served by visiting ministers from [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stamfordrutlandmethodists.org.uk/Circuit%20history.htm|title=Methodist circuit's own history}}</ref><!--Does not give closure date, 'tis true, but best you are likely to get--> On its closure in 1972 the Methodist Circuit still sent a preacher to the village for a few years, service taking place in the parish church.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Midsummer Fair==
Every year the villagers organise their popular Midsummer Fair and Street Market.  This year, 2010, it is due to take place on Sunday, 20 June, and as always it aims to be a great family day out, with 60-plus stalls, a duck grand prix, a dog show, funfair, kids games, beer festivals and barbecues, and much more besides.  Last year broke all records, attracting over 2,000 cars.  The websites listed below have more details.
