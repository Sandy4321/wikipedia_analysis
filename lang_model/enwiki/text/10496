==Biography==
===Personal life===
Chesley V. Morton, Jr. was born in [[Miami, Florida]] on August 21, 1951 to Chesley V. Morton, Sr. and Anne M. Morton (unrelated). In 1953, Morton, Sr. moved the family to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] where he established a law practice. Morton attended [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] schools. While studying in [[Prague, Czechoslovakia]], in 1968, the [[Warsaw Pact]] invaded that country. Morton and other American students were among the first foreigners evacuated after the military invasion. He graduated from [[Nova High School]] ([[Davie, Florida]]) in 1969 and was accepted to [[Florida State University]], majoring in Broadcast Communications. After graduation, he found work covering political events as still photographer and TV [[cameraman]] for the [[Florida Public Broadcasting Service]] program ''Today in the Legislature''.<ref name="LeRoy">[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00395.x/abstract]| "Today in the Legislature" A Florida Story. David J. LeRoy, C. Edward Wotring, Jack Lyle. Journal of Communication. Volume 24, Issue 3. p.92-98 Sept 1974</ref> In 1976 he moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] where he attended Woodrow Wilson School of Law, later transferring to [[Atlanta Law School]]. While attending night law school, Morton worked as a [[paralegal]], and later served as a [[Deputy Sheriff]] in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]].   

Morton married in 1986 and divorced in 1990. The couple had one child. Since 1985 he has worked as a stockbroker and as a securities industry [[arbitrator]] for the [[dispute resolution]] forums of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD now [[FINRA]]).

===Georgia House of Representatives===
Chesley V. Morton was elected to four terms in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] beginning in 1983, serving as State Representative from the 47th District for eight years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2001_02/fulltext/hr1285.htm |title=HR1285.html |publisher=.legis.ga.gov |date=2002-06-15 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref> The district included portions of [[Chamblee, Georgia|Chamblee]], [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]], [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker]], and unincorporated [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]]. He was a member of the [[Georgia House of Representatives#List of Committees|Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, Banks and Banking, Regulated Beverages]] committees. During his tenure, he was the [[Ranking member|ranking republican]] on the Agriculture and Consumer Affairs committee. 

====Animal protection & Humane euthanasia====
Representative Morton sponsored the ''Georgia Animal Protection Act'' of 1986, one of the earliest comprehensive animal protection measures in the United States. The law was enacted in response to the inhumane treatment of [[companion animals]] by a [[pet store]] chain in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agr.georgia.gov/animalprotection.aspx |title=Animal Protection - Ga Dept of Agriculture |publisher=Agr.georgia.gov |date= |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> The Act provided for the licensing and regulation of pet shops, stables, kennels, and animal shelters, and established, for the first time, minimum standards of care. The Georgia Department of Agriculture was tasked with enforcing the law through the Department's newly created Animal Protection Division. Representative Morton then sponsored an additional provision, added in 1990, known as the ''Humane Euthanasia Act'', which was the first state law to mandate intravenous injection of [[sodium pentothal]] in place of [[gas chamber]]s and other less humane methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-chambers/law/289 |title=Georgia Humane Euthansia Act, O.C.G.A. <U+00C2><U+00A7>4-11-5.1 |publisher=Animal Law Coalition |date= |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-chambers/article/290 |title=Judge Issues Permanent Injunction Against Illegal Use of Gas Chambers in Georgia |publisher=Animal Law Coalition |date= |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Commissioner [[Tommy Irvin]] and the Georgia Department of Agriculture were required, in their licensing of animal shelters, to enforce the new humane [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] law. However, [[Commissioner of Agriculture|Commissioner]] Irvin failed to abide by the terms of the law,<ref>http://tiftongazette.com/local/x323686581/Wells-I-did-what-I-was-told/print</ref><ref>http://www.wistv.com/story/6225570/georgia-agriculture-commissioner-gassing-of-strays-is-local-issue?clienttype=printable</ref> and instead continued to license gas chambers. In March 2007, Morton sued the Georgia Department of Agriculture and Commissioner Irvin.<ref>http://www.kittyvillage.com/morton_v_irvin.pdf</ref> The [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] Superior Court ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs,<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,260743,00.html</ref> validating the terms of the Humane Euthanasia Act, with an [[injunction]] prohibiting the Department from issuing licenses to shelters using gas chambers in violation of the Act. When the Department continued to license a gas chamber in [[Cobb County, Georgia]] a second court action was brought, which resulted in the Department being held in [[contempt of court|contempt]].<ref>http://www.myatltv.com/article_watl.aspx?storyid=105335</ref><ref>http://www.11alive.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=105335</ref> The cases received widespread coverage in the media, casting Irvin in an unfavorable light.

====Penny Stock Law====
The [[State of Georgia]] was the first state to [[codification (law)|codify]] a comprehensive [[penny stock]] securities law.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/business/fi-532_1_penny-stock</ref> Secretary of State [[Max Cleland]], whose office enforced State securities laws<ref>http://www.sos.ga.gov/securities/</ref> was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Morton, the only [[stockbroker]] in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] at the time, was a principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. It was eventually upheld in [[U.S. District Court]],<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/111783/GEORGIA-LAW-WONT-HURT-BROKERS-JUDGE-RULES.html?pg=all,</ref> and the [[statute]] became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly after enactment of the Georgia law, both FINRA and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either closing or greatly restricting broker/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson & Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/business/penny-stock-fraud-from-both-sides-now.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm</ref>
