'''Richard Barre''' (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1130 <U+2013> ''c.'' 1202) was a medieval English justice, clergyman, and scholar. He was educated at the law school of Bologna, and entered royal service under King [[Henry II of England]], later working for Henry's son and successor [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son [[Henry the Young King]]. Barre served the elder Henry as a diplomat, and was involved in a minor way with the king's quarrel with [[Thomas Becket]], which earned Barre a condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal justice during Richard's reign, and was one of the main judges in the period from 1194 to 1199. During the reign of King [[John of England|John]], Barre was no longer employed as a judge owing to earlier disagreements with John. Barre was the author of a work of [[Bible|Biblical]] extracts dedicated to one of his patrons, [[William Longchamp]], the [[Bishop of Ely]] and [[Chancellor of England]].

==Early life==
Whether Barre was a native of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his surname appears to derive from the Norman village of [[La Barre-en-Ouche|La Barre]], near [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]], in the present-day department of [[Eure]].<ref name=Barre182/> He was likely born around 1130.<ref name=DNB/> Barre was related to the [[Sifrewast family]],{{#tag:ref|The Sifrewast family was from Normandy, near the place called now Chiffrevast at [[Tamerville]] near [[Valognes]].<ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} knights in [[Berkshire]], and had a relative, Hugh Barre, who was [[Archdeacon of Leicester]] in the 1150s.  Barre studied law at [[Bologna]] in Italy before 1150, and was a student there with [[Stephen of Tournai]], who became [[Bishop of Tournai]] in 1192.<ref name=Barre182/> Another fellow student wrote a short verse addressed to Barre: "''Pontificum causas regumque negocia tractes, Qui tibi divicias deliciasque parant''" which translates to "May you manage the causes of bishops and the affairs of kings, Who provide riches and delights for you."<ref name=QDuggan26>Quoted and translated in Duggan "Roman, Canon, and Common Law in Twelfth-Century England" ''Historical Research'' p. 26</ref> After finishing his schooling, Barre seems to have worked for either [[Robert de Chesney]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], or Nicholas, [[Archdeacon of Huntingdon]]; the main evidence for this is that Barre witnessed charters for both men from 1160 to 1164. By 1165, Barre had joined the household of King Henry II of England.<ref name=Barre182>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 182<U+2013>185</ref>

==Service to King Henry==
Barre served King Henry during the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who had gone into exile in 1164 over the dispute about the limits of royal authority over the English Church.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192<U+2013>195</ref> Because of Barre's close ties to King Henry, Becket considered him one of the king's "evil counselors", and Barre was the subject of denunciations by the archbishop.<ref name=Barre186/> In late August 1169, Barre was in Normandy with Henry, where Barre was part of a group of ecclesiastics advising the king on how to resolve the [[Becket controversy|Becket dispute]].<ref name=Becket189>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 189</ref>{{#tag:ref|This group advising the king included two continental archbishops <U+2013> from [[Archbishop of Rouen|Rouen]] and [[Archbishop of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], a number of bishops <U+2013> including all the Norman bishops, other French bishops and an English bishop, and abbots from Norman, Breton, and English monasteries. The assemblage was rounded out by scholars such as [[Geoffrey of Auxerre]] and royal clerks such as [[Geoffrey Ridel (bishop of Ely)|Geoffrey Ridel]] and [[John of Oxford]]. However, although [[Gilbert Foliot]], one of the main opponents of Becket was in the area, he was not able to consult with the king because he was excommunicate.<ref name=Becket189/>|group=notes}} In September 1169, Barre was sent along with two other clerks to Rome to complain about the behaviour of papal envoys during negotiations with Becket held at the beginning of September.  The papal negotiators at first agreed to a compromise, but the next day claimed that the proposal was unacceptable. With the failure of the negotiations, Becket restored the sentences of [[excommunicate|excommunication]] on a number of royal officials, but Barre was not included among those specifically named even though many of his colleagues were. The historian [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] argues that Barre was not specifically named in the restoration of excommunications, as Becket considered him already excommunicated because of his association with those under the church's ban.<ref name=Becket190>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 190<U+2013>192</ref>

During January and February 1170 the king sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket.<ref name=Barre186>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 186<U+2013>187</ref> The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful;<ref name=DNB/> rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] over this usurpation of the right of the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir.<ref name=Warren501>Warren ''Henry II'' pp. 501<U+2013>502</ref> Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.<ref name=Becket204>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 204</ref>{{#tag:ref|Alexander had earlier given permission for the coronation, likely in June 1161, but in 1166 Alexander revoked the permission at the instigation of Becket.<ref name=Warren501/>|group=notes}}

After Becket's murder in December 1170<ref name=Huscroft192/> King Henry sent Barre to Rome, accompanied by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of <U+00C9>vreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy.<ref name=HenryII305>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 305</ref> The mission's objective was to make it clear to Alexander that Henry had had nothing to do with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope.<ref name=DNB/> Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an [[Papal interdict|interdict]], or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king.<ref name=Barre186/><ref name=Coredon164>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms & Phrases'' p. 164</ref> Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171.<ref name=Barre186/> In September he was named a royal justice.<ref name=Sharpe128>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compedium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 128</ref> He was named [[chancellor]] to King Henry's eldest living son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's seal.<ref name=Barre186/>

As well as the Lisieux archdeaconry, Barre held the [[prebend]] of Hurstborne and Burbage in the [[Diocese of Salisbury]] from 1177,<ref name=Hurst>Greenway ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34256 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 4: Salisbury: Prebendaries of Hurstborne and Burbage]''</ref> and the prebend of Moreton and Whaddon in the [[Diocese of Hereford]] from 1180 through 1184.<ref name=Moreton>Barrow ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34443 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Prebendaries of Moreton and Whaddon]''</ref>  He continued to hold the archdeaconry at Lisieux until 1188,<ref name=ArchEly>Greenway ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33865 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Ely: Archdeacons of Ely]''</ref> and was at Lisieux for most of the late 1170s and 1180s.<ref name=Sharpe129>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 129</ref> In 1187 King Henry sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the continent, with letters to the German Emperor, the King of Hungary, and the Emperor at Constantinople, seeking assistance for his projected crusade,<ref name=HenryII>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 607</ref> but Henry died in 1189, before the crusade could set off.<ref name=Bartlett113>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 113</ref>

==Later years and death==
After the death of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as [[Archdeacon of Ely]],<ref name=Barre188/> with the appointment occurring before 4 July 1190.<ref name=ArchEly/> Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince [[John of England|John]] during Richard's absence on the [[Third Crusade]].<ref name=Feudal373>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' pp. 373<U+2013>376</ref> Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194.<ref name=Barre188/> Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he did not return to his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.<ref name=Sharpe134/>{{#tag:ref|The author [[Duncan Lunan]], in an investigative article about the [[Green Children of Woolpit]], argues that Barre married Agnes, one of the mysterious children, and had at least one child by her.<ref name=Lunan49>Lunan "Children from the Sky" ''Analog'' pp. 49<U+2013>51</ref> No other reference mentions any marriage or children for Barre.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=ArchEly/><ref name=Turner>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law''</ref>|group=notes}}

Barre was one of the main royal justices between 1194 and 1199.<ref name=Barre188>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref> He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, [[Eustace (Bishop of Ely)|Eustace]],<ref name=Sharpe129/> who was elected in August 1197.<ref name=Handbook244>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 244</ref> But Barre had incurred the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202,<ref name=Barre190/> when he was serving as a [[Papal judge-delegate|judge-delegate]] for Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]],<ref name=Sharpe129/> but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213.<ref name=Barre190>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 190</ref> Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.<ref name=Barre196>Turner "Richard Barre and Michael Belet" ''Judges, Administrators and the Common Law'' p. 196</ref>

==Literary work==
Barre wrote a work on the Bible entitled ''Compendium de veteri et novo testamento'', which he dedicated to William Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with [[gloss]]es on [[Roman law]].<ref name=Barre196/> It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS [[British Library]] [[Harleian Collection|Harley]] 3255, and [[Lambeth Palace]] MS 105.<ref name=DNB>Rigg "Barre, Richard (b. c.1130, d. in or after 1202)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript "provides [a] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible." Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as "bishop, legate, and chancellor", it is likely that the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period.<ref name=Sharpe134>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' p. 134</ref> The prologue to the work describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.<ref name=Sharpe135>Sharpe "Richard Barre's ''Compendium''" ''Journal of Medieval Latin'' pp. 135<U+2013>138</ref>

A third copy of Barre's ''Compendium'' may have existed at [[Leicester Abbey]], where a late 15th-century library catalogue records a work by Barre on the Bible that the catalogue titles "Compendium Ricardi Barre super utroque testamento". The title and contents make this manuscript likely to be a copy of the ''Compendium''. The same catalogue also records five books once owned by Barre <U+2013> copies of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'', [[Justinian]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex]]'', [[gloss|glossed]] copies of the [[Psalter]] and some of the ''[[Pauline Epistles|Epistles]]'' of [[St. Paul|Paul]], as well as [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]''. Also, another Leicester Abbey manuscript records some satirical verses that were said to have been written by Barre.<ref name=Sharpe135/>
