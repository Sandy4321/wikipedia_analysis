'''''Buried Treasure''''' is the fifth [[story arc]] from the second season of ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle|Rocky and His Friends]]''. It was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the 1960-1961 television season.

==Notes==
This was the only "Rocky and Bullwinkle" storyline to feature [[Boris Badenov]] without [[Natasha Fatale]] (though Boris would often appear without her in the ''Bullwinkle's Corner'', ''Mr. Know-it-All'', and ''Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club'' segments).

In order to combat poor news paper sales Colonel McCorn Pone announces a treasure hunt for the "Picayune Pot" a useless brass trophy stuffed with one million confederate dollars which is merely a token to be taken back to the colonel to win a 1910 [[Stearns-Knight]] Roadster. Rocky & Bullwinkle and the rest of the citizens search for the pot, which leaves Frostbite Falls covered in holes.
