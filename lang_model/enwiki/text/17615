==Early life==
Coached by his father Anatoly, Lomachenko claims that if his father had not been a boxing coach he probably would have chosen to play [[ice hockey]] professionally.<ref name="personal">[http://www.aiba.org/en-US/news/ozqsp/newsId/2631/news.aspx Lomachenko lapping up the applause], [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|International Boxing Association]] (September 14, 2009)</ref>

==Amateur career==
At the [[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships|World Championships 2007]] in Chicago he beat [[Abner Cotto]] in the first round, Theodoros Papazov, [[Arturo Santos Reyes]], and [[Li Yang (boxer)|Li Yang]] in the semifinal to reach a fight against Russian favorite [[Albert Selimov]], another southpaw, to whom he lost, 12:16.

Lomachenko won gold at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. He avenged his 2007 World Championship defeat to Selimov in the first round. Lomachenko beat his five opponents by an astonishing 58-13 on the way to his first gold medal, and was subsequently named the outstanding boxer for the tournament and awarded the [[Val Barker Trophy]].

In [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] he won his second consecutive Gold Medal. He defeated [[Han Soon-Chul]] of [[South Korea at the 2012 Summer Olympics|South Korea]] in the [[Boxing at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's lightweight|final]] by 19-9.

== Professional career ==

After winning the [[Boxing at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's lightweight|gold medal]], Lomachenko made the decision to turn pro. After meeting with several fight promoters, Lomachenko signed a contract to fight for [[Top Rank]].
Lomachenko made his professional debut in [[United States]] 12 October 2013 as part of the undercard to the [[Timothy Bradley vs. Juan Manuel Marquez]] main event defeating Mexican fighter Jos<U+00E9> Ramirez with a fourth round knockout.<ref name=BLH1012/> 

=== Lomachenko vs. Salido ===
Lomachenko's bid to make history by winning a world championship in his second fight and break [[Saensak Muangsurin]]'s record ended in failure. He challenged [[Orlando Salido]] for the featherweight [[World Boxing Organization]]'s title. However, Lomachenko shied from engaging Salido throughout most of the fight, something that his opponent exploited. A late surge, which saw him injure Salido in the final round, was unable to change the final result.

Boxing magazines mentioned the conduct of the referee, Salido's dirty boxing and weight issues that are outlined in [[Orlando Salido vs. Vasyl Lomachenko controversy]] as contributing factors to Lomachenko's loss.
