The '''''Binghamton''''' is a former ferryboat that operated from 1905 to 1967 transporting paasengers between [[Manhattan]] and [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]. The ''Binghamton'' was built for the ''Hoboken Ferry Company'' and was designed to carry 986 passengers plus vehicles.<ref>http://www.bergencountyhistory.org/pdfs/MarkerBooklet100707.pdf Accessed January 7, 2009.</ref> The ''Binghamton'' is located in [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], [[New Jersey]] and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 9, 1982. The ''Binghamton'' is now permanently moored in Edgewater and being used as a [[floating restaurant]].<ref>http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2111898870/ Accessed November 29, 2008.</ref>

The ferryboat was owned by tycoon and former New Jersey Assembly Speaker [[Nelson G. Gross|Nelson Gross]].  He was murdered by teenage employees of the restaurant in 1997.

==Background==
[[File:Binghamton plaque.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Binghampton retired in 1967.]]
Until the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Manhattan]] and tunneled under the [[Hudson River]], all New York-bound rail lines from the west terminated at the New Jersey shoreline of [[New York Harbor]]. Accordingly, a number of independent and railroad-affiliated ferry companies provided passenger and light freight service across the harbor. One particular type of ferryboat, the "double-ender," was especially common in New York Harbor. The first American double-ended ferries were the paddle-wheelers ''Jersey'' and ''York'' (1812) of [[Robert Fulton]]'s York & Jersey Steamboat Ferry Company.<Hilton, p73> Excellent for transporting vehicles, the double-enders were well adapted to New York Harbor, where there was considerable demand for speed and efficiency (vehicles could drive on-and-off from either end and time consuming turns were not necessary). It has been estimated that over 400 double-ended ferries operated in New York Harbor during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The peak years were 1906-1908 when approximately 150 double-ended ferries were in service in the Harbor.<Hilton, p76>

The Hoboken Ferry Company was a subsidiary of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W). The company had a fleet of six ferryboats when it ceased operations in 1967.  Three of these - the ''Elmira'', ''Scranton'', and ''Pocono'' (nee ''Scandinavia'') - ''Binghamton'''s sisters, were also built in 1905. (Another, ''Ithaca'', was destroyed by fire in 1946.) Of these, ''Binghamton'' is now the only survivor.

By 1905 the DL&W had acquired the [[Hoboken Terminal]] and ferries of the [[Morris and Essex Railroad]]. These ferries had been operating at capacity and the ferry terminal was woefully inadequate. In 1904, the obsolete ferry-house caught fire and was destroyed. The rail-ferry traffic, however, was delayed only briefly. For a few days the trains were routed to other terminals, but the wreckage was quickly cleared away, giving access for most of the vessels.  

Work began at once on a new terminal. In order to more easily accommodate the new double-level ferryboats, the ferry slips, finished by 1907, had two access and egress levels separating passenger and vehicular traffic, making for more efficient transport.

==History==
The ''Binghamton'' was one of six identical screw-propelled double-ended ferryboats built by the [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry-dock Company]] at [[Newport News, Virginia]] in 1904-05 to designs by Gardner & Cox, naval architects. She was launched on February 20, 1905, with Miss Charlotte Emery, daughter of John M. Emery, the newly promoted superintendent of the Hoboken Ferry Company and Ferry Department of the DL&W, serving as her sponsor. ''Binghamton'' was completed a month later and left the Newport News yard on March 25 for the trip to Hoboken, New Jersey. She was placed in commission on April 3. Her Captain for the first crossing was Oren D. Relyea.

Her normal run was from the Hoboken Terminal to Barclay Street, a twelve-minute journey of approximately 1 and 3/4 miles, a trip made continuously nearly every day for more than sixty years (on occasion she substituted on the Hoboken - 23rd Street run). 

As alternate methods of travel across the Harbor were implemented, ferry transport diminished. The opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Penn Station in Manhattan (1907); the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|Hudson and Manhattan Rapid Transit Line]] (1907); the [[Holland Tunnel|Holland]] and [[Lincoln Tunnel|Lincoln]] tunnels (1927; 1937); and the [[George Washington Bridge]] (1931) all contributed to the decline of the ferries. The last ferry crossing of the Hoboken company, in operation since 1821, took place on November 22, 1967, when the railroad closed its trans-Hudson operations and offered its ferries for sale.

==Restaurant Conversion==
''Binghamton'' was acquired in 1969 by Edward Russo, an Edgewater, NJ contractor, for conversion into a restaurant. Russo planned large dining rooms on the Upper and Main decks, plus two pubs in the former engine room. Russo leased four acres of land from the Borough of Edgewater for ten years at a monthly rental price of $500. Restaurant and liquor licenses were approved in advance, thus there seemed little to block the boat's projected Labor Day, 1970 opening.

Unfortunately, all did not go as planned. ''Binghamton'' moved temporarily to Hoboken's Fifth Street Pier for exterior repainting and was to be towed to Weekawken for conversion to the planned restaurant. A tug strike delayed this move until June. Once tied to the vacant Penn Central Railroad Pier 18 at Weehawken, work progressed slowly. Dredging also took longer than had been anticipated.  

Once the channel at Edgewater was completed in 1971, ''Binghamton'' found herself again at the end of a towline. She was moored in her new berth where pilings were driven around her guards to keep her in place. Russo provided the fill as promised, but failed to install the black-top and outdoor lighting needed to give the floating restaurant a parking lot.

Russo, however, was unable to find a concessionaire to operate the restaurant. There was a report that the boat would open in the fall of 1972 as the "Edgewater Ferryboat Restaurant," but nothing materialized and ''Binghamton'' continued to lie unused in the shadow of a 21-story high-rise apartment complex.

The American National Bank and Trust of Montclair held a 1973 note for $50,000 issued to Russo (Ruscon Industries) which held the ''Binghamton'' as collateral. When Ruscon defaulted on repaying the loan, American National, anxious to recover its money, actively sought buyers for ''Binghamton''. Two parties materialized, one being a restaurateur. The other prospective buyer, ultimately the successful bidder, had plans for a restaurant and nightclub.

Ferry Binghamton Inc., Hackensack, New Jersey, purchased the vessel in late 1974 for $65,000.  After negotiations with local authorities, plans to keep the boat at moorings were abandoned in favor of a new location a half-mile downstream. Although the distance seemed short, moving ''Binghamton'' was no easy task as silt had built up around her hull. On February 28, 1975, amid snapping towlines, ''Binghamton'' was pulled off the mud and successfully moved to the former Alcoa dock in Edgewater. The restaurant opened later in the year.

The US Department of the Interior listed ''Binghamton'' on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1997 the vessel made headlines when owner [[Nelson G. Gross|Nelson Gross]] was found murdered in Manhattan.  The restaurant, known as "Binghamton's", continued to operate for ten years, but closed by Fall 2007. ''Binghamton'' has remained unused at her berth in Edgewater since then.
