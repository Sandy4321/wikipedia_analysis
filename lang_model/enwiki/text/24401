'''Philitas''' or '''Philetas of Cos''' ({{circa|340}}&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;c.&nbsp;285&nbsp;BC) was a scholar and poet during the early [[Hellenistic period]] of [[ancient Greece]].<ref name=Bulloch-4/> A Greek associated with [[Alexandria]], he [[flourished]] in the second half of the 4th century&nbsp;BC and was appointed tutor to the heir to the throne of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He was thin and frail; [[Athenaeus]] later caricatured him as an academic so consumed by his studies that he wasted away and died.<ref name=Bing/>

Philitas was the first major writer who was both a scholar and a poet.<ref name=Bulloch-4/> His reputation continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in [[elegiac]] meter. His vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' described the meanings of rare literary words, including those used by [[Homer]]. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem ''Demeter'', was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.<ref name=Bing/>

==Life==

Little is known of Philitas' life. Ancient sources refer to him as a Coan, a native or long-time inhabitant of [[Kos|Cos]],<ref name=Span-24/> one of the [[Dodecanese]] islands in the [[Aegean Sea]] just off the coast of Asia. His student [[Theocritus]] wrote that Philetas' father was Telephos (<U+03A4><U+03AE><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''{{transl|el|ISO|T<U+1E17>lephos}}'') and his mother, assuming the manuscript is supplemented correctly, Euctione (<U+0395><U+1F50><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B7>, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Eukti<U+00F3>n<U+0113>}}'').<ref>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=26}}</ref> From a comment about Philitas in the ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th century&nbsp;AD historical encyclopedia, it is estimated he was born {{circa|340&nbsp;BC}}, and that he might have established a reputation in Cos by c.&nbsp;309/8&nbsp;BC. During the [[wars of the Diadochi]] that followed the death of [[Alexander the Great]] and divided Alexander's empire, [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] had captured Cos from his rival successor, [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]], in 310&nbsp;BC; his son, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&nbsp;II Philadelphus]], was born there in 308&nbsp;BC. It was a favorite retreat for men of letters weary of Alexandria.<ref name=Sandys>{{cite book |title= A History of Classical Scholarship: from the Sixth Century&nbsp;B.C. to the End of the Middle Ages |author= [[John Edwin Sandys]] |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=London |year=1903 |pages=118<U+2013>9 |oclc=2759759}}</ref>

[[Image:Ptolemaic-Empire-300BC.jpeg|thumb|left|The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], {{circa|300&nbsp;BC}}, was centered on [[Alexandria]] in [[ancient Egypt]]; [[Kos|Cos]] was on its northwest frontier.]]
Philetas was appointed Philadelphus' [[preceptor]], or tutor, which suggests he moved to [[Alexandria]] c.&nbsp;297/6&nbsp;BC<ref name=Span-23>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=23}}</ref> and moved back to Cos in the later 290s&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Span-24>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=24}}</ref> He may also have tutored [[Arsinoe II of Egypt|Arsinoe&nbsp;II]], Philadelphus' older sister and eventual wife.<ref name=Span-29>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=29}}</ref> Later tutors of royal offspring in Ptolemaic Egypt generally headed the [[Library of Alexandria]], but it is unknown whether Philitas held that position.<ref name=Bulloch-4/> Philitas also taught the poets [[Hermesianax]] and Theocritus and the [[grammarian]] [[Zenodotus]], and after he returned to Cos he seems to have spent at least ten years leading a brotherhood of intellectuals and poets that included [[Aratus]], Hermesianax, and Theocritus.<ref name=Sandys/><ref name=Pauly/>

Hermesianax wrote of "Philitas, singing of nimble Bittis", and [[Ovid]] twice calls her "Battis". It is commonly thought that Bittis or Battis was Philitas' mistress, and that Hermesianax referred to love poetry; another possibility is that her name connoted "chatterbox", and that she was a humorous personification of Philitas' passion for words.<ref name=Bing/>

Philitas was thin and frail, and may have suffered and died from a [[wasting disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= The Classical Quarterly |volume=41 |issue=2 |year=1991 |pages=534<U+2013>8 |author= [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] |title= How thin was Philitas?}}</ref> He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280s&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Span-24/> His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a [[plane tree]] by the people of Cos, depicting him as "frail with all the glosses".<ref name=Bing/> His contemporary [[Posidippus]] wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus,<ref name=Stewart>{{cite book |author= Andrew Stewart |chapter= Posidippus and the truth in sculpture |pages=183<U+2013>205 |editor= Gutzwiller (ed.) |title= The New Posidippus |year=2005}}</ref><ref name=Sens-Posidippus/> which "included nothing from the physique of heroes.

St. George Stock analyzed the story as saying Philitas studied the [[Megarian school of philosophy]], which cultivated and studied [[paradox]]es such as the [[liar paradox]]: if someone says "I am lying", is what he says true or false?<ref>{{cite book |editor= Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapterurl=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/insolubles/#1 |chapter=Insolubles |author= Paul Vincent Spade |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> Stock wrote that Philitas worried so much over the liar paradox that he died of [[insomnia]], and translated the epitaph as follows:

<poem style='margin-left: 1em'>
<div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'>Philetas of Cos am I,</div><div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'>'Twas the Liar who made me die,</div><div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'>And the bad nights caused thereby.<ref>{{cite book |author= St. George Stock |title=Stoicism |year=1908 |page=36 |publisher= Archibald Constable |location=London |oclc=1201330}}</ref></div>
</poem>

A more literal translation suggests that the invented epitaph pokes fun at Philitas' focus on using the right words:

Philitas wrote a vocabulary explaining the meanings of rare literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms; it probably took the form of a lexicon.<ref name=Pauly/> The vocabulary, called ''Disorderly Words'' (<U+1F0C><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+03B3><U+03BB><U+1FF6><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>, ''{{transl|el|ISO|<U+00C1>taktoi gl<U+00F4>ssai}}''), has been lost, with only a few fragments quoted by later authors.<ref name=Bing/> One example, quoted in Athenaeus, is that the word <U+03C0><U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B1> (''{{transl|el|ISO|p<U+00E9>lla}}'') meant "wine cup" in the ancient Greek region of [[Boeotia]];<ref>Athenaeus (tr.

About thirty fragments of Philitas' poetry are known, along with four definite titles:<ref name=Pauly/>
* ''Demeter'', Philitas' most famous work, consisted of [[elegiac couplet]]s, or [[couplets]] in the [[elegiac]] meter.<ref name=Hopkinson>{{cite journal |journal= The Classical Review |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=311<U+2013>2 |title= Coi sacra Philitae |author= N.

* ''Hermes'' was an [[epyllion]], or brief mythological narrative, written in [[hexameter]]. It had the structure of a [[hymn]], with a central narrative telling of [[Odysseus]]' visit to the island of the king [[Aeolus #<U+00C6>olus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], keeper of the winds, and of Odysseus' secret affair with the king's daughter Polymele.<ref name=Pauly/>

These poems had the structure of [[epigram]]s and their themes may have included [[erotica]]. The only surviving poem contains two elegiac couplets and has a puzzle or riddle structure characteristic of some ancient Greek [[Skolion|drinking-party songs]].<ref name=Pauly/>
* Only one of the ''Epigrams'' has been fully reconstructed.<ref name=Pauly/>
Another possible poem is ''Telephus'', which may have been a companion to ''Demeter''.<ref name=Pauly/>

At most fifty verses of Philitas survive.<ref name=Bing/> Below is an example fragment of two verses, which was quoted in the ''Collection of Paradoxical Stories'', whose putative author Antigonus (often identified with [[Antigonus of Carystus]],<ref>{{cite book |author= Kathryn Gutzwiller |title= A Guide to Hellenistic Literature |location= Malden, MA |publisher=Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=0-631-23321-0 |pages=166<U+2013>7}}</ref> a near-contemporary) does not specify which work they came from; indirect evidence suggests ''Demeter''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |pages=209<U+2013>13}}</ref> These two verses show the confluence of Philitas' interests in poetry and obscure words:

According to Antigonus, the "cactus" (<U+03BA><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''{{transl|el|ISO|k<U+00E1>ktos}}'') was a thorny plant from Sicily, and "When a deer steps on it and is pricked, its bones remain soundless and unusable for flutes.

Philitas was the most important intellectual figure in the early years of [[Hellenistic civilization]].<ref>Bulloch, "Hellenistic poetry", p. 4.

His reputation for scholarship endured for at least a century. In Athens, the comic playwright Strato made jokes that assumed audiences knew about Philitas' vocabulary, and the vocabulary was criticized more than a century later by the influential Homeric scholar [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in his ''Against Philitas'' (<U+03A0><U+03C1><U+1F78><U+03C2> <U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD>, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Pr<U+00F2>s Phil<U+00ED>tan}}'').

Philitas was the first writer whose works represent the combination of qualities now regarded as [[Ancient Greek literature #Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic]]: variety, scholarship, and use of Homeric sources in non-[[Epic poetry|epic]] works. He directly influenced the major Hellenistic poets [[Callimachus]] and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].<ref name=Bulloch-5/> His poetry was mentioned or briefly quoted by his rival Callimachus and by other ancient authors,<ref>{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |pages=85<U+2013>346}}</ref> and his poetic reputation endured for at least three centuries, as [[Augustan poets]] identified his name with great elegiac writing.<ref name=Bulloch-5/> [[Propertius]] linked him to his rival with the following well-known couplet:
