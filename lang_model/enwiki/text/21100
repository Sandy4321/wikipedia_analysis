'''Richard Spooner''' (28 July 1783 &ndash; 24 November 1864) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman and politician. In his youth he was a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] reformer, but in later life he moved to the political right to become an [[Ultra-Tories|Ultra-Tory]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Death of Mr. Spooner, M.P. |author= |newspaper=[[Birmingham Daily Post]] |date=25 November 1864 }}</ref>

==Early life and family==
Spooner was born at Birches Green, [[Erdington]], and was the son of Issac Spooner a banker and magistrate in nearby [[Birmingham]]. Following education at [[Rugby School]] he formed a banking company in partnership with [[Thomas Attwood]].<ref name=obit/> In 1804 he married Charlotte Wetherall, daughter of the [[Dean of Hereford]].<ref name=times/><ref name=mantimes/> He was involved in the civic life of Birmingham, helping to found the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics Institute]] in 1820, of which he was the first president.<ref name=obit/>

==Radical politics==
In 1812 Spooner and Attwood led a campaign to repeal the [[Orders in Council (1807)|orders in council]] introduced in 1807 as part of the government's campaign of economic warfare against France. The orders, which severely effected the trade of Birmingham were repealed later in the year.<ref name=obit/>

In March 1820 he contested [[United Kingdom general election, 1820|the general election]] at [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]], [[Yorkshire]]. The constituency was a two-seat "[[pocket borough]]" in the hands of the [[Duke of Newcastle|Dukes of Newcastle]], who supported the [[British Tory Party|Tory]] candidates. However, Spooner, running as a Radical, and [[Marmaduke Lawson]], a [[British Whig Party|Whig]] were elected. Three months later, the Tories managed to have the election of both [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s overturned on petition.<ref name=obit/>

In 1826 Spooner again stood for parliament at [[Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Warwickshire]]. While he had overwhelming support from the voters of Birmingham, he was unsuccessful.<ref name=obit/> In December of the same year a parliamentary vacancy was caused, when [[Richard Ironmonger]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]] died. Spooner was chosen as the Radical candidate to contest the ensuing [[Stafford by-election 1826|by-election]], but was defeated in a straight fight by the Whig, [[Thomas Wentworth Beaumont|Thomas Beaumont]].<ref name=obit/><ref>{{cite news |title=Stafford Election |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=16 December 1826 |page=3 }}</ref> He was expected to contest the seat again at the next [[United Kingdom general election, 1830|general election in 1830]]. Instead he stood at [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], where his colleague Attwood had been requested to stand, but had declined.<ref>{{cite news |title=General Election |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=28 July 1830 |page=3 }}</ref> Once again, he failed to be elected.<ref name=obit/>

==Move to the Tories==
By 1832 Spooner's repeated electoral defeats led to his moving away from Radical politics. In that year he was asked to join the [[Birmingham Political Union]], but declined the invitation. By the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1835|1835 general election]] he had made a complete change in his political views. The ''[[Birmingham Daily Post]]'' described his conversion:
<blockquote>"...from having been a bold and uncompromising Liberal, became ultimately one of the most determined, immovable and obstructive members of the ultra-Tory party."<ref name=obit/></blockquote>

==Member of parliament for Birmingham==

In 1835 and [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841]] Spooner stood as the Tory candidate against Birmingham's sitting Radical MPs. He was heavily defeated on both occasions.<ref name=obit/> In 1844, [[Joshua Scholefield]], one of the town's members of parliament, died. Consequently, a by-election was held. Spooner was again the Tory candidate and was opposed by [[William Scholefield]], son of the deceased MP, who was expected to hold the seat for the Radicals. However, the Liberal/Radical vote was split when a third candidate, Joseph Sturge, entered the contest. Spooner was elected "most likely to his own astonishment" as the first Tory MP for Birmingham.<ref name=obit/> It was noted that the "personal liking felt for the man was temporarily permitted to outweigh the general resentment at his political apostasy".<ref name=obit/> At the next [[United Kingdom general election, 1847|general election in 1847]] the Liberals were reunited, and Spooner lost the seat to William Scholefield.<ref name=obit/>

==Member of parliament for North Warwickshire==
Having lost his seat at Birmingham in July 1847, Spooner was immediately nominated as a Conservative candidate for the two-member [[North Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern Division of Warwickshire]] where polling was not held until August.<ref name=birm47/> On 16 August he was duly declared elected, along with his party colleague, [[Charles Newdigate Newdegate]].<ref name=warks47>{{cite news |title=The General Election. Warwickshire (North) |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=17 August 1847 |page=4 }}</ref> He held the seat at the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1857|1857]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1859|1859]].<ref name=obit/>

Spooner was a member of the "Ultra" faction of the Tories. He was a proponent of [[protectionism]] and a strong [[Church of England|Anglican]], opposing any measures of relief to [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], "[[Non-Conformism|Dissenters]]" or [[Judaism|Jews]]. In his later years he was considered a figure of fun, with his annual (and barely audible) speech denouncing the renewal of the grant to [[NUI Maynooth|Maynooth Seminary]] treated with derision.<ref name=obit/> In his obituary his later parliamentary contributions were summarised:
<blockquote>"...every proposal which in his early life would have elicited his most stenuous approval, received in his old age his most vehement opposition".<ref name=obit/></blockquote>

In 1862 he became unwell, and ceased attending the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|Commons]]. He delayed his resignation as the local Conservative organisation had no agreed candidate in the event of a vacancy.<ref name=obit/> He lived in virtual retirement at Henwood Lodge, [[Leamington Spa]], where he died in November 1864.<ref name=obit/><ref name=times>{{cite news |title=Death Of Mr. Spooner, M.P. For North Warwickshire |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=25 November 1864 |page=10 }}</ref> He was buried in the family vault at [[Elmdon, West Midlands|Elmdon]].<ref name=mantimes>{{cite news |title=Death of Mr. R Spooner M.P. |author= |newspaper=[[Manchester Times]] |date=26 November 1864}}</ref>
