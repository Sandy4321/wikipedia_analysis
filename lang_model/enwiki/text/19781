{{nuclear weapons}}
A '''nuclear weapon''' is a [[weapon]] which derives its destructive force from [[nuclear reaction]]s of either [[nuclear fission]] or the more powerful [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]. As a result, even a nuclear weapon with a relatively small [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] is significantly more powerful than the largest conventional [[explosives]], and a single weapon is capable of destroying or seriously disabling an entire city. 

In the [[history of warfare]], nuclear weapons have been used only twice, both during the closing days of [[World War II]]. The first event occurred on the morning of [[August 6]] [[1945]], when the [[United States]] dropped a [[uranium]] gun-type device code-named "[[Little Boy]]" on the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]]. The second event occurred three days later when a [[plutonium]] implosion-type device code-named "[[Fat Man]]" was dropped on the city of [[Nagasaki]]. The use of these weapons, which resulted in the immediate deaths of around 100,000 to 200,000 individuals (mostly civilians) and even more over time, was and remains controversial &mdash; critics charged that they were unnecessary acts of mass killing, while others claimed that they ultimately reduced casualties on both sides by hastening the end of the war (see ''[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]'' for a full discussion).

Since that time, nuclear weapons have been detonated on over two thousand occasions for [[nuclear testing|testing]] and demonstration purposes. The only known countries to have detonated such weapons are the [[United States]], [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], and [[Pakistan]]. These countries are the declared nuclear powers (with [[Russia]] inheriting the weapons of the Soviet Union after its collapse). 

Various other countries may hold nuclear weapons, but they have never publicly admitted possession, or their claims to possession have not been verified. For example, [[Israel]] has modern airborne delivery systems and appears to have an extensive nuclear program with hundreds of warheads (see [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction]]); [[North Korea]] has recently stated that it has nuclear capabilities (although it has made several changing statements about the abandonment of its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons programs]], often dependent on the political climate at the time) but never conducted a confirmed test and its weapons status remains unclear; and [[Iran]] currently stands accused by a number of governments of attempting to develop nuclear capabilities, though its government claims that its acknowledged nuclear activities, such as [[uranium enrichment]], are for peaceful purposes. (For more information see [[List of countries with nuclear weapons]].)

Apart from their use as weapons, [[nuclear explosive]]s have been tested and used for various [[Peaceful nuclear explosions|non-military uses]].

==Types of nuclear weapons==
[[Image:Fission bomb assembly methods.svg|right|thumb|250px|The two basic fission weapon designs.]]
{{main|Nuclear weapon design}}

There are two basic types of nuclear weapons. The first are weapons which produce their explosive energy through [[nuclear fission]] reactions alone. These are known colloquially as '''atomic bombs''', '''atom bombs''', or '''A-bombs'''. In fission weapons, a mass of [[fissile]] material ([[enriched uranium]] or [[plutonium]]) is assembled into a [[critical mass|supercritical mass]]&mdash;the amount of material needed to start an [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] [[nuclear chain reaction]]&mdash;either by shooting one piece of subcritical material into another, or by compressing a subcritical mass with chemical explosives, at which points [[neutron]]s are injected and the reaction begins. A major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is ensuring that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself. The amount of energy released by fission bombs can range between the equivalent of less than a ton of [[TNT]] upwards to around 500 thousand tons ([[kiloton]]s) of TNT.

The second basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large amount of its energy through [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, and can be over a thousand times more powerful than fission bombs. These are known as '''hydrogen bombs''', '''H-bombs''', '''thermonuclear bombs''', and '''fusion bombs'''. They work by utilizing the [[Teller-Ulam design]], in which a fission bomb is detonated in a specially manufactured compartment adjacent to a fusion fuel. The [[gamma radiation|gamma]] and [[X-ray]]s of the fission explosion compress and heat a capsule of [[tritium]], [[deuterium]], or [[lithium deuteride]] starting a fusion reaction. Neutrons emitted by this fusion reaction can induce a final fission stage in a [[depleted uranium]] tamper surrounding the fusion fuel, increasing the yield considerably as well as the amount of [[nuclear fallout]]. Each of these components is known as a "stage", with the fission bomb as the "primary" and the fusion capsule as the "secondary". By chaining together numerous stages with increasing amounts of fusion fuel, thermonuclear weapons can be made to an almost arbitrary yield; the largest ever detonated (the [[Tsar Bomba]] of the USSR) released an energy equivalent to over 50 million tons ([[megaton]]s) of TNT, though most modern weapons are nowhere near that large.

There are other types of nuclear weapons as well. For example, a [[boosted fission weapon]] is a fission bomb which increases its explosive yield through a small amount of fusion reactions, but it is not a hydrogen bomb. Some weapons are designed for special purposes; a [[neutron bomb]] is a nuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of prompt [[radiation]]. The detonation of a nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of [[neutron radiation]]. Surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials (such as [[cobalt]] or [[gold]]) creates a weapon known as a [[salted bomb]]. This device can produce exceptionally large quantities of [[radioactive contamination]]. Most variety in [[nuclear weapon design]] is in different yields of nuclear weapons for different types of purposes, and in manipulating design elements to attempt to make weapons extremely small.

== Nuclear strategy ==
[[Image:W87 MX Missile schematic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|right|The United States' [[LG-118A Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper missile]] was a [[MIRV]]ed delivery system. Each missile could contain up to ten nuclear warheads (shown in red), each of which could be aimed at a different target. These were developed to make [[missile defense]] very difficult for an enemy country.]]
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}

[[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear warfare strategies]] is a way for either fighting or avoiding a nuclear war. The policy of trying to ward off a potential attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of [[deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]]. The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike status (the ability to respond to a nuclear attack against your country with a nuclear attack of your own) and potentially to strive for [[first strike]] status (the ability to completely destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate). During the [[Cold War]], policy and military theorists in nuclear-enabled countries worked out models of what sorts of policies could prevent one from ever being attacked by a nuclear weapon. 

Different forms of [[nuclear weapons delivery]] (see below) allow for different types of nuclear strategy, primarily by making it difficult to defend against them and difficult to launch a pre-emptive strike against them. Sometimes this has meant keeping the weapon locations hidden, such as putting them on [[submarine]]s or [[train]] cars whose locations are very hard for an enemy to track, and other times this means burying them in hardened bunkers. Other responses have included attempts to make it seem likely that the country could survive a nuclear attack, by using [[missile defense]] (to destroy the missiles before they land) or by means of [[civil defense]] (using early warning systems to evacuate citizens to a safe area before an attack). Note that weapons which are designed to threaten large populations or to generally deter attacks are known as "strategic" weapons. Weapons which are designed to actually be used on a battlefield in military situations are known as "tactical" weapons. 

There are critics of the very idea of "nuclear strategy" for waging nuclear war who have suggested that a nuclear war between two nuclear powers would result in mutual annihilation. From this point of view, the significance of nuclear weapons is to purely deter war because any nuclear war would immediately escalate out of mutual distrust and fear, resulting in [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]]. This threat of national, if not global, destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism.

Critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate. The use of (or threat of use of) such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, according to an [[Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of eight July 1996|Advisory Opinion]] issued by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1996.

Perhaps the most controversial idea in nuclear strategy is that [[nuclear proliferation]] would be desirable. This view argues that unlike conventional weapons nuclear weapons successfully deter all-out war between states, as they did during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Political scientist [[Kenneth Waltz]] is the most prominent advocate of this argument.

== Weapons delivery ==
[[Image:Fat_man.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The first nuclear weapons were [[gravity bomb]]s, such as the "[[Fat Man]]" weapon dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. These weapons were very large and could only be delivered by a [[bomber]] aircraft.]]
{{main|Nuclear weapons delivery}}

[[Nuclear weapons delivery]]&mdash; the technology and systems used to bring a nuclear weapon to its target&mdash;is an important aspect of nuclear weapons relating both to [[nuclear weapon design]] and [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strategy]].

Historically the first method of delivery, and the method used in the two nuclear weapons actually used in warfare, is as a [[gravity bomb]], dropped from [[bomber]] aircraft. This method is usually the first developed by countries as it does not place many restrictions on the size of the weapon, and weapon miniaturization is something which requires considerable weapons design knowledge. It does, however, limit the range of attack, the response time to an impending attack, and the number of weapons which can be fielded at any given time. 

More preferable from a strategic point of view are nuclear weapons mounted onto a [[missile]], which can use a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory to deliver a warhead over the horizon. While even short range missiles allow for a faster and less vulnerable attack, the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) has allowed some nations to plausibly deliver missiles anywhere on the globe with a high likelihood of success. More advanced systems, such as [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs) allow multiple warheads to be launched at a number of targets from any one missile, reducing the chance of any successful [[missile defense]]. Today, missiles are by far the most common among systems designed for delivery of nuclear weapons. To make a warhead small enough to fit onto a missile, though, can be a difficult task.

"Tactical" weapons (see above) have involved the most variety of delivery types, including not only gravity bombs and missiles but also [[artillery]] shells, [[land mine]]s, and nuclear [[depth charge]]s and [[torpedo]]es for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. An atomic [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] was also tested at one time by the United States. Small, two-man portable tactical weapons (somewhat misleadingly referred to as [[suitcase bomb]]s), such as the [[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]], have been developed, although the difficulty to combine sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility.

== History ==
[[Image:Hiroshima aftermath.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The aftermath of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].]]
{{main|History of nuclear weapons}}
The first nuclear weapons were created in the [[United States]], by an international team including many displaced <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> scientists from central Europe with assistance from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], during [[World War II]] as part of the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]]. While the first weapons were developed primarily out of fear that [[Nazi Germany]] would develop them first, they were eventually used against the Japanese cities of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945. The [[Soviet Union]] developed and tested their first nuclear weapon in 1949, based partially on information obtained from Soviet espionage in the United States. Both the USA and USSR would go on to develop weapons powered by [[nuclear fusion]] (hydrogen bombs) by the mid-1950s. With the invention of reliable [[rocketry]] during the 1960s, it became possible for nuclear weapons to be delivered anywhere in the world on a very short notice, and the two Cold War superpowers adopted a strategy of [[deterrence]] to maintain a shaky peace. 

[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.png|250px|thumb|US and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945-2005.]]

Nuclear weapons were symbols of military and national power, and [[nuclear testing]] was often used both to test new designs as well as to send political messages. Other nations also developed nuclear weapons during this time, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[China]]. These five members of the "nuclear club" agreed to attempt to limit the spread of [[nuclear proliferation]] to other nations, though at least three other countries ([[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Pakistan]], and most likely [[Israel]]) developed nuclear arms during this time. At the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] inherited the weapons of the former USSR, and along with the USA pledged to reduce their stockpile for increased international safety. Nuclear proliferation has continued, though, with [[Pakistan]] testing their first weapons in 1998, and the state of [[North Korea]] claiming to have developed nuclear weapons in 2004. Nuclear weapons have been at the heart of many national and international political disputes, and have played a major part in [[Nuclear weapons in popular culture|popular culture]] since their dramatic public debut in the 1940s, and have usually symbolized the ultimate ability of mankind to utilize the strength of nature for destruction.

There have been (at least) four major false alarms, the most recent in 1995, that almost resulted in the US or USSR/Russia launching its weapons in retaliation for a supposed attack.<ref>{{cite web

[[As of 2005]], there are estimated to be at least 29,000 nuclear weapons held by [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|at least seven countries]], though 96% of these are in the possession of just two (the United States and the Russian Federation).
