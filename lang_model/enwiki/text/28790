'''Trailers''' or '''previews''' are [[film]] [[advertisement]]s for feature films that will be exhibited in the future at a [[Movie theater|cinema]], on whose screen they are shown. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end.<ref>{{cite web

Besides in front of theatrical releases, movie trailers have now become extremely popular on the internet. Of some 10-billion videos watched online annually, movie trailers rank #3, after news and user-created video.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
The first trailer shown in a U.S. movie theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''[[The Pleasure Seekers]]'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. Loew adopted the practice, which was reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln (NE) ''Daily Star'', describing it as "an entirely new and unique stunt," and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew<U+2019>s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising."<ref><U+201C>Movies Score on Legit in New York;<U+201D> Lincoln (NE) ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25</ref> Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.<ref>Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53</ref> Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed.  Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film "[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]" by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. In 1964, [[Andrew J. Kuehn]] distributed his independently-produced trailer for ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|Night of the Iguana]]'', using stark, high-contrast photography, fast-paced editing and a provocative narration by a young [[James Earl Jones]]. His format was so successful, he began producing this new form of trailer with partner Dan Davis.

Kuehn opened the west coast office of Kaleidoscope Films in 1968 and Kuehn and his company became a major player in the trailer industry for the next three decades. As Hollywood began to produce bigger blockbuster films and invest more money in marketing them, directors like [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Oliver Stone]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] began to depend on Kuehn and Kaleidoscope for their ability to create the best trailers theater-goers could see. Kuehn alumni include leading trailer makers and marketing creatives. Top trailer companies have all been run by former Kaleidoscope creatives, like The Cimarron Group (Chris Arnold), Ant Farm, Aspect Ratio (Mark Trugman), Trailer Park (Benedict Coulter) and Motor Entertainment, run by Greg McClatchy, who previously headed up the film marketing division at [[20th Century Fox]]. Michael Camp headed the trailer department at [[Paramount Pictures]], Tom Kennedy at [[MGM]], Jeff Werner and Vince Arcaro all started their own successful trailer companies and Bob Harper began his career as a messenger at Kaleidoscope before becoming a producer and quickly Vice-Chairman of [[20th Century Fox|Fox Filmed Entertainment]] and, in 2007, Chairman of Regency Entertainment.  Top industry trailer composer [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]] credits his career success to the thirty-year collaboration with Kuehn and their revolutionary approach of creating original scores using a whole new musical template.<ref>[http://www.ajkfoundation.org/ajkbio1.asp ajkfoundation.org: Andrew J. Kuehn, Jr. biography]</ref>

In earlier decades of cinema, trailers were only one part of the  entertainment which included cartoon shorts and serial adventure episodes. These earlier trailers were much shorter and often consisted of little more than title cards and stock footage. Today, longer, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment and in major multiplex chains, about the first twenty minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.

==Definition==
Trailers consist of a series of selected shots from the film being advertised.  Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than two and a half minutes, the maximum length allowed by theaters. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.<ref>"Trailer music."   SoundtrackNet, LLC. 30 April 2009. <http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/></ref>

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film.  The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured elaborate special effects scenes that were never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of movie trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park) while the movie itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited movie does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]].  dio.  Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the movie editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack.  This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score <U+2014> sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date <U+2014> while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film. (see Music, below)

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the movie are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser, an event that does not occur in the final film.

==Parts of a trailer==
Trailers tell the story of a movie in a highly condensed fashion that must have maximum appeal. In the decades since movie marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

===Plot summary===
Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie. 

===Voice-over===
[[Voice-over]] narration is used to briefly set up the premise of the movie and provide explanation when necessary ("In a world..."). Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer [[voice actors|voice-over artists]] are the late [[Don LaFontaine]], Howard Parker, [[Percy Rodriguez]], Harlan Rector, Andy Geller, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (Disney)|Mark Elliot]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Ashton Smith]], John Garry, [[Jim Cummings]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Bill J. Lloyd, and [[Brian Cummings]]. Some movie trailers are now being voiced by women.  [[Sylvia Villagran]] is one of the few women working in movie trailers today.  Classic voice-over artists in movie trailers of the 1950s and 1960s included [[Art Gilmore]], [[Knox Manning]], [[Reed Hadley]], [[Fred Foy]], Karl Weber and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clich<U+00E9>s such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc.  Some trailers have used voice over clich<U+00E9>s for satirical effect.  This can be seen in trailers for films such as ''[[Comedian (movie)|The Comedian]]'' and ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]''.<ref>[http://www.movie-list.com/trailers.php?id=comedian movie-list.com: ''Comedian'' trailer]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXxQFMG86HA YouTube: ''Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny'' trailer]</ref>

===Music===
[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:
*Music from the score of other movies. Most-used titles include ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'''s [[Lux Aeterna (Requiem for a Dream)|main theme "Lux Aeterna"]] by [[Clint Mansell]], ''[[Come See the Paradise]]'' by [[Randy Edelman]], ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' by [[James Horner]], ''[[Stargate]]'' by [[David Arnold]], ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' by [[Wojciech Kilar]], and ''[[Backdraft]]'' by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref name="soundtrack.net">[http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/]</ref>
*Popular or well known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack-there-of, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff<ref name="soundtrack.net"/>, as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]].
*"Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer.  
*Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 movie trailer projects, including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.
*Songs, which may include [[knock-off]]s of recognizable (but expensive to license) songs.

===Cast, crew, and studio information===
*A cast run is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie.
*Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

===Technical elements===
*[[Audio mixing (film and television)|Sound mix]]: many movie trailers are presented in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.
*[[Video resolution]]: movie trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being in general terms 35mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed at any resolution up to 1080p.

==United States MPAA rating cards==
These rating cards appear at the head of movie trailers in the United States. For information about the MPAA ratings, see [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]]. The MPAA mandates that theatrical trailers not exceed two minutes and thirty seconds in length, and each major studio is given one exception to this rule per year. There are no time restrictions concerning internet and home video trailers. 

[[Image:Redband.JPG|thumb|300px|The red band trailer title card for the film ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

A '''green band''' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards read: "The following PREVIEW has been approved for ALL AUDIENCES by the Motion Picture Association of America," and often include the movie's [[MPAA rating]] G,PG,PG-13. This signifies that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which includes limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, without any public announcement, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that the trailer is approved for "appropriate" audiences. (for example, the trailers of ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.90trailers.com/2012-2009-movie-trailer |title=Green Band Trailer}}</ref> ''[[Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant]]'' and ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'').  This means that the material in the trailer will be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the movie they have come to see.  When it appears in trailers on the internet, especially in aggregating sites like YouTube or Trailer Park, the "appropriateness" of the content has no context.

A '''yellow band''' is a yellow graphic that reads "The following PREVIEW has been approved ONLY for AGE-APPROPRIATE internet users by the Motion Picture Association of America" (for example, the trailers for ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' and ''[[The Strangers]]''). 

Trailers that do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a '''red band''', which reads "The following PREVIEW has been approved for RESTRICTED AUDIENCES ONLY by the Motion Picture Association of America" or "The following PREVIEW has been approved for MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY by the Motion Picture Association of America," and may only be shown before an R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movie. ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'', ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'', ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[My Best Friend's Girl]]'', ''[[Bruno (film)|Bruno]]'', ''[[Inglorious Basterds]]'', ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', ''[[Falling (film)|Falling]]'', ''[[Adventureland (film)|Adventureland]]'', ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'', ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'', ''[[Legion]]'', and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' carry this banner.<ref>IMDb.com Amityville trailer</ref> Due in part to the rising popularity of red band trailers, [[Regal Entertainment Group]] announced on [[March 2008]] that they would begin allowing red band trailers to play in their theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/10721-regal-ok-restricted-red-band-trailers|publisher=CanMag|accessdate=2008-03-17|title=Regal to Allow Red Band Trailers}}</ref> With the demand for restricted trailers on the rise, the MPAA had to quickly decide how to control red band trailers that appeared online. The MPAA requires that all red band trailers open to an [[Age gate]], which theoretically prevents underage users from watching.

==Use of trailers in other media==

The concept of the trailer format has spread to other non-cinema media as well. Trailers for [[computer game]]s have become especially popular. Comic book trailers have also pleased fans of the genre; [[Marvel Comics]] has been at the forefront of this type of marketing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Awards for trailers==

Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding movie trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'', and The [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. While the Golden Trailer Awards allow only trailers to be entered in the competition, the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of movie advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Kodak Theater]] in Hollywood.
