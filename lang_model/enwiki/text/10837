'''The Kyoto Protocol to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]''' (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

As part of the Kyoto Protocol, many developed countries have agreed to legally binding limitations/reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases in two commitments periods. The first commitment period applies to emissions between 2008-2012, and the second commitment period applies to emissions between 2013-2020.

</ref> The conference recommends that by 2005, industrialized countries should reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent, compared to 1988 levels.

'''1990''' IPCC issues a report declaring its certainty that human activity is resulting in pollutants that will intensify the greenhouse effect.

'''1992''' The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change [http://www.unfccc.int/ ("FCCC" or "UNFCCC")] among other agreements.

'''1995''' Parties to the FCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.

'''1997''' Parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.

'''2000''' Efforts to accommodate US and Australian objections to the Kyoto draft agreement{{clarify|date=May 2013}} fail at a meeting of signatories in the Hague.

'''2001''' [[George W. Bush]] withdraws US endorsement of the Kyoto Protocol. In November, the COP meeting in Marrakesh finalizes the provisions{{clarify|date=May 2013}} of the Kyoto Protocol without U.S support.

'''2002''' Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the FCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005

'''2011''' Canada withdraws from the protocol under the [[Harper government]], having greatly increased emissions over the target, citing the intent to create a made-in-Canada solution

</ref>  The treaty follows the main principles agreed in the original 1992 UN Framework Convention.<ref name="2004 grubb kyoto"/>  According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I Parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period (2008<U+2013>2012). These emissions limitation commitments are listed in Annex B of the Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol's first round commitments are the first detailed step taken within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Gupta ''et al.'', 2007).<ref name=gupta/> The Protocol establishes a structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. It set a timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commitments for a second commitment period (see [[Kyoto Protocol#Successor]] for details).<ref name="grubb commitments">{{harvnb|Grubb|Depledge|2001|p=269}}</ref> The first period emission reduction commitments expired on 31 December 2012.

The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."<ref name="unfccc2005"/> Even if Annex I Parties succeed in meeting their first-round commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations.<ref name="grubb commitments"/><ref name="ipcc kyoto stabilization"/>

For each of the different anthropogenic GHGs, different levels of emissions reductions would be required to meet the objective of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations (see [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations]]).<ref name="2007 meehl stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs">

*Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.
*Minimizing Impacts on Developing Countries by establishing an adaptation fund for climate change.
*Accounting, Reporting and Review in order to ensure the integrity of the Protocol.

==First commitment period: 2008-2012==
Under the Kyoto Protocol, 37 [[industrialized countries]] and the [[European Community]] (the [[European Union]]-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions.<ref name="2011 unfccc kyoto protocol overview"/>  The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), [[sulphur hexafluoride]] ({{chem|S|F|6}}), and two groups of gases, [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) and [[perfluorocarbon]]s (PFCs).<ref name="grubb kyoto gases">

The benchmark 1990 emission levels accepted by the Conference of the Parties of UNFCCC (decision 2/CP.3) were the values of "[[global warming potential]]" calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]].

Annex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated "flexibility" mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying [[emissions trading|emission allowances]] from other operators which have excess emissions credits.

==Flexible mechanisms==
{{See also|Economics of climate change mitigation#Kyoto Protocol}}

The Protocol defines three "[[flexibility mechanisms]]" that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments.<ref>

}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR WG3|2001}}
</ref>{{Rp|402|date=November 2012}}  The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM), and [[Joint Implementation]] (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to "trade" their emissions ([[Assigned amount units|Assigned Amount Unit]]s, AAUs, or "allowances" for short).

The economic basis for providing this flexibility is that the [[margin (economics)|marginal]] cost of reducing (or abating) emissions differs among countries.<ref name="toth 2001 flexibility mechanisms">

</ref>  Studies also showed that national losses in Annex I [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) could be reduced by use of the flexibility mechanisms.<ref name="hourcade 2001 economic costs of flexibility mechanisms"/>

The CDM and JI are called "project-based mechanisms," in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of "production" of emission reductions.<ref name="toth 2001 flexibility mechanisms"/>  The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.

The production of emission reductions generated by the CDM and JI can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments.<ref>

</ref> The emission reductions produced by the CDM and JI are both measured against a hypothetical [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|baseline]] of emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a particular emission reduction project. The emission reductions produced by the CDM are called [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs). The reductions are called "[[carbon credit|credits]]" because they are emission reductions credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Each Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a "designated national authority") to create and manage its [[greenhouse gas inventory]]. Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the "CDM process". This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.

Under the GIS a Party to the Protocol expecting that the development of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its Kyoto quota units (AAUs) to another Party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be "greened", i.e. channeled to the development and implementation of the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).<ref name="2009 carbon trust carbon market"/>{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}}

====Clean Development Mechanism====

Between 2001, which was the first year [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5&nbsp;billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) in emission reductions.<ref name=wdr>{{cite web

By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in [[China]] (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

====Joint Implementation====

The formal crediting period for [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&nbsp;20).<ref name="2009 carbon trust carbon market">{{cite web

The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.

==Stabilization of GHG concentrations==

As noted [[Kyoto Protocol#Objectives|earlier on]], the first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments are not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.<ref name="grubb commitments"/><ref name="ipcc kyoto stabilization">

Gupta ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name="450ppm scenarios"/> also looked at what 450&nbsp;ppm scenarios projected for non-Annex I Parties. Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions ([[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], [[East Asia]], and [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Asia]]) would need to be substantially reduced below [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|"business-as-usual"]].<ref name="450ppm scenarios"/> "Business-as-usual" are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below "business-as-usual".<ref name="450ppm scenarios"/>

==Details of the agreement==

The agreement is a protocol to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) adopted at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 3) in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.

National emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use [[land use]], land use change, and [[forestry]] (LULUCF) in meeting their targets.<ref name="Dessai 2001 3">{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=3}}</ref>  LULUCF activities are also called "sink" activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate.<ref>

{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=9}}
</ref>  Annex I Parties use of forest management in meeting their targets is capped.<ref name="forest management"/>

===Negotiations===

{{See also|Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations}}

Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing emissions.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=144}}
</ref> The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/> The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/>

At the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the [[Group of 77|G77]] was able to push for a mandate (the "Berlin mandate") where it was recognized that:<ref name="liverman berlin mandate">
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=290}}
</ref>
*developed nations had contributed most to the then-current concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere (see [[Greenhouse gas#Cumulative and historical emissions]]).
*developing country [[Greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions|emissions per-capita]] (i.e., average emissions per head of population)<ref>

}}, in {{harvnb|World Bank|2010|p=370}}
</ref> were still relatively low.
*and that the share of global emissions from developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.
During negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate.<ref>
{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=4}}
</ref> It has since become a member.<ref>
{{harvnb|G-77|2011}}
</ref>

The Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period.<ref name="liverman berlin mandate"/> However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|pp=145<U+2013>146}}
</ref> In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/> The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/>

====Emissions cuts====

[[Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations]] contains a list of the emissions cuts that were proposed by UNFCCC Parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world.<ref name="liverman negotiations">
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=291}}
</ref> The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=148}}
</ref> In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/> Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can "bank" their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/>

The EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included <U+2013> {{CO2}}, {{chem|CH|4}}, and {{chem|N|2|O}} <U+2013> with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> The EU also wanted to have a "bubble" commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/>

The most vulnerable nations <U+2013> the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS) <U+2013> pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed.<ref name="grubb differentiation"/> Two examples include differentiation of targets based on [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and differentiation based on [[energy intensity]] (energy use per unit of economic output).<ref name="grubb differentiation">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=151}}
</ref>

The final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the [[diplomat]] who chaired the negotiations.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=46}}
</ref>  The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=44}}
</ref> The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=45}}
</ref>

===Financial commitments===

The Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in [[UNFCCC]]. One such project is [[The Adaptation Fund]]"<ref>http://www.adaptation-fund.org/</ref>", that has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

===Implementational provisions===
The protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties [[United Nations Climate Change conference#2000: COP 6, The Hague, Netherlands|COP6]] of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in [[the Hague]] in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).

In 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6bis) was held in [[Bonn]] where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the [[European Union]]) managed to get the agreement of Japan and [[Russia]] by allowing more use of [[CO2 sink|carbon dioxide sinks]].

[[United Nations Climate Change conference#2001: COP 7, Marrakech, Morocco|COP7]] was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in [[Marrakech]] to establish the final details of the protocol.

The first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in [[Montreal]] from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

During COP13 in Bali 36 developed [[Contact Group|C.G.]] countries (plus the EU as a party in the [[European Union]]) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for [[Iceland]]; but, since the EU's member states each have individual obligations,<ref>{{cite web | title=The Kyoto protocol <U+2013> A brief summary | work=European Commission | url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/kyoto.htm | accessdate=19 April 2007 }}</ref> much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below [[Kyoto Protocol#Increase in greenhouse gas emission since 1990]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/3145.php |title=Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> Reduction limitations expire in 2013.

===Mechanism of compliance===

The protocol defines a mechanism of "compliance" as a "monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance."<ref>{{cite web

</ref> the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law.<ref name="grubb compliance"/> Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.<ref name="grubb compliance"/>

===Enforcement===

If the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%.  In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.<ref>

==Ratification process==

The Protocol was adopted by [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|COP 3]] of UNFCC on 11 December 1997 in [[Kyoto, Japan]]. It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to [[UNFCCC]], when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the [[European Community]] had signed. [[Ratification]] (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification of Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.<ref name=parties/>

Article 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force "on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in [[Annex I]] which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the [[Annex I]] countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Protocol full text (PDF)|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf|publisher=UNFCC Homepage}}</ref>

On 3 December 2007, Australia ratified the protocol during the first day of the COP13 in Bali.

As of May 2013, [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|191 countries]] and one regional economic organization (the [[European Economic Community|EC]]) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from [[Annex I]] countries.<ref name = "Kyoto-PDF-unfccc">{{cite web | title=Kyoto Protocol: Status of Ratification | url=http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2009 | publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] |format=PDF}}</ref> One of the 191 ratifying states<U+2014>Canada<U+2014>has denounced the protocol.

===US position===

The U.S. signed the Protocol, but did not ratify it.  Before the Protocol was agreed on, the US Senate passed the [[Byrd-Hagel Resolution]] unanimously disapproving of any international agreement that 1) did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and 2) "would seriously harm the economy of the United States".<ref>Byrd-Hagel Resolution (http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html)</ref> Therefore, even though the [[Clinton administration]] signed the treaty,<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ "Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact"]. All Politics (CNN). 11 December 1997. Retrieved 5 November 2006.</ref> it remained only a symbolic act and was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.

When [[George W. Bush]] was elected US president in 2000, he was asked by [[US Senator]] [[Chuck Hagel|Hagel]] what his administration's position was on climate change. Bush replied that he took climate change "very seriously,"<ref>http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/George_W__Bush_Energy_+_Oil.htm#56</ref> but that he opposed the Kyoto treaty, because "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy".<ref name="Dessai 2001 5"/>  Almost all world leaders (e.g., China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific islands) expressed their disappointment over President Bush's decision not to support the treaty.<ref>
{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=6}}
</ref>

The US accounted for 36% of emissions in 1990, and without US ratification, only an EU+Russia+Japan+small party coalition could place the treaty into legal effect. A deal was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.<ref>

===Other states and territories where the treaty is not applicable===
United States and (since 15 December 2012) Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the convention. The Protocol is furthermore not applied to UNFCCC-observers Andorra and the [[Holy See]] and UN member South Sudan (which may become a party after acceding to the UNFCCC). Although the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Cura<U+00E7>ao, Sint Maarten or the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/key-topics/treaties/search-the-treaty-database/1997/12/008415.html|work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)]]|title=Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref> The United Kingdom did not extent its ratification to Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Turks and Caicos Islands or the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, while Denmark excluded application to the Faroe Islands<ref name = "Ratification of Kyoto"/>

UNFCCC (2011)<ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/>{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} made an estimate of the total effect of implemented and adopted PaMs. Projected savings were estimated relative to a [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|reference (baseline) scenario]] where PaMs are not implemented.  PaMs were projected to deliver emissions savings relative to baseline of about 1.5 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq by 2010, and 2.8 thousand Tg {{chem|CO|2}} eq by 2020.<ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/>{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}}  In percentage terms, and using annual emissions in the year 1990 as a reference point, PaMs were projected to deliver at least a 5.0% reduction relative to baseline by 2010, and a 10.0% reduction relative to baseline in 2020.<ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/>{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} Scenarios reviewed by UNFCCC (2011)<ref name="2011 unfccc synthesis of annex I communications"/>{{Rp|14|date=November 2012}} still suggested that total Annex I annual emissions would increase out to 2020 (see the preceding paragraph).

Collectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the USA, have a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008-2012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}}  According to Olivier ''et al.'' (2011),<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}} the Kyoto Parties will comfortably exceed their collective target, with a projected average reduction of 16% for 2008-2012. This projection excludes both LULUCF and credits generated by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|24|date=November 2012}}

As noted in the preceding section, between 1990<U+2013>1999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs.<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the USA.<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990<U+2013>2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards.<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}} The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.<ref name="Long term trend in global CO2 emissions"/>{{Rp|25|date=November 2012}}

An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits or the use of the voluntary Green Investment Scheme.

In December 2011, Canada's environment minister, [[Peter Kent]], formally announced that [[Climate change in Canada|Canada]] would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (see the section on the [[Kyoto Protocol#Withdrawal of Canada|withdrawal of Canada]]).<ref name="vaughan 2011 canada withdrawal">

'''Emissions'''

GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7&nbsp;billion tonnes (billion&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000,000,000) of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. CO<sub>2</sub> was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by [[methane]] (26%) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O) (11%).

The [[energy sector]] was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8&nbsp;tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
*The Africa region's [[aggregate data|aggregate]] emissions were 1.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4&nbsp;tonnes.
*The Asia and Pacific region's aggregate emissions were 7.9&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6&nbsp;tonnes.
*The Latin America and [[Caribbean]] region's aggregate emissions were 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6&nbsp;tonnes.
*The "other" region includes [[Albania]], Armenia, [[Azerbaijan]], Georgia, Malta, [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1&nbsp;tonnes.

Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes.

''Trends''

In several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009).<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=3 April 2010}}{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>  For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990<U+2013>2005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.

Without US participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1<U+2013>1.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without US participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2<U+2013>2%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.

This has particularly centred on the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability of the developing world to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world.

As mentioned earlier, a number of Annex I Parties have implemented emissions trading schemes (ETSs) as part of efforts to meet their Kyoto commitments. General commentaries on emissions trading are contained in [[emissions trading]] and [[carbon emission trading]]. Individual articles on the ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes (see [[Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading]] for a list of ETSs).

One of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments.<ref name="toth flexibility mechanisms"/> Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources,<ref>

{{further|United Nations Climate Change conference}}
The official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the ''Conference of the Parties''. It is held every year as part of the United Nations Climate Change conference, which also serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. The first [[Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (MOP)]] was held in 2005 in conjunction with the eleventh Conferences of parties to UNFCCC. Also [[parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol]] can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin, while the 2012 conference was held in [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Doha]].
