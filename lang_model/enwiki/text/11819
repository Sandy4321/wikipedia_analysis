'''Cyclone Mala''' was the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]].<ref name="IMDrpt"/> In mid-April, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern [[Bay of Bengal]] and nearby [[Andaman Sea]]. Over a period of several days, the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April&nbsp;24. Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction. It attained gale-force winds and was [[Tropical cyclone naming|named]] ''Mala'' the next day. Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April&nbsp;27 and Mala subsequently underwent [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]] which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak. Early on April&nbsp;28, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph). The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a [[SSHS#Category 4|Category&nbsp;4-equivalent cyclone]]. Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[Myanmar]]'s [[Rakhine State]] on April&nbsp;29. Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning.

In contrast to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized loss of life along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near [[Yangon]] on April&nbsp;28 that spawned a possible [[tornado]] in an industrial zone. A total of 586&nbsp;homes were damaged there. Just outside the city in the [[Hinthada District]], a [[flash flood]] killed at least 18&nbsp;people. Overall, the storm claimed 37&nbsp;lives in the country and left US$6.7&nbsp;million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the [[Red Cross]] distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4&nbsp;million [[Burmese kyat|kyat]] (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the [[Ayeyarwady Region]].

Despite never being forecast to strike [[Bangladesh]], officials there warned residents that the storm could strike the nation and cause loss of life. Cautionary signals were raised at ports in [[Chittagong]], [[Cox's Bazar]], and [[Mongla]], advising seafaring vessels to remain docked until the storm's passage.<ref>{{cite news|work=''The Daily Star''|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|date=May 1, 2006|title=Cyclone spares Bangladesh, hits Burmese coast|location=Dhaka, Bangladesh}}</ref> Roughly 34,000&nbsp;members of the [[Bangladesh Red Crescent Society]] were placed on standby for possible relief efforts.<ref name="usatoday"/>

==Impact==
[[File:Cyclone Mala on April 29, 2006 at 0633 UTC.jpg|thumb|300px|Cyclone Mala making landfall in Rakhine State on April&nbsp;29]]
Throughout almost the entire existence of Mala, it produced rainfall in the Andaman and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] islands. Daily totals peaked on April&nbsp;27 at {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Car Nicobar]].<ref name="IMDrpt"/>

After moving through Myanmar, Mala brought heavy rains to northern Thailand. According to local meteorologists the storm also accelerated the onset of the seasonal [[monsoon]] which would contribute to a wetter-than-average year for the region.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chiang Mai|newspaper=The Nation|date=May 3, 2006|title=Early rains in North 'a sign of La Nina and wet year'}} {{subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis}}</ref>

===Myanmar===
Though Mala struck Myanmar as a powerful cyclone, early warnings and proper evacuations minimized loss of life along coastal areas. Additionally, no major [[storm surge]] was reported, limiting the potential for major damage.
