Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.<ref name=AARP-07>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt : The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online |first=Anita Mabante |last=Leach |date= August 2007 |url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081222084100/http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archivedate= December 22, 2008 | accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref>

Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records{{spaced ndash}} rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi{{spaced ndash}} is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and her father for introducing her to the [[traditional pop]] and [[Great American Songbook]] repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.<ref name="Asheralbumsales">{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Interview 17 June 1998 at Linda's home in Tucson, Arizona | first=Debbie |last=Kruger | publisher=debbiekruger.com | date=June 17, 1998 | url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html | accessdate = July 6, 2007}}</ref><ref name=starbulletin/>

Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as [[Lola Beltr<U+00E1>n]] and [[<U+00C9>dith Piaf]]; she has called their singing and rhythms "more like Greek music ...

She has said that "all girl singers" eventually "have to curtsy to [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]]".<ref name="tiptheirhat"/> Of [[Maria Callas]], Ronstadt says, "There's no one in her league.

===Beginning of professional career===
At age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Suzy.

===The Stone Poneys===
{{Main|Stone Poneys}}
Ronstadt visited a friend from Tucson, [[Bobby Kimmel]], in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday,<ref name=LATimes/> decided to move there permanently to form a band with him.<ref name="Soulful"/> Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter [[Kenny Edwards]], and eventually the three of them were signed by [[Nik Venet]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in the summer of 1966 as "[[The Stone Poneys]]". The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967<U+2013>68: ''[[The Stone Poneys (album)|The Stone Poneys]]''; ''[[Evergreen, Volume 2]]''; and ''[[Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III]]''. The band is best known for their hit single "[[Different Drum]]" (written by [[Michael Nesmith]] prior to his joining [[the Monkees]]), which reached No. 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart as well as No. 12 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine. More than 45 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings.<ref>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | publisher=Rhapsody | url=http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/linda-ronstadt | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref>

Besides recording one of her most enduring songs, Ronstadt was already showcasing her highly expressive performance of an eclectic mix of songs, often from under-appreciated songwriters, utilizing a wide array of backing musicians. Additionally, many of her songs, including "Different Drum", were written by male songwriters and had minimal lyric changes, allowing Ronstadt to toy with [[gender roles]] that were in ferment in the 1960s and 1970s. While the Stone Poneys broke up before the release of their third album, Kenny Edwards recorded and toured with Ronstadt from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

In 2008 Australia's [[Raven Records]] released a compilation CD titled ''The Stone Poneys''. The disc features all tracks from the first two Stone Poneys albums and four tracks from the third album.

===Solo career===
Still contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, ''[[Hand Sown ... Home Grown]]'', in 1969. It has been called the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.<ref name="Linen106"/> During this same period, she contributed to the ''[[Music From Free Creek]]'' "super session" project.

Ronstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for [[Remington Products|Remington]] electric razors, in which a multitracked Ronstadt and [[Frank Zappa]] claimed that the electric razor "cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted".<ref name=Remington>{{cite web | work= The Linda Ronstadt Download Center | title= Remington Electric Razor | url=http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html | publisher=westhamptonpg personal webpage|accessdate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>

Ronstadt's second solo album, ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]'', was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by [[Elliot Mazer]], whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of [[Janis Joplin]], who had worked with him on her ''Cheap Thrills'' album.<ref name=Capitol>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt's 1969<U+2013>1974 Capitol Records Solo Output Presented in New 2-CD Collection, 'The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capitol Years' | publisher=PR Newswire | date=November 8, 2005 | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-08-2005/0004211041&EDATE= | accessdate = September 30, 2007}}</ref> The ''Silk Purse'' album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single "Long Long Time", and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).

In a 1976 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview with [[Cameron Crowe]], Ronstadt explained that "they haven't invented a word for that loneliness that everybody goes through on the road.

Several years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first "arena-class rock diva", with "hugely anticipated tours",<ref name="doubleplatinum"/> she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally. There were few "girl singers" on the Rock circuit at the time, and those that were, were relegated to "groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys", a status Ronstadt avoided.<ref name=groupie>{{cite web | work=Fusion Magazine | title= Female Rocker Roundup: Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Carey, Lydia Pense, Nansi Nevins - Part 1 |date=December 26, 1969 | first=Pete |last=Senoff | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intfus1.htm  | accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref> Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, and a series of boyfriend-managers.

Soon after she went solo in the late 1960s, one of her first backing bands was the pioneering country-rock band [[Swampwater]], famous for synthesizing [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and swamp-rock elements into their music. Its members included Cajun fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]] and John Beland, who later joined [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]],<ref name=swamprock>{{cite web | work=The Rising Storm | title= Swampwater "Swampwater" | author=jason | date=May 20, 2007 | url=http://therisingstorm.net/swampwater-swampwater/ | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> as well as Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell and Eric White, brother of [[Clarence White]] of [[The Byrds]].

Another backing band featured players [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Bernie Leadon]] and [[Randy Meisner]], who went on to form the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on ''[[Linda Ronstadt (album)|Linda Ronstadt]]'', her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's "[[Rock Me On the Water]] was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]. She said, "As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims."<ref name=MIXMag2000/> Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with [[David Geffen]] about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's [[Asylum Records]] label.<ref>See generally Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 159, 173, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref>

|source=<U+2014>[[Peter Asher]], on collaborating with Ronstadt<ref name="Goldmine589"/>}}
Ronstadt began her fourth solo album, ''[[Don't Cry Now]]'', in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with [[Asylum Records]]) and [[J. D. Souther|John David "J.D." Souther]] producing most of the album's tracks. But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked [[Peter Asher]], who came highly recommended to her by [[James Taylor]]'s sister [[Kate Taylor]], to help her produce two of them: "Sail Away" and "I Believe in You".<ref name="producer3"/>

The album featured Ronstadt's first country hit, "[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]", which she had first recorded on ''Hand Sown ... Home Grown''{{spaced ndash}} this time hitting the Country Top 20.

With the release of ''Don't Cry Now'', Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on [[Neil Young]]'s ''Time Fades Away'' tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before. Backstage at a concert in Texas, [[Chris Hillman]] introduced her to [[Emmylou Harris]], telling them, "You two could be good friends",<ref name=goldmine>{{cite web | title=And then there were two...

Asher turned out to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any producer she had worked with previously.<ref name=MIXMag2000>{{cite web | work=Mix Magazine| title=Linda Ronstadt |date=December 1, 2000 |first=Dan |last=Daley| url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio.<ref name="producer3"/> Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a "woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer,<ref name="negativequalities">{{cite web | title=Peter Asher Interview |first= Caroline |last=Ryder | work=[[Swindle (magazine)|Swindle]] |date= October 2007 |url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025181433/http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ |archivedate= October 25, 2007 |accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref> and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. "It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with", he said.<ref name="producer3"/>

Asher executive produced a tribute CD called ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', released September 6, 2011, on which Ronstadt's 1976 version of [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[That'll Be The Day]]" appears among newly recorded versions of Holly's songs by various artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/132169-listen-buddy-holly-tribute-cd-sept-6th.html |title=Listen To Me: Buddy Holly Tribute CD Out Sept. 6th |date=July 26, 2011 |publisher=AltSounds.com |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}

Ronstadt captured the sounds of [[country music]] and the rhythms of [[ranchera]] music{{spaced ndash}} which she likened in 1968 to ''"Mexican bluegrass"''{{spaced ndash}} and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll and some of her pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] roots.<ref name=Soulful>{{cite web | work=Cleveland Scene | title=Gypsy Eyes, Interview 1968| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdis.htm | accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref> Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusing of country music and rock 'n' roll called [[Country rock]], started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music "purists" for her "brand of music" which crossed many genres. ''Country Western Stars'' magazine wrote in 1970 that "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda." She never categorized herself and stuck to her genre-crossing brand of music.<ref name=CWS>{{cite web | work=Country Western Stars | title=Sexy new sweetheart for country western|date= March 1970 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/cws70-3.html | accessdate = April 8, 2008}}</ref>

More importantly, Ronstadt became a highly successful "Albums Artist", some of which contain material written by her.<ref name=MIXMag2000/>

Ronstadt's natural vocal range spans several octaves from [[contralto]] to [[soprano]], and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine pointed out that a whole generation, "but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Chuck Berry]]."<ref name="interpreter6">{{cite web |work=Rolling Stone | title=Artists: Linda Ronstadt Bio, Pictures, Video| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/linda-ronstadt/biography | accessdate = November 24, 2012}}</ref>

Others have argued that Ronstadt had the same generational effect with her [[Great American Songbook]] music, exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and 1930s{{spaced ndash}} music which, ironically, was pushed aside because of the advent of rock 'n' roll.

In the 1974 book ''Rock 'N' Roll Woman'', author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt's "own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union."<ref name="Soulful"/>

By this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Swampwater]], [[Neil Young]], and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and roll.<ref name=goldmine/>

====Most successful female singer of the 1970s====

With the release of ''Heart Like a Wheel'', Ronstadt reached No. 1 on the Billboard Album Chart (it was also the first of four No. 1 Country Albums for Ronstadt) and the disc was certified Double-Platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA Certifcations]</ref> (over two million copies sold in the U.S.). In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings, and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of Ronstadt's interpreting and recording their songs. Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists. This skill would eventually serve her later in her career, as a master song interpreter.

''Heart Like a Wheel''{{'}}s first single release, "[[You're No Good]]"{{spaced ndash}} a rockified version of an R&B song written by [[Clint Ballard, Jr.]] that Ronstadt had initially resisted because Andrew Gold's guitar tracks sounded too much like a "Beatles song" to her<ref name="producer3"/>{{spaced ndash}} climbed to No. 1 on both the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[Cash Box]] Pop singles charts.<ref name=bronson>Bronson, Fred.

The album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock with ''Heart Like a Wheel'', her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first Grammy Award<ref name = 1stgrammy>{{cite web | title='Grammy.com: Grammy Award Winners'| work=1975<U+2013>18th Annual Grammy Awards| url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}</ref> for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance/Female]] for "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)" which was originally a 1940s hit by [[Hank Williams]]. Ronstadt's interpretation peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy as well as the Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female trophy.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine put Ronstadt on its cover in March 1975. This was the first of six ''Rolling Stone'' magazine covers shot by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by [[Ben Fong-Torres]], discussing Ronstadt's many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.

In September 1975, Ronstadt's album ''[[Prisoner In Disguise]]'' was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the Billboard Album Chart and sold over a million copies.<ref name = RIAAsearch/> It became her second in a row to go platinum, "a grand slam" in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually be the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990).<ref name=people75/> The disc's first single release was "[[Love Is A Rose]]". It was climbing the Pop and Country charts but [[(Love is Like a) Heat Wave|Heat Wave]], a rockified version of the 1963 hit by [[Martha and the Vandellas]], was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the "Love Is a Rose" single and issued "Heat Wave" with "Love Is a Rose" on the B-side. "Heat Wave" hit the Top Five on Billboard's Hot 100 while "Love Is A Rose" hit the Top Five on Billboard's Country chart.

In 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of Billboard's Album Chart and won her second career [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her third consecutive platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch/> album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, "Try Me Again" and "Lo Siento Mi Vida". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson's classic "Crazy", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.

At the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of ''Heart Like a Wheel'' with her album ''[[Simple Dreams]]'', which held the No. 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the Billboard Album Chart. It also knocked [[Elvis Presley]] out of No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums chart. It sold over 3<U+00BD> million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone. The album was released in September 1977, and by December it had replaced [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s long-running No. 1 album ''Rumours'' in the top spot. ''Simple Dreams'' spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts. Among them were the [[RIAA]] platinum-certified single "[[Blue Bayou]]", a Country Rock interpretation of a [[Roy Orbison]] song, "It's So Easy"{{spaced ndash}} previously sung by Buddy Holly{{spaced ndash}} and "[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]", a song written by [[Warren Zevon]], an up-and-coming songwriter of the time whom Ronstadt elected to highlight and record. The album garnered several Grammy Award nominations{{spaced ndash}} including Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for "Blue Bayou"{{spaced ndash}} and won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.

''Simple Dreams'' became one of the singer's best-selling international-selling albums as well, reaching No. 1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts.<ref name="international">{{cite web | title=Ronstadt Facts, Investigative International Sales | work=Linda Ronstadt Record Sales Information Page (German Site) | url=http://lindaronstadt.de/facts.htm | accessdate = April 17, 2007}}</ref> ''Simple Dreams'' also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist as well. The same year, she completed a concert tour around Europe. As ''Country Music Magazine'' wrote in October 1978, ''Simple Dreams'' solidified Ronstadt's role as "easily the most successful female rock and roll ''and'' country star at this time".<ref name=ramblers />

Also in 1977, she was asked by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to sing the [[U.S. National Anthem]] at game three of the [[World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]].<ref name=nationalanthem>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Singing the National Anthem at Game three of World Series | publisher= [[YouTube]] | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxYYwE_ezE | accessdate = August 11, 2007}}</ref>

====''Time'' magazine and Ronstadt's "rock chick" image====

Eventually, Ronstadt's rock-and-roll image became just as famous as her music by the mid-1970s.<ref name="Goldmine589"/> The 1977 appearance on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine under the banner "[[torch song|Torchy]] Rock" was controversial for Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock.<ref name=identitycrisis /><ref name=rockwell>{{cite book | title= Stranded{{spaced ndash}} Rock and Roll for a Desert Island | editor=Greil Marcus | contribution=Living in the USA | last=Rockwell | first=John | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/desertisle.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear,<ref name=Asherscomment>{{cite web | work=Mojo | title= Homecoming Queen, April 1995| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artmojo.htm | accessdate = May 11, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover,<ref name=identitycrisis /> and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project<ref name=identitycrisis /> (although she wore a rather revealing dress for the cover of ''Hasten Down the Wind'', which projected an image of her not all that different from the ''Time'' magazine cover){{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

In 2004, she was interviewed for ''[[CBS This Morning]]''<ref name=cbs>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | publisher= [[CBS News]] |date=December 5, 2004 | url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/CBSNSM/CBS_SundayAM.html | accessdate = July 12, 2007}}</ref> and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her [[Svengali]]. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area.

Ronstadt and Asher claim to have viewed the photos prior to publication and, when their request that the photos be removed was denied, they unceremoniously threw Leibovitz out of the house.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1978, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine declared Ronstadt, "by far America's best-known female rock singer."<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/> She scored a third No. 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart <U+2013> at this point equaling the record set by Carole King in 1974 <U+2013> with ''[[Living in the USA]]''. She achieved a major hit single with "[[Ooh Baby Baby]]," with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country and R&B). ''Living in the USA'' was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advance copies).<ref name="doubleplatinum"/> The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.

At the end of that year, ''Billboard'' magazine crowned Ronstadt with three No. 1 Awards for the Year: No. 1 Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, No. 1 Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and No. 1 Female Artist of the Year (overall).<ref name=TopFemale>{{cite web | work=Billboard | title=Congratulations | date=December 23, 1978 | url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html | accessdate = June 24, 2007}}</ref>

''Living in the USA'' showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album<ref name="Goldmine589"/> and concert <U+2013> which at the time were recorded live on radio or television.

Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film ''[[FM (film)|FM]]'', where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station's knowledge. The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me", "Love Me Tender" and "[[Tumbling Dice]]". Ronstadt was persuaded to record "Tumbling Dice" after [[Mick Jagger]] came backstage when she was at a concert and said, "You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs."<ref name=MickJagger>{{cite web | work=The Hit Parader Interview | title=Tour Reflections and Simple Dreams | date=March 1978 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm | accessdate = December 29, 2010}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Living in the USA'', Ronstadt conducted album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with [[The Rolling Stones]] at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where Ronstadt and Jagger sang "Tumbling Dice".<ref>{{cite web | title= Ronstadt and Rolling Stones, July 21, 1978| work=Photos| url=http://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1,1222215,1222980|publisher=iorr.org forum | accessdate = December 9, 2010}}{{dubious|date=November 2012|reason=NON-RS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Rolling Stones U.S. Tour 1978 |date=July 21, 1978 | url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Rolling_Stones_U.S._Tour_1978.html0 |publisher=MyEtyomology.com/SpeedyLook| accessdate = December 9, 2010}}{{dubious|date=November 2012|reason=NON-RS}}</ref> On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, "I loved it.

As ''Rolling Stone'' magazine dubbed her "Rock's Venus",<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/> her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits]]'' album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the [[RIAA]] for seven-times platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over seven million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits Volume II]]'' was released and certified platinum.<ref name=RIAAsearch/>

In 1979, Ronstadt went on an international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]], and the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in Tokyo. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend [[Lowell George]], held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], in Los Angeles.

By the end of the decade, Ronstadt had outsold her female competition; no other female artist to date had five straight platinum LPs{{spaced ndash}} ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]'', and ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' among them.<ref name=PeopleMagazine>{{cite web | work= [[People (magazine)|People]] | title= On the Charts and in Men's Hearts Linda Ronstadt is  No. 1 With a Bullet | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artpeo77.htm |date=October 24, 1977 | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Us Weekly]]'' reported in 1978 that Ronstadt, [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Carly Simon]] had become "The Queens of Rock"<ref name=Ward1978/> and "Rock is no longer exclusively male.

In 1980, Ronstadt released ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'', her seventh consecutive platinum-selling album. It is a straightforward rock and roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, [[The Cretones]], and musician Mark Goldenberg who played on the record himself.

She also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine for a record-setting sixth time. ''Mad Love'' entered the ''Billboard'' Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the No. 3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with "How Do I Make You?", originally recorded by [[Billy Thermal]], and "Hurt So Bad", originally a Top 10 hit for [[Little Anthony & the Imperials]]. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to [[Pat Benatar]]'s ''[[Crimes of Passion]]'' album). Benatar praised Ronstadt by stating, "There are a lot of good female singers around. How could I be the best?

In the summer of 1980 Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. [[Joseph Papp]] cast her as the lead in the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', alongside [[Kevin Kline]].<ref name=Pirates>{{cite web | work= Hit Parader| title=Rock Queen Conquers Broadway and Lives Happily Ever After |date=September 1981|url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp81.htm | accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref>  She said singing Gilbert and Sullivan was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created [[Tucson]]'s first orchestra, the ''Club Filarmonico Tucsonense'', and had once created an arrangement of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.<ref name=AARP-07/>

''The Pirates of Penzance'' opened for a limited engagement in New York City's [[Central Park]], eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.<ref name=imbd>{{cite web | publisher = [[Internet Broadway Database]] | title=Linda Ronstadt|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306| accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' was effusive in its praise: "... she has not dodged the [[coloratura]] demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&S canon): from her entrance trilling 'Poor Wand'ring One,' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way."<ref name=bronson/> Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and [[Angela Lansbury]] in the 1983 operetta's film version. Ronstadt received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for the role in the film version. She garnered a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' won several Tony Awards, including a [[Tony Award for Best Revival]].

As a child, Ronstadt had discovered the opera ''[[La boh<U+00E8>me]]'' through the silent film with [[Lillian Gish]] and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the opera superstar [[Beverly Sills]], she was told, ''"My dear, ''every'' soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!"'' In 1984, Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp's [[Public Theater]]. However, the production was a critical and commercial disaster, closing after only a few nights.<ref name=Mimi>{{cite web | work= [[Newsweek]] | title=A Pop Star Goes Puccini |first=Jack |last=Kroll |date=December 10, 1984|url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artnw84.htm | accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref>

In 1982, Ronstadt released the album ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]'', a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified platinum. It peaked at No. 31 on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with "Get Closer" and "[[I Knew You When]]"{{spaced ndash}} a 1965 hit by [[Billy Joe Royal]]{{spaced ndash}} while the Jimmy Webb song "Easy For You To Say" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. "Sometimes You Just Can't Win" was picked up by country radio, and made it to No. 27 on that listing. Rondstadt also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], his second Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Package]].

Along with the release of her ''Get Closer'' album, Ronstadt embarked on a North American tour, remaining one of the top rock-concert draws that summer and fall. On November 25, 1982, her "Happy Thanksgiving Day" concert was held at the [[Reunion Arena]] in Dallas and broadcast live via satellite to [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] radio stations in the United States.<ref name=dallas>{{cite web | work=Billboard | title=Linda Ronstadt Live.

Ronstadt eventually tired of playing arenas.<ref name=identitycrisis/> She had ceased to feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were "appropriate places for music". She wanted "angels in the architecture"{{spaced ndash}} a reference to a lyric in the [[Paul Simon]] song "[[You Can Call Me Al]]" from the 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different ''Graceland'' track, "Under African Skies". The lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: "Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona....")

Ronstadt's recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two of these have been certified triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.<ref name="certifications"/>

By recording [[traditional pop]], [[Old-time music|traditional country]], [[Latin American music|traditional Latin roots]], and [[adult contemporary]], Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.

===Jazz/pop trilogy===
In 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of jazz and pop standards (later marketed in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] form) titled ''Keeping Out of Mischief'' with the assistance of producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. "Doing that killed me", she said in a ''Time'' magazine interview.<ref name="Time interview">{{cite news | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=Linda Leads the Band | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833-2,00.html| accessdate = June 6, 2009 | date=September 26, 1983 | first1=Jay | last1=Cocks | first2=Denise | last2=Worrell}}</ref> But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her.<ref name="Jerry Wexler">{{cite web | work= [[Down Beat]] | title=An Intimate Conversation with Linda Ronstadt |first=Steve |last=Bloom | date=July 1985 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm| accessdate = August 18, 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to somehow convince her reluctant record company, [[Elektra Records]], to [[greenlight]] this type of album under her contract.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle" />

By 1983, Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor and master of jazz/traditional pop orchestration [[Nelson Riddle]]. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]], recording a trilogy of [[jazz]]/ [[traditional pop]] albums: ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'' (1983<U+2014>U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); ''[[Lush Life (Linda Ronstadt album)|Lush Life]]'' (1984<U+2014>U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and ''[[For Sentimental Reasons (Linda Ronstadt album)|For Sentimental Reasons]]'' (1986<U+2014>U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the U.S. alone.

The album design for ''What's New'' by designer [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]] was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a [[Walkman]] headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered "elevator music" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Riddle, and ''What's New'' became a hit. The album was released in September 1983, it spent 81 weeks on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and held the No. 3 position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot by [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' and Lionel Richie's ''Can't Slow Down'') and the [[RIAA]] [[certified]] it triple platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch/> (over three million copies sold in the U.S. alone).

Ronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record ''What's New'' or record with Riddle. According to [[jazz]] historian [[Peter Levinson]], author of the book ''September in the Rain{{spaced ndash}} a Biography on Nelson Riddle'', Joe Smith, president of [[Elektra Records]], was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle">{{cite web | work=Jerry Jazz Musician | title=The Peter Levinson Interview | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured [[Danny Kortchmar]] as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.

''What's New'' brought Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, "the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref name=nelsonriddle>{{cite web | title=Peter Levinson (Interview) | publisher=jerryjazzmusician.com | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> which in 1983 was considered 'Vintage Pop'". Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life.<ref name=nelsonriddle/> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, ''What's New'' "isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | title=Linda Ronstadt Celebrate the Golden Age of Pop | author = [[Stephen Holden|Holden, Stephen]] | date=September 4, 1983 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html | accessdate = May 10, 2007| date=February 7, 2005}}</ref> ''What's New'' is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]].<ref name=nytimes/>

In 1984, Ronstadt and Riddle performed these songs live, in [[concert halls]] throughout Australia, Japan and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Pine Knob]].

In 2004, Ronstadt released ''[[Hummin' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin' to Myself]]'', her album for [[Verve Records]]. It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached No. 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at No. 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.<ref name="JazzTimes2"/>

===="Trio" recordings====

|quote="When (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I've never heard before. We (recorded the vocals) as individual parts, because we didn't have the luxury of spending a lot of time together on a tour bus ... and knowing each other's (vocal) moves ... takes years."|source=<U+2014>Linda Ronstadt<ref name=MIXMag2000/>}}
In 1978, Ronstadt, [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], friends and admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton's "[[I Will Always Love You]]" on ''Prisoner in Disguise'') attempted to collaborate on a ''Trio'' album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.

In January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the No. 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the Pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, it produced four Top Ten Country singles including "To Know Him Is To Love Him" which hit No.&nbsp;1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, U2, Prince and Whitney Houston.

In 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{spaced ndash}} and owed her record company a finished album{{spaced ndash}} removed Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album ''Feels Like Home''.

However, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of [[Neil Young]]'s "After The Gold Rush" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three ladies also received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Album.

====''Canciones''{{spaced ndash}} songs of the Ronstadt family====
At the end of 1987, Ronstadt released ''[[Canciones de Mi Padre]]'', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as "world class songs".  Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rub<U+00E9>n Fuentes]].

These ''canciones'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.<ref name=MyFathersSongs>{{cite web | work=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily | title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre - A Musical Family |first=James S. |last=Griffith | url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html | accessdate = May 30, 2007}}</ref> Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was herself an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s.  Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible Anglo accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.<ref name=MexAm>{{cite web | title=American Way | work=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm| accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Herbst |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |accessdate = October 19, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archivedate = October 22, 2006}}</ref> In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, ''"Lo siento mi vida"''{{spaced ndash}} a song that she included in her Grammy Award-winning album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltr<U+00E1>n]] as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo "Lalo" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.<ref name="AARP-07"/>

This album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc's [[RIAA]] double-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over two million copies sold in the U.S.) certification, making it the biggest-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show, served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.

Ronstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on Broadway. She called the stage show by the same name ''Canciones de mi Padre''. These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in ''La boh<U+00E8>me'', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''Great Performances'' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].

Ronstadt later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s; their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair for Ronstadt, where she appeared to do the "bare minimum" to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow-up to the first ''Canciones''. For this effort she won a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well known "afro-Cuban" songs. This disc was titled ''[[Frenes<U+00ED> (album)|Frenes<U+00ED>]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy Award, this time the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].

In 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''San Juan Bautista''. It was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The production was part of the PBS ''Great Performances'' series.

====Returning to the contemporary music scene====
By the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with "[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]", which peaked at No. 2 in March.<ref name=bronson/> Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with [[James Ingram]] was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling Gold single in the U.S.{{spaced ndash}} one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled "Dreams To Dream". Although "Dreams To Dream" failed to achieve the success of "Somewhere Out There", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.

In 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. This effort, titled ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'', became one of the singer's most successful albums{{spaced ndash}} in terms of production, arrangements, chart sales and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the ''Billboard'' chart, reaching the No. 7 position and being certified triple-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also garnered critical acclaim, receiving numerous Grammy Award nominations and being praised by [[Amazon.com]] as "an album that defines virtually everything that is right about adult contemporary pop".<ref name=CryReview>{{cite web |title=''Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind'' Editorial Review | publisher= [[Amazon.com]] |first=Daniel |last=Durchholz |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002H7E | accessdate = July 10, 2008}}</ref> Ronstadt featured New Orleans soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the album's songs.

Ronstadt incorporated the sounds of the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]], [[Tower of Power]] horns, the [[Skywalker Symphony]] and numerous musicians. It has duets, including "[[Don't Know Much]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 No. 2 hit, Christmas 1989<ref name=bronson/>) and "[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 No. 11 hit), both of which were long-running No. 1 Adult Contemporary hits. These duets with Neville received much critical acclaim, earning several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed "Don't Know Much" together on the telecast.<ref name=kqed/> ("Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. "I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.")<ref>Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). "Home Grown". ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''.</ref>

In December 1990, she participated in a concert held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] to commemorate [[John Lennon]]'s 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included [[Miles Davis]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Sean Lennon]]. An album resulted, titled ''Happy Birthday, John''.<ref name=Lennon>{{cite web | title=John Lennon Super Live -- Japan | work=Dream Power |first=Hisataka |last=Suzuki |first2=Shiona |last2=MacKenzie |date=November 9, 2001 | url=http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/dreampower2001.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007}}</ref>

===A return to roots music===
Continuing with her crafted approach to more mainstream-oriented material, Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed ''[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]'' album at the end of 1993. It includes New Age arrangements such as the lead single "Heartbeats Accelerating" as well as the self-penned title track and features the unique glass armonica instrument. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at No. 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]'s classic hit "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, "Walk On", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled "The Blue Train" charted 10 weeks in ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching No.&nbsp;75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year and her version of the song "Perfidia" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.<ref name="billboardmag">

In 1996, Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached No. 78 in ''Billboard''. The album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].

In 1998, Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stands{{spaced ndash}} at 60,000 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008{{spaced ndash}} as the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalogue. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.

Despite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', a folk-rock-oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of ''Billboard'''s Country Albums chart (#73 on the main ''Billboard'' album chart). However, it would sell roughly half the number of copies that ''[[Trio II]]'' sold and had gone out of print as of December 2010.

Also in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Jackson Browne]] at [[Staples Center]]'s 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, "It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century", and "Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year's Eve in Los Angeles."<ref name=NewYearsEve>{{cite web |title=The Eagles to Perform at Staples Center |date=May 6, 1999 |publisher=Staples Center |url=http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928135754/http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0  |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref>

In 2000, Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the [[Elektra Records|Elektra/Asylum label]]. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song "River", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney's signature song, "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]".

Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under the [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]] labels.

|source=<U+2014>Linda Ronstadt<ref name="Goldmine589"/>}}
In 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her then-new friend, musician and musical scholar [[Ann Savoy]], to record ''[[Adieu False Heart]]''. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But ''[[Adieu False Heart]]'' was a commercial failure, peaking at No. 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year.  This is the last time Linda Ronstadt recorded an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as the result of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in December 2012.

''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of The Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

In 2007, Ronstadt could be heard on the compilation album ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]''{{spaced ndash}} a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artist{{spaced ndash}} on the track "Miss Otis Regrets".<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Linda Ronstadt] Rock on the Net.</ref>

In the summer of 2007, Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock and folk music into her repertoire.  It was one of her final concerts.

===Retirement===
In 2011, Ronstadt was interviewed by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' and announced her retirement.<ref name="retirement">{{cite web | author = Burch, Cathalena E.| date = April 22, 2011 | title=Ronstadt: Legacy 'Belongs 100 Percent to Nelson' | url=http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/blogs/caliente-tuned-in/ronstadt-legacy-belongs-percent-to-nelson/article_17e2d7b2-6ca0-11e0-b37e-001cc4c002e0.html | work = [[Arizona Daily Star]] | accessdate = September 4, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, she revealed to [[AARP]] that she has [[Parkinson's disease]], and can no longer "sing a note".<ref>[[Brian Mansfield|Mansfield, Brian]] (August 23, 2013).

==Personal life==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's private life became increasingly public. It was fueled by a relationship with then<U+2013>Governor of California [[Jerry Brown]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[presidential candidate]].

After living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California.<ref name=SFGateSale/> "Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment," she says. "I couldn't breathe the air, and I didn't want to drive on the freeways to get to the studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city.

===Political activism===
Ronstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the [[Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary film about the [[Iraq War]]; she dedicated the song "Desperado" to Moore.<ref name=aladdin2>{{cite web | title=The Progressive | work=Linda Ronstadt Gets the Hook at Aladdin| first=Matthew |last=Rothschild |date=July 21, 2004

Following the concert, news accounts reported that Ronstadt was "evicted" from the hotel premises.<ref name=aladdin>{{cite web | work=Las Vegas Review-Journal | title=Aladdin officials defend eviction of singer after political comments |first=Mike |last=Weatherford |date=July 20, 2004 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Jul-20-Tue-2004/news/24348468.html | accessdate = December 13, 2012}}</ref> Ronstadt's comments, as well as the reactions of some audience members and the hotel, became a topic of discussion nationwide.

Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued in her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America.

At a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' that she was "embarrassed [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] (was) from the United States.... He's an idiot.... He's enormously incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes.... Now the fact that we were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have died <U+2013> it's just as immoral as racism." Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident by noting, "If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone ... you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful.
