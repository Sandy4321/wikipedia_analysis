'''Samuel Davies''' (November 3, 1723-February 4, 1761)<ref name="encyclopediavirginia">{{cite web|title=Samuel Davies (1723<U+2013>1761)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Davies_Samuel_1723-1761|work=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=18 January 2012}}</ref> was an [[evangelism|evangelist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. Davies ministered in [[Hanover County, Virginia|Hanover County]] from 1748-1759, followed by a term as the fourth [[President of Princeton University]], then known as the College of New Jersey, from 1759 to 1761. One of the first non-Anglican preachers in [[Virginia]], he was a strong advocate for religious freedom, and helped to institute significant religious reforms in the colony. Davies was also a prolific writer, authoring several hymns and publishing a book of poetry.

== Early life ==

Davies was born in [[New Castle County, Delaware]] to David Davies and Martha Thomas Davies, [[Baptist]]s of [[Welsh American|Welsh]] descent. Davies' mother eventually became a follower of presbyterian doctrine, which led to his earliest exposure to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology.<ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> A child of deeply religious parents, his mother named him after the prophet [[Samuel]].<ref name="puritansermons">{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Thomas Talbot|title=Samuel Davies: Apostle of Virginia|journal=The Banner of Truth Magazine|year=1983|month=April|url=http://www.puritansermons.com/pdf/sdavies1.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> The Davies could not afford to send their son to college, so they instead sent him to receive his early education under the tutelage of Rev. [[Samuel Blair (Presbyterian minister)|Samuel Blair]] at the academy he conducted in [[Londonderry Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Faggs Manor]], Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Samuel|title=Letter from Mr. Samuel Blair, Minister at New Londonderry, to Mr. Prince, Minister at Boston, August 6th, 1744|year=1744|url=http://www.revival-library.org/catalogues/1725ff/blair.html}}</ref> Blair's son, also named [[Samuel Blair (chaplain)|Samuel]], was a member of Princeton's graduating class of 1760, the final class over which Davies presided over as school president. The younger Blair later became the second [[chaplain]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Samuel Blair Sermons, 1766-1769: Finding Aid|url=http://findingaids.princeton.edu/getEad?eadid=C0291&kw=#bioghist|publisher=Princeton University Library|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=2008}}</ref>

== Career in the ministry ==

=== Service in Virginia ===

Davies completed his studies with Blair, and was licensed to preach by the [[Presbyterian polity|Presbytery]] of New Castle in 1746.<ref name="etcweb.princeton">{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|year=1978|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0691046549|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/davies_samuel.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|chapter=Davies, Samuel}}</ref> He joined the [[The Old Side<U+2013>New Side Controversy|New Side]] [[synod]] of New York, and married Sarah Kirkpatrick on October 23, 1746, while he was preaching in Pennsylvania and Delaware. He was ordained as an [[evangelism|evangelist]] to Virginia several months later, on February 17, 1747.<ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> In Virginia he served religious [[dissenter]]s to the [[Anglican Church]] in [[Hanover County, Virginia]], working as pastor of four congregations which had been licensed by the [[Colonial America|Colonial]] government in 1743. He eventually led seven congregations in five counties, fulfilling his duties while suffering through frail health from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> In addition to his illness, he also suffered through the death of his wife Sarah from a [[miscarriage]] on September 15, 1747, shortly before their first anniversary.<ref name="puritansermons" /><ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> As the first non-[[Anglican]] minister licensed to preach in Virginia, Davies advanced the cause of religious and civil liberty in colonial Virginia. Davies' strong religious convictions led him to value the "freeborn mind" and the inalienable "liberty of conscience" that the established Anglican Church in Virginia often failed to respect in the days before independence. Davies was one of the main founders and first moderator of the Presbytery of Hanover, a group of all the Presbyterian ministers in Virginia and [[North Carolina]], and was considered the leading voice of religious dissenters in the region.<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> By appealing to British law and notions of British liberty, Davies agitated in an agreeable and effective manner for greater religious tolerance and laid the groundwork for the ultimate [[separation of church and state]] in Virginia that was consummated by the [[Statute for Religious Freedom]] in 1786.

=== Evangelism of slaves ===

Davies also spent his time in Virginia pioneering the literacy of the colony's slave population. Although he was not opposed to slavery, he felt that slaves were as equally deserving of direct access to the word of God as their masters.<ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> He made the slave population a particular focus of his ministry, and there were several reports at the time of Davies converting African slaves at unusually high numbers.<ref name="jstor">{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jeffrey H|title=Samuel Davies and the TransatlanticCampaign for Slaver Literacy in Virginia|journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|year=2003|volume=111|issue=4|publisher=Virginia Historical Society|location=Richmond|jstor=4250141}}</ref> Davies used the educational materials he received from his sponsors in Great Britain to provide instruction to slaves. He eventually converted hundreds of slaves to Christianity, and they joined other members of the congregation at the [[communion table]].<ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> Davies estimated that he ministered to over a thousand black people during his time in Virginia.<ref name="bookrags">{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Gale|title=Dictionary of Literary Biography|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Corporation|isbn=0787681733|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/samuel-davies-dlb/|accessdate=14 May 2012|chapter=Samuel Davies}}</ref>  A unique aspect of Davies' religious work among the slave population was his attempts at teaching them to read. Differing from Baptist and Methodist evangelists, who based conversion solely on an outpouring of the spirit, Davies believed that no one, regardless of race or social status, can have true religion without ''both'' hearing and reading the Word of God.<ref name="jstor" />

== President of Princeton ==

At the same time that Davies was starting his ministry in Virginia, six students began their studies in [[Elizabeth, N.J.]], at the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]], which had been established in 1746 to educate "those of every Religious Denomination." In 1753 the trustees of the college persuaded Davies, whose work in Virginia had been favorably noted, to go to [[Great Britain]] to raise money for the fledgling school. The journey was at times harrowing, but Davies confided to his diary that "To be instrumental of laying a foundation of extensive benefit to mankind, not only in the present but in future generations, is a most animating prospect." In the end, Davies and a fellow Presbyterian minister, [[Gilbert Tennent]], spent eleven months in Great Britain, with Davies preaching sixty times during their stay. Davies and Tennent were able to raise substantial support, mainly through church collections, enough to build Nassau Hall as the first permanent building on the new campus in Princeton. One significant donor was the grandson of [[Oliver Cromwell]], who gave three [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] to support their efforts.<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> Davies and Tennent eventually raised a total of four thousand pounds on behalf of the College of New Jersey.<ref name="tracts.ukgo">{{cite web|title=Rev. Samuel Davies|url=http://www.tracts.ukgo.com/samuel_davies.htm|work=Evangelical Tracts|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>

After his return from Great Britain, Davies' prominence in Virginia grew during the [[French and Indian War]] as he implored men to do their part "to secure the inestimable blessings of liberty." [[Robert Dinwiddie|Governor Dinwiddie]] declared Davies to be the best recruiter in the colony.

In 1759, four years after he had returned from his trip to Great Britain on behalf of the College of New Jersey, the trustees of the college called on Davies again <U+2013> this time to become the school's fourth president. Davies initially declined the position, thinking that one of the trustees, [[Samuel Finley]], was better qualified.<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> The [[board of trustees]] eventually persuaded Davies to take the job, and he succeeded [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], who died just six weeks after his inauguration. Unfortunately, Davies's term as president was also cut short when he died in 1761 at the age of 37. Finley succeeded Davies as the school's president<ref>{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|year=1978|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0691046549|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/finley_samuel.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|chapter=Finley, Samuel}}</ref>, and he was buried alongside his predecessor in [[Princeton Cemetery]].

=== Death and final sermon ===

Davies is well-known for preaching what turned out to be his own funeral sermon. The sermon, entitled "This Very Year You Shall Die!" was delivered at Princeton on [[New Year's Day]], 1761, with the reference text being [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah 28:16]]. In his sermon Davies states that "it is not only possible-but highly probable, that death may meet ''some'' of us within the compass of this year."<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Samuel|title=This Very Year You Are Going to Die!|year=1761|url=http://www.gracegems.org/Davies/this_very_yea_die.htm|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Almost prophetically, Davies died one month later from [[pneumonia]], on February 4th, 1761.<ref name="etcweb.princeton" />

== Legacy ==

=== Preacher and orator ===

Davies accomplished much despite his relatively short life, and lived the creed to which he exhorted the Princeton Class of 1760 in his baccalaureate address, which has been echoed by the presidents of Princeton throughout its history: "Whatever be your place, imbibe and cherish a public spirit. Serve your generation."<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> Samuel Davies was one of the major contributors to the [[Great Awakening]], a series of religious revivals which eventually caused America to break away from the [[Church of England]].<ref name="encyclopediavirginia" /> Davies' [[rhetoric]]al gifts were renowned, and among the many people influenced by him was the orator [[Patrick Henry]]. Henry was taken to listen to many of Davies' sermons as a young boy, often reciting portions of them aloud at his mother's request. He would later claim that Davies had the "most profound influence" on him, and considered him to be the greatest speaker he had ever heard.

Davies took his preaching very seriously, and believed that sermons should be delivered "with a grave and affectionate solemnity."<ref name="puritansermons" /> 
A contemporary and friend, minister David Bostwick said that Davies' sermons were "adapted to pierce the conscience and affect the heart," while [[William Buell Sprague]] noted that "he spoke with a glowing zeal...and an eloquence more impressive and effective than had then ever graced the American [[pulpit]]."<ref name="puritansermons" /> Davies' sermons went through several editions in the United States and England, and for fifty years after his death they were among the most widely read in the English language.<ref name="etcweb.princeton" /> The first five volumes of sermons were printed in [[London, England|London]] from 1767-71, and the best known American edition is three volume set, which appeared in [[New York City|New York]] in 1851.<ref name="tracts.ukgo" />

=== Songwriter and poet ===

Musicologists credit Davies with being the first American-born [[hymn]] writer.<ref name="bookrags" /> Davies followed the [[melody (music)|lines]] of [[Isaac Watts]], and while his verses are considered "solid, but somewhat dry and heavy,"<ref name="hymnary">{{cite web|title=Davies, Samuel, 1723-1761 > Texts|url=http://www.hymnary.org/person/Davies_S|work=Hymnary.org|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> several of his hymns maintained popularity in american [[hymnal]]s into the twentieth century. Two of his most popular hymns are "Eternal Spirit, Source of Light," and "Great God of wonders, all Thy ways."<ref name="hymnary" /> In 1752, Davies had a collection of his poems published in [[Williamsburg, VA|Williamsburg]], titled ''Miscellaneous Poems, Chiefly on Divine Subjects.''<ref name="bookrags" /> Davies' poems were written in the meditative style of [[Edward Taylor]], although his attempts at putting "sublime evangelical rhetoric into [[couplet]] form" produced writing that had a "cramped" style.<ref name="bookrags" />

=== Educator and evangelist ===

Even before becoming president of Princeton Davies proved to be highly beneficial to the university. In addition to raising money to build Nassau Hall, Davies received funding from Great Britain in order to build a house for the school's president, and a charitable fund to educate young people. Upon his selection as president one trustee wrote to another "I believe there was never a College happier in a president. You can hardly conceive what prodigious, uncommon gifts the God of Heaven had bestowed on that man."<ref name="princeton">{{cite web|title=Samuel Davies|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/davies/|work=The Presidents of Princeton University|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> While serving as the school's president, Davies drew up the first catalog of the university library, 1,281 books in all.<ref name="princeton" />


Davies' efforts to evangelize slaves in Virginia has come to be called "the first sustained proselytization of slaves" in that colony, earning him scholarly attention into the present day.<ref name="jstor" />
