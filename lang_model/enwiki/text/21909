'''Thomas Holm''' (born 19 February 1981) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[association football|football]] player who currently plays for [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]]. He have previously played for [[SC Heerenveen]], [[BV Veendam]], [[V<U+00E5>lerenga Fotball|V<U+00E5>lerenga]], [[Molde FK|Molde]] and [[Troms<U+00F8> IL|Troms<U+00F8>]]. He is the older half-brother of [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] player [[Daniel Fredheim Holm]].

Holm won [[Tippeligaen]] with V<U+00E5>lerenga in [[2005 Norwegian Premier League|2005]] and Molde in [[2011 Norwegian Premier League|2011]]. He has been capped four times playing for [[Norway national football team|Norway]].

==Club career==
Holm was born in [[Oslo]], and grew up in [[Trosterud]], and played for [[V<U+00E5>lerenga Fotball|V<U+00E5>lerenga]]'s youth team. He felt that V<U+00E5>lerenga did not give the youth a chance, and transfered to [[Eredivisie]] club [[SC Heerenveen]] during the summer of 1998. Holm performed well as right back and defensive midfielder under head coach [[Foppe de Haan]]'s command, and in 2000 he signed a four-year contract worth 10 Million [[Norwegian kroner]].<ref>VG 6. mars 2000: <U+00AB>Han ga blaffen i V<U+00E5>lerenga og ble utenlandsproff bare 17 <U+00E5>r gammel. N<U+00E5> har Thomas Holm skrevet kontrakt verdt 10 mill<U+00BB></ref>

In September 2002 Holm moved back to Norway and V<U+00E5>lerenga and accepted a lower salary, and justified the transfer with V<U+00E5>lerenga's ambitions and supporters.<ref name="alt"> Aftenposten Aften 3. september 2002: <U+00AB>- Kan tilf<U+00F8>re V<U+00E5>lerenga alt<U+00BB></ref> Head coach of V<U+00E5>lerenga, [[Kjetil Rekdal]] had big faith in Holm, and said that he was a talented player with a big future,<ref name="alt" /> and stated that Holm would be the perfect replacement for Rekdal in the midfield after his own retirement.<ref name="Rekdal-rollen">Aftenposten Aften 19. september 2002: <U+00AB>Holm tar gjerne Rekdal-rollen<U+00BB></ref> Holm won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|Norwegian Cup]] with V<U+00E5>lerenga in [[2002 Norwegian Football Cup|2002]].<ref name="vif">{{Kilde www |url=http://www.vif-fotball.no/article1452045.ece |tittel=Thomas Holm solgt til Molde |bes<U+00F8>ksdato=22. november 2007 |utgiver=V<U+00E5>lerenga Fotball | dato= 21. november 2007}}</ref>

Holm lost most of the [[2003 Norwegian Premier League|2003-season]] due to a calf-fracture, but in [[2004 Norwegian Premier League|2004]] he was back and was a contributing factor to V<U+00E5>lerenga's good season when they lost the league championship to [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] on goal difference.<ref name="perfekt">Aftenposten Aften 15. november 2004: <U+00AB>- Perfekt for landslaget<U+00BB></ref> The [[2005 Norwegian Premier League|next season]] V<U+00E5>lerenga and Holm won the league, one point ahead of [[IK Start|Start]]<ref name="vif"/>

Holm did not play much during the 2007-season, only six league-games and 14 games in total, and transfered to [[Molde FK|Molde]] after that season. In total he played 145 matches for V<U+00E5>lerenga, and scored three goals.<ref name="vif"/> He played 60 league-matches during his first three seasons in Molde,<ref name="nettavisen">{{cite web |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/tippeligaen/article3041140.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Kan v<U+00E6>re ferdig i Molde |work=nettavisen.no |publisher=[[Nettavisen]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> and in 2009 he won silver in both the league and the cup with Molde.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fredrikstadfk.no/content/view/4737/372/ |language=Norwegian |title=Thomas Holm: - Fortsatt sulten p<U+00E5> suksess. |work=fredrikstadfk.no |publisher=[[Fredrikstad FK]] |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, after the 2010-season, Molde tried to sell Holm to other clubs, without any success,<ref name="nettavisen"/> and Holm played under the command of the new manager [[Ole Gunnar Solskj<U+00E6>r]], until he in Augst 2011 was loaned out to [[Troms<U+00F8> IL|Troms<U+00F8>]] for the rest of the 2011-season.<ref name="til">{{cite web |url=http://til.no/Nyheter/Nyhetsarkiv/TIL-leier-Thomas-Holm-fra-Molde-FK-ut-aaret |title=TIL leier Thomas Holm fra Molde FK ut <U+00E5>ret |language=Norwegian |work=til.no |publisher=[[Troms<U+00F8> IL]] |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> In fact, Holm was both champion and runner-up of the [[2011 Norwegian Premier League|2011 Tippeligaen]], as Molde won the league while Troms<U+00F8> finished second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nordlys.no/sporten/til-magasinet/article5825195.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Dobbel glede for Holm |work=nordlys.no |publisher=[[Nordlys]] |date=28 November 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref>
