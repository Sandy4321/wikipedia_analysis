{{LaRouche movement}}

In the mid-1980s, as the culmination of a series of federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist [[Lyndon LaRouche]] and his associates, a number of criminal trials were held. There was a federal trial in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], another in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and several state trials.  While there were differences in the specific charges, the trials focused upon the allegation that LaRouche and his associates conspired to solicit loans from their supporters, on behalf of organizations they controlled, without intending to repay those loans.

LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges. They asserted that the federal government deliberately imposed an involuntary bankruptcy on the debtor entities.  They indicated that the bankruptcy caused them to be unable to repay the loans, which then paved the way for them to be prosecuted. They claimed that the trials were politically motivated.

The first federal trial, held in Boston, involved twelve defendants. A variety of delays, including searches of the files of then-Vice President [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Oliver North]] caused the trial to last for six months. The jurors hearing the case had been impaneled for eight months, and indicated to the judge that they were unwilling to continue for the three to six months of additional time that the judge estimated would be needed to complete the trial. The case ended in a mistrial. 

A second federal trial on separate charges took place in Alexandria later the same year. Unlike the Boston case, the judge tried the case quickly. LaRouche himself was convicted of [[mail fraud]] in the case ''United States of America v. Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. et al'', while others associated with the movement received convictions for mail fraud, [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and [[tax evasion]]. LaRouche received a prison term of fifteen years, which began in 1989. He was paroled in 1994 after serving five years. Five of his associates were found guilty in the Virginia federal court trial, and sentenced from three to five years. Thirteen associates were found guilty in separate state trials in Virginia and New York, resulting in terms from one month to thirteen years. The Virginia state trials later were described as the highest-profile cases that the Attorney General's office ever had handled.<ref>"James S. Gilmore III: Intense, All-Business Attorney General Already Has Stepped From Allen's Shadow;" Margaret Edds, Staff Writer. ''Virginian - Pilot''. Norfolk, Va.: Apr 2, 1995. pg. A.1</ref>   Fourteen states ultimately placed injunctions on LaRouche-related organizations. Following LaRouche's conviction, the movement mounted unsuccessful efforts to exonerate him.

==Background==
Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche formed a variety of political organizations, including the [[U.S. Labor Party]] and the National Democratic Policy Committee.<ref>{{citeweb|accessdate=2008-08-27|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou6.htm|title=LaRouche Convicted Of Mail Fraud|publisher=The Washington Post Online|date=December 17, 1988|author=Caryle Murphy}}</ref> These organizations served as the platforms for [[Lyndon LaRouche U.S. Presidential campaigns|presidential campaigns by LaRouche]] starting in 1976,<ref>{{citeweb|accessdate=2008-08-27|title=Group Makes Political Inroads|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou5.htm|publisher=The Washington Post Online|date=January 13, 1985|author=John Mintz}}</ref> and by his followers in scores of local races. Their greatest electoral success came in 1986 when two supporters, [[Janice Hart]] and Mark J. Fairchild, won the Democratic Party nominations for [[Illinois]] [[Secretary of State]] and [[Lieutenant Governor]].<ref>{{citeweb|accessdate=2008-08-27|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB153AF93AA15754C0A960948260 |title=AROUND THE NATION; LaRouche Backers Lose Illinois Court Round|publisher=The New York Times Online|date=July 29, 1986}}</ref> Both lost in the general election later the same year. Also in 1986, the "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" (PANIC) got an [[initiative]] on the California ballot, [[California Proposition 64 (1986)|Prop. 64]] also known as the "LaRouche Initiative", that attracted widespread opposition and was defeated in November. The ''Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987'' called the LaRouche movement one of the two most prominent "extremist political groups" of 1986.<ref>{{cite book |title=Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987 |last=Frankel |first=William  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=  Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|location= |isbn=9780838633229 |page= p.202|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=9IMiLBWqCsAC&pg=PA202}}</ref>

==Investigations==
===Early 1980s===
[[Image:Henry Kissinger.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Kissinger, in 1976]]
According to arguments made by LaRouche's attorneys in later appeals, the government investigations were started in the 1960s under the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] program (''see [[LaRouche conspiracy trials#Appeals|appeals]]''). Edward Spannaus, a defendant in the trials, further notes that there was a memorandum written on January 12, 1983, by former [[FBI]] chief [[William Hedgcock Webster|William Webster]] to Oliver "Buck" Revell, head of the Bureau's General Investigative Division. It requested information on the funding of LaRouche and the [[U.S. Labor Party]], including whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. The LaRouche organization asserts that this formulation was specifically tailored to enable FBI "active measures" against LaRouche under [[Executive Order 12333]], which permits such measures if a political movement receives foreign funding.<ref>[http://www.larouchepub.com/exon/exon_add1_train.html Have The Mass Media Brainwashed Your Neighbor About Lyndon LaRouche?] ''EIR'' website, undated</ref> The memo was eventually obtained by LaRouche's attorneys and submitted as an exhibit in the Boston trial.

In August 1982, former [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] sent a memo to Webster requesting an investigation of the LaRouche movement due to their "increasingly obnoxious" harassment of him,<ref>"Larouche Lawyers Introduce Three Kissinger-F.B.I. Letters", AP, ''New York Times'' Mar 18, 1988  Sec: B  National Desk  p: 5</ref> which was raised at a meeting that day of the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]] by senior member [[David Abshire]].<ref>''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989., p. 306: ''"At the PFIAB meeting today, David Abshire raised the subject of the activities of the U.S. Labor Party and Lyndon LaRoche [sic]... A number of the members present, including Edward Bennett Williams, raised the question of the sources of funding for these U.S. Labor Party activities. In view of the large amounts obviously being expended worldwide, the question was raised whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. Can you give me an update together with any comments or observations on this matter?''</ref><ref>"Richard Mellon Scaife: Who Is He Really?",Edward Spannaus, ''The Executive Intelligence Review'' a series printed beginning March 21, 1997.[http://american_almanac.tripod.com/scaife.htm]</ref> Revell replied to Kissinger that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation.<ref>"Larouche Lawyers Introduce Three Kissinger-F.B.I. Letters", AP, ''New York Times'' Mar 18, 1988  Sec: B  National Desk  p: 5</ref>  The FBI conducted an investigation that ultimately could not find any evidence of a violation of Kissinger's civil rights. The investigation was closed in late 1983.<ref>"Kissinger asked FBI to look at LaRouche", [[Jack Anderson]], published in ''The Frederick Post'', March 29, 1985</ref>

===Mid-1980s===
[[Image:Portrait webster HSAC.jpg|thumb|William Webster, FBI Director]]
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government and eleven states began investigations into alleged financial improprieties by LaRouche groups. A federal [[grand jury]] reportedly began investigating "an extensive nationwide pattern of credit card fraud" by LaRouche organizations in November 1984.<ref>"LaRouche Groups' Debt to U.S. Grows Daily", by Joel Brinkley, ''[[New York Times]]'', May 19, 1986</ref> That same year a New Jersey bank froze the accounts of LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign due to allegedly fraudulent credit-card charges.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD8163EF93AA15753C1A960948260 "Abrams Files Larouche Lawsuit"] October 29, 1986, ''New York Times''</ref>

In January 1985 the grand jury subpoenaed documents from the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), and three other LaRouche organizations: Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. Seven weeks later, on March 29, 1985, a court held them to be in contempt and fined them $45,000 per day. The fines for all the organizations eventually totaled over $20&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD133FF936A35750C0A961948260 LaRouche Groups to Appeal] AP, March 5, 1987</ref> The same grand jury questioned Elliot I.

Boston, Mass.: Oct 25, 1985. pg. 72</ref>

Investigations by a separate federal grand jury in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] along with state agencies in New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois, and Washington were also underway.<ref>"16 LaRouhe Aides Indicted for Fraud" February 18, 1987, ''New York Times''</ref> The FBI, IRS, FEC<ref>"Gifts to LaRouche are probed: San Diego widow loaned $34,300 to L.A. group"; William Osborne.

The [[Internal Revenue Service]] revoked the tax exempt status of the Fusion Energy Foundation in September 1985, and a year later the State of New York sought to dissolve the corporation, alleging that it used "persistently fraudulent and illegal" means to solicit donations.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> [[William Weld]], the future Massachusetts governor who at the time was the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, announced in January of 1986 that he would convene a national conference "to coordinate a prosecutive and investigative effort" against LaRouche. The conference was held the following month in Boston.<ref>''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989., p. 236. From "Proposed Finding of Facts," motion to court by defense attorneys: ''65. A conference of law enforcement officials was held in Boston on February 12-14, 1986, under the general guidance of Mr. Weld. The topics included both criminal and civil strategies for dealing with LaRouche. 69. During the course of the year (1986) Mr. Weld contacted approximately half a dozen U.S. Attorneys to encourage them to pursue potential criminal claims against LaRouche.''(The intervening numbers simply list participants with some comments about what role they played at the conference.)</ref> Three states, Alaska, Indiana, and Maryland, banned fundraising by Caucus Distributors Inc. in May 1986, due to the sale of unregistered promissory notes.<ref>{{cite web

==Raid and indictments==
Beginning October 6, 1986, the  [[Leesburg, Virginia]] headquarters of the LaRouche organization were searched in a coordinated, two-day raid by hundreds of officers of the FBI, [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], other federal agencies, and Virginia state authorities, supported by armored cars and a helicopter. The agents also surrounded the heavily guarded<ref>"Jury finds LaRouche guilty in conspiracy and mail fraud plot", ''Houston Chronicle'', December 17, 1988</ref>  estate, where LaRouche was living, for the duration of the search, but did not enter it.<ref>{{cite web

Warren J. Hamerman, Chair of the NDPC, said the searches "conducted by [[Donald Regan]]'s associate William Weld's forces against presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche's headquarters coincides with Don Regan's desperate attempts to maintain the cover-up on [[AIDS]]."<ref>"10 Larouche Associates Face Fraud Counts; Offices Raided", Christine Reid,''Richmond Times - Dispatch'', October 7, 1986</ref> LaRouche later said that the Soviet premiere had ordered the raid as part of an assassination attempt. "The man with the [[mark of the beast]] on his head, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachov]] (sic), has demanded my elimination," said LaRouche.<ref>"Authorities See Pattern of Threats, Plots Dark Side of LaRouche Empire Surfaces", Kevin Roderick. ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 1986</ref> In his 1987 autobiography, he wrote that the raid was ordered by [[Raisa Gorbachev]], whom he described as outranking her husband in the [[nomenklatura]] due to her leadership of the Soviet Cultural Fund.<ref>''The Power of Reason: 1988'', an autobiography by Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., 1987, Executive Intelligence Review, Designed by World Composition Services, ISBN 0-943235-00-6, p. 309</ref> 

On the same day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count indictment that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1&nbsp;million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The [[National Caucus of Labor Committees]] was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, "we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts...just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal."<ref>"U.S. Charges Aides to Larouche With Credit-Card Fraud Scheme", October 7, 1986, ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year,<ref>"Prosecutor Links Fraud To Larouche", ''New York Times'', December 18, 1987</ref> and investigators were allegedly given false information.

==Involuntary bankruptcy==
In early April 1987, the government charged in court that LaRouche organizations may have been trying to sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4&nbsp;million in contempt of court fines.<ref>"3 Firms Linked to LaRouche Seized for Fines", Robert L. Jackson, ''Los Angeles Times'', April 22, 1987</ref> The U.S. Department of Justice filed an [[involuntary bankruptcy]] petition on April 20, 1987 for the purpose of collecting the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial.<ref>"U.S. Agents Take Over 3 LaRouche Companies;" ''Los Angeles Times''  Los Angeles, Calif.: Apr 21, 1987. pg. 1</ref> Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a "pattern of transferring or commingling substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes".<ref>"Legality Of Move By U.S. Is Argued", Bill McKelway, ''Richmond Times - Dispatch'', May 5, 1988</ref>  The trustees later reported they were only able to locate about $86,000 in assets.<ref>"Legality Of Move By U.S. Is Argued", Bill McKelway, ''Richmond Times - Dispatch'', May 5, 1988</ref>

The bankruptcy halted the publication of a weekly newspaper, ''New Solidarity'', and a bi-monthly science magazine, ''Fusion''. At least one publication, ''[[21st Century Science and Technology|Fusion]]'', was reborn with a new name but the same editor and material.<ref>[http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/8192/ The Scientist 1988, 2(2):1]</ref>

The attorneys who represented the LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and that members of the Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.<ref>"Proposed Findings of Fact in cases 87-0795-A,87-0796-A,87-0797-A", published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.<BR>''Fact #9: On or about June 22, 1987, the Alleged Debtors filed their answers to the involuntary petitions. In their answers: a) Caucus and Fusion denied that they were eligible to be debtors because of their eleemosynary status; b) all denied that they were not paying their debts as they became due; c) all asserted affirmatively that the petitions were defective because there were an insufficient number of petitioning creditors; d) all asserted affirmatively that the petitions arose out of a motive to assist the U.S. Government in its related criminal proceedings and thus were tainted with bad faith; and e) all asserted affirmatively that the petitions constituted prior restraints on the exercise of their right to freedom of speech in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.''</ref>

During the bankruptcy trial in September 1989, an FBI agent destroyed evidence (credit card receipts, cancelled checks, and FEC filings) immediately after he had promised the court he would preserve them.<ref>"LaRouche Documents Destroyed", Associated Press, September 9, 1989</ref> On October 25, 1989, Judge Martin V.B. Bostetter dismissed the government's involuntary bankruptcy petition, finding that two of entities involved were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore not subject to involuntary bankruptcy actions.<ref>Howe, Robert, "Ruling May Help Appeal, LaRouche Backers Say," ''Washington Post'', October 28, 1989[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1219810.html]</ref> Bostetter said the government's actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome. He found that the government's actions and representations in obtaining the bankruptcy had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization, leading to a "constructive fraud on the court."<ref>{{cite web

The LaRouche organization asserts that it has proof, obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], which shows that the purpose of the bankruptcy was simply to shut down the affected entities rather than to collect fines.<ref>The FOIA search turned up a memo by James Reynolds of General Litigation and Legal Advice Section of the Department of Justice, in which he writes, "Benefit is that a trustee is immediately appointed. They are ordered to shut down the business immediately." [http://www.schillerinstitute.org/exon/lar_bad_guy.html "He's a Bad Guy, But We Can't Say Why!"] Schiller Institute website</ref> The U.S. Attorney said, "Essentially the court holds that we did not abuse the bankruptcy filing, just that we should have filed differently". He also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected.<ref>"Ruling May Help Appeal, LaRouche Backers Say", ''Washington Post'', October 28, 1989</ref>

==Alexandria trial==
[[Image:Old Alexandria District Federal Courthouse.jpg|thumb|U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. It is now the Martin VB Bostetter Courthouse, handling bankruptcy cases.]]
On October 14, 1988, LaRouche and six associates were indicted in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] before Judge [[Albert V. Bryan]], in whose district LaRouche resides.<ref>"Clark Joins Motion Seeking Bond For Larouche Appeal" Frank Green. ''Richmond Times - Dispatch''. Richmond, Va.: Apr 7, 1989. pg.

</ref> The indictments included various [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges, including conspiracy to commit [[mail fraud]]. LaRouche was also charged with conspiring to hide his personal income since 1979, the last year he had filed a federal tax return.

===Preliminary motions===

Judge Bryan granted a prosecution motion ''[[in limine]]'', ruling that the defense would not be permitted to discuss, or even allude to, the fact that the indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy. It also excluded certain other avenues that the prosecution had reason to expect that the defense would pursue, such as claims of vindictive prosecution and a history of political harassment by the government.<ref>Government's Motion In Limine, United States of America v. Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. et al, Criminal No. 88-00243-A, published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.
<br>''The defendants have indicated that they intend to defend this case by claiming vindictive prosecution, harassment by the government, and that their inability to repay loans was due to "financial warfare" brought against them by the government. ...There are several incidents into which it appears the defense intends to delve: prior FBI investigations; asserted infiltrations of the LaRouche organization by informants; other criminal and civil proceedings; and the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings in this District. It is the position of the government that these incidents essentially are irrelevant.''</ref>

LaRouche's attorneys claimed on appeal that this prevented them from presenting their defense, that being that the LaRouche organization no longer controlled the indebted entities, and that the decision not to repay debts was made by government trustees. The court rejected the appeal.<ref>{{cite web

A defense motion to conduct ''[[Venire#United_States|voir dire in jury selection]]'' in the second trial was denied.<ref>Motion of the defendants for submission of questions to the jury venire, Criminal No. 88-00243-A, published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.<br>''1. This is a case which has resulted in considerable publicity at both the local and national level... 2. The case involves defendants who have very strenuously expressed minority political opinion and the chance of prejudicial jurors as a result of these political briefs is substantial... According, the defendants move this court to allow them to file specific questions for the jury venire by Friday, November 18, 1988.''</ref>  An ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief, one of many filed on appeal, charged that, unlike Judge Keeton who devoted three weeks to jury selection, Alexandria Judge Bryan spent two hours and did not permit individual questioning of prospective jurors. The brief asserts that this contributed to the result that most jurors in the Alexandria trial were present or former government employees. Jury foreman Buster Horton was the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] liaison to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).<ref>''Brief Amici Curiae of Burton D. Linne, Jack O. Slater, and John C. Imlay IV'', published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.<br>''And finally, permeating the proceedings was the District Court's own peculiar reluctance to credit appellants' concerns that their prosecution was politically motivated{{ndash}} and, therefore, to take the necessary prophylactic steps at the stage of jury-selection to exclude improper political intervention or influence. All of these circumstances made it impossible for appellants' trial defense-team to discover enough about Horton to protest his seating on the jury.

===Trial===
The prosecution presented evidence that LaRouche and his staff solicited loans with false assurances to potential lenders and showed "reckless disregard for the truth".<ref>"1988 LaRouche Trial Hears Closing Arguments;" Caryle Murphy. ''Washington Post''. Washington, D.C.: Dec 15, 1988. pg. a.46</ref> Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson presented evidence that LaRouche's organization had solicited US$34&nbsp;million in loans since 1983. In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, and to a lesser extent, what they did with that money when they got it... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true."<ref>From court transcript, ''United States of America v. Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. et al'', published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.</ref>

The most important evidence was the testimony of lenders,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> many of them elderly retirees, who had  loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the "war on drugs" but only received $10,000 in repayment.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> One of the prosecutors, John Markham, said those loans represented "just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing". Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4&nbsp;million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5&nbsp;million had been repaid out of $30&nbsp;million in non-campaign loans.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000, but according to testimony at trial the amount owed by 1987 topped $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=autogenerated1>LaRouche Convicted Of Mail Fraud, By Caryle Murphy, Washington Post Staff Writer, Saturday, December 17, 1988; Page A01 [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou6.htm]</ref>

===Income tax===

One of the charges against LaRouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax, not having filed a return in ten years.<ref>"Conservative Oilman Pays Rent For Larouche Estate", Associated Press. May 3, 1986</ref> LaRouche claimed to have had no income. LaRouche lived on a 172-acre (700,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) estate in [[Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia]], with a pond and horse ring. It was purchased for his use by Oklahoma oilman David Nick Anderson for $1.3&nbsp;million, with LaRouche organizations paying rent to cover the $9,605 mortgage.<ref>"Conservative Oilman Pays Rent For Larouche Estate", Associated Press.

===State trials===
The Attorney General of Virginia, [[Mary Sue Terry]], prosecuted eight LaRouche associates on securities fraud charges relating to $30&nbsp;million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials were held in the larger city of [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, it was necessary to get a decision by the [[State Corporation Commission]] (SCC) that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the companies argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations-Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.-to stop their sale.<ref>"SCC ENJOINS LAROUCHE GROUPS" Bill McKelway. ''Richmond Times - Dispatch''. Richmond, Va.: Mar 5, 1987. pg.

According to the Barbara Boyd, a LaRouche associate, "At the center of the Virginia prosecutions was the novel allegation by prosecutors, that political loans advanced for political programs and campaigns, were investment securities, subject to the securities registration and securities fraud provisions of state law. No court had ever declared this prior to the Virginia prosecutions."<ref>Boyd, Barbara, [http://members.tripod.com/~american_almanac/boyd.htm "The Human Rights Issues in the Virginia LaRouche Cases,"] ''American Almanac'', August 10, 1998</ref> Boyd asserts that the SCC initially refused to issue a ruling that political loans were investment securities, and only later cooperated. The commissioner who gave the ruling, [[Elizabeth Lacy]], was shortly thereafter nominated as Virginia's first woman Supreme Court Justice, and then refused to recuse herself from the case that had resulted from her decision.<ref>Boyd, Barbara, [http://members.tripod.com/~american_almanac/boyd.htm "The Human Rights Issues in the Virginia LaRouche Cases,"] ''American Almanac'', August 10, 1998</ref>

[[Image:Reflections of an American Political Prisoner.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Billington considered himself a political prisoner.]]
Michael Billington was charged in a Roanoke court with having solicited 131 loans totaling $1.24&nbsp;million from 85 people even when he knew that the loans would not be repaid.<ref>"Jury Convicts Top Larouche Fund-Raiser Of Securities Fraud", Associated Press, October 25, 1989</ref> Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he served in the federal case.<ref>"Convicted LaRouche aide won't renounce his leader" Thomas J.

Virginia's court system has the juries determine prison terms though judges may override them. The jury in his case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90), and the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse,) and because he had warned that he would accept the recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved, "willful and massive fraud that has caused a lot of people to suffer".<ref>"LaRouche Fund-Raiser Convicted", ''Richmond Times - Dispatch'', October 25, 1989</ref>

==Appeals==
[[Image:Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|Several decisions were appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].]]
Beginning as early as 1986, LaRouche-related lawyers made numerous appeals of court decisions. The contempt of court fines from the Boston grand jury were appealed. On July 3, 1986, the [[First Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the fines.<ref>"Fines For Larouche Groups Upheld", William F. Doherty, ''Boston Globe'', July 3, 1986</ref> It was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, who let the decision stand.<ref>"Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Agree To Hear Plea On Miranda", Linda Greenhouse, ''[[New York Times]]'', October 17, 1989</ref>

When the Boston case ended in mistrial, LaRouche lawyers appealed the decision to retry the case. In their appeal, heard October 5, 1988, they argued that a retrial would violate [[double jeopardy]].<ref>"New LaRouche trial would violate defendants' rights, lawyer argues", ''Providence Journal'', October 6, 1988</ref> Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, cancelling the retrial.<ref>"No Larouche Trial, Rules Federal Judge", ''Boston Globe'', March 3, 1989</ref> The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche. "My imprisonment is the American Dreyfus case", LaRouche said in a January 1989 interview from prison. The prosecutor denied claims of a conspiracy, describing the theory as an "Orwellian fantasy ... that we are hiding some supersecret spy plot which, if exposed, would exonerate them."<ref>"Larouche Mounts Last-Ditch Bid For Hub Retrial", Elizabeth Neuffer, ''Boston Globe'', March 22, 1989</ref>

A 1989 appeal filed by the LaRouche defendants argued that, due to the motion ''in limine'' granted by Judge Bryan in the Virginia case, the jury never heard the two central features of LaRouche's actual defense: first, the long history of "adversive government actions" against the LaRouche organization, and second, that the government, through the involuntary bankruptcy and related actions, had "intentionally... subverted their ability to raise funds and pay their debts."<ref>Brief for the appellants, No. 89-5518, May 25, 1989, published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.</ref> In the pro-defense book ''Railroad!'' the authors write "...the judge invaded the province of the jury, preventing the jurors from hearing the facts which would enable them to competently determine the question of criminal intention."<ref>Edward Spannaus, ''Railroad!'', Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, Washington, D.C., 1989, OCLC 23870104, p. 9</ref>

LaRouche's attorneys claimed the investigations of LaRouche and his organization began in the 1960s as part of [[COINTELPRO]], and "culminated in an intense 5-year program by what may be characterized as a national multi-agency 'Get LaRouche' task force."<ref>Appeal, ''United States of America vs. Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. et al No. 89-5518'', published in ''Railroad!'', Edward Spannaus, Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, 1989.</ref> According to the appeal, the task force included both Criminal and Tax divisions of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], The U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria, the [[FBI]], the [[U.S. Secret Service]], [[IRS]], [[U.S. Postal Service]], [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], Virginia Attorney General's office, [[Virginia State Corporation Commission]], and the [[Loudon County]] Sheriff's office. LaRouche's attorneys claimed on appeal that the lower court's decision on their ''in limine'' prevented them from presenting their defense, that being that the LaRouche organization no longer controlled the indebted entities, and that the decision not to repay debts was made by government trustees. This appeal was rejected.<ref>{{cite web

Numerous ''[[amicus curiae]]'' ("friend of the court") briefs were filed on appeal. One by Albert Bleckmann, director of the Institute for Public Law and Political Sciences at the [[University of Muenster]], raised further objections to the lack of ''voir dire'', the exclusion of evidence under the motion ''in limine'', the fact that the government did not approach LaRouche about his tax situation before indicting him for tax violations, and concerns about [[double jeopardy]] because of the nearly identical charges in the Boston and Alexandria trials.<ref>''United States of America vs. Lyndon H.

On July 3, 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected without comment an appeal by LaRouche and his six co-defendants that claimed the Alexandria court had tried to silence them.<ref>"Supreme Court to Weigh First `Right-to-Die' Case", ''Newsday'', July 4, 1989</ref>

A three-judge panel of [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] unanimously confirmed the Alexandria convictions on January 23, 1990,<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30615FE34540C708EDDA80894D8494D81 "Appeals Court Upholds Convictions of LaRouche and Four Others"], January 23, 1990, ''New York Times''</ref> They found that the defense had not asked for a continuance in a timely manner, had not indicated that significant flaws in the case were due to lack of time, and had not pressed jurors about their knowledge of LaRouche.<ref>"Appeals Court Upholds LaRouche Conviction on Mail Fraud, Conspiracy", Robert F.

==Claims of LaRouche supporters==
The convictions of LaRouche and his associates were a defining moment in the history of the LaRouche network. LaRouche supporters and others, including hundreds of elected officials from the U.S. and other countries, insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs (see [[#Attempts at exoneration|attempts at exoneration]].)
LaRouche also alleged systematic government misconduct:
<blockquote>The record shows, that for nearly thirty years, elements of the U.S. Department of Justice have been engaged in world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.<ref>"U.S.A. VS. LYNDON LAROUCHE, 'He's a Bad Guy, But We Can't Say Why'" by Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., February 15, 2000 [http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2000/lar_bad_guy_2710.html]</ref></blockquote>
LaRouche and his lawyers asserted that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] sought to destroy his organization, and that the prosecution was the result of a conspiracy between the ADL, the government, and the media.<ref>"Lyndon LaRouche Leaves Prison to Testify for Fund-Raiser", ''[[Washington Post]]'', Alison Howard, May 24, 1990</ref><ref>"Judge Rejects LaRouche Allegation", ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 30, 1990</ref> This claim stems from a series of meetings that LaRouche publications refer to as the "[[John Train]] Salon."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040207101155/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exon3.htm The John Train 'Salon' - The Evidence of Criminal Fraud Filed with the Fourth Circuit Court], ''LaRouche in 2004'' website</ref>

In testimony to submitted to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated [[Schiller Institute]] claimed that "[t]he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [sic] was the consequence of an unprecedented involuntary bankruptcy proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an ''ex parte'', ''in camera'' proceeding."<ref>[http://american_almanac.tripod.com/dojtest.htm Testimony Of The Schiller Institute Submitted To The Committee On The Judiciary, United States Senate], published in ''Executive Intelligence Review'', July 31, 1998</ref>

[[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]], a professor of [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[international law]] at the [[University of Mainz]] in Germany, compared the LaRouche trial to the [[Dreyfus affair]], which he called "a classical example of a political trial". He wrote, "Just as LaRouche was, the French Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was deprived by the structure of the trial procedures, of any opportunity to prove his innocence, and facts critical for his defense were excluded from the trial."<ref>This paragraph is excerpted from a longer essay by von der Heydte, which appeared as a full page ad, sponsored by the LaRouche-affiliated Commission to investigate Human Rights Violations, in the ''[[Washington Times]]'' on March 1, 1990, in the ''Loudoun Times-Mirror'' of Loudon County, Virginia on March 2, and as a half-page ad in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' on March 3. It was subsequently re-printed in ''Railroad!'', Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations, Leesburg, VA 1989</ref>

===Attempts at exoneration===
[[Image:Ramsey Clark in Nandigram cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramsey Clark]] in 2007]]
On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d'Almeida Ribeiro, the [[Special Rapporteur]] for the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], filed a request to the U.S. Government based on a complaint that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under the laws of the United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/Symbol/E.CN.4.1993.62.En?Opendocument "Implementation Of The Declaration On The Elimination Of All Forms Of Intolerance And Of Discrimination Based On Religion Or Belief"], United Nations Commission on Human Rights website, January 6, 1993</ref>

One of LaRouche's appeals attorneys was former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]]. In a 1995 letter to then-Attorney General [[Janet Reno]], he said that the case involved "a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge." He asserted that, "The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts."<ref>Clark, Ramsey. [http://web.archive.org/web/20061221170153/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/clarkletter.htm] "Open Letter to Janet Reno," posted on LaRouche presidential campaign website, 2004.</ref>

The LaRouche organization organized several panels of sympathetic legal experts, elected officials and journalists from other countries, to have them review the case and issue their findings. These included the Curtis Clark Commission,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20031219040856/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonappendix1.htm "Selected Key Findings Of Evidence Reviewed,"] ''LaRouche in 2004'' website</ref> and the [[Schiller Institute#Mann-Chestnut hearings|Mann-Chestnut hearings]].<ref> [http://www.larouchepub.com/pr/1997/schiller_pr_04-21-97.html Statement of Mann-Chestnut Commission], Schiller Institute press release, May 21, 1997</ref>

On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the ''New Federalist'', a LaRouche publication, as well as the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Roll Call]]''. Entitled "Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration" its signatories included [[Arturo Frondizi]], former [[President of Argentina]]; figures from the 1960s [[American Civil Rights Movement]] such as [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], [[James Bevel]], and [[Rosa Parks]]; former [[Minnesota]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] and Democratic Presidential Candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]]; [[Mervyn M. Dymally]], who chaired the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]; and artists such as classical vocalist [[William Warfield]], and violinist [[Norbert Brainin]], former 1st Violin of the [[Amadeus Quartet]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040228111029/http://larouchein2004.net/exoneration/exonstatement.htm "Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration"]</ref><!--LaRouche's Schiller Institute paid for the advertisement. Amelia Boynton Robinson was at that time a board member of the Institute. James Bevel and William Warfield had been active in various LaRouche organizations.-->
