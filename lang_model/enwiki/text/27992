The '''sand diver''', '''''Synodus intermedius''''', is a species of fish in the [[lizardfish]] family, [[Synodontidae]], a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basa]]l [[ray-finned fish]] in the class [[Actinopterygii]]. The etymology of ''Synodus'' is of Greek origin: "syn", [[symphysis]] or grown together, and "odous" which means teeth.  Sand divers inhabit [[subtropical]] [[marine ecosystems]], (37<U+00B0>N-17<U+00B0>N), including sandy bottom areas on [[continental shelves]], [[coral reefs]], [[estuaries]], bays, and reef structures.  They are [[demersal]] or [[benthic fish]], which means they live on or close to the sea bed.  Distribution ranges from the northern Gulf of Mexico south to the [[Guianas]], and western Atlantic north to North Carolina and Bermuda.  They are a common lizardfish in the [[West Indies]].  They grow to approximately {{convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} total length, and weigh around {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}}.  

The trunk of sand divers is a [[pallid]] color, ranging from gray to brownish gray with mottling on the head and trunk grading to a whitish underbelly.  They have variable markings, including a black patch on the shoulder girdle, reddish brown vertical bars across the back, and thin yellow-gold striped lateral lines running from behind the gill flap or [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]] to the base of the tail or [[caudal fin]].  They are able to alter their color, becoming paler or darker to blend with the background.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[File:S. intermedius clade.png|thumb|right|220px|Genetically distinct lineages of Synodontidae in the western Atlantic]]
Lizardfishes are [[Aulopiformes|aulopiforms]] in the order [[Synodontidae]] which is represented in the western Atlantic by 3 [[genera]]: ''[[Synodus]]'', comprising 6 species, ''[[Saurida]]'', comprising 4 species, and ''[[Trachinocephalus]]'' which includes a single species.  <ref name="FrableBaldwin2013">{{cite journal|last1=Frable|first1=Benjamin W.|last2=Baldwin|first2=Carole C.|last3=Luther|first3=Brendan M.|last4=Weigt|first4=Lee A.|title=A new species of western Atlantic lizardfish (Teleostei: Synodontidae: Synodus) and resurrection of Synodus bondi Fowler, 1939, as a valid species from the Caribbean with redescriptions of S. bondi, S. foetens (Linnaeus, 1766), and S. intermedius (Agassiz, 1829)|journal=Fishery Bulletin|volume=111|issue=2|year=2013|pages=122<U+2013>146|issn=00900656|doi=10.7755/FB.111.2.2}}</ref> 

The [[fossil record]] indicates an [[evolutionary divergence]] of [[Aulopidae]] dating back to the [[Early Cretaceous]] or [[Late Jurassic]], with most extant families appearing by the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Eocene]].  Aulopoids are a small group of benthic fishes that inhabit coral reefs and continental shelves, including lizardfishes (''Synodus'', ''Saurida'') and flagfin fishes (''Aulopus'').  Integrated studies regarding deep-sea evolutionary adaptations, simultaneous [[hermaphroditism]], and tubular eyes suggest that the stem species of [[lizardfish|lizardfishes]] arose in a marine environment with separate sexes, and round eyes that were laterally directed.  The study also identified the suborder Alepisauroidei as the largest and oldest known vertebrae clade with the reproductive strategy of simultaneous hermaphroditism.<ref name="DavisFielitz2010">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew P.|last2=Fielitz|first2=Christopher|title=Estimating divergence times of lizardfishes and their allies (Euteleostei: Aulopiformes) and the timing of deep-sea adaptations|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=57|issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=1194<U+2013>1208 |issn=10557903 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.09.003}}</ref>      

==Description==
[[File:Synodus_intermedius-lizardfish_IMG_4817.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Synodus intermedius'' has a wide mouth with numerous needlelike teeth]]
Sand divers have an elongated body and can grow to a length of up to {{convert|46|cm|abbr=on}}. The dorsal (upper) surface is dappled brownish-gray and there is a black patch on the shoulder girdle at the upper end of the gill slits. There are about eight pairs of reddish-brown bars on the top and sides of the body, broadest at the [[lateral line]] and narrowing towards the belly. There are also slender yellowish-gold longitudinal lines running along the body. The ventral (under) surface of the fish is pale.<ref name=MSIP>{{cite web |url=http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=caribbean_diving_guide&id=201 |title=Sand diver (''Synodus intermedius'') |author=M. De Kluijver; G. Gijswijt; R. de Leon; I. da Cunda |work=Interactive Guide to Caribbean Diving |publisher=Marine Species Identification Portal |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> The tip of the lower jaw is rounded, without a fleshy knob, and the soft rays of the dorsal fin are relatively short, the tip of the front one lying on top of the origin of the hind one when depressed. These characteristics helps to distinguish this species from the [[offshore lizardfish]] (''Synodus poeyi'').<ref name=Gibbs>{{cite journal |author=Gibbs, Robert H. Jr. |year=1959 |title=A synopsis of the postlarvae of Western Atlantic lizard-fishes (Synodontidae) |journal=Copeia |volume=3 |pages=232<U+2013>236 |doi=10.2307/1440395 |jstor=1440395 }}</ref> The anal fin of the sand diver has ten to twelve soft rays which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar [[diamond lizardfish]] (''Synodus synodus'') which has eight to ten. Another fish with which it might be confused is the [[Atlantic lizardfish]] (''Synodus saurus''), but that species is uncommon in the Caribbean and has slender blue or turquoise longitudinal lines.<ref name=MSIP/>

As is common among benthic and demersal fish, the [[cornea]] of the eye has an iridescent layer, the function of which may be to offer protection to the eye from very bright light.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lythgoe, J. N. |year=1975 |title=The structure and phylogeny of iridescent corneas in fishes |journal=NATO Advanced Study Institutes Series |volume=1 |pages=253<U+2013>262 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0241-5_24 }}</ref> The mouth is wide and filled with numerous needlelike teeth.  There are two rows of teeth in the upper jaw; the inner row teeth are longer than the outer row.  There are three rows of teeth on the lower jaw; the outer row are covered by lips, the middle teeth increase in size.  Both jaws have posterior teeth that slant slightly toward the back.  There are also 3 to 4 rows of depressible teeth on the palate.  The tongue has 5 rows of teeth, the largest positioned closest to the anterior tip, slanting toward the back.<ref name="FrableBaldwin2013"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Sand diver (Synodus intermedius).jpg|thumb|200px|left|At Bari Reef in the Caribbean]]  
Sand divers are found in the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean between 37<U+00B0>N and 17<U+00B0>N, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Their range extends from North Carolina and Bermuda, southwards to [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in Brazil, and includes the West Indies, Caribbean Sea and northern, eastern and southern Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=WoRMS/><ref name=FishBase>{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Synodus-intermedius.html |title= ''Synodus intermedius''  (Spix & Agassiz, 1829): Sand diver |author=Froese, Rainer |year=2012 |work=FishBase |publisher= |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref> They have been reported from [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]] in the eastern Atlantic, though that record is questionable, and are also known from the Philippines.<ref name=FishBase/>Sand divers are usually found on or near the seabed in sandy areas among boulders or in sandy corridors in reefs, but they will also rest on the tops of reef structures, propping themselves up on their pectoral fins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phleger, C.

==Ecology==
[[File:Synodus intermedius-lizardfish profile IMG 4812.jpg|thumb|200px|''Synodus intermedius'' on Bari Reef, [[Bonaire]]]]
Sand divers are piscivorous ambush predators once thought to occupy a [[Trophic pyramid|mid-trophic]] position as a lie in wait ambush predator.  Research has since discovered they occupy a high trophic position as active hunters that feed on other predatory fishes.  In some systems they are considered [[apex predator]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cruz-Escalona, V. H.; Peterson, M. S.; Campos-Davilla, L.; Zetina-Regon, M. |year=2005 |title=Feeding habits and trophic morphology of inshore lizardfish (''Synodus foetens'') on the central continental shelf off Veracruz, Gulf of Mexico |journal=Journal of Applied Icthyology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=525<U+2013>530 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0426.2005.00651.x}}</ref>   They can be found on top of the sand or on reef tops, and also bury themselves in the sand with only their head exposed. Sand divers feed on a variety of reef fishes such as [[Bar jack|bar jacks]], [[blue chromis]], [[wrasse]]s, [[fairy basslet]]s, [[grunts]], and [[yellowhead jawfish]].
