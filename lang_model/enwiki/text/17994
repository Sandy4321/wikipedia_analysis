'''Fort Saint Joseph''' was a [[fort]] established on land granted to the [[Jesuit]]s by [[King Louis XIV]]; it was located on what is now the south side of the present-day town of [[Niles, Michigan]]. P<U+00E8>re [[Claude-Jean Allouez]] established the ''Mission de Saint-Joseph'' in the 1680s.  Allouez ministered to the local Native Americans.  

The French built the fort in 1691 mainly as a trading post on the lower [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].  It was located where one branch of the [[Old Sauk Trail]], a major east-west [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trail, and the north-south Grand River Trail meet; together the combined trail [[ford (crossing)|ford]]s the river. The fort was a significant stronghold of the [[fur trade]] at the southern end of [[Lake Michigan]].  Prior to the French and Indian War (also known as the [[Seven Years War]]), the post had a French garrison of 10 soldiers, a commandant, blacksmith, Catholic priest, interpreter, and 15 additional households.<ref>Nassaney, 28</ref> 

With their victory in the war, the British took over the fort and maintained it for the fur trade. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], they used it to supply their American Indian allies against the rebellious Continentals. The Spanish raided the fort in 1781 and briefly claimed it and the St. Joseph River as their territory.  The British maintained the fort until after the United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian War]] and the signing of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795. After the British abandoned the fort, it fell into ruin and was overtaken by forest. The fort site was not rediscovered until 1998. An archeology excavation has been underway since 2002.  Among the rare artifacts discovered is an intact Jesuit religious [[medallion]] from the 1730s, one of only two found in North America.  In December 2010, the team revealed a foundation wall and corner posts of one of the original buildings. 

The site is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is a state-registered site as well.

==French and Indian War==
During the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]], considered the first battle of the [[French and Indian War]] in North America, [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]] was killed. He was the son of Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers and the half-brother of Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers, who was stationed at Fort St. Joseph.  Louis Coulon de Villiers vowed revenge for his brother's death.

After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] victory in the French and Indian War, France turned the fort over to the British, who occupied it in October 1761. On May 25, 1763, during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]], the fort was captured by [[Potawatomi]] warriors. They killed most of the British 15-man garrison outright, and took the commander, Ensign Francis Schlosser, captive. They took him to [[Detroit]] to be ransomed as a prisoner, as was common for higher-ranking men.<ref name="Myers">{{cite web |url=http://www.nwta.com/couriers/3-96/StJo.html |last=Myers |first=Robert C |title=Historic Sites: Fort St. Joseph |publisher=Northwest Territory Alliance |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> After Pontiac's Rebellion, the British no longer used the fort as a military outpost, but continued to maintain it as an important trading post.

==American Revolution==
===Raid of 1780===
During the war, the British used Fort St. Joseph to equip the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], Potawatomi, and other American Indians who were their allies in the war against the rebellious Continentals. In 1780 Americans from [[Cahokia, Illinois]], led by [[Jean-Baptiste Hamelin]] and Lt. Thomas Brady, raided the fort.  The British Lt. Dagreaux Du Quindre led forces after the raiding party; he overtook and defeated them near [[Petit fort|Petit Fort]] (in present-day [[Indiana]]).

===Spanish Expedition of 1781===
After the defeat of Hamelin's party, two [[Milwaukee]] chiefs, ''El Heturn<U+00F2>'' and ''Naquiguen'', traveled to [[Spain|Spanish]]-held [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]; they arrived on 26 December  1780, to report the failed raid.  They asked for assistance to raid the fort again.  Don Francisco Cruzat, Commandant of St. Louis, dispatched the militia Captain Don Eugenio Pour<U+00E9> with 60 volunteers and Native allies.  The force also included Ensign Charles Tayon and the interpreter Louis Chevalier.  

The Spanish and Native force travelled via the [[Illinois River]] and [[Kankakee River]] to modern [[Dunns Bridge, Indiana]], where it turned Northeast and marched towards Fort St. Joseph.<ref name=Collins>{{cite web |first=William |last=Collins |title=The Spanish Attack On Fort St. Joseph |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gero/papers/1983-1984/sec4.htm |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref>  Before the Spanish and their allies attacked the fort, they promised the Potawatomi half the bounty if they would remain neutral.<ref>Skaggs, 214</ref>  Captain Pour<U+00E9> took Fort St. Joseph by surprise on 12 February 1781 by racing across the ice and taking the fort before the defenders could take up arms.<ref name=Collins />  He had the Spanish colors raised and claimed Fort St. Joseph and the St. Joseph River for Spain.  His troops plundered the fort for one day, distributing the goods among natives before departing.  Lt. Dagneau de Quindre arrived the next day, but was unable to persuade his native allies to pursue the raiders as they had done the previous year.<ref name=Collins />  The Spanish arrived at St. Louis on 6 March without incident.<ref name=Collins /> Pour<U+00E9> delivered the British flag to Cruzat.<ref>Skaggs, 208</ref>

Some historians have described the attack as Spanish retaliation for the British [[Battle of Saint Louis|attack on St. Louis]] in the previous year.<ref name=Collins />  When Cruzat wrote about it to [[Bernardo de G<U+00E1>lvez y Madrid, Count of G<U+00E1>lvez|Governor G<U+00E1>lvez]], he justified the raid as needing to appear strong to his Native allies, and to forestall British actions in the region.<ref>Skaggs, 219</ref>  Although Cruzat treated the raid as an act of Indian affairs, the looting and destruction of goods held at Fort St. Joseph also dissuaded a second British attack into Spanish territory.<ref>Par<U+00E9>, pg 47-48</ref>

==Jay's Treaty==
The British finally abandoned the fort after the United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian War]] and the signing of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795. The fort gradually fell into ruin and was overgrown. Based on its Fort St. Joseph expedition, Spain claimed lands east of the [[Mississippi River]], but this was not recognized by the United States.  With the signing of [[Pinckney's Treaty]] (1795) with the US, Spain gave up any claim of land east of the Mississippi.<ref name=Skaggs209>Skaggs, 209</ref>  Because of the long dispute over the land, the diplomats [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Jay]] considered the Spanish Fort St. Joseph campaign to have been little more than a ploy to claim the [[Northwest Territory]]. Franklin warned they want to "shut us up within the Appalachian Mountains."<ref name=Skaggs209 />

==Rediscovery to present==
Pothunters in the late 1800s recovered hundreds of artifacts from the fort site, which are now displayed in the Fort Joseph Museum in Niles. They include "trade silver, musket parts, glass beads, buttons, gunflints, knife blades, and door hinges."<ref name="Myers"/>  The specific location of the 15-acre fort site was forgotten, and part of is likely underwater since a dam upriver raised the water level.<ref name="Myers"/>   

The site was not rediscovered until an archeological survey in 1998.<ref name="Mumford">[http://www.miarch.org/fort/tribune.html Lou Mumford, "Fort St. Joseph believed located"], ''South Bend Tribune,'' November 6, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.miarch.org/fort/transcript.html  "Transcript of press conference given by Dr. Michael Nassaney"], November 5, 1998, Michigan Archaeological Society website</ref> Support the Fort, a local interest group founded in 1992, helped sponsor a major archeological excavation on site, which began in 2002. 

The team from [[Western Michigan University]] (WMU) has conducted a public archeology program as the project has developed, with a total of 10,000 visitors coming to the annual two-day field school. WMU's related activities have included workshops for graduate students and volunteers, three week-long training programs for middle school and high school teachers, and community outreach, including biweekly lectures at the library.<ref name="Find"/> The seasonal excavations have uncovered rare artifacts, such as a 1730s Jesuit religious medallion, one of only two found in North America.<ref>[http://www.supportthefort.net/ Dr. Michael S.

Support the Fort has arranged related annual living history exhibits and re-enactments, featuring elements of Potowatomi, French, British and American life at the fort and in the region.  In the future, they intend to construct a replica of the fort, with space to interpret the artifacts found through controlled excavation.  This was the only fort in Michigan to be controlled by four different nations: France, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States.<ref name="Mumford"/>  It was always a multicultural site, a meeting and trading place for the ethnic Europeans with the [[Potowatomi]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Ojibwe]] American Indian nations, and sometimes an occasion for marriage of their members.<ref>Nassaney, 29</ref>
