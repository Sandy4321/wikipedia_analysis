'''Hartford''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Connecticut]]. It is located in [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]] on the [[Connecticut River]], north of the center of the state, {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Its 2006 population was 124,512.<ref name=popest2/> Hartford ranks as the state's third-largest city,<ref>In US Census population estimates between 2000 and 2008, New Haven and Hartford's populations were estimated to have been within 511 of each other. In the American Community Survey 2008, New Haven was significantly larger (124,000 in New Haven versus 118,000 in Hartford). Since such differences are still potentially within the margin of error in these estimates, which is "officially" larger will not be known until the 2010 Census. As of October 2009, the Census population estimate page listed New Haven as having a larger population than Hartford in the 2000 (most recent) Decennial Census.</ref> after [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the south and the sixth largest in [[New England]].<ref name=popest2/> [[Greater Hartford]] is also the largest metro area in Connecticut, and 45th largest in the country (2006 [[census]] estimate) with a metropolitan population of 1,188,841.

Nicknamed the "Insurance Capital of the World", Hartford houses many of the world's insurance company headquarters, and insurance remains the region's major industry.<ref>[http://www.hartford.gov/history/ City of Hartford History] (The State of Connecticut is sometimes known as "the land of steady habits.")[http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm Connecticut Nicknames, Connecticut State Library]</ref> Almost 400 years old, Hartford is among the oldest cities in the United States, and following the [[American Civil War]], Hartford took the mantle of the country's wealthiest city from [[New Orleans]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E0D8103CF935A1575BC0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=] (In the time following the Civil War, Hartford was the nations wealthiest city) from the New York Times, 2002.</ref> In 1868, Mark Twain wrote, "Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief."<ref>[http://www.twainquotes.com/18680906.html Letter from Mark Twain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Hartford is home to the nation's oldest public art museum ([[Wadsworth Atheneum]]), the oldest public park ([[Bushnell Park]]), the oldest continuously published newspaper (''[[The Hartford Courant]]''), the second-oldest secondary school ([[Hartford Public High School|Hartford Public]]), and until its closure in 2009, the sixth-oldest opera company in the nation ([[Connecticut Opera]]).

In 2004, the Hartford metropolitan area ranked second nationally based on per capita economic activity, behind only [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Hartford is ranked 32nd of 318 metropolitan areas in total economic production and generates more economic activity than sixteen U.S. states.<ref>http://www.hartford.gov/news/ECONOMIC%20ACTIVITY%20REPORT.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.usmayors.org/metroeconomies/0107/GMPreport.pdf U.S. Metro Economies: GMP &#173; The Engines of America's Growth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==

:''This is a summary. For more information, see: [[History of Hartford, Connecticut]]''

After Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]] visited the area in 1614, fur traders from the [[New Netherland]] colony set up trade at [[Fort Goede Hoop]] (''Good Hope'') at the confluence of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] and [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park Rivers]]<ref name="Bushnell Park">http://www.bushnellpark.org/parkriver.html</ref> as early as 1623, but abandoned their post by 1654. Today, the neighborhood near the site is still known as Dutch Point. The first [[England|English]] settlers arrived in 1635 and their settlement was originally called Newtown, but was renamed Hartford in 1637. The name "Hartford" was chosen to honor the English town of [[Hertford, England|Hertford]], home of [[Samuel Stone]], one of the settlers.

[[File:OldHartfordMap.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1877 Map of Hartford]]

The leader of Hartford's  [[Founders of Hartford, Connecticut|original settlers]] from what is now [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], Pastor [[Thomas Hooker]], delivered a sermon which inspired the writing of the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], a document (ratified January 14, 1639) investing ''the people'' with the authority to govern, rather than ceding such authority to a higher power. Hooker's conception of self-rule embodied in the Fundamental Orders went on to inspire the [[Connecticut Constitution]], and ultimately the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Today, one of the Connecticut's nicknames is the 'Constitution State'.<ref>http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/voigt/050905</ref><ref>''Leassons from Thomas Hooker about the frailty of humanity and the importance of a worldview'' by Steven Voigt, September 5, 2005</ref>

On December 15, 1814, delegations from throughout New England gathered at the [[Hartford Convention]] to discuss possible [[secession]] from the United States. Later in the century, Hartford was a center of [[abolitionist]] activity. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], daughter of Lyman Beecher and author of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', lived in Nook Farm, part of the Asylum Hill section of the city.

On the week of 12 April 1909 the [[Connecticut River]] reached a then-record flood stage of 24<U+00BD> feet above the low water mark flooding the city and doing great damage.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Record-Breaking Flood at Hartford, Conn.|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=h-ADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=%22popular+mechanics%22+1907&lr=&as_brr=1#PPA516,M1|work= |publisher= [[Popular Mechanics]]|date= June 1909|accessdate=4 February 2009 }}</ref>

On July 6, 1944, the [[Hartford Circus Fire]] destroyed the big top at the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]], the deadliest circus fire in the history of the United States.  On November 3, 1981, Thirman L. Milner became the first black mayor elected in New England.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In 1987, Carrie Saxon Perry was elected mayor of Hartford, the first female African-American mayor of a major American city.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Starting in the late 1950s the suburbs of Hartford grew while the capital city began a long decline. This decline may have been accelerated by construction of highways (including [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] & [[I-91]] which intersect in downtown Hartford).  Many residents moved out of the city and into the suburbs, and this trend continues. During the 1980s, Hartford experienced an economic boom of sorts and by the late 1980s, almost a dozen new skyscrapers were proposed to be built in the city's downtown. For various reasons, including the economic recession that followed in the early 1990s, many of these buildings were never built. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, many workers in Hartford lived more than twenty-minutes drive from the city<U+2014>though according to the Census Bureau, the city's average commute time of 22 minutes is a full three minutes less than the U.S. average.<ref>http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=35200US734500937000&-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_DP3&-context=adp&-ds_name=&-tree_id=307&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-format=</ref> In the past few years, development, both commercial and residential, has increased downtown.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

[[File:StateHouseSqHartford.jpg|thumb|200px|right|State House Square in Downtown Hartford]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|17.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2|1}} of it (3.67%) is water.

Hartford is bordered by the towns of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]],
[[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]], [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]], [[Bloomfield, Connecticut|Bloomfield]], [[South Windsor, Connecticut|South Windsor]], and [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]].

The [[Connecticut River]] forms the boundary between Hartford and East Hartford.

The [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] originally divided Hartford into northern and southern sections and was a major part of [[Bushnell Park]] but the river was nearly completely enclosed and buried by flood control projects in the 1940s.<ref name="Bushnell Park" /> The former course of the river can still be seen in some of the roadways that were built in its place, such as Jewell St. and the [[Conlin-Whitehead Highway]].<ref>[http://www.past-inc.org/historic-bridges/stone-mainst.html Main Street Bridge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Hartford lies in the [[Humid continental climate]] zone ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen]] ''Dfa''). Summers are typically hot and muggy by New England standards, while winters are typically cold with frequent snowfall.  The average annual precipitation is approximately {{convert|46.2|in|cm|0}},<ref name = NCDC /> which is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Hartford typically receives about {{convert|45|in|cm|0}} of snow in an average winter;<ref name = NCDC /> the record seasonal snowfall was {{convert|115.2|in|cm|0}} during the winter of 1995<U+2013>1996.<ref>[www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9602/tr9602.pdf The Winter of 95-96:  A Season of Extremes, National Climatic Data Center]</ref>  The first snowfall typically occurs in mid to late November and the last snow of the season usually occurs in late March, although accumulating snow has occurred as early as late September and as late as mid-May in extreme events.  During the summer, temperatures often exceed {{convert|90|F|0}}, and do so on an average of 18 days per year.<ref name = NCDC />  Conversely, winter temperatures dip to {{convert|0|F|0}} on 5 nights per year.<ref name = NCDC /> Thunderstorms are common during the summer months since the frontal boundary that separates the tropical air mass from colder air to the north moves back and forth over the city.  While these thunderstorms may be severe with damaging winds and hail, tornadoes are rare.  Tropical storms and hurricanes have also struck Hartford, although the occurrence of such systems is rare and is usually confined to the remnants of such storms.

==Economy==
[[File:Travelers Tower, Hartford, CT - view 1.JPG|175px|thumb|Travelers Tower in Downtown Hartford.]]
Hartford is the historic international center of the [[insurance]] industry, with companies such as [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]], [[Aetna]], [[The Hartford]], [[The Phoenix Companies]], Inc. and [[Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company|Hartford Steam Boiler]] based in the city.  The area is also home to [[Colt Firearms]], [[U.S. Fire Arms Mfg. Co.|U.S. Fire Arms]] and [[United Technologies]].

Nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Hartford was a major manufacturing and publishing city. Among these was the pioneer bicycle (and later) [[automobile]] maker [[Pope Manufacturing Company|Pope]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877<U+2013>1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.37.</ref> As in many northern industrial cities, many factories have been closed, relocated, or reduced operations.

Despite the city's lengthy history with the insurance industry, various insurers have recently left Hartford and moved their operations to other locations, including to some of Hartford's suburbs.  Citing the tax structure in the city and parking shortages, [[MetLife]] recently vacated several floors in CityPlace, Connecticut's largest office building, and joined [[CIGNA]] in a large suburban campus in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]].  [[Lincoln Financial]] has recently cut its Hartford workforce, while [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] elected to construct a sprawling training complex in [[Windsor, Connecticut]], just north of the city.  Additionally, [[MassMutual]] recently relocated its Hartford operations to [[Enfield, Connecticut]], to be closer to its headquarters in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and the insurance giant [[The Hartford]] has relocated some of its employees to nearby [[Simsbury, Connecticut]].

At the same time, many companies have moved to or expanded in the central business district and surrounding neighborhoods. [[Aetna]] announced mid-decade that by 2010 it would move nearly 3,500 employees from its [[Middletown, Connecticut]] offices to its corporate headquarters in the Asylum Hill section of the city. Travelers recently expanded its operations at several downtown locations. In 2008, [[Sovereign Bank]] consolidated two bank branches as well as its regional headquarters in a nineteenth century palazzo on Asylum Street. In 2009, [[Northeast Utilities]], a Fortune 500 company and New England's largest energy utility, announced it would establish its corporate headquarters downtown. In the same year, work began at the southeastern corner of Constitution Plaza on the AI Technology Center, the future headquarters of the eponymous engineering firm. AI's chief executive helped finance the building, the first commercially leasable structure in Connecticut to be certified at the platinum level under the US Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) program. Other recent entrants into the downtown market include GlobeOp Financial Services and specialty insurance broker S.H. Smith.

Following the housing market decline, Hartford renters are finding cheap and declining rent averages in relation to national trends. <U+201C>Declining rents are affecting not only Hartford but also other markets in Connecticut and across the country as employers remain restrained about hiring. Connecticut's unemployment now stands at 9.1 percent, below the nation's 9.7 percent.<U+201D> <ref name=name>{{Cite web|url= http://articles.courant.com/2010-04-09/business/hc-apartment-rents-connecticut.artapr09_1_average-rent-rent-increases-apartment-hunters|title=Courant.com: Apartment rents keep dropping in Hartford|accessdate = 27 October 2010 }}</ref>

Hartford was  home to the [[NHL]]'s [[Hartford Whalers]] from 1979 to 1997, before the team relocated to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and became the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].

The [[Boston Celtics]] played various home games per year in Hartford from 1975<U+2013>1995.

The [[University of Connecticut]] men's and women's basketball team - the [[UConn Huskies]] - also play a number of their home games at the [[XL Center]] downtown. Other home games are played at [[Gampel Pavilion]] located on the university's campus in [[Storrs, CT|Storrs]].

Hartford also used to have a [[National League]] [[baseball team]], the [[Hartford Dark Blues]],  back in the 1870s, and a [[NFL]] team, the [[Hartford Blues]], for one season in 1926.

==New development==
[[File:P-KK08-000-011.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Connecticut Convention Center]]
Billed as "New England's Rising Star",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hartford.com/ |title=Hartford- New England's Rising Star- Home page |accessdate=2007-06-08 |publisher=Hartford Image Project}}</ref> Hartford has generated renewed interest with both local and national developers who are investing heavily in the city through a variety of projects. Investments include commercial and residential projects such as the new 36-story Hartford 21 apartment tower, the new river front Connecticut Science Center, an extensive system of riverfront trails and parks, neighborhood improvements to Park Street and Parkville, renovation of the historic Colt building in line with National Park standards, and significant development in the central business district of condominiums and retail space.

In 1997, the city lost its professional hockey franchise, the [[Hartford Whalers]], but efforts are being made to bring an [[NHL]] team back to the city. City officials and developers are talking about the possibility of a new city arena to house this team.

Currently there are more than 1 billion dollars' worth of private and publicly funded projects happening throughout the city's 17 neighborhoods. The overlying theme for development is to create more activity downtown and attract more residents to the city's different neighborhoods.

Some of the major projects include:
'''Adriaen's Landing:''' The state- and privately-funded project is situated on the banks of the [[Connecticut River]] along Columbus Boulevard, and connects to Constitution Plaza. Constitution Plaza forced hundreds of households to relocate when it was built a few decades ago. The latest project includes the {{convert|540000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} Connecticut Convention Center, which opened in June 2005 and is the largest meeting space between [[New York City]] and [[Boston]].  Attached to the Convention Center is the 22-story, 409 room [[Marriott International|Marriott]] Hartford Hotel-Downtown which opened in August 2005. Being constructed next to the convention center and hotel is the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} Connecticut Science Center.
The final component of the project, 'Front Street', sits across from the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and the Hartford Times Building. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded parts of the project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project - the first developer was removed from the project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential component of Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an [[ESPN Zone]] to the Front Street ([[ESPN]] is headquartered in nearby [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]).<ref>http://www.frontstreetdistrict.com/index.html</ref> On the back side of Front Street, the historic [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Hartford Times Building is being converted for administrative offices for the [[Wadsworth Athenaeum]]. In 2004, Underground Coalition, a Connecticut hip hop promotion company, produced The First Annual Hartford Hip Hop festival, which also took place at Adriaen's Landing. The event drew over 5,000 fans.

[[File:Connecticut Culinary Institute, 2009-09-02.jpg|thumb|160px|upright|Connecticut Culinary Institute]]

'''Hartford 21:''' Recently completed on the site of the former [[Hartford Civic Center]] Mall (now known as the [[XL Center]]), the project includes a 36 story residential tower<U+2014>the tallest residential tower between [[New York City]] and [[Boston]]. Attached to the tower is {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|-3}} of office space and {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|-2}} of retail space, all contained within a connected complex. The Greater Hartford [[YMCA]] has opened in the complex and will soon be closing its Jewell Street site which will be knocked down for another project. The [[XL Center]] Arena remains open and hosts the AHL [[Connecticut Whale]] and the [[University of Connecticut|UConn]] men's and women's basketball teams, as well as shows and concerts.

'''[[Capital Community College]] at the 11-story G. Fox Department Store Building:''' The {{convert|913000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} former home of the [[G. Fox & Co.|G. Fox & Company Department Store]] on Main Street has been renovated and made the new home of Capital Community College as well as offices for the State of Connecticut and ground level retail space. Capital Community College helps train (mostly) adult students in specific career fields. On Thursdays, vendors sell crafts on the Main Street level. Two music clubs, Mezzanine and Room 960, are housed in the building.

'''Connecticut Culinary Institute''': The school recently relocated its main campus to the former Hastings Hotel and Conference Center, which is next to [[Aetna]] headquarters in the city's Asylum Hill neighborhood just west of downtown. The school also has a branch campus in [[Suffield, Connecticut]]. The Hastings Hotel and Conference Center, which closed abruptly in 2004, was the hotel where former President [[Bill Clinton]] stayed when he was in the city.

[[File:RentschlerFieldAtNight.JPG<U+200E>|thumb|right|160px|Rentschler Field]]

'''[[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]]:''' In neighboring [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]], the stadium for UConn football was part of the revitalization plan for Hartford and was built on some of the lands donated by [[United Technologies]]. The bulk of the land donated will be used for technology, entertainment, lodging and retail development. A high-tech research park is also currently being planned for the site.

'''Transportation and parking changes:''' The New Britain-Hartford Busway is in the works. Local activists are pushing for more bike lanes, as well as for these lanes to be respected by motorists and kept clear of debris.  The local bicycle advocacy organization formed in 2005, [http://www.wecyclect.org/ Central Connecticut Bicycle Alliance], has been making surprising inroads in Hartford and the surrounding suburbs.

Some roads were turned into pedestrian walkways to reduce gridlock, while other roads were widened or made one-way. Some intersections were also improved to better handle traffic. A large parking garage was built downtown to ease parking problems. A series of shuttle routes was created, known as the "Star Shuttle" and now run by the [http://www.hartfordtransit.org/ Greater Hartford Transit District].

'''New condos and apartments:'''
* '''Hartford 21:''' Opened adjacent to the [[XL Center]] in September 2006, this sleek 36-story apartment tower is the tallest in New England, and is located at the intersection of Trumbull Street and Asylum Street.  The building includes 232 luxury one-bedroom and two-bedroom units (including four penthouses), an adjacent parking garage and spacious common areas.
* '''Trumbull on the Park:''' Recently opened along Bushnell Park, this apartment community is housed in a new 11-story brick building along with a parking garage and ground-level retail space. Additional units are housed in recently renovated historic buildings on nearby Lewis Street.
* '''55 on the Park:''' Formerly a [[Southern New England Telephone|SNET]] office building, it has been turned into luxury apartments that sit along Bushnell Park. The building reopened a few years ago and was among the first new residences to open downtown in years.
* '''Sage Allen Building:''' On Main Street, the former Sage Allen department store building has been turned into 44 4-bedroom townhouses as well as an upscale apartment building comprising about 70 units that opened in January 2007. The project also includes the renovation of the Richardson Food Court and the reopening of Temple Street, which once again reconnects Main and Market Streets. Many of the townhouses will be occupied by [[University of Hartford]] students. It sits directly across Market Street from the [[University of Connecticut]] Graduate Business Learning Center.
* '''The Metropolitan:''' The former Hartford Electric Light Company Building on Pearl Street is being converted into luxury condominiums.
* '''American Airlines Building:''' Located at 915 Main Street across from Capital Community College and the [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], the site was formerly home to an [[E. J. Korvette]] department store and later American Airlines. The building has been converted into apartments with renovated ground-level retail space.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
[[File:Florida 148.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Bradley International Airport]]
[[Bradley International Airport]], in [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], is twenty minutes north of downtown and serves Hartford and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] with over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine [[airline]]s.  Other airports serving the Hartford area include:<ref>http://www.bradleyairport.com/Flights/destinations.aspx</ref>
* [[Hartford-Brainard Airport]], located in Hartford off [[Interstate 91|I-91]] and close to Wethersfield, serves charter flights and local flights.
* [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]], located in New Haven, Connecticut, is served by [[US Airways Express]].

===Buses===
Hartford city buses run at regular intervals throughout the city, and less frequent service to the suburbs. A free circulator bus, known as the "Star Shuttle," operates around downtown.  Interstate bus service is provided by Bonanza Bus, [[Greyhound Bus]] and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]]. [[Chinatown bus lines]] provides low-cost bus service between Hartford and their New York and Boston hubs. Additionally, there are buses for connections to smaller cities in the state. The bus station is located on the ground floor of the transport center at One Union Place in Downtown Hartford.

A proposed [[bus rapid transit]] line between Hartford and New Britain, the [[New Britain<U+2013>Hartford Busway]], is being considered as a way to reduce traffic congestion on I-84.<ref>http://www.gobrt.org/HartfordNewBritainFEISExecutiveSummary.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.newbritainherald.com/articles/2010/07/02/news/doc4c2ea0c0a3970050173464.txt</ref>

===Highways===
[[File:Bulkeley Bridge, Hartford.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Bulkeley Bridge]] over Connecticut River in Hartford]]During the 1960s and 1970s, Hartford was a [[poster child]] for highway construction, and several highways surround the downtown area. [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]], which runs from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], to its intersection with [[Interstate 90 in Massachusetts|I-90]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], just over the Massachusetts border, and [[Interstate 91|I-91]], which runs from [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] along the [[Connecticut River]] to [[Canada]], intersect in downtown Hartford.  In addition to [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] and [[I-91]], two other highways service the city: [[Route 2 (Connecticut)|Route 2]], an expressway that runs from downtown Hartford to [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]], passing through [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and past [[Foxwoods Resort Casino]]; and the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]] portion of [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|Route 15]] that skirts the southeastern part of the city near Brainard Airport.  A short connector known as the [[Conlin-Whitehead Highway]] also provides direct access from I-91 to the Capitol Area of downtown Hartford.

Hartford experiences heavy traffic as a result of its substantial suburban population (about 10 times that of the actual city), which is proportionally much larger than that of any other nearby city. As a result, thousands of people travel on area highways at the start and end of each workday. I-84 experiences traffic from [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] through Hartford and into [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] and [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]] during the [[rush hour]].

[[File:Charter Oak Bridge.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Charter Oak Bridge]] over Connecticut River in Hartford]]Several major surface arteries also run through the city. Albany Avenue ([[U.S. Route 44|Route 44]]) runs westward through the northern part of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] to the hills of northern [[Litchfield County]] and into [[New York]], and eastward towards [[Putnam, Connecticut|Putnam]] and into [[Rhode Island]]. Main Street ([[Route 159 (Connecticut)|Route 159]]) heads north through [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] towards the western suburbs of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Wethersfield Avenue ([[Route 99 (Connecticut)|Route 99]]) heads south through [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] towards [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]. Farmington Avenue heads west through West Hartford Center and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] towards [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]].

===Bicycle===
A bicycle route runs through the center of Hartford. This route is a small piece of the large eastern bicycle route - the [[East Coast Greenway]] (ECG). The {{convert|3000|mi|km|adj=on}} ECG runs from [[Calais, Maine]] to the [[Florida Keys]]. The route is intended to be off road, but some sections are currently on-road. The section through Hartford is right through the middle of Bushnell Park.

There are designated bicycle lanes on several roads including Capitol Avenue, Zion Street, Scarborough Lane, Whitney, and South Whitney.

===Railroad===
{{See also|Union Station (Hartford)}}
[[File:HartfordUnionStation.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Hartford's [[Union Station (Hartford)|Union Station]]]]
The dependence on railroads has decreased since the construction of [[Interstate 91]] and [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] through the city center. However, Hartford's Union Station at One Union Place still operates a significant schedule. [[Amtrak]] provides service from Hartford to [[Vermont]] via [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and southward to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with connections to [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[Washington DC]]. The station also serves numerous bus companies because of Hartford's mid-way location on the New York to Boston route.

Currently, there are preliminary plans to create a [[New Haven-Hartford-Springfield Commuter Rail Line]] with stations in communities close to [[Interstate 91|I-91]]. It would use rail currently used by [[Amtrak]], which in turn was formerly part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] system.

===Public transport===
[[Connecticut Transit]] is owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]]. CTTRANSIT operates local and commuter bus service within the city and the surrounding area. Taxi service is available from the train station at 1 Union Place or by calling one to any location in the area. There is a free downtown shuttle, and city buses are equipped with bike racks.
