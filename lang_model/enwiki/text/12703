==Television stations==
There are six English-language stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg that supply free programming to the city. Most homes subscribe to cable through [[Shaw Communications]], or digital television through [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]] digital. There are also two satellite services available through [[StarChoice]] and [[Bell ExpressVu]]. Some homes use [[grey market]] satellite dishes to bring in signals from American satellite services.

Additionally, American network affiliates broadcasting from North Dakota are available over-the-air in many parts of Winnipeg and Southern Manitoba.  Until the mid-1980s, [[KXJB]] and [[KVLY]] (then known as [[KTHI]]) were available on Winnipeg's cable service. These channels were replaced by [[WDIV]] and [[WJBK]] from Detroit, later [[WTOL]] from Toledo, and then by [[WCCO]] and [[KARE]] from Minneapolis. [[WDAZ-TV]] and [[Prairie Public Television|KGFE]], both from [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks, ND]] are still available on Winnipeg cable systems. [[WUHF]], the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-affiliate from [[Rochester, New York]], has been available on cable since December 1994, despite a nearby Fox station, [[KNRR]], in [[Pembina, North Dakota]] that can be viewed over-the-air in Winnipeg. 

<!-- Note: It is legitimate and fine to list American stations available in the Winnipeg market in the above paragraph. However, the table below this comment is *only* to list television stations originating *in* Winnipeg. -->
