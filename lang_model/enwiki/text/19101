'''''Only Fools and Horses''''' was a British television sitcom, created and written by [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]], and made and broadcast by the BBC. Seven series were originally broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1991, with sporadic [[Christmas special]]s until 2003. Episodes are regularly repeated on [[GOLD (TV channel)|GOLD]].

Set in [[Peckham]] in south London, it stars [[David Jason]] as ambitious market trader [[Del Boy|Derek "Del Boy" Trotter]], [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]] as his younger brother [[Rodney Trotter|Rodney]], and [[Lennard Pearce]] as their aging [[Grandad (Only Fools and Horses)|grandfather]] (later replaced by [[Buster Merryfield]] as their [[Uncle Albert]]). Backed by a strong supporting cast, the series chronicles their highs and lows in life, in particular their attempts to get rich.

After a relatively slow start the show went on to achieve consistently high ratings, and the 1996 episode "[[Time On Our Hands]]" (at the time intended as the [[last episode]]) holds the record for the [[List of most-watched television episodes#United Kingdom|highest UK audience for a sitcom episode]], attracting 24.3&nbsp;million viewers (over a third of the population).<ref name="most watched">{{cite news |

 accessdate = 2006-09-13}}</ref> A spin-off series, ''[[The Green Green Grass]]'', which shows the lives of [[Boycie]] and Marlene in a new house in Shropshire, has run for four series on BBC One in the UK. A prequel, ''[[Rock & Chips]]'', aired on 24 January 2010.
There have been campaigns to get another series made for the shows 30th anniversary in 2011 but is highly unlikely due to the actors commitments and the filming of the prequal [[Rock & Chips]].

==Scenario==
[[Del Boy|Derek "Del Boy" Trotter]] (played by [[David Jason]]), a fast-talking, archetypal [[cockney]] market trader, lives in a [[council flat]] in a high-rise tower block, Nelson Mandela House, in [[Peckham]], [[South London]] <U+2013> though it was actually filmed in Harlech Tower in [[Acton, London|Acton]] and later [[Bristol]] <U+2013> with his much younger brother, [[Rodney Trotter]] ([[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]), and their elderly [[Grandad (Only Fools and Horses)|Grandad]] ([[Lennard Pearce]]). Their mother Joan died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded shortly after his wife's death, effectively making Del Rodney's surrogate father and the family [[patriarch]]. Despite the difference in their ages, the brothers share a constant bond throughout.

The situation focuses primarily on their futile attempts to get rich <U+2013> "This time next year, we'll be millionaires" is a frequent saying of Del's <U+2013> through buying and selling a variety of low-quality and illegal goods, such as [[Russian Army]] camcorders, luminous yellow paint and [[sex doll]]s filled with an explosive gas. They own an unregistered company, ''Trotters Independent Traders'', trade primarily on the [[black market]] and generally neither pay taxes nor claim money from the state; as Del says, "The government don't give us nothing, so we don't give the government nothing". Most of their deals are too dodgy to succeed and usually end up backfiring, an important factor in generating sympathy for the characters. They also drive a grubby three-wheeled van, and are regulars at their local [[Public house|pub]], ''The Nag's Head''. In interview in a documentary about the show, Sullivan said he saw Del as someone who would sell you anything in order to make money, which is why the dining table changed so often.

Initially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the show's only regulars, along with the occasional appearances of dopey roadsweeper [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]] ([[Roger Lloyd Pack]]) and pretentious used car salesman [[Boycie]] ([[John Challis]]). Over time, the cast expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the ''Nag's Head''. These included pub landlord Mike ([[Kenneth MacDonald (English actor)|Kenneth MacDonald]]), lorry driver [[Denzil Tulser|Denzil]] ([[Paul Barber (actor)|Paul Barber]]), youthful [[spiv]] Mickey Pearce ([[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]]) and Boycie's flirtatious wife Marlene ([[Sue Holderness]]). Although the show still centred around the Trotter family, these characters became popular in their own right, contributing to the plots and humour.

As the series progressed, the scope of the plots expanded, leading to the larger regular cast, with writer John Sullivan unafraid to mix comedy with drama. Many early episodes were largely self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a [[story arc]] and an ongoing episodic dimension. The character of Grandad was killed off following the death of Lennard Pearce, and his brother [[Uncle Albert]] ([[Buster Merryfield]]) emerged to restore the three generations line-up. After years of fruitless searching, both Del and Rodney found long-term love, in the form of [[Raquel Turner|Raquel]] ([[Tessa Peake-Jones]]) and [[Cassandra Trotter|Cassandra]] ([[Gwyneth Strong]]) respectively; Del also had a son with Raquel, [[Damien Trotter|Damien]] (played by five actors, most recently [[Benjamin Smith (actor)|Ben Smith]]). Rodney and Cassandra married, separated and then got back together again. Cassandra miscarried, but then she and Rodney eventually had a baby. Rodney found out who his real father was. The Trotters finally became millionaires, before losing it again, and then gaining some of it back.

The humour comes from several sources. The interaction between Del and Rodney is key, with each an ideal comic [[Double act|foil]] for the other in both personality and appearance. Much is made of the traits of individual characters, such as Del's lack of cultural refinement, despite his pretensions, best seen in his misuse of French phrases or his claims to be a [[yuppy]]; Rodney's gormless nature, resulting in him being labelled a "plonker" or a "dipstick" by Del; the general daftness of Grandad and Trigger, and the rampant snobbery of Boycie. There are also several [[running gag]]s, including Trigger's belief that Rodney's name is actually Dave, Uncle Albert's "during the war..." anecdotes, Del's supposed long-time affair with Marlene and the dilapidated [[Reliant Regal]] van.

==History==
[[Image:Only fools original cast.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The original ''Only Fools and Horses'' line-up of (l-r) Grandad (Lennard Pearce), Del Boy (David Jason) and Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst) lasted from 1981<U+2013>1984.]]
In 1980, [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]], a scriptwriter under contract at the BBC, had already written the successful sit-com ''[[Citizen Smith]]''. It had come to an end and he was searching for a new project. An initial idea for a comedy set in the world of [[Football (soccer)|football]] had already been rejected by the BBC, as had his alternative idea, a sit-com centring around a [[cockney]] market trader in working-class, modern-day London. The latter idea persisted.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark, Steve | title=The Only Fools and Horses Story| publisher=BBC Books| year=1998| isbn=0-563-38445-X | pages=10<U+2013>11}}</ref> Through Ray Butt, a BBC producer and director whom Sullivan had met and become friends with when they were working on ''Citizen Smith'', a draft script was shown to the Corporation's Head of Comedy, [[John Howard Davies]]. Davies commissioned Sullivan to write a full series. Sullivan believes the key factor in it being accepted was the success of [[ITV]]'s new drama, ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', a series with a similar premise and also set in modern-day London.<ref name="Clark15">{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=15}}</ref>

Sullivan had initially given the show the working title ''Readies''. For the actual title he intended to use, as a reference to the [[protagonist]]'s tax and work-evading lifestyle, ''Only Fools and Horses''. That name was based on a genuine, though very obscure saying, ''"why do only fools and horses work? (for a living)''", which had its origins in 19th century American [[vaudeville]].<ref name="Clark12">{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=12}}</ref> ''Only Fools and Horses'' had also been the title of an episode of ''Citizen Smith'' and Sullivan felt that a longer name would help to grab the viewers' attention. He was first overruled on the grounds that the audience would not understand the title, but he eventually got his way and, from the second series onwards, the theme music was changed to a version explaining the meaning of the saying; some first series episodes were subsequently re-edited to use the new theme.

Filming of the first series began in May 1981, and the first episode, "[[Big Brother (Only Fools and Horses)|Big Brother]]", was transmitted on [[BBC One|BBC1]] at 8.30 pm on 8 September that year. It attracted a respectable, though unspectacular (by those days' standards) 9.2&nbsp;million viewers<ref>{{cite web |

The second series fared little better and the show was close to being cancelled altogether. However, both the first and second series had a repeat run in June 1983 in a more low-key time slot, but attracted respectable viewing figures, which convinced Davies to commission a third series.<ref name="Clark9293">{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=92<U+2013>93}}</ref> From there, the show gradually built up a following, and began to top the television ratings. Viewing figures for the fourth series were double those of the first.<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber, Richard | title=The Complete A-Z of Only Fools and Horses| publisher=Orion| year=2003| isbn=0-7528-6025-9 | page=28}}</ref>

Mid-way through the filming of the fifth series, David Jason told John Sullivan at a dinner that he wanted to leave the show in order to further his career elsewhere. Sullivan thus wrote "[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Only Fools and Horses)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]", which was intended to be the final episode and would see Del accepting a friend's offer to set up business in Australia, leaving Rodney and Albert behind. Plans were made for a spin-off entitled ''Hot-Rod'', following Rodney's attempts to survive on his own with help from Mickey Pearce, but leaving open the prospect of Del's return. Jason ultimately changed his mind, and the ending of the episode was changed to show Del rejecting the offer.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=116<U+2013>118}}</ref>

Sullivan had a tendency to write scripts that were too long, meaning pages of material had to be cut. Shortly before filming of the sixth series began, he requested that the show's time slot be extended and it was agreed to extend its running time to 50 minutes. This coincided with the show becoming one of the BBC's most popular programmes, according to producer Gareth Gwenlan,<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=101}}</ref> and allowed for more [[pathos]] in the series and an expansion of the regular cast.

The seventh series, which was to be the last, was aired in early 1991. Sullivan and the major actors were all involved with other projects, and it was confirmed that there were no plans for a new series. The show continued in [[Christmas special]]s in 1991, 1992 and 1993, followed by a three year break. Sullivan wanted a "final" episode to tie up the show and see the Trotters finally become millionaires; this was later extended to three one hour episodes, all to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received, and given the happy ending it was widely assumed that they were to be the last.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=140<U+2013>143}}</ref> After a five year break, however, the show returned again in 2001 with another Christmas special, followed by two more in 2002 and 2003. There are currently no further plans for ''Only Fools and Horses'' to return,<ref>{{cite news |

[[Image:Only Fools Rodney Del Albert.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The more familiar line-up of Rodney, Del, and [[Uncle Albert]] lasted from 1985<U+2013>1997.]]
'''[[Del Boy]]''' ([[David Jason]])  <U+2014> A stereotypical market trader and petty criminal, Del would sell anything to anyone to earn money, including stolen goods, and was the driving force behind the Trotters' attempts to become rich. Sharp-witted, image-conscious and self-confident, but lacking in the required [[nous]] to realise his high ambitions, he was invariably a failure. Del's cultural pretensions, best seen in his use of inaccurate French phrases (such as using Bonjour to say goodbye), were equally wanting. He nonetheless had endearing features, especially his "lovable loser" qualities and his devotion and loyalty to his family, which saw him take care of Rodney and Grandad on his own from the age of 16. However, this gave him a tendency to emotionally blackmail Rodney with the memories of their mother, often trying to manipulate him with the line "Mum said to me on her death bed..." He also tried to interfere with his brother's personal life, much to the latter's annoyance. Ostensibly popular with women <U+2013> his poor choice in women was another running gag <U+2013> Del never settled down with one until he met Raquel, with whom he had a son, Damien.

Sullivan later said he had always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases, and it was them on which he based Del Boy. David Jason himself added elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel-hair coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician.<ref name="comedy guide">{{cite web |

 title=Only Fools And Horses |
 work=BBC | accessdate = 2006-09-22}}</ref> Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part, with [[Jim Broadbent]] (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as [[DCI Roy Slater]]), [[Enn Reitel]] and [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]] all earlier preferences. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of ''[[Open All Hours]]'' that Jason was considered and, despite initial concerns over his ability <U+2013> at that point, Jason had not had a leading television role <U+2013> and the fact that he and Lyndhurst did not look alike, he was cast.<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | pages=97<U+2013>98}}</ref>

'''[[Rodney Trotter|Rodney]]''' ([[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]) <U+2014> The ideal comic foil for Del Boy in numerous ways: naive, much younger and easily-influenced, more academically gifted, although only to the extent of two [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]]s, but generally gormless and lacking in common sense. Effectively orphaned when young, Rodney was raised by Del. His principal job throughout the show was as Del's lackey and sidekick, whose duties included looking out for policemen at the market and cleaning the van. Much of the conflict between the two came from Rodney's dislike of his reliance on Del, and his unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or by setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father. In contrast to Del Boy, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences; he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=14}}</ref>

'''[[Grandad (Only Fools and Horses)|Grandad]]''' ([[Lennard Pearce]]) <U+2014> Del and Rodney's elderly grandad was added to the cast to balance the three distinct generations, adding the voice of experience to the situation. In casting the role of Grandad, Sullivan had in mind an actor similar to [[Wilfrid Brambell]], who had played Albert Steptoe in ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', although chose not to use Brambell himself, thinking him too closely associated with ''Steptoe''. After seeing Pearce's audition, Sullivan settled on casting him immediately.<ref name="Clark15"/> Scruffy and daft, although sometimes displaying a razor sharp wit, Grandad rarely left the flat or even moved from his armchair in front of two television sets. Despite his age he was invariably treated as a dogsbody by Del and Rodney, often being assigned mundane jobs around the flat such as cooking meals. Pearce died in 1984 whilst filming the series four episode "[[Hole in One (Only Fools and Horses)|Hole in One]]" (several scenes were subsequently re-shot with Buster Merryfield).<ref name="Clark52">{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=52, 104<U+2013>106}}</ref> Sullivan thus wrote a new episode, "[[Strained Relations]]", which featured Grandad's funeral. It is revealed in the prequel "[[Rock & Chips]]" that Grandad's first name is Ted.

'''[[Uncle Albert]]''' ([[Buster Merryfield]]) <U+2014> Shortly after the death of Lennard Pearce it was decided that a new older family member should be brought in, which eventually led to "Uncle Albert", Grandad's long-lost brother. Merryfield was an inexperienced amateur actor at the time, but was selected because he appeared to fit the description of an old sailor, especially with his distinctive white "[[Captain Birdseye]]" beard.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> Albert first appeared at Grandad's funeral, and eventually moved in with Del and Rodney. His long-winded anecdotes about his wartime experiences with the [[Royal Navy]] became one of the show's running gags, resulting in gentle mocking from his great-nephews. When Merryfield died in 1999, Albert's death was written into the next episode.

'''[[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]]''' ([[Roger Lloyd Pack]]) <U+2014> Trigger, apparently so called because he looks like [[Trigger (horse)|a horse]], was the principal supporting character throughout the show's run; only Del Boy and Rodney appeared in more episodes. Lloyd Pack was cast by pure chance; Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=60}}</ref> Initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods, Trigger's place in the series changed over time. A daft road sweeper most frequently seen in the ''Nag's Head'', he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, drawing laughs in each of his scenes through his general stupidity, in particular his unshakable belief that Rodney's real name was actually Dave.
[[Image:Only Fools and Horses 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Del Boy]] (right) with friends [[Boycie]] (left) and [[Trigger (Only Fools And Horses)|Trigger]].]]
'''[[Boycie]]''' ([[John Challis]]) <U+2014> A shady used car salesman and a frightful snob with a machine gun laugh who "thinks anyone with a [[Pound Sterling|pound]] less than him is a peasant", according to Rodney in "[[Fatal Extraction]]". Boycie made sporadic appearances in earlier series before becoming a regular cast member from series 5 onwards. Boycie, a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], was very self-centred and prone to boasting about his high social status and mocking those less fortunate than himself, particularly Del Boy, though he did mellow as the series progressed. Del in turn teased him for being a "jaffa" (seedless) when it emerged that he had a low sperm count. Challis had played a similar character in an episode of ''[[Citizen Smith]]''. Sullivan liked him, and promised to cast him in a future series, which led to Boycie.<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=40}}</ref> Boycie later featured in a spin-off series, ''[[The Green Green Grass]]'', starting in 2005, in which he and his wife Marlene fled to the countryside from a criminal gang.

'''[[Raquel Turner|Raquel]]''' ([[Tessa Peake-Jones]]) <U+2014> Raquel was introduced because Sullivan wanted more female characters and for Del to start meeting more mature women.<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=102}}</ref> Her first appearance, in "[[Dates (Only Fools and Horses)|Dates]]", was intended to be a one-off, but she was written in again a year later and thereafter became a permanent cast member. An ambitious trained singer and actress whose career never took off, she met Del through a [[dating agency]], but they fell out over her part-time job as a [[Striptease|stripper]], before getting together again. This time she moved in with Del, helping to mellow him, and they had a son together, named Damien. As the character unfolded, it was revealed that she was previously married to Del's nemesis, [[DCI Roy Slater]]. Del Boy introduces her as "my significant other".

'''[[Cassandra Trotter|Cassandra]]''' ([[Gwyneth Strong]]) <U+2014> The intelligent daughter of a successful middle-class businessman, Cassandra first met Rodney in "[[Yuppy Love]]". Their relationship blossomed, and by the end of series six the two had married. But her high career ambitions brought her into conflict with Rodney, and their troubled marriage was one of the main storylines of the seventh series. They were eventually reconciled and in later episodes she was markedly less ambitious. The relationship with Rodney ultimately grew stronger after Cassandra suffered a miscarriage and later gave birth to a daughter.

'''Marlene''' ([[Sue Holderness]]) <U+2014> Marlene was initially just an [[unseen character]], occasionally mentioned by her husband, Boycie. She was a cheerful, slightly daffy woman whose burning, and seemingly unattainable, desire to have a child provided one of the show's earlier "soap opera" sub-plots. Details were occasionally revealed about Marlene's prior reputation as being popular with the local men; there was a consistent undercurrent of an affair between her and Del. She did finally have a son, Tyler. Questions over the latter's paternity, owing to Marlene's reputation and Boycie's impotence, were a recurring gag. 

'''[[Denzil Tulser|Denzil]]''' ([[Paul Barber (actor)|Paul Barber]]) <U+2014> Originally cast because Sullivan wanted Del to have had a black friend from his school days, easy-going [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] Denzil was often on the receiving end of Del's scams. His inability to say no to Del's business deals frequently led to conflict with his domineering wife, Corrine ([[Eva Mottley]]), who was only sighted once, in "[[Who's a Pretty Boy?]]". Sullivan had planned to bring Corrine back for more episodes, but after Mottley's death in 1985 opted to make her an unseen character rather than use another actress.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=98}}</ref>

'''Mickey Pearce''' ([[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]]) <U+2014> Mickey was a young, obnoxious spiv and friend of Rodney's, known for his ludicrous boasts about his success in business or with women, and for frequently taking advantage of Rodney's gullibility. Other jokes around Mickey were his rapid turnover of jobs, and the fact that he sported the pork-pie hat and suit of the [[2 tone]]/[[ska]] scene, which was popular during the 1980s, well into the 2000s.

'''[[Mike Fisher (Only Fools and Horses)|Mike]]''' ([[Kenneth MacDonald (English actor)|Kenneth MacDonald]]) <U+2014> The [[landlord]] of the ''Nag's Head'', although not from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service. Good natured and somewhat gullible, he was often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any goods he was selling. Del's unpaid bar tab was the cause of conflict between the two, but Mike rarely succeeded in getting him to pay up. When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, a storyline involving Mike's imprisonment for attempting to embezzle the brewery was written, and cafe owner Sid took over as pub landlord.

'''[[Damien Trotter|Damien]]''' (various) <U+2014> Damien was Del and Raquel's son. It was Rodney's mocking suggestion that he be named after the [[Damien Thorn|Devil's child]] in ''[[The Omen]]''; the couple took the suggestion seriously. The ''Omen'' joke and Rodney's apparent fear of Damien became a running gag (accompanied, not, in fact, by Jerry Goldsmith's original music from the film in question, but by its invariable stand-in, the "O Fortuna" from [[Carl Orff]]'s "[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]"). Six actors played Damien: Patrick McManus (1991), Grant Stevens (1991), Robert Liddement (1992), Jamie Smith (1993<U+2013>96), [[Douglas Hodge]] (1996, as adult), and [[Ben Smith (actor)|Ben Smith]] (2001<U+2013>03).

'''Sid''' ([[Roy Heather]]) <U+2014> Sid made sporadic appearances throughout the show's run, mainly as the proprietor of the run-down and unhygienic local cafe, which was shot in different locations, depending on the episode. After ''Nag's Head'' landlord Mike was imprisoned for [[embezzlement]] in the episode "[[If They Could See Us Now]]", Sid took over and kept that role for the remainder of the series.

==Minor Cast==
The most frequent roles for guest actors in ''Only Fools and Horses'' were as Del or Rodney's once-seen girlfriends, barmaids at the ''Nag's Head'', or individuals the Trotters were doing business with. Del and Rodney's deceased mother, Joan, though never seen, cropped up in Del's embellished accounts of her, or in his attempts to emotionally blackmail Rodney. Her grave <U+2013> a flamboyant monument <U+2013> was seen occasionally. Their absent father, Reg, appeared once in "[[Thicker than Water (Only Fools and Horses)|Thicker Than Water]]" (played by [[Peter Woodthorpe]]), before leaving under a cloud, never to be seen again. Other members of the Trotter family were rarely sighted, the exceptions being the woman they believe to be Auntie Rose ([[Beryl Cooke]]) in "[[The Second Time Around (Only Fools and Horses)|The Second Time Around]]", and cousins Stan and Jean (Mike Kemp and Maureen Sweeney), who attended Grandad's funeral. When Rodney met Cassandra, her parents Alan and Pamela ([[Denis Lill]] and [[Wanda Ventham]]) became casually recurring characters.

In some episodes a guest character was essential to the plot. Del's ex-fiancee Pauline ([[Jill Baker]]) dominated Del's libido in "[[The Second Time Around (Only Fools and Horses)|The Second Time Around]]", prompting Rodney and Grandad to leave. In "[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Only Fools and Horses)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]", Del's old business partner Jumbo Mills ([[Nick Stringer]]) wanted Del to return to Australia with him and restore their partnership, forcing Del to make a decision. An attempt by Lennox ([[Vas Blackwood]]) to rob a local supermarket set-up the "hostage" situation in "[[The Longest Night]]". Del and Rodney spent the whole of "[[Tea for Three]]" battling each other for the affections of Trigger's niece Lisa ([[Gerry Cowper]]). Abdul ([[Tony Anholt]]) in "[[To Hull and Back]]" and Arnie ([[Philip McGough]]) in "[[Chain Gang (Only Fools and Horses)|Chain Gang]]" were responsible for setting up dubious enterprises involving the Trotters in their respective episodes. Tony Angelino ([[Philip Pope]]), the singing dustman with a [[Rhotacism|speech impediment]], was the key to the humour and the storyline of "[[Stage Fright (Only Fools and Horses)|Stage Fright]]".

Del's nemesis from his school days, corrupt policeman [[DCI Roy Slater]] (played by [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Jim Broadbent]]), made three appearances, in "[[May The Force Be With You (Only Fools and Horses)|May The Force Be With You]]", "[[To Hull and Back]]" and "[[Class of '62]]". Feared local villains, the Driscoll Brothers ([[Roy Marsden]] and [[Christopher Ryan]]) featured once, in "[[Little Problems]]". In a play on Rodney's light-hearted perception of him being the spawn of the devil, a grown-up Damien ([[Douglas Hodge]]) appeared in Rodney's futuristic dream in "[[Heroes and Villains (Only Fools and Horses)|Heroes and Villains]]", as the all-powerful, war-mongering head of the now multi-national ''Trotters Independent Traders''. Rodney and Mickey's friends, the smooth-talking Jevon ([[Steven Woodcock]]) and then, briefly, Chris ([[Tony Marshall (actor)|Tony Marshall]]), a ladies' hairdresser, featured sporadically during the sixth and seventh series. The two-part 1991 Christmas special, "Miami Twice", saw [[Richard Branson]] and [[Barry Gibb]] make brief cameo appearances. [[Mike Read]] appeared as himself, hosting an episode of "[[Top Of The Pops]]", in "[[It's Only Rock and Roll (Only Fools and Horses)|It's Only Rock and Roll]]" and [[Jonathan Ross]] appeared as himself in "[[If They Could See Us Now]]".

While their characters were less significant, well-known actors who played cameos in the programme included [[Joan Sims]], best known for her numerous roles in the ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]'' films, who guest-starred in the feature-length episode "[[The Frog's Legacy]]" as an aunt of Trigger and old friend of Del's late mother; future Hollywood star [[David Thewlis]], who played a young wannabe musician in "[[It's Only Rock and Roll (Only Fools and Horses)|It's Only Rock and Roll]]"; [[John Bardon]], who now plays the role of [[Jim Branning]] in the soap opera "[[EastEnders]]", as the supermarket security officer in "[[The Longest Night]]". Walter Sparrow, who appeared as Dirty Barry in "[[Danger UXD]]", went on to appear in several Hollywood films.<ref>{{cite web |

==Episodes==
{{Details|List of Only Fools and Horses episodes}}
Sixty-three episodes of ''Only Fools and Horses'', all written by John Sullivan, were broadcast on BBC1 between 8 September 1981 and 25 December 2003.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | pages=146<U+2013>158}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=5}}</ref> The show was aired in seven series (1981<U+2013>83, 1985<U+2013>86, 1989 and 1990/91), and thereafter in sporadic Christmas special editions (1991<U+2013>93, 1996, 2001<U+2013>03). All of the earlier episodes had a running time of 30 minutes, but this was extended after Series Six (1989), and all subsequent episodes had a running time ranging from 50 to 95 minutes. Most episodes were shot in front of a live audience or had a [[laugh track]] recorded from a live audience viewing; the only exceptions being "[[To Hull and Back]]", "[[A Royal Flush]]", and the second part of "[[Miami Twice (part two)|Miami Twice]]".

Five special editions were produced, some of which have only recently been rediscovered.<ref>{{cite web |

==Reception==

''Only Fools and Horses'' won the [[BAFTA]] award for best comedy series in 1986, 1989 and 1997, was nominated in 1984, 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1992, and won the audience award in 2004. David Jason received individual BAFTAs for his portrayal of Del Boy in 1991 and 1997. The series won a [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]] in 1997 for most popular comedy series; Jason won two individual awards, in 1997 and 2002. It won the [[Royal Television Society|RTS]] best comedy award in 1997, best BBC sit-com at the 1990 [[British Comedy Awards]], and two [[Television and Radio Industries Club|Television and Radio Industries Club Awards]] for comedy programme of the year in 1984 and 1997.

==Theme music and titles==
[[Image:Only Fools Titles.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|The title sequence of ''Only Fools and Horses'', which introduces the main characters.]]
John Sullivan wrote the theme music for ''Only Fools and Horses'' when he wrote the first series, but the producers opted instead for an instrumental, saxophone-led tune composed by [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]], who had also arranged the themes for other BBC sit-coms, such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''. However, Sullivan was unhappy with this, so for the second series he persuaded the BBC to use his own compositions instead, partly because the new lyrics would explain the obscure title, which had been the subject of viewers' questions to the BBC during the first series.<ref name="Clark12"/> 

The first series was subsequently re-edited to use the new theme songs, though the first episode, "[[Big Brother (Only Fools and Horses)|Big Brother]]", is still sometimes repeated with the original Hazlehurst music intact,<ref>{{cite news |

publisher=BBC | 
accessdate=2007-01-17 | 
author=}}</ref> as is the [[Christmas Crackers (Only Fools and Horses)|1981 Christmas special]]. The current DVD release of Series One, however, replaces the theme music on all seven episodes. The original theme music is still used in the first episode during a montage in which Del unsuccessfully conducts business throughout Peckham whilst trying to find Rodney.

The lyrics to the established themes contain both slang and references to British culture, and describe elements of the show. The opening lyrics include "stick a pony in my pocket", pony being [[London slang]] for 25 pounds sterling;<ref name="slang">See the {{cite web |

 accessdate= 2006 }}</ref> "fetch the suitcase from the van" and "where it all comes from is a mystery", all references to the Trotters' shady, cash-only business. It ends with the title lyric, "why do only fools and horses work?" The closing theme follows suit, describing the dubious goods that the Trotters specialise in, from "miles and miles of carpet tiles" to "[[Trevor Francis]] tracksuits"; Francis was an English [[Football (soccer)|football]] player during the 1970s and 1980s. These are "from a mush in [[Shepherd's Bush]]"; mush is slang for a man whose name is unknown and Shepherd's Bush is a west London district.<ref name = "slang"/> The line "no [[income tax]], no [[Value Added Tax|VAT]]" summarises their outlook, before closing with the refrain "God bless Hooky Street". Hooky is British slang for something stolen or which has been acquired illegally.<ref name="slang"/>
[[Image:Only Fools Titles 2.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|The images peeling away was conceived as a metaphor for the Trotters' lifestyle]]

Both songs are performed by Sullivan, and not <U+2013> as is sometimes thought <U+2013> by Nicholas Lyndhurst.<ref>{{cite web |

Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing "Down to Margate", the closing credits song for "[[The Jolly Boys' Outing]]".

The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially like adhesive labels. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London, including a used car lot and a tower block. The sequence was conceived by [[graphic designer]], Peter Clayton, as a "metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete.<ref name="credits">{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=202}}</ref> 

As the series progressed, the sequence was occasionally updated with new footage, but it only ever featured Del, Rodney and either Grandad or Uncle Albert. The 2001<U+2013>2003 trilogy featured just Del and Rodney. In total, the shots of Del and Rodney were updated three times during the series' run to reflect their ageing, whilst Grandad and Uncle Albert only ever received one version each during their run. The 2001<U+2013>2003 Christmas specials used the same titles sequences but rendered for broadcast in the now standard 16:9 ratio widescreen.

The closing credits for the programme varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring the names of the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series the credits switched to a standard rolling format. Towards the end of the run they settled on a uniform style with the typeface [[Dom Casual]] scrolling against a freeze frame of the final scene which faded to a plain black background.<ref name="credits"/> Despite strict BBC crediting guidelines in place by the time the most recent episodes screened, the programme was able to enjoy unedited closing credits and the full version of the theme song.

Sullivan remembered it and thought it was an expression Del Boy would use; in 2003, the phrase was incorporated into the new [[Oxford English Dictionary]].<ref>{{cite news |

Four episodes were subsequently re-edited for radio and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] over June and July 1999.<ref>{{cite web |

These episodes and three other audio box-sets have since been released on audio cassette and CD.

In 1988, ''Only Fools and Horses'' featured at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] at the [[London Palladium]]. The plot saw David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst and Buster Merryfield appear on stage in character, thinking that they are delivering boxes of alcohol to an associate of Del's, only later realising where they actually are. The idea of an ''Only Fools and Horses'' stage show was mooted by Ray Butt, following the success of other sit-com crossovers such as ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''. Sullivan wasn't keen, owing to his inexperience with the theatre, and the enterprise was deemed too time-consuming, so nothing came of it.<ref name="Clark9293"/>

==International remakes==
''Only Fools and Horses'' was sold to countries throughout the world. Australia, Belgium, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], Greece, [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Montenegro]], New Zealand, [[Pakistan]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], South Africa and Spain are among those who purchased it.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=25}}</ref> In all countries in which ex-[[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] is spoken the title was "Mu<U+0107>ke" (or "<U+041C><U+0443><U+045B><U+043A><U+0435>" in [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]]), which can roughly be translated as "shady businesses." Three overseas re-makes have also been produced. The first was in The Netherlands, entitled ''Wat schuift't?'' (What's it worth?). The Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans, it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Granpa and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on [[RTL 4]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Webber | year=2003 | title=A-Z of Only Fools and Horses | page=234}}</ref>

The second country to re-make the show is Portugal, with their version named ''O Fura-Vidas'', a local expression for someone who lives outside the law. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals, with only minor changes. It centred around the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in [[Lisbon]], and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney).<ref>For more details of ''O Fura-Vidas'', see {{cite web | url=http://www.waitenet.co.uk/ |
 title=Chris' fools and horses page |
 work=waitenet.co.uk | accessdate = 2006-09-17}}</ref>

The third country to re-make the show is [[Slovenia]]; their version is called ''Brat bratu'' (Brother to brother). All episodes were based on the original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]]. It features brothers Brane (Brane <U+0160>turbej) and Bine (Jure Dreven<U+0161>ek), who moved from [[Maribor]] to [[Ljubljana]]. The series also stars Peter Ternov<U+0161>ek as Grandad. It was directed by [[Branko <U+0110>uri<U+0107>]]. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes were aired due to poor ratings.

There have been several plans to produce an American version. One was to be a [[star vehicle]] for former ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H*]]'' actor [[Harry Morgan]], with Grandad rather than Del becoming the lead character.<ref>{{cite book | author=Clark | year=1998 | title=Only Fools and Horses Story | page=90}}</ref> The other, entitled ''This Time Next Year...'', would have seen the Trotters renamed the Flannagans. A draft script was written for the latter,<ref>See Webber (2003), pp. 259<U+2013>63 for the draft script</ref> but neither show materialised. [[Steve Carell]], star of the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', has expressed an interest in making an American version of ''Only Fools and Horses'', with him to star as Del Boy.<ref>{{cite news |

''Only Fools and Horses'' featured in a parody of American sit-coms by [[David Walliams]] and [[Matt Lucas]] in "Mash and Peas do the USA" for [[Channel 4]]'s Sitcom Weekend in 1997. Re-named ''Only Jerks and Horses'', the sketch took a mocking view of what the series would have been like had it been re-made in the United States, with Del Boy, Boycie and Trigger all "[[Americanization|Americanized]]", though Rodney remained English.
