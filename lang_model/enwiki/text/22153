'''LeRoy Jerome Prinz''' (July 14, 1895 <U+2013> September 15, 1983) was an American [[choreographer]], [[dance director|director]] and producer, who was involved in the production of dozens of motion pictures, mainly for [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Brothers]], from 1929 through 1958, and also choreographed [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals. He was nominated three times for the [[Academy Award for Best Dance Direction]] in the 1930s, and won the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] in 1958. 

Among the films whose dances he choreographed were ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1936), ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1945), and ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' (1958). 

==Early life and military service==

LeRoy Jerome Prinz was born in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]. His grandfather was a dancing master, and his father taught [[ballroom dancing]] etiquette to young men and women at Prinz's Academy in St. Joseph.<ref name="Times 1945">{{cite news | title=The Peripatetic Mr. Prinz: A Dance Director Who Bristles at Being Called a 'Dancing Man,' Recounts His Adventures as a Soldier of Fortune | work=The New York Times | date=June 17, 1945 | accessdate=February 14, 2014 | author=Pryor, Thomas M. | page=X3}}</ref><ref name="Bacon">{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19520313&id=2YNSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lSMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4871,6276535 | title=Leroy Prinz, Film Dance Director, Was Hobo, War Pilot and Adventurer | work=The Milwaukee Journal | date=March 13, 1952 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | author=Bacon, James}}</ref> According to one account, he was sent to [[reform school]] after chasing his stepmother with a carving knife.<ref name="Coakley profile"/>

In newspaper profiles, he claimed that after running away from [[boarding school]] at the age of 15, he "hopped a freight" and came to New York City, where, in 1911, he began a song and dance act, "Prinz and Buck," with a young black man he met along the way. Later that year, he told interviewers, he went on a ship to Europe as a [[cabin boy]], jumped ship, and traveled around Europe "introducing the American strut step" in return for meals and lodging. In [[Marseilles]] he joined the [[French Foreign Legion]], serving as a [[bugler]] in [[Algiers]].<ref name="Times 1945"/>

After the outbreak of World War I, he returned to France, was trained as a pilot, and served in the French aviation corps and Captain [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]'s [[94th Aero Squadron]].<ref name="LAT obit" /><ref name="Bacon" /><ref name="Wings">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QrbvAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=prinz | title=Wings of Honor: American Airmen in WWI | publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. | author=Sloan Jr., James J. | year=2004 | pages=132, 134 | isbn=0-88740-577-0}}</ref>  He was with the 94th from November 1917 to June 1918, when he switched to the [[27th Aero Squadron]], where he stayed until November 1918.<ref name="Wings" />  At the 27th his duties included working at the Aircraft Acceptance Park test facility at [[Orly, France|Orly]].<ref name="Wings"/>  Prinz subsequently told journalists that he crashed 14 to 18 airplanes, was nicknamed "America's German Ace" as a result,<ref name="Coakley profile" /> and that he was wounded in the war and carried a silver plate in his head from his last plane crash.<ref name="Times 1945"/>  He returned to the U.S. in 1919 and studied theater at [[Northwestern University]].<ref name="LAT obit" />

==Career==

After graduation from Northwestern, Prinz returned to France and worked as a choreographer for the ''[[Folies Berg<U+00E8>re]]'' in Paris.<ref name="LAT obit">{{cite news | title=LeRoy Prinz, Movie Choreographer, Dies | work=Los Angeles Times | date=September 20, 1983 | accessdate=February 12, 2014 | author=Bronzini, Tom | page=E23}}</ref>

In various newspaper profiles, Prinz claimed that he worked as a dancer at a bordello in Omaha, as an aviation instructor for the Mexican government, and that he ferried ammunition for the Nicaraguan rebel leader, [[Augusto C<U+00E9>sar Sandino]].<ref name="Times 1945"/>   He told interviewers that he worked for gangster [[Jim Colosimo]]'s restaurant in Chicago,<ref name="Bacon"/> and that he produced stage shows for [[Al Capone]].<ref name="Coakley profile"/> He claimed in a 1945 ''New York Times'' profile that Capone hired him to book entertainment and stage floor shows at eighteen Chicago nightclubs. Prinz left Chicago and worked as a dance director in New York, Florida, Mexico and Cuba. His employers included [[Earl Carroll]], Broadway's [[The Shubert Organization|Shubert family]], [[Tex Guinan]] and Philadelphia bootlegger Boo Hoo Hoff.<ref name="Bacon"/> He choreographed ''Earl Carroll's Vanities of 1930'' and other Broadway shows between 1929 and 1933.<ref name="Playbill ">{{cite web | url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/4754/Leroy-Prinz | title=LeRoy Prinz | publisher=Playbill.com | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Cleopatra trailer screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Prinz clashed with [[Agnes de Mille]] while staging dances for her uncle's film ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934).]]
His first employment in films was in 1931 by director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who employed him as dance director. While filming ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934), Prinz clashed with DeMille's niece [[Agnes de Mille]], who was brought in to choreograph dance sequences. According to Agnes deMille's biographer, her uncle always deferred to the "reliable but pedestrian" Prinz, even after agreeing to his niece's flamboyant dances in advance. Agnes deMille left the film.<ref name="deMille">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PufqiwbFTT0C&pg=PA113&dq=leroy+prinz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OTL-UrK4EobIsATZxYGYBg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=leroy%20prinz&f=false | title=No Intermissions: The Life of Agnes de Mille | publisher=Da Capo Press | author=Easton, Carol | year=2000 | pages=111<U+2013>115 | isbn=0-306-80975-3}}</ref>

He directed dance sequences for dozens of [[Paramount Pictures]] movies between 1933 and 1941, when he became dance director of [[Warner Brothers]],<ref name="Times 1945"/> where he staged all of Warner's musical sequences for the next sixteen years. He worked in over 150 films, mainly as a choreographer, among them ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929), ''[[Tea for Two (film)|Tea for Two]]'' (1950), and ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1952), a remake of the first sound movie.<ref name="LAT obit"/><ref name="McCracken bio"/>

In the 1940s he worked on the first [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]] [[Road to <U+2026>|"Road" movie]], ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), at Paramount. His first major assignment at Warner Brothers was the 1942 [[George M. Cohan]] biographical movie ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', starring [[James Cagney]] in the title role. In 1944 he choreographed a "ballet in jive" sequence in the service musical ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'', featuring Broadway dancer [[Joan McCracken]]. Prinz played himself directing the sequence in a brief cameo appearance.<ref name="McCracken bio"/>

McCracken, who came to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the ''Hollywood Canteen'' number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he made no effort to integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose ''Oklahoma!'' dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.<ref name="McCracken bio"/><ref name="LAT obit"/>

Prinz worked again with James Cagney, eight years after ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'', on ''[[The West Point Story (film)|West Point Story]]'', also starring [[Virginia Mayo]] and [[Doris Day]]. He ceased working in films after choreographing the Boar's Tooth Ceremonial dance sequence in the 1958 film adaptation of ''South Pacific''.<ref name="LAT obit"/>

Later in life he was owner of his own production company, vice president of an advertising agency, and a producer of benefit programs in Hollywood.<ref name="LAT obit"/> He counted among his friends [[Ronald Reagan]], whom he knew from their days working together at Warner Brothers, and he choreographed entertainment at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]] and at several presidential inaugurations. At the 1976 convention, he came up with the idea of playing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" when convention organizers wanted to silence unruly delegates.<ref name="Coakley profile">{{cite news | title=Life Begins at 81 | work=Chicago Tribune | date=September 26, 1976 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Coakley, Michael | page=E6}}</ref><ref name="AP obit">{{cite news | title=Choreographer LeRoy Prinz | work=Chicago Tribune | date=September 21, 1983 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=February 12, 2014 | page=A12}}</ref>

Prinz was a "notorious self-promoter",<ref name="McCracken bio"/> and told stories about himself that were sometimes dubious. Columnist Michael Coakley recounted in a late-life profile of Prinz that editors of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' once were able to verify 90 percent of what they were told by Prinz, who sent them a telegraph saying "That's great. Don't believe 50 percent of it myself."<ref name="Coakley profile"/> In a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' profile late in life, Prinz' claimed "at least partial credit" in popularizing the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and [[rumba]], which became popular after appearing in his movies.<ref name="1975 profile">{{cite news | title=Postscript: Choreographer Keeps Hoofing at 80 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=September 22, 1975 | accessdate=February 12, 2014 | author=Houston, Jim | page=C1}}</ref>

==Awards==

Prinz was nominated in the long-defunct category of [[Academy Award for Best Dance Direction|Best Dance Direction]] during the [[10th Academy Awards|1937]] Academy Awards, for a [[Bing Crosby]] film he choreographed at Paramount, ''[[Waikiki Wedding]]'', and was twice nominated in that category for the 1935 films ''[[All the King's Horses (1935 film)|All the King's Horses]]'' and ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1936]]''. He was awarded the [[Golden Globe]] for best film choreography in 1958.<ref name=IMDB-awards>{{cite web|title=LeRoy Prinz-Awards|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697895/awards?ref_=nm_awd|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref> 

Though known mainly for his work as a dance director on big-budget musicals, he directed a number of mainly short films, one of which, ''[[A Boy and His Dog (1946 film)|A Boy and His Dog]]'' (1946), won the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]].<ref name="LAT obit"/>

==Choreographic style and legacy==
[[File:Cagney in yankee doodle dandy.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In Prinz's choreography of films like ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', the camera was like a member of the audience.]]

A  ''[[New York Times]]'' profile said that "his life story reads more like the script of an Errol Flynn adventure",<ref name="Times 1945"/> though the stories he told about himself were often dubious.<ref name="Coakley profile"/> He was once described as "a feisty little man who always had a cigarette dangling from his lips and looked more like a bartender than a choreographer."<ref name="McCracken bio"/>

Prinz was an "idea man" rather than as a choreographer, creating lavish production numbers and using simple steps and dance routines.<ref name="Woll"/> Jazz dance choreographer [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] has said that Prinz "didn't know a bloody thing about dancing."<ref name="McCracken bio">{{cite book | title=The Girl Who Fell Down: A Biography of Joan McCracken | publisher=Northeastern University Press | author=Sagolla, Lisa Jo | year=2003 | location=Boston | pages=89<U+2013>91 | isbn=1-55553-573-9}}</ref> In a 1952 profile, [[Associated Press]] Hollywood columnist [[James Bacon (author)|James Bacon]] said that Prinz differed from what he described as "sissified" choreographers, that he was "a rough, tough guy, as some little giants of 5 foot 5 are. His language is colorful."<ref name="Bacon"/> He claimed to have never taken a lesson in his life and, in a reference to his family's dancing school, that he was a "victim of heredity."<ref name="Times 1945"/>

As a choreographer at Warner Brothers, Prinz had a different approach than [[Busby Berkeley]], whose choreography for early 1930s movies included elaborate production numbers that were photographed using imaginative camera angles, often from above. Berkeley's numbers "broke the boundaries of the stage," while Prinz took a completely opposite approach, with the audience never able to forget that it was watching a stage performance. Prinz's style is evident in the ''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' number in ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'', which featured a stationary camera and included features of the stage, such as the orchestra pit, in the dance number. The camera, in effect, became a member of the audience.<ref name="Woll">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oYfq914PSfkC&pg=PA54&dq=LeRoy+Prinz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w279UsvBAbSlsQSloYCwAw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=LeRoy%20Prinz&f=false | title=The Hollywood Musical Goes to War | publisher=Taylor Trade Publications | author=Woll, Allen L. | year=1983 | pages=54<U+2013>56 | isbn=0-88229-704-X}}</ref>

In his 1983 study of wartime Hollywood musicals, Allen L. Woll says that with the camera angles not being employed effectively, as they were by Berkeley, "the pedestrian quality of Prinz's dance numbers is painfully revealed. No matter the picture, no matter the director, Prinz's dances are invariably the same, static and stage-bound."<ref name="Woll"/>

His treatment of dancers was sometimes caustic. Choreographer [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]] recalled in 1972 interview that Prinz "would make some girls hysterical. He loved to have them in tears. And that seemed to be the thing, to swear at the girls and be nasty."<ref name="Hermes Pan">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9w5ob3kzI7cC&pg=PA30&dq=leroy+prinz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Oyf8UqTtObGQ0QGhs4CoAQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=leroy%20prinz&f=false | title=Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Franceschina, John | year=2012 | page=30 | isbn=0-19-975429-2}}</ref>
