'''Henry DeWolf "Harry" Smyth'''<ref name="datus smith"/> (May 1, 1898 <U+2013> September 11, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]], [[diplomat]], and [[bureaucrat]] who played a number of key roles in the early development of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Educated at [[Princeton University]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], he was a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Physics from 1924 to 1966. He chaired the department from 1935 to 1949.

During [[World War II]] he was a member of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s [[S-1 Uranium Committee|Uranium Section]] and a consultant on the [[Manhattan Project]]. He wrote the Manhattan Project's first public official history, which came to be known as the [[Smyth Report]].

As a member of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1949 to 1954, Smyth urged in vain against the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] and in favor of international control of [[nuclear weapons]]. He was the sole member of the commission to vote against stripping [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s [[security clearance]]. He served as the U.S. representative to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) from 1961 to 1970, playing an important role in the realization of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]

He received the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1968 and the [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Distinguished Honor Award]] in 1970. The [[American Nuclear Society]]'s award for "nuclear statesmanship", of which he was the first recipient, is named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Smyth was both May 1, 1898, in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], [[New York]], to Ruth Anne Phelps and Charles Henry Smyth, Jr.,<ref name=aps>{{cite web |url=http://amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.Ms.Coll.15-ead.xml |title=Henry DeWolf Smyth papers, 1885<U+2013>1987 |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> a professor of [[geology]] at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]. [[Woodrow Wilson]], then [[President of Princeton University]], convinced Charles Henry Smyth, Jr., to join the faculty at Princeton, and in 1905 the family moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref name="charles phelps smyth">{{cite book |url=http://nas.nasonline.org/site/DocServer/Smyth_Charles.pdf?docID=73881 |title=Charles Phelps Smyth, 1895<U+2013>1990 |first1=Walter |last1=Kauzmann |first2=John D. |last2=Roberts |authorlink1=Walter Kauzmann |authorlink2=John D.

Henry DeWolf Smyth's elder brother, [[Charles Phelps Smyth]], attended the same [[Primary school|primary]] and [[Secondary school|secondary]] schools as Henry. The elder brother also received undergraduate and master's degrees from Princeton, but in [[chemistry]]. He earned his Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]] but like Henry and their father became a faculty member at Princeton. Both brothers served in the [[Chemical Warfare Service]] in [[World War I]] and on the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name="charles phelps smyth"/>

Henry DeWolf Smyth married Mary de Coningh on June 30, 1936.<ref name=aps/> He was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="oppenheimer prometheus pp544-6"/>

==Education==
In Princeton, Smyth attended Miss Fine's School,<ref name=aps/> which later became the [[Princeton Day School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pds.org/podium/default.aspx?t=135815 |title=About Princeton Day School: History |publisher=[[Princeton Day School]] |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> and the [[Lawrenceville School]]. After graduating from Lawrenceville in 1914,<ref name=aps/> he entered Princeton, where he received a [[Classics|classical education]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-09-12/news/26075124_1_nuclear-power-first-atomic-bomb-international-atomic-energy-agency |title=Henry Dewolf Smyth, 88, physicist |first=Burr |last=Van Atta |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=1986-09-12 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[Sigma Xi]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1918. He earned a [[master's degree]] and [[Ph.D.]] in physics from Princeton in 1920 and 1921, respectively, studying under [[Karl Taylor Compton]].<ref name=aps/>

The [[National Research Council]] awarded him a fellowship, and he joined the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. There he studied under [[Ernest Rutherford]] and earned a second doctorate, in 1923.<ref name=aps/>

==Early career==
During World War I, Smyth worked in the [[Chemical Warfare Service]]<ref name=schwartz/> and at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. After getting his second Ph.D., he returned to Princeton for the last year of his NRC fellowship. He was appointed an instructor in 1924, an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1929, and a full professor in 1936. In 1935 he became chairman of the Department of Physics, a position he held until 1949. During 1931<U+2013>32 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at the [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen]].<ref name=aps/>

Smyth's early work was in [[physical chemistry]]. He switched to [[nuclear physics]], inspired by [[James Chadwick]]'s discovery of the [[neutron]], [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] [[splitting the atom]], and [[Ernest Lawrence]]'s invention of the [[cyclotron]]. As department chair, Smyth had two cyclotrons built at Princeton.<ref name=aps/> In 1929 [[Kenneth Bainbridge]] completed his Ph.D. dissertation at Princeton working under Smyth.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=155167|title=Henry Smyth}}</ref>

He was a member of the subcommittee on physics of the National Research Council from 1928 to 1935.<ref name=aps/> In 1936 Smyth responded to media criticism of [[basic science]] research as "useless" by suggesting that seemingly useless research could turn out to be very useful later.<ref name=schwartz/>

==World War II==
[[Image:SmythReport.jpg|thumb|right|Fronticepiece of the Smyth Report.]]
During [[World War II]], Smyth was involved in helping the United States build the [[atomic bomb]]. During 1941<U+2013>43 was a member of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s [[S-1 Uranium Committee|Uranium Section]] charged with producing [[fissile]] material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the [[electromagnetic]] methods that were used to [[Enriched uranium|enrich]] the first large [[U-235]] samples for the project. During 1943<U+2013>45 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon.<ref name=aps/> He remained chairman of Princeton's physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project's later stages.<ref name=schwartz/>

Smyth advocated within the NDRC for the preparation of a comprehensive report to be released to the public following the weapon's first use. [[Vannevar Bush]], who as civilian director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman [[James Bryant Conant]]. Manhattan Project director General [[Leslie Groves]] granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote what became known as the [[Smyth Report]] in his office in Princeton's Palmer Laboratory,<ref name=schwartz>{{cite thesis |title=The making of the history of the atomic bomb: Henry DeWolf Smyth and the historiography of the Manhattan Project |first=Rebecca Press |last=Schwartz |degree=Ph.D. |year=2008 |month=Sep |publisher=[[Princeton University]]}}</ref> which later became the [[Frist Campus Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/frist/timeline.html |title=Frist Campus Center timeline |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

The report was first released to the press on August 12, 1945, days after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|attacks]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. The [[Government Printing Office]] could not print enough copies to meet demand,<ref name=schwartz/> so Smyth persuaded the director of the [[Princeton University Press]] to print more. By the end of the Press's 1946 fiscal year it had printed 103,000 copies. Smyth held the [[copyright]] to the work to prevent others from claiming it, but he permitted widespread reproduction, essentially releasing it into the [[public domain]].<ref name="datus smith">{{cite journal |title=The publishing history of the 'Smyth Report' |first=Datus C. |last=Smith |journal=The Princeton University Library Chronicle |volume=37 |number=3 |year=1976 |month=Spring |pages=191<U+2013>200 |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/pulc/pulc_v_37_n_3.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> He later recalled that "my financial balance from the Smyth Report is minus two dollars, the copyright fee."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 'Smyth Report' |first=Henry DeWolf |last=Smyth |journal=The Princeton University Library Chronicle |volume=37 |number=3 |year=1976 |month=Spring |pages=173<U+2013>89 |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/pulc/pulc_v_37_n_3.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

In the report, Smyth called it "a semi-technical report which it is hoped men of science in this country can use to help their fellow citizens in reaching wise decisions" in the new [[Atomic Age]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Atomic energy for military purposes; the official report on the development of the atomic bomb under the auspices of the United States Government, 1940<U+2013>1945 |first=Henry DeWolf |last=Smyth |year=1945}}</ref> At the urging of his superiors, he removed several discussions of the bomb's moral implications and its creators' unease. Rebecca Press Schwartz argues that Smyth's academic background and his report's security-driven focus on physics at the expense of engineering caused the Smyth Report to promote a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily an achievement of physicists.<ref name=schwartz/>

==Postwar==
Following the war, Smyth returned full time to his duties at Princeton. He continued to chair the Physics Department and was named the [[Joseph Henry]] Professor of Physics in 1946. During this time he spoke and wrote regularly about [[nuclear energy]] and [[science policy]].<ref name=aps/>

In 1949 Smyth resigned as department chairman after President [[Harry Truman]] named him to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. He was the commission's only scientist. Following the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[RDS-1|successful nuclear test]] in August 1949, the U.S. was considering a crash course to develop a [[hydrogen bomb]]. The AEC's nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], recommended unanimously against such a course, and Smyth was one of three of the five AEC commissioners to agree. Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program.<ref name=aps/>

In 1953 Smyth and John A. Hall served as principal advisors to President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in preparing his [[Atoms for Peace]] speech to the [[United Nations]].<ref name="iaea atoms for peace"/> The IAEA traces its origins to this speech.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1032_web.pdf |title=History of the International Atomic Energy Agency: The First Forty Years |first=David |last=Fischer |publisher=IAEA |year=1997 |page=1 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2645741.stm |title=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2645741.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-08-09 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

In 1954 the AEC was considering rescinding Oppenheimer's [[security clearance]] on suspicion that he was a [[Communist]]. Smyth was still the only scientist on the commission. Despite his personal dislike of Oppenheimer and pressure from the commission's chairman, [[Lewis Strauss]], Smyth was the sole commissioner to vote against stripping Oppenheimer's clearance on June 29, 1954.<ref name="oppenheimer prometheus pp544-6">{{cite book |title=[[American Prometheus|American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer]] |first1=Kai |last1=Bird |first2=Martin J. |last2=Sherwin |year=2005 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |pages=544<U+2013>6}}</ref> Smyth resigned from the AEC on September 30 of that year<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lGfBYCVSlmMC&pg=RA1-PA271&lpg=RA1-PA271#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Nuclear Regulatory Legislation |publisher=[[Government Printing Office]] |year=2008 |page=271 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref> out of frustration with Strauss.<ref name=aps/> [[Eulogy|Eulogizing]] Oppenheimer in 1967, Smyth said of Oppenheimer's treatment, "Such a wrong can never be righted; such a blot on our history never erased.... We regret that his great work for his country was repaid so shabbily".<ref>Quoted in Bird & Sherwin, p. 5.</ref>

Smyth returned to Princeton and served on several high-level administrative committees. This work included advising on the construction of a [[particle accelerator]] built jointly with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and overseeing [[Project Matterhorn]], which became the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]].<ref name=aps/> He chaired the committee that chose [[Robert F. Goheen]] to succeed [[Harold W. Dodds]] as President of Princeton.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/01/20649/ |title=The Goheen years |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> He also served as a consultant on nuclear power to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], the AEC, and private industry. He retired from Princeton in 1966.<ref name=aps/>

Smyth was a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] and served as its Vice President in 1956 and its President in 1957. He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1947 and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1956. He was a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].<ref name=aps/>

==IAEA representative==
[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed Smyth as the representative of the United States to the IAEA, a position with the rank of [[Ambassador]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/chiefsofmission/representative-to-iaea |title=Representative of the U.S.A. to the International Atomic Energy Agency (Vienna) |author=[[U.S. State Department]] Office of the Historian |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> He assumed the position on June 13, 1961, following confirmation by the [[U.S. Senate]]. Smyth shared the organization's stated goals of developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.<ref name=aps/> He helped develop what [[Glenn Seaborg]] later called "an unprecedented atmosphere of rapport"<ref>Quoted in the American Philosophical Society biography.</ref> at the IAEA and played a crucial role in the adoption of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1970. He retired from the IAEA<ref name=aps/> on August 31, 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/smyth-henry-dewolf |title=Henry DeWolf Smyth |author=[[U.S. State Department]] Office of the Historian |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

In September 1961, [[Harlan Cleveland]], then [[Assistant Secretary of State]] for International Organization Affairs, appointed Smyth to chair a committee to review U.S. policy toward the IAEA. The committee's report affirmed the importance of civilian uses of nuclear energy. In 1962 Cleveland again tapped Smyth, this time as an adviser to the [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] on the IAEA. In this position Smyth advocated for a transfer of national nuclear safeguards to the IAEA.<ref name=aps/>

In December 1965, Smyth was elected Chairman of the Board of the [[Universities Research Association]]. During Smyth's tenure, the URA signed a contract with the U.S. government to construct and operate the National Accelerator Laboratory, which later became known as [[Fermilab]]. Construction began, and research programs were planned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.fnal.gov/GoldenBooks/gb_ramsey.html |title=The early history of URA and Fermilab |first=Norman F. |last=Ramsey |authorlink=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr. |publisher=[[Fermilab]] |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> Smyth stepped down as chairman in 1970 but remained on the board.<ref name=aps/>

Smyth received the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1968<ref name="iaea atoms for peace">{{cite journal |title=Atoms for Peace Awards |journal=IAEA Bulletin |volume=10 |issue=5 |year=1968 |pages=10<U+2013>11 |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull105/10501401011.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> and the State Department's [[Distinguished Honor Award]] in 1970.<ref name=aps/> In 1972 he became the first recipient of an award for nuclear statesmanship given jointly by the [[American Nuclear Society]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.new.ans.org/honors/va-smyth |title=Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award |author=[[American Nuclear Society]] |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> By 1974, when the award was next given,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.new.ans.org/honors/recipients/va-smyth |title=Recipients: Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award |author=[[American Nuclear Society]] |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> it had been named the Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award.<ref name=aps/>

==Later life and legacy==
After retiring from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. In 1985 he denounced President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-09-14/news/8603080546_1_atomic-bomb-atomic-weapons-mr-smyth |title=Henry Smyth |author=''[[New York Times]]'' News Service |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1986-09-14 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986,<ref name=aps/> in Princeton. The cause was [[cardiac arrest]], though he had long battled [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-09-18/news/mn-11319_1_henry-smyth |title=Henry Smyth; wrote report on 1st A-bomb |author=Times Wire Services |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1986-09-18 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>
