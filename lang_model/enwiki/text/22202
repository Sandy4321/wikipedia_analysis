In April 2009 a police detective who is also a member of Brunson's security detail investigated the website of a blogger critical of Brunson's $300,000 salary and other perks. Discussing the accusations, Brunson said he was one of the lowest-paid mega-church pastors in the Southern Baptist Convention. The anonymous blogger's name was revealed to the church, and a trespass warning was issued that banned the longtime member and his wife from First Baptist.<ref>{{cite web

In 2012, Brunson was a vocal opponent of Ordinate 2012-296, a bill that if passed, would have added sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression to the City of Jacksonville's Human Rights Commission.<ref>{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref> Adding this wording would have established protections for those stated groups in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations. In an August 7, 2012 opinion piece in the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'', Brunson wrote, "With the left hand, City Council wants us to believe it is concerned with the rights of the church. Yet with the right hand, council reveals its true intention <U+2014> requiring Christians to subordinate their faith to the dictates of government steered by a rabid minority".<ref>{{cite web
