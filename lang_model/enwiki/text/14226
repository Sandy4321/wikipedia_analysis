'''Chrome Division''' is a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Norway]] formed in 2004 by [[Shagrath]], the lead vocalist of [[symphonic black metal]] band [[Dimmu Borgir]], and [[Lex Icon]], founder of [[The Kovenant]]. Although it was not intended as such, it is now considered a side project of Shagrath's, and the current lineup consists of him on rhythm guitar, along with Eddie Guz as the vocalist, Ricky Black on lead guitar, Bj<U+00F6>rn Luna on bass guitar and Tony White on drums. The band plays in the style of bands such as [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]], and draws heavily upon imagery from the [[motorcycling]] subculture.

To date, Chrome Division has released two albums, ''[[Doomsday Rock 'n Roll]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Booze, Broads and Beelzebub]]'', was released in 2008, but the band has signed a three-album deal with [[Nuclear Blast]]. Chrome Division also released a music video for the song "Serial Killer" in an attempt to publicise the album, directed by noted Swedish director [[Patrick Ullaeus]].

==History==
===Foundation and early history===
The idea for the band was conceived by [[Shagrath]] and [[Stian Arnesen]], then of [[Dimmu Borgir]], in 1999.<ref name="Detector">{{cite web |url= http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,48651.sm |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930193129/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,48651.sm |archivedate= 2007-09-30|title= Chrome Division interview (Shagrath)|accessdate=2007-08-19 |last= Morgan|first= Anthony|date= [[2006-06-26]]|publisher= [[Rockdetector]]}}</ref> This consisted of the two musicians [[Jam session|jamming]] after Dimmu Borgir rehearsals. With Shagrath on guitars and Arnesen (or "Lex Icon") on drums, they recorded some material, but could take it no further due to their commitments to their other bands.<ref name="Nuclear"/> Shagrath later claimed that Dimmu Borgir will always be his priority.<ref name="Live">{{cite web |url= http://www.live-metal.net/interviews_dimmuborgir.html|title= Dimmu Borgir: Sharing Their Sacrifice (interview with Shagrath)|accessdate=2007-08-19 |last= Maki|first= Jeff|date= [[2007-05-09]]|publisher= Live-Metal.net}}</ref>

It was not until mid 2004 that the band was properly formed.<ref name="Nuclear"/> Shagrath and Lex Icon once again met up, and by this time Lex Icon had left Dimmu Borgir and founded [[The Kovenant]].

===''Booze, Broads and Beelzebub'' (2007<U+2013>present)===
Although there was no official release on the subject, Shagrath said in an interview with Live-Metal.net that Chrome Division had several new songs post ''Doomsday Rock 'n Roll'', and that the band would probably try to produce a new album in mid 2007.<ref name="Live"/> Bj<U+00F6>rn Luna also said that there was to be a second album in an interview on MetalEagle.com, and explained that the band has signed a three album contract with [[Nuclear Blast]].<ref name="Eagle"/>

==Musical style==
Shagrath cites Chrome Division's influences as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Black Label Society]], [[Spiritual Beggars]] and [[AC/DC]], and says that he wanted the band to sound like an '80s [[rock 'n roll]] [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. He also talked about the band trying adhere to that image, through lyrical content and such.<ref name="Detector"/> This was picked up on by Ken Pearce, of SeaOfTranquility.org  who commented on the [[Motorcycling|biker culture]] imagery,<ref name="Sea">{{cite web |url= http://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=3951|title= Chrome Division: Doomsday Rock <U+2018>N<U+2019> Roll|accessdate=2007-08-20 |last= Pierce|first= Ken|date= [[2006-07-23]]|publisher= Sea of Tranquility}}</ref> which included the sound of a motorcycle revving up at the start of the track "Trouble with the Law".<ref name="Blabber3">{{cite web |url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=848|title= Doomsday Rock 'N Roll (Nuclear Blast)|accessdate=2007-08-20 |last= Alisoglu|first= Scott|publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> Reviewers compared the sound of the music to [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]],<ref name="CoC"/><ref name="Live review"/> and [[Black Label Society]]<ref name="Live review"/> and compared the "fun" attitude of the band to [[Turbonegro]].<ref name="Live review"/> Shagrath has said that future releases from the band will be "musically the same thing", but that they will "try to add different ingredients" and they may also change the lyrical content.<ref name="Detector"/>
