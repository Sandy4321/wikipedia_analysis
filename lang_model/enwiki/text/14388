The '''Harpoon''' is an all-weather, [[Over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]], [[anti-ship missile]] system, originally developed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] of the United States, with development and manufacturing now taken over by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]]. In 2004, Boeing delivered the 7,000th Harpoon unit since the weapon's introduction in 1977. The missile system has also been further developed into a coastal strike version, the [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] (SLAM).

The Harpoon uses [[active radar homing]] and low-level, sea-skimming cruise trajectory to improve survivability and effectiveness. The missile's launch platforms include:
*[[fixed-wing aircraft|Airplane]]s ('''AGM-84''', without the booster);
*[[warship|Surface ships]] ('''RGM-84''', fitted with a [[solid rocket]] launch booster that detaches when expended to allow the missile's integral [[turbojet]] to maintain flight);
*[[Submarine]]s ('''UGM-84''', fitted with a solid-rocket launch booster and encapsulated in a container to enable submerged launch through a torpedo tube);
*Coastal defense batteries.

The chief competitors of the Harpoon are the French ''[[Exocet]]'', the Swedish ''[[RBS15]]'', the Russian ''[[Kh-35|SS-N-25 Switchblade]]'' and the Chinese ''[[C-802|Yingji]]''.

==Variants==
===Original Harpoon===
The Harpoon was first introduced in 1977 after the sinking of the Israeli destroyer ''[[HMS Zealous (R39)|Eilat]]'' in 1967 by Soviet-built [[P-15 Termit|Styx]] anti-ship missiles from an Egyptian missile boat. Initially developed as an air-launched missile for the [[United States Navy]], the Harpoon has been adapted for use on Air Force [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H bombers]], which can carry from eight to 12 of the missiles. The Harpoon has also been adapted for use on the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], in use by the USA, Singapore and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] also operates 5 modified Fokker-50 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) which are fitted with sonars and sensors to fire the Harpoon missile. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] can fire AGM-84 series missiles from its [[General Dynamics F-111#F-111C|F-111C/G Aardvark]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[P-3 Orion|AP-3C Orion]] aircraft. The [[Royal Australian Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on major surface combatants and the [[Collins class submarine]]. The [[Spanish Air Force]] and  [[Chilean Navy]] are another AGM-84D customer and can fire the missiles from [[F/A-18]], [[F-16]], ships and [[P-3 Orion]] aircraft.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on several types of surface ship and submarine, and the [[Royal Air Force]] uses it on the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod MR2]] maritime patrol aircraft. The [[Pakistan Navy]] uses the Harpoon on its [[Frigate|naval frigates]] and P-3C Orions.  The [[Canadian  Forces Maritime Command]] (Canadian Navy) uses Harpoons on its [[Halifax-Class]] Patrol frigates.

===Harpoon Block ID===
This version featured a larger fuel tank and reattack capability, but was not produced in numbers because its intended mission (confrontation with the Soviet Union) was, after 1991, considered unlikely.

===Harpoon Block IE===
The Block IE version uses an optical seeker head borrowed from the [[AGM-62 Walleye]], a [[GPS]] receiver and the [[data]] link from the [[AGM-65 Maverick]] [[missile]].  It is an intermediate range, all-weather weapon which can attack ships in port, which are close together, or a land target.  The reuse of electronics and [[sensors]] already in service in other weapons reduced its development cost.<ref>FAS Harpoon article</ref><ref>Global Security Harpoon article</ref>

===SLAM ATA (Block IG)===
This version, under development, gives the SLAM a reattack capability as well as an image comparison capability similar to the [[Tomahawk cruise missile]]; that is, the weapon can compare the target scene in front of it with an [[image]] stored in its on-board [[computer]] during terminal phase target acquisition and lockon.<ref>Global Security Harpoon article</ref>

===Harpoon Block II===
[[Image:Harpoon-block-II-launch.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Harpoon Block II test firing from [[USS Decatur (DDG-73)|USS ''Decatur'']].]]

In production at Boeing facilities in [[Saint Charles, Missouri]] is the Harpoon Block II, intended to offer an expanded engagement envelope and advanced [[electronic countermeasures|counter measures]] together with improved targeting.  Specifically, the Harpoon was initially designed as an open-ocean weapon; Block II continues progress begun with Block IE, and provides the Harpoon with a littoral water attack capability.

The key improvements of the Harpoon Block II are obtained by incorporating the [[inertial measurement unit]] from the [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] program, and the software, computer, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)/inertial navigation system and GPS antenna/receiver from the SLAM Expanded Response (SLAM-ER), an upgrade to the SLAM.

The first international customer for Harpoon Block II systems was the [[Royal Danish Navy]], which ordered 50 upgrade kits in 1997; the first systems were delivered in 2002.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

===Harpoon Block III===
With the addition of a robust [[datalink]] system, Harpoon Block III provides inflight
target updates, positive terminal control and connectivity with future network architecture, resulting in
more control after the weapon is released. The [[datalink]] is already provides autonomous, all-weather, over-the-horizon capability.

The Harpoon Block III Weapon System provides the [[U.S. Navy]] and its allies with Surface
Warfare (SuW) capabilities from ships and aircraft. Harpoon Block III creates a highly capable
weapon for the open water and littoral warfare environment, adding [[Global Positioning System]] capability, littoral performance improvement and a precision moving
target solution.

The 500-pound blast warhead delivers lethal firepower for conventional anti-ship missions, such as open-ocean, near-land or ships in port. The [[datalink]] updated [[Global Positioning System]]/Inertial Navigation System improves midcourse guidance to the
target area. The accurate navigation solution allows users to discriminate target ships
from islands, other nearby land masses, obstructions or ships.
Harpoon Block III will be deployable from Harpoon missile system platforms with existing
command and launch equipment, the [[F/A-18E/F]] Super Hornet and the Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) like [[P-3 Orion]].

==Operational history==
In 1981 and 1982 there were two [[1982 Harpoon Missile Misfire Incident|accidental launches]] of Harpoon missiles from US and Danish surface ships.

In 1986, the [[United States Navy]] sank at least two Libyan patrol boats in the [[Gulf of Sidra]]. Two Harpoon missiles were launched from [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'']] with no confirmed result and several others from [[A-6 Intruder]] aircraft that were said to have hit their targets.<ref>[[Time (magazine)]]. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961035,00.html High-Tech Firepower]. [[April 7]], [[1986]].</ref><ref>Ronald Reagan. [http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/32686h.htm Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate on the Gulf of Sidra Incident]. [[March 26]], [[1986]].</ref> Initial reports claimed ''Yorktown'' scored hits on a patrol boat, but after action reports indicated that the target may have been a false one and that no ships were hit by those missiles.<ref>[[The New York Times]]. PENTAGON REVISES LIBYAN SHIP TOLL. [[March 27]], [[1986]].</ref>

In 1988, Harpoon missiles were used to sink the [[Iranian frigate Sahand|Iranian frigate ''Sahand'']] during [[Operation Praying Mantis]]. Another was fired at the FAC ''[[Joshan]]'', but failed to strike because the FAC had already been largely sunk by [[RIM-66 Standard]] missiles. An Iranian Harpoon was also fired, at the USS ''Wainwright''. The missile passed down the side of the ship but apparently failed to detect and engage the ship.

In December 1988, a Harpoon launched by a [[F/A-18 Hornet]] from the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']]<ref>The New York Times / AP. U.S. Rocket Hits Indian Ship Accidentally, Killing Crewman. [[December 13]], [[1988]].</ref> killed one sailor when it struck the ''Jagvivek'', a 250 ft long [[India]]n merchant ship, during an exercise at the [[Pacific Missile Range]] near [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]]. A [[Notice to Mariners]] had been issued warning of the danger, but when ''Jagvivek'' strayed in the test range, the unarmed Harpoon, loaded with an inert warhead, locked onto it instead of its intended target. 

57 Harpoons were sold to the [[Republic of China Air Force]].
