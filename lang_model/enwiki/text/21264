===Micra K10===
The original Micra (chassis name K10) was introduced in October 1982 as a challenger to the highly successful [[Honda City AA|Honda City]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was intended to replace the [[Nissan Cherry]] as the company's competitor in the supermini sector, as the Cherry model itself had progressively become larger with each successive generation. It was introduced in the European market in 1983, and in the Canadian market in 1984. Although Nissan was slowly phasing out the Datsun name, a small {{Nihongo|"Datsun"|<U+30C0><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30B5><U+30F3>|Dattosan}} appeared on the tailgate for the first two years, and in some European markets, the car was known as the "Datsun-Nissan Micra". The Datsun badges had disappeared completely by the end of 1984. The Micra was initially available with an extremely refined all-aluminium [[MA10S]] [[Overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine.

The model was revised in June 1985, identifiable by the slightly larger rear lamp clusters. The Japanese market saw the debut of the first [[March Turbo|Micra Turbo]]/[[Nissan MA engine#MA10ET|MA10ET]], where Nissan grafted a turbocharger to the small 1.0&nbsp;L engine. Another facelift came in March 1989, which consisted of some minor upgrades such as deeper bumpers, a new front grille, minor interior details, and headlight changes. It also saw the introduction of an electronically controlled [[carburetor|carburettor]], the larger MA12 1.2&nbsp;L engine with 60&nbsp;PS (44&nbsp;kW/59&nbsp;hp) and a 5-door hatchback version.

In 1988, Nissan launched a limited 10,000 unit run of its [[homologation|homologated]] Nissan 1989 Micra Superturbo (EK10GFR/GAR). Both this and the 1988 Micra R (EK10FR) featured the same highly advanced sequential compound charged (supercharger plus turbocharger) engine in an all-aluminium [[straight-4]] 930&nbsp;cc 8-valve 4-cylinder [[Nissan MA MA09ERT]] unit that produced 110&nbsp;PS [[JIS]] (81&nbsp;kW/108&nbsp;hp) at 6400&nbsp;rpm. This car came with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] with viscous [[limited slip differential]], as well as options such as air conditioning and electric mirrors. The Micra Superturbo still holds the crown for the fastest production Micra in Nissan's history, with factory performance figures of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) and 15.5 seconds to run a quarter mile. It has a top speed of 180&nbsp;km/h (112&nbsp;mph).

The Micra's chassis spawned a number of variations. The [[Nissan Be-1|Be-1]] (BK10), launched at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in 1985 (but not sold until 1987), was a limited edition model with a more rounded bodyshape, and only 10,000 were sold. In 1987, the canvas-topped, retro looking hatchback [[Nissan Pao|Pao]] (<U+30D1><U+30AA>) (PK10) was launched (also at the Tokyo Motorshow) and sold to the public in 1989; 51,657 models were sold. The canvas-topped [[Nissan Figaro|Figaro]] (<U+30D5><U+30A3><U+30AC><U+30ED>) (FK10) coup<U+00E9> was unveiled at the same show in 1989, but not released until 1991. Because demand for the Figaro exceeded the 20,000 vehicles built, Nissan sold the car by lottery: winners could place orders for the car. Despite being a JDM-only model, the Figaro is one of the most imported models of the K10 derivatives; its popularity among numerous celebrity owners helped it earn cult status. The K10 ceased production on 21 December 1992.

During its lifetime, the Micra gained a good reputation for reliability and economy. In 1995, it topped the small car class in a reliability survey of four to six-year-old cars undertaken by the German [[ADAC|Automobile Association (ADAC)]], with 7.5 recorded breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles for four-year-old Micras and 11.5 for six-year-old cars: this compared with 8.0 breakdowns per 1,000 cars for four-year old [[Volkswagen Polo]]s and 15.3 for six-year-old Polos.<ref name= ADACMotorWelt199605>{{Cite journal|authorlink=Gerhard Michl (Alfons Kifmann - Ed)|title=Pleiten, Pfusch und Pannen|journal=ADAC Motorwelt|volume=|pages=pages 38<U+2013>48|month=May | year=1996}}).</ref> (The class loser was the [[Fiat Uno]] with 20.7 breakdowns per 1,000 for four-year-old cars and 37.3 for six-year-old Unos.<ref name=ADACMotorWelt199605/>{{-}}

===Micra K11 (1992<U+2013>1997)===
The second-generation K11 was built and launched in Japan in early 1992, and released in Europe in the fourth quarter of the year. It was powered by brand new all-aluminium 1.0&nbsp;L ([[Nissan CG engine#CG10DE|CG10DE]]) and 1.3&nbsp;L ([[Nissan CG engine#CG13DE|CG13DE]]) [[Overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve|16 valve]] engines, with 55&nbsp;PS [[Din|DIN]] (40&nbsp;kW/54&nbsp;hp) and 75&nbsp;PS (55&nbsp;kW/75&nbsp;bhp) respectively (higher outputs in Japan), both with ECCS (Electronic Concentrated Control System) fuel injection. [[Power steering]] was an option on some models, and the equipment list included security features not usually available in this market segment: a toughened safety-cage and side-impact door beams were standard and pre-tensioning seat-belts and a driver's air-bag were optional. However, the MK2 Micra scored only a modest two stars in Euro NCAP testing in 1997.<ref name="euroncap">{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/nissan_micra_1997/9.aspx|title=Euro NCAP: Micra K11 safety test}}</ref> [[Airbag]]s, [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock brakes]], electric windows, central locking and air conditioning were available as options on some of the Micra range as it developed in its life cycle. The car soon won the [[European Car of the Year]] award for 1993 (the first Japanese car to do so) and the [[Good Design Award]] (a Trade and Industry Design award in Japan) along with the [[Car of the Year Japan]] award in 1993. This would spawn the V3 Award edition.

After minor changes in 1996, in 1998, six years after its launch, the Micra received a facelift which saw the whole range get power steering as standard. This also saw the introduction of the [[Peugeot]]-sourced 1.5&nbsp;L [[PSA TU engine#TUD|TUD5]] Diesel engine into the Western European range.

In 1999, [[Renault]] bought a 36% stake in Nissan, and in 2000 there was talk of moving production of the Micra to Flins, near [[Paris]]. However, the UK government prevented this by making a <U+00A3>40 million grant that was approved by the European Commission in January 2001. The Micra's next incarnation was also made in Britain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1136490.stm|title=BBC News: From Datsun to Nissan | date=2001-01-25}}</ref>

There was a Cabriolet (FHK11) unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, but it was not sold until August 1997, with an electric top. These were produced in limited numbers for the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) only. However, much like the Nissan Figaro, some have been imported into the UK unofficially. There was also an estate version called the Box (WK11), which was unveiled on November 1999, with a double folding rear seat, along with an automatic transmission [[four-wheel drive]] model.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Micra K11C (1997<U+2013>2003)===
In late 1997, a Facelift version was introduced, and were built from late 1997-early 2003.

The cumulative visual changes from the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round side repeater indicators, minor changes to internal controls, slightly desaturated colours on the rear light lenses, a redesigned rear wiper which rests horizontally instead of vertically, the centre high level brake lamp being reduced in size and mounted at the top of the rear window, instead of on the parcel shelf, and a radio aerial repositioned from the top of the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof towards the rear.

In late 2000, the original facelift was replaced by a second facelift version, technically being quite similar. Changes if the second facelift include new lights added on the bumper, the lower-body of the car was changed, front side lights were coloured orange instead, and a major change is that the inside of the car was completely re-designed.

By the time of late 2002, the new K12 was introduced and started to be built, although the K11C models were still being built at the same time. This means that both K11C and K12 models were being built in late 2002. The K11C models were fully replaced by K12 in early 2003.

===Micra K12 (2002<U+2013>2007)===
The next version of the Micra, the K12, was unveiled in 2002 Paris Motor Show as the Nissan mm Concept. It was introduced to the Japanese market in early 2002 and to Europe in late 2002. The car was radically redesigned: it featured a new, 70&nbsp;mm longer wheelbase (developed with Renault) and an even more curvy exterior that was taller and slightly wider. Its most distinctive feature was a pair of prominent headlamps that extended to the wing-tops. Other additions included a sliding rear seat and the option of [[Advanced Key|keyless ignition]] on higher specification models.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2002/12/20/emfnis21.xml|title=Telegraph.co.uk: Cupid raids the car park | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Hudson | date=2002-12-21}}</ref> The range of engines included improved 1.2 ([[Nissan CR engine|CR12DE]]) and 1.4 ([[Nissan CR engine|CR14DE]]) petrol models, and a Renault-sourced 1.5 diesel unit (K9K). The automatic [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission of the previous model was replaced by a conventional [[automatic transmission]].
[[File:Nissan-March rafeet-k12 2005-front.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Nissan Micra Rafeet]]

The K12 was well received by the motor industry and set a new standard for the superminis that followed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cars.yahoo.com/car-reviews/car-and-driving/nissan-micra-2004925.html|title=Yahoo! Cars: Nissan Micra (2003 to date)}}</ref><ref name="parkers">{{cite web| url=http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/reviews/Review.aspx?model=584|title=Parker's: Nissan Micra Hatchback (03 on)}}</ref>

In 2005, Nissan Europe released a performance model of the K12. Dubbed the '''160 SR''', it was released as a direct competitor to the [[Opel Corsa]] OPC, [[Ford Fiesta]] Zetec-S and the [[Citro<U+00EB>n C2]] GT,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} with a 1.6&nbsp;L [[Nissan HR engine|HR16DE]] engine, giving 113&nbsp;PS (83&nbsp;kW/111&nbsp;hp) and uprated sports suspension. In 2006, Nissan renamed the 160 SR to the '''Sport SR''' in line with name changes across the board for the K12. However, this rebranding was short-lived: the performance model reverted to the 160 SR name in late 2007.<ref name="range">{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.uk/home/vehicles/passenger/K12/index.html?ln=/en_GB|title=Nissan UK: Micra}}</ref>

The launch of the 160 SR coincided with a revision of the K12. The radiator grilles were given a chrome strip through the centre and the original amber indicators were replaced with clear ones. The rear bumper was restyled and made more robust (apparently in response to French parking habits). The interior was also given a makeover, with more supportive seats, thicker glass and better soundproofing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/57771/now_micra_gets_a_new_face.html|title=Auto Express: Now Micra gets a new face}}</ref>

There were originally six trim levels of the K12, but in 2006 they were simplified to just three: Initia, Spirita and Sport. In addition, the launch line-up of six engines was reduced to the most popular four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.testdriven.co.uk/news.cfm/nissan-micra-110ps-sport-sr|title=TestDriven.co.uk: Nissan Micra 110PS Sport SR}}</ref>

[[Autech]], a Nissan-owned company, unveiled alternative models called the '''Bolero''' and the '''Rafeet'''. The Bolero, like Autech's versions of the K11, has the usual retro front end (which with the standard Micra headlights makes the car resemble the [[Lancia Ypsilon]]); the Rafeet has a more modern approach, resembling a [[BMW MINI]], with either a black or white leather interior,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autech.jp/SV/MARCHRAFEET/index.html|title=Autech: Micra Rafeet}}</ref> whereas the Bolero has partial wood panelling and exclusive seating.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autech.jp/SV/MARCHBOLERO/index.html|title=Autech: March Bolero}}</ref>

In 2003, Nissan UK, inspired by the [[Andros Trophy]] K11, unveiled the '''Micra-R''', a one-off mid-engined K12. Shown at the [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]] without running gear and engine, being only a display car, it was later given the go-ahead and Nissan commissioned [[Ray Mallock Ltd.|Ray Mallock Ltd]] to insert a mid mounted [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]]-derived [[Nissan Primera|Primera]] [[Nissan QG engine|QG20DE]] engine for show and press demonstration purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/41087/nissan_micra_r.html|title=Auto Express: Nissan Micra R}}</ref> In 2005, Nissan UK decided to replace the Primera engine with a [[Nissan VQ engine|VQ35DE]] from a [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] with a modified [[Nissan Altima|Altima SE-R]] gearbox for user-friendliness on the road. This model was baptized '''350SR''', although it was not offered for sale. It was taken on to ''[[Evo (magazine)|EVO]]'' magazine's "fast fleet" for a period of time where it became a favourite of many of the writers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evolongtermtests/210169/nissan_micra_350sr.html|title=EVO: Nissan Micra 350SR}}</ref> Other modifications to this car include a vented rear arch and a set of [[Rays Engineering]] wheels. To date, Nissan has no plans to put this model into production.

===Micra C+C===
[[File:Nissan Micra CC 004.jpg|thumb|left|Micra C+C]]

June 15, 2005, the K12 chassis spawned the [[Retractable hardtop|coup<U+00E9> convertible]] model called the ''' [[:ja:<U+65E5><U+7523><U+30FB><U+30DE><U+30A4><U+30AF><U+30E9>C+C|Nissan Micra C+C]]'''. It was designed at the new London-based Nissan Design Europe studio, developed at the Nissan Technical Centre Europe at [[Cranfield]], [[Bedfordshire]] and built, as with its predecessor, at the [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] plant. It is built as a modern interpretation of the 1991 Micra based [[Nissan Figaro]] with a convertible hardtop instead of the canvass top the Figaro had. The electric folding glass roof is made by [[Karmann]] coachworks and has a 2+2 seating layout. The car is powered by an 1.4 or 1.6&nbsp;L gasoline engine, or a 1.5 L diesel available on European versions only.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/57634/new_micra_is_a_touch_of_glass.html|title= Auto Express: New Micra is a touch of glass}}</ref> It was originally available only in Europe but sales in Japan began Micra 2007 after the introduction at the Tokyo Auto Show.

The first sketches of the latest generation Nissan Micra were unveiled on 1 October 2009, referred to as '''W02A''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Nissan-Micra-2010-first-design-sketches/|title=Car Magazine: Nissan Micra (2010) first design sketches}}</ref> later referred to in Nissan press releases as '''K13'''.<ref name="AllNewMicra">{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.th/en/web/news/news_7702.htm|title=Nissan Thailand: All New Nissan Micra 12 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="NISMO">{{cite web|url= http://www.nissan.co.jp/OPTIONAL-PARTS/NISMO/MARCH/K13/index.html|title=NISMO Japan K13 optional parts}}</ref> Nissan has stated that the model will be built in five countries, but only four are confirmed so far: Thailand for the Japanese, Hong Kong, Macau, South-East Asian and Australian markets; India for the Indian, European, Middle Eastern and African markets; China for the Mainland China market; Mexico for Mexican, Central American, South American and Caribbean markets.<ref name=AP100717>{{Cite news|url=http://www.owh.com/article/20100717/MONEY/707179899/100323 |title=Japanese automakers move production |date=2010-07-17 |publisher=AP via Omaha World-Herald }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_nissan-s-made-in-india-car-next-year_1285745|title=dnaindia.com: Nissan's Made-in-India car next year}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.uk/GB/en/vehicles/city-cars/new_micra/REVIEWS.html#vehicles/city-cars/new_micra/REVIEWS/AUTOCAR|title=Nissan UK: New Micra Reviews}}</ref> Nissan launched the new Nissan Micra globally on 2 March 2010 at the 80th Geneva Auto Show in Switzerland.

The new Idling Stop System is reported to improve fuel economy by 2.0&nbsp;km/L. It features variable control of voltage for power generation with alternator (including regenerative charging function with braking energy). Micra's coefficient of drag is just 0.32 achieved in part by the sleek roofline, with a raised rear end, which optimally adjusts airflow to the rear sides and other elements of the body designed to reduce air resistance such as door mirrors, a large front spoiler and the underbody configuration. A lightweight roof panel helps to keep weight to {{convert|915|kg|abbr=on}}. The car was designed to appeal to a unisex crowd, yet look stylish and elegant to face the tough competition. Micra's new-generation Xtronic CVT features a new structure combining a belt-operated CVT with an auxiliary two-speed transmission. The CVT raises the transmission ratio by more than 20% compared to other CVTs in its class, providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness during high-speed driving. With the auxiliary transmission, the size and weight of the CVT unit is significantly reduced. Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class, achieved by the increased transmission ratio, reduced pulley size and weight, and reduced oil agitating resistance <U+2014> helping improve fuel economy. An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with Idling Stop. Quicker oil pressure response improves startup performance and thus contributes to an improvement in fuel economy. While Idling Stop is in operation, pulley rotation is temporarily locked inside the CVT and is slowly unlocked when the engine starts again. This prevents reverse movement during a hill start and enables smooth startup.

On 10 February 2010, Nissan announced that the [[Nissan Juke]] will go into production following its appearance as the Quazana [[concept vehicle|concept car]] at the 2009 [[Geneva Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Nissan-Qazana-concept-car-2010-first-photos-110209/|title=Car Magazine: Nissan Qazana concept car (2010)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissanpress.co.uk/press_site/releases/arc_2010/59747nis.htm|title=Nissan Press: Nissan Juke unveiled ahead of Geneva public debut}}</ref>

===Versa===
{{For|the first-generation Versa|Nissan Tiida}}
The second generation Versa was unveiled at the 2011 [[New York Auto Show]]. Instead of being based on the Tiida, it will now be a badge engineered version of the new Micra sedan and possibly the Micra hatchback. The US-spec model unveiled at the motorshow was the new March/Micra sedan previously shown in December 2010 in China, which is now known as the [[Nissan Sunny]] although it is very similar to the March/Micra hatchback. It continues to compete with the likes of other entry-level sedans such as the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Chevrolet Aveo]], [[Hyundai Accent]], and [[Toyota Yaris]] in terms of price and features. However, its overall dimensions inside and out are now more competitive with the likes of the [[Ford Focus]], [[Chevrolet Cruze]], [[Hyundai Elantra]], [[Honda Civic]], and [[Toyota Corolla]]. The second generation Versa is powered by a 1.6-litre petrol that delivers around 80&nbsp;kW (109&nbsp;hp) and 145 Nm (107&nbsp;lb-ft) of torque. The new model weighs less and has gained more legroom compared to its predecessor. In the US prices start at $10,990, higher spec models include [[Bluetooth]], navigation system with 5-inch touch-screen display, Satellite Radio and an iPod<U+00AE>/USB interface.<ref>[http://www.caradvice.com.au/115818/2012-nissan-tiida-unveiled-in-new-york/ Car Advice], 2012 Nissan Tiida Unveiled in New York.</ref> It is said to be the cheapest car in the U.S.  The fuel economy is estimated to be 30 mpg city and 38 mpg highway with the CVT-equipped Versa sedan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.insideline.com/nissan/versa/2012/2012-nissan-versa-sedan-debuts-2011-new-york-auto-show.html | title= 2012 Nissan Versa Sedan Debuts: 2011 New York Auto Show |date=2011-04-20 |author=Anita Lienert |publisher=InsideLine}}</ref> A hatchback version will debut one year later for the 2013 model year.

===Safety===
EuroNCAP tested this model of the Nissan Micra as a standard equipment LHD, 5-door hatchback, registered in 2010. They scored it accordingly:
* Overall {{rating|4|5}}
* Adult Occupant {{percentage|84|100}}, 30 points.
* Child Occupant {{percentage|79|100}}, 39 points.
* Pedestrian {{percentage|58|100}}, 21 points.
* Safety Assist {{percentage|57|100}}, 4 points.

The Micra scored well in the test and received 4 stars from a possible 5, although the car was penalised for "loading the dummy in an unrealistic way" and increasing chest damage to the driver and passenger. Despite this the results were decent for a hatchback and the car offers good protection for side and front end impacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/results/nissan/micra/2010/413.aspx |title=Nissan Micra &#124; Euro NCAP - For safer cars crash test safety rating |publisher=Euro NCAP |date= |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref>

==Nissan Micra/March by country==
===Australia===
The UK-built Micra K11 was briefly exported to the [[Australia]]n market beginning in 1995 with a three model line up, base 3-door LX, 5-door SLX and 3-door Super S (of which only 303 were ever sold in Australia and demand a hefty price premium over the other models). Class leading performance, a surprisingly dynamic chassis with well sorted suspension, roomy interior and above average build quality were the Micra's strengths in comparison to its Korean competitors like the [[Hyundai Excel]], [[Daewoo Cielo]] and [[Ford Festiva]]. A poor exchange rate between the UK and Australia meant the Micra's pricing was rather steep and Australian buyers saw the cheaper Koreans and more established Japanese-sourced superminis, such as the [[Suzuki Swift]] and [[Daihatsu Charade]], as offering better value for money. Also, the Micra received the lowest possible rating (one star) in Australian crash tests. The Micra was dropped from Nissan Australia's line-up in 1997.

Nissan re-introduced the Micra to Australia in 2007,<ref>[http://www.nissan.com.au/news_pdfs/20070302_Micra.pdf Nissan Micra to enter Australia's light car Market] (2007-03-02)- Retrieved 2007-27-11</ref> being sold only as a 5-door hatchback, and coming from Japan and not the UK.

===Canada===
[[File:Nissan Micra K10 Canada (1).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Canadian version of the Micra K10]]
In Canada, the K10-J was sold and branded as the Nissan Micra. It came standard with the larger MA12S inline 4 cylinder OHC 1.2&nbsp;L (1235&nbsp;cc) engine. The Nissan Micra was finally discontinued in Canada in 1991, replaced by the [[Nissan Sentra|Nissan Sentra Classic]], but many K10s are still running on Canadian roads today.

Nissan would return to selling [[subcompact car]]s in [[Canada]] after 2007, when the [[Compact car|compact]] [[Nissan Tiida|Versa]] was added to the lineup.

===China===
In China, Dongfeng Nissan released the Micra K13 on August 30, 2010.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/100915-01-e.html |title=ALL NEW NISSAN MARCH/MICRA OUTPERFORMS |date=2010-09-15 |work=Nissan Global }}</ref> Four trims with 1.5-liter engines (HR15DE) are available, priced between 69,900 and 92,900 yuan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2010/08/dongfeng-nissan-releases-the-fourth-generation-march/|title=

===India===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in India.

Nissan Micra is available in [[India]] with four petrol and two diesel variants. The four petrol variants of Nissan Micra are: Nissan Micra XE, Nissan Micra XE Plus, Nissan Micra XL and Nissan Micra XV. All the four variants are powered by the 1.2&nbsp;L, 1198&nbsp;cc, petrol engine with five-speed manual transmission that delivers {{Convert|76|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} of maximum power at 6000&nbsp;rpmwith {{convert|104|Nm|lb<U+00B7>ft|abbr=on}} of maximum torque at 4000 rpm. These variants are differed from each other by the interior comfort, luxury and safety features. Notable feature includes a standard [[air bag]] across the range although [[ABS]] is available only on the top variant.

The diesel variants of Nissan Micra are Nissan Micra Diesel XV and Nissan Micra Diesel XV Premium. The Nissan Micra diesel is loaded with a 1.5 litre, 4 cylinder, 8 valve, SOHC, 1461&nbsp;cc, common rail powertrain that is capable of developing maximum power of 64 PS at 4000&nbsp;rpmand 160&nbsp;nm of highest torque at 2000&nbsp;rpmwith the same 5 speed manual gearbox.

===Japan===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Japan.

====K11====
Like the K10, the K11 spawned numerous spin-offs, which were all sold only in Japan. In April 1994, the '''V3 Award''' edition was released to commemorate the three awards the car won in the first year of production, based on the C# with a coloured roof spoiler. It came with a special commemorative tachometer and sticker. There was a specially retro facelifted model called '''Tango''' in June 1996, based on the F and A# model, and the '''Collet''' was unveiled in October 1996 to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Micra in Japan, with central locking. Initially sold for five months, this became a regular model soon after. In October 1997, another facelifted 5-door model called the '''Bolero''' made its appearance, with a round headlight and a large grille, resembling a classic British saloon of the 1960s. The '''Juke''' (December 1997), '''Rumba''' (November 1998) and '''Polka''' (December 2000) kept the retro theme alive, all of them with slight variations. In April 2001, there was a '''Muji 1000''' edition, which was sold through the [[MUJI]] website. The car came with an exclusive one piece grille and unpainted bumpers and wing mirrors. Like the Box estate car, this version had a double folding seat. The car was only available in white and production was limited to 1000 units. At the same time, there was a Collet F, a 20th anniversary model. Most of these spin-offs were produced by [[Autech]].

In Japan, several speciality companies modified the Micra K11, often catering to the vogue for "classic" styling:
*[[Mitsuoka]] made a latterday interpretation of the 1960s [[Jaguar Mark 2|Mark II Jaguar]] called the [[Mitsuoka Viewt|Viewt]]. Launched in 1995, this car is regarded as a luxury model compared with the other Micras: it was only made as a four-door saloon or two-door convertible, with wooden interior panelling, leather interior and chrome plating available.
*Companies such as Copel, Mooku and Lotas produced Micras modified to resemble the Vanden Plas Princess 1100. The extent of the modifications ranged from circular headlamps and a chrome grille in the case of the Copel Ministar, to a remodelled bootlid and new rear lights on the Copel Bonito. Mooku also modified the Micra Box.

====K12====
While Nissan Europe had the 160 SR, in Japan the 5-door only Micra K12 was available with the '''12 SR''' and '''15 SR-A''' versions, the first one with a tuned 1.2&nbsp;L CR12DE engine giving 110&nbsp;PS (81&nbsp;kW/108&nbsp;hp). It is equipped with an exclusive [[HKS Co., Ltd.|HKS]] exhaust and has a set of 15x6 wheels on a 185/55R15 81V [[Bridgestone]] RE-01R tyres.

From 2005 in Japan, 3-door models on the Micra K12 and the CR10DE were dropped from the range, the CR14DE was only used for 4WD models, and the HR15DE was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carview.co.jp/catalog/NISSAN/MARCH/2005/spec/|title=carview.co.jp Specifications 2005 Nissan Micra}}</ref>

====K13====
The K13 Micra was Launched in Japan on 13 July 2010 with models 12S, 12X, 12G, 12X FOUR and 12G FOUR. Price range 999,600 yen to 1,644,300 yen, including consumption tax.<ref name="AllNewMarch">{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/100713-01-e.html?rss|title=Nissan Global: All New March 13July2010}}</ref> Nissan announced as of June 25, 2010, it received a total of 12,147 sales order of Micra in Japan in less than two weeks after initial sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUKTOE66P06L20100726|title=Nissan: Japan orders for new March shatter target|author=Chang-Ran Kim |date=2010-07-26|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref> Nissan is one of the first major Japanese automakers to shift production of a popular vehicle abroad and import the vehicle for sale in Japan, called gyaku yunyu or "reverse imports."<ref name=AP100717/>

===Mexico===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Mexico.

The Nissan Micra K13 is called the Nissan March in Mexico and went on sale in late March 2011, it began production at the Aguascalientes plant in early March. The Nissan March is sold in 4 trim levels: Drive, Sense, Advance and SR. The base Drive trim level does not have air conditioning and rear window wipers and has black mirrors; this trim level also lacks a radio and comes with 14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers. The Sense trim level adds air conditioning, Mp3 radio player, colour coded mirrors and a rear window wiper. This model also comes with 14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers. The Advance trim level adds 15-inch alloy wheels an optional 4-speed CVT transmission and also adds 2 front airbags for the driver and passenger. The SR trim adds side skirts and a rear spoiler for a more sporty appearance and has the same alloy wheels only with a darker color. All trim levels come standard with a 5-speed manual transmission and with the 1.6-litre engine with 106&nbsp;hp.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], where the car has been sold since February 1995, the K11 Micra is still sold with an entirely facelifted and improved version called the '''Super Micra'''. It has a digital instrument cluster, LED rear light clusters, indicators built-in to the side mirrors and a facelifted front end with modern crystal headlights. It also comes with a semi leather interior with rear headrests. The car still retains the original CG13DE engine.

===Thailand===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Thailand.

In Thailand, the Micra K13 was launched at the Bangkok motor show on 26 March 2010, priced from 375,000 [[Thai baht|baht]] ($11,600) to 537,000 baht.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paultan.org/2010/03/15/nissan-starts-march-production-in-thailand/ |title=Nissan starts Micra production in Thailand |date=2010-03-15 |work=Paultan.org }}</ref> By early July 2010, the company has received about 8,000 sales order and said new buyers would have to wait for five months. The company expects to produce 90,000 units in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-06/nissan-s-waiting-list-swells-in-bangkok-as-demand-overwhelms-car-factories.html |title=Nissan's Waiting List Swells in Bangkok as Car Demand Surges |date=2010-07-07 |author=Liza Lin |publisher=bloomberg}}</ref>

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Micra K11 was a popular car. The trim levels were aligned with [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]] rather than the [[United Kingdom]]. However, there was no diesel option.

===UK===
From 1992 until July 2010 over two million Micras were built in the [[UK]] at the [[NMUK]] plant in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]].<ref name="nissanpress.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.nissanpress.co.uk/press_site/releases/arc_2010/61192nis.htm|title=Nissan Press office: Press release on Micra ceasing production}}</ref>

====K10====
The Micra K10 first went on sale the [[United Kingdom|UK]] over the summer of 1983, and it was an instant sales success. In its best year, 1990, it was the eleventh most popular new car in the UK with just under 50,000 sales. It was a popular choice with driving instructors and undemanding motorists thanks to its ease of driving, solid build and durable mechanical components. 343,411 were sold in nearly a decade. As recently as early 2007, almost 15 years after the last examples were sold, 96,421 examples were still reported to be in circulation,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/nissan-micra-443911.html|title=www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/nissan-micra-443911.html<!--INSERT TITLE--> | location=London | work=The Independent|date=2007-04-10}}</ref> and four years on, as the 20th anniversary of its demise approaches, the number remaining on Britain's roads is likely to be still well into five figures. It compares particularly well to many other popular small cars in Britain of its era, particularly the British-built [[Austin Metro]] and [[Italy|Italian]] [[Fiat Uno]].

In the U.K., Micra K10 became the eleventh best selling new car in 1990 with almost 50,000 units sold.

====K11====
The second incarnation of the Micra, the K11, was launched in the UK at the end of 1992, with production taking place in Britain at the [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] plant rather than in [[Japan]]. Like its predecessor, it was a very popular car thanks to its quality, ease of driving and fuel economy. However, it was available with a limited range of engines: 1.0 and 1.3 petrol units. A facelift over the summer of 2000 saw the 1.3 shelved and replaced with a 1.4 unit. This upgrade, after a previous makeover in 1998, enhanced the Micra's appeal and it was still fairly popular on the launch of its successor in December 2002.

The Micra K11 (as it is known in Europe), was the second model after the [[Nissan Primera|Primera]] built in Nissan's [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd|NMUK]] plant in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]].

In 1998, the [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]],  plant produced its millionth Micra, becoming the first Japanese manufacturer in Europe to achieve the milestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissanpress.co.uk/nissan/corporate/manufacturing_gb_ltd.htm|title=Nissan Press: NMUK History}}</ref>

====K12====
Like the previous version of the Micra, the third generation model, the K12, was made at the [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] plant. It had a wider range of engines, including [[Renault|Renault-sourced]] 1.2 petrol and 1.5 direct-injection diesel powerplants, and offered an improved driving experience. Its chassis would form the basis of the next [[Renault Clio]], launched in 2005 but still built in [[France]]. This stylish, all-new Micra helped Nissan bolster its market share of the supermini sector, which had been declining in the final year or two of its predecessor's life. Although it has never featured in the [[SMMT|SMMT's]] official top 10 best-selling cars in the UK, it has been among the best-selling 10 cars in Britain among private buyers for virtually all of its production life.

In 2003, the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' programme featured a segment on cars that gave value for money, highlighting specification that could be purchased for <U+00A3>9,000. The Micra K12 was selected and tested by presenter [[Richard Hammond]], who gave it a positive review. This was despite comparing its qualities to those of a [[Boeing 737]], concluding that the Micra "had all the toys".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode8.shtml|title=BBC ''Top Gear'': Series 3, Episode 8 (21 December 2003)}}</ref> However, when Hammond tested the Micra C+C in 2006, he was less than enthusiastic. This was because his model was coloured pink and as a result, he spent most of the segment driving it with a paper bag over his head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series8episode1.shtml|title=BBC ''Top Gear'': Series 8, Episode 1 (7 May 2006)}}</ref>

The pink C+C was one of only five, made specifically for Nissan's sponsorship of the C+C TLC Tour in 2005<U+2013>06, in support of the [[Breakthrough Breast Cancer]] charity.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/you_can_help/whats_new/nissan_micra.html|title=Breakthrough: Nissan Micra goes topless in support of Breakthrough}}</ref> Such was the public's response that Nissan subsequently announced the launch of the Micra C+C Pink, limited to 100 models.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.testdriven.co.uk/news.cfm/nissan-micra-cc-pink|title=TestDriven.co.uk: Nissan Micra C+C Pink}}</ref> These quickly sold out and another production run was announced in August 2006, this time limited to 175 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/4189/5213/nissan-micra-cc-pink-edition.phtml|title=Pocket-lint.co.uk: Nissan goes pretty with the Micra C+C Pink edition}}</ref>

In July 2004, Nissan announced that a Coral Blue K12 Micra had become NMUK's one millionth car for the UK market, and that its [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]], plant had produced over 250,000 K12s since the model's launch, for sale in up to 45 markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissanpress.co.uk/nissan/releases/arc_2004/36034nis.htm|title=Nissan Press: Nissan produces millionth UK car}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}

In August 2006, the K10 was still receiving credit for its impressive durability. An ''[[Auto Express]]'' survey revealed that of the 340,000 K10 Micras registered in the UK between 1983 and 1992, 96,000 were still on the road<U+2014>nearly 30%, an impressive figure for a car which had been out of production for 14 years. This gave it a far higher rating than the [[Fiat Uno]] and the [[Austin Metro]], both of which had dwindled away to less than 3%.

In 2007, with the Micra K12C, the model grades were brought into line with the rest of the Nissan UK range, namely Visia, Acenta, Tekna, 160 SR and Active Luxury.<ref name="range"/>

The Micra C+C convertible was available in Visia, Acenta, Tekna and Active Luxury grades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.uk/home/vehicles/passenger/K12F/index.html?ln=/en_GB|title=Nissan UK: Micra C+C}}</ref> However, the 1.6 litre engine is available for all models, save the Visia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.uk/home/vehicles/passenger/K12F/grades-and-specs/index.html?ln=/en_GB|title=Nissan UK: Micra C+C grades and specifications}}</ref>

====End of production in UK====
Micra production ceased at the [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] plant as of 16 July 2010 ending a 18 year run of Micra's at the plant. 2,368,704 Micra's were built.<ref name="nissanpress.co.uk"/>

The Micra will no longer be built at the [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd|NMUK]] plant in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]], UK, which will instead manufacture an entirely new model that will compete in the same market segment as the Micra.<ref name='bbcnews1'>{{Cite news|title=Car plant bags new Nissan model|date=2008-06-03|publisher=BBC|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7432924.stm |work=BBC News Online|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref>

==Reputation and popularity==
The K10/K11 generations of Micra were known for reliability, excellent build quality, and user friendliness. The K12 model has received consistently good reviews, with the main criticisms being the lack of head room and luggage space in the rear.<ref name="parkers"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.topgear.com/drives/D0/A0/new/|title=Top Gear: Nissan Micra new car review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/roadtests/39658/nissan_micra.html|title =Auto Express: Nissan Micra review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-review/nissan-micra-hatchback/556/|title=What Car: Nissan Micra review}}</ref>

There are numerous tuning parts available for the car. Engine transplants are not new for the Micra, as many owners with mechanical skills have installed the [[SR20DE]] and more commonly, the [[GA16DE]] into their K11s. Turbocharger kits are a popular choice for the K11 and K12s.

The [[insurance]] company [[Folksam]] rated it as a dangerous car in case of crash for the years 1988<U+2013>1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folksam.se/english/reports|title=Folksam: Report ''How safe is your car?'' (PDF file)}}</ref> However, safety specification has improved with successive models. The Micra's [[Euro NCAP]] ratings are two stars for the K11<ref name="euroncap"/> and four for the K12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/nissan_micra_2003/165.aspx|title=Euro NCAP: Micra K12 safety test}}</ref>

The K12 Micra came top of its class in ''[[What Car?]]'' magazine's Security Supertest in 2003, passing both entry and driveaway tests and achieving a maximum score for its locking system and immobiliser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compucars.co.uk/news/Nissan/338.html|title=Compucars: Nissan Micra tops supermini security test}}</ref>

In 2005, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] motor insurance research expert [http://www.thatcham.org/home.jsp?ugid=2 Thatcham] introduced a standard for keyless go, requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more than 10&nbsp;cm from the vehicle. In an independent test, the Micra was found to be the most secure, while certain BMW and Mercedes models failed, being theoretically capable of allowing cars to be driven away while their owners were refuelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/58364/micras_top_of_the_fobs.html|title=Auto Express: Micra's Top of the Fobs}}</ref>

In ''What Car?'''s Reliability Supertest in 2007, Nissan was ranked 6th out of 26 manufacturers overall, with the K11 Micra (1998<U+2013>2002) being its most reliable model.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whatcar.com/news-special-report.aspx?NA=229285&EL=3223738|title=''What Car?'': Reliability Supertest 2007}}</ref>

==Micra in motorsports==
Nissan first entered the Micra in [[Auto racing|motorsports]] with the March Superturbo R. Introduced in 1987, this rare pre-facelift K10 weighed in at 740&nbsp;kg (1630&nbsp;lb) with half interior, roll cage and tool kit. It was built for the new sub-1600&nbsp;cc [[Group A]] class, and shortly after in 1988 Nissan released the March Superturbo as a road car.

While the March was a favourite with the drivers in the Japanese Rally Championship, veteran Swedish rally driver [[Per Eklund]] finished the 1988 [[Rally GB|RAC Rally]] in 21st position and the 1989 [[Acropolis Rally Greece]] in 10th place.

During the K11's production life, there was a series of national rally championship trophies held all over Europe called the '''Micra Challenge'''. This was intended as a cheap introduction to rallying, as the cars all had identical 1.3&nbsp;L race-prepared engines. The UK series ran between 1995 and 1999. This model is still used in club and national rallies. In France, the 1.3&nbsp;L model was used as the basis for a circuit racing one-make cup for celebrity drivers, the Nissan Stars Cup. In Portugal, the Micra spawned a one-make trophy alongside the National Rally Championship for Beginners.

In the late 1990s, a K11 was adapted into a [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ30DE|VQ30]] mid-engined 4WD configuration to race in the [[Troph<U+00E9>e Andros]], the French [[ice racing]] series. Drivers who raced this car include [[<U+00C9>rik Comas]], [[Philippe Gache]], [[St<U+00E9>phane Peterhansel]] and [[Emmanuel Collard]].

Nissan sponsors a one-make series in Japan called the '''March Cup''', which has been running since the introduction of the K10. Usually a [[Super GT|JGTC]] support race, it is held in two separate five-round championships called West Japan Series and East Japan Series, and a ladies series running simultaneously. At the end of the season, the best performing cars from both sides meet up for the Champions Cup final at the end the season.

==Scale models==
[[Fujimi]] makes 1/24 scale [[model car|plastic model kits]] of a 3-door K11 and 5-door K12, in several different versions. [[Kyosho]] also makes a 5-door K12, as a 1/43 scale diecast in both left- and right-hand drive versions. [[Bandai]] makes 1/24 or 1/43 etc. plastic model kits and diecast model kits Nissan Be-1, while Norev makes a 1:43-scale Micra C+C 1.6, complete with folding roof.
