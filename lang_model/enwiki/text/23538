'''Khwarezm''' {{IPAc-en|k|w|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|r|<U+025B>|z|<U+0259>|m}}<!--Foreign language names moved to "Names and Etymology" below--> or '''Chorasmia''' {{IPAc-en|k|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|r|<U+00E6>|z|m|i|<U+0259>}} (Persian:<U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631><U+0632><U+0645>) is a large [[oasis]] region on the [[Amu Darya]] [[river delta]] in western [[Central Asia]], bordered on the north by the (former) [[Aral Sea]], on the east by the [[Kyzyl Kum|Kyzylkum desert]], on the south by the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum desert]], and on the west by the [[Ustyurt Plateau]]. It was the center of the (indigenous) Khwarezmian civilization and a series of kingdoms, whose capitals were (among others) [[Kath (city)|Kath]], [[Gurganj]] (the modern [[K<U+00F6>ne<U+00FC>rgen<U+00E7>]]) and, from the 16th century on, [[Khiva]]. Today Khwarezm belongs partly to [[Uzbekistan]], partly to [[Kazakhstan]] and partly to [[Turkmenistan]].

==Names and etymology==

Khwarezm has been known also as '''Chorasmia''', '''Khwarezmia''', '''Khwarizm''', '''Khwarazm''', '''Khorezm''', '''Khoresm''', '''Khorasam''', '''Harezm''', '''Horezm''',  and '''Chorezm'''.<ref name="iranica.com">[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chorasmia-index Encyclopedia Iranica, Chorasmia, Yuri Aleksandrovich Rapoport]</ref>

In [[Avestan]] the name is ''Xvairizem'', in [[Old Persian]] ''Huwarazmish'', in [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] ''<U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631><U+0632><U+0645>'' (Khw<U+0101>razm), in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] <U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631><U+0632><U+0645> ''Khw<U+0101>rizm'', in Old Chinese *q<U+02B0>alj<U+026F><U+0294>mri<U+0261>(<U+547C><U+4F3C><U+5BC6>), modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]]  ''Hu<U+0101>l<U+00E1>z<U+01D0>m<U+00F3>'' (<U+82B1><U+524C><U+5B50><U+6A21>), in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] ''<U+0425><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437><U+043C>'', in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] ''Xorazm'', in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] ''Horezm'', in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Harezm'', in Greek ''<U+03A7><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03AF><U+03B1>'' and  ''<U+03A7><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03BC><U+03B1>'', by Herodotus.

The Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in his ''Mu<U+02BF><U+01E7>am al-buldan'' wrote that the name was a compound (in Persian) of ''khwar'' ({{lang|fa|<U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631>}}), and ''razm'' ({{lang|fa|<U+0631><U+0632><U+0645>}}), referring to the abundance of cooked fish as a main diet of the peoples of this area.<ref>[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Mu'jem al-baladan]], Vol2, p395</ref>

[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] however, believes the Persian name to be made up of (<U+062E><U+0648><U+0631>) meaning "the sun" and (<U+0632><U+0645>) meaning "Earth", designating "the land from which the sun rises",<ref>C. E. Bosworth, ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol IV, 1978. p. 1061</ref> although the same etymology is also given for [[Greater_Khorasan#Name|Khurasan]]. Another view is that the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] compound stands for "lowland" from ''kh(w)ar'' "low" and ''zam'' "earth, land.".<ref name="iranica.com"/>  Khwarezm is indeed the lowest region in [[Central Asia]] (except for the [[Caspian Sea]] to the far west), located on the delta of the [[Amu Darya]] on the southern shores of the [[Aral Sea]]. Various forms of ''khwar/khar/khor/hor'' are commonly used also in the [[Persian Gulf]] to stand for tidal flats, marshland, or tidal bays (e.g., [[Khor Musa]], [[Khor Abdallah]], [[Hor al-Azim]], [[Hor al-Himar]], etc.)

The name also appears in [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions as ''Huvarazmish'', which is declared to be part of the [[Persian Empire]].

Some of the early scholars believed Khwarezm to be what ancient [[Avesta|Avestic]] texts refer to as [[Airyanem Vaejah]] ("Ariyaneh Waeje"; later [[Middle Persian]] ''Iran vij'').<ref>Bahram Farahvoshi. ''Iranovich'', Tehran University Press. 1991. p. 8</ref> These sources claim that [[Kunya Urgench|Old Urgench]], which was the capital of ancient Khwarezm for many years, was actually Ourva, the eighth land of [[Ahura Mazda]] mentioned in the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] text of [[Vendidad]].<ref>Musa Javan. Tarikh-i Ijtima'i Iran-i Bastan (''The social history of ancient Iran''), 1961. p. 24</ref> However, Michael Witzel, a researcher in early Indo-European history, believes that Airyanem Vaejah was located in what is now [[Afghanistan]], the northern areas of which were a part of ancient Khwarezm and [[Greater Khorasan]].<ref>[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf Michael Witzel. "The Home of the Aryans."] (.pdf)</ref> Others, however, disagree. [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] believes Khwarezm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the [[Avesta]]n people, and [[Dehkhoda]] calls Khwarezm "<U+0645><U+0647><U+062F> <U+0642><U+0648><U+0645> <U+0622><U+0631><U+06CC><U+0627>" ("the cradle of the [[Arya]]n tribe").<ref>[[Elton L.

[[Biruni]], a native speaker of [[Chorasmian language|Chorasmian]] (an Iranian language),<ref name="BosworthIranica" /><ref>L. Massignon, "Al-Biruni et la valuer internationale de la science arabe" in ''Al-Biruni Commemoration Volume'' (Calcutta, 1951), pp. 217<U+2013>219. excerpt: In a celebrated preface to the book of Drugs, [[Biruni]] says: "It is through the Arabic language that the sciences have been transmitted by means of translations from all parts of the world.  They have been enhanced by the translation into the Arabic language and have as a result insinuated themselves into men's hearts, and the beauty of this language has commingled with these sciences in our veins and arteries.  And if it is true that in all nations one likes to adorn oneself by using the language to which one has remained loyal, having become accustomed to using it with friends and companions according to need, I must judge for myself that in my '''native''' [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmian]], science has as much as chance of becoming perpetuated as a camel has of facing [[Kaaba]]."</ref><ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/> says that the land belonging to [[Afrasiab]] was first colonised 980 years before Alexander the Great, sc. before the Seleucid era, i.e. in 1292 B.C., when the hero of the Iranian epic ''[[Siyavash]]'' came to Khwarezm; his son [[Kay Khusraw]] was established on the throne 92 years later, in 1200 B.C. He starts giving names only with the [[Afrighid]] line of Khwarazmshahs, having placed the ascension of Afrighids in 616 of the Seleucid era, i.e. in 305 A.D.

==Early people==
Like Soghdiana, Khwarzem was an expansion of the [[BMAC]] culture during the [[Bronze Age]] which later fused with indo-Iranians during their migrations around 1000 BC. Early Iron Age states arose from this cultural exchange.  List of Successive cultures in Khwarzem region 3000-500 BC:<ref>{{cite web

=== Khwarezmian language and culture===
{{cleanup|reason=Khwarezmian = Chorasmian|date=July 2012}}
An [[Eastern Iranian languages|East Iranian]] language, known as [[Khwarezmian language]], was spoken in Khwarezm proper (i.e., the lower Amu Darya region) until soon after the Mongol invasion, when it was replaced by Turkic languages.<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f5/v5f5a015.html Encyclopedia Iranica, "The Chorasmian Language", D.N.Mackenzie]</ref><ref>Andrew Dalby, ''Dictionary of Languages: The definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', Columbia University Press, 2004, pg 278</ref><ref>MacKenzie, D.

The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks, in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes, and behind them the Chinese (see Kowalski; Minorsky, "Turan"). Turan thus became both an ethnic and a geographical term, but always containing ambiguities and contradictions, arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians."</ref><ref>C.E.

Translation:
:"The people of the Khwarezm were a branch from '''[[Persian peoples|Persian]]''' tree."

The area of Khwarezm was under [[Afrighid]] and then [[Samanid]] control until the 10th century before it was conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]].  The Iranian [[Chorasmian language]] and culture felt the pressure of Turkic infiltration from northern Khwarezm southwards, leading to the disappearance of the original Iranian character<ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/> of the province and its complete turkicisation today, but Khwarezmian speech<ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/> probably lasted in upper Khwarezm, the region round Haz<U+0101>rasp, till the end of the 8th/14th century.<ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/>

The [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Chorasmian language]] survived for several centuries after [[Islam]] until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for it is hard to see the commanding figure of [[Biruni]], a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum.<ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/>

==Achaemenid, Parthian and Sassanid era==
During the [[Achaemenid]] period, Khwarezm was governed by [[Smerdis of Persia|Smerdis/Bardiya]] along with [[Bactriana]], [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]], and the other eastern provinces of the empire.<ref>Huart, Clement.

When the king of Khwarezm offered friendship to [[Alexander the Great]] in 328 BC, Alexander's Greek and Roman biographers imagined the nomad king of a desert waste, but 20th-century Russian [[archeology|archeologists]] revealed the region as a stable and centralized kingdom, a land of agriculture to the east of the Aral Sea, surrounded by the nomads of [[Central Asia]], protected by its army of mailed horsemen, in the most powerful kingdom northwest of the [[Amu Darya]] (the [[Oxus]] River of antiquity). The king's emissary offered to lead Alexander's armies against his own enemies, west over the Caspian towards the [[Black Sea]] (e.g. [[Caucasian Iberia|Kingdom of Iberia]] and [[Colchis]]). Alexander politely refused.

Although largely independent during the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] and [[Seleucid]] dynasties, it is known that Khwarezm and neighboring Bactriana were part of the [[Sassanid]] empire during the time of [[Bahram II]]. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] verifies that Khwarezm was a regional capital of the Sassanid empire. When speaking of the pre-Islamic "Khosrau of Khwarezm" (<U+062E><U+0633><U+0631><U+0648> <U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631><U+0632><U+0645>), or post-Islamic "[[Amir]] of Khwarezm" (<U+0627><U+0645><U+06CC><U+0631> <U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631><U+0632><U+0645>), or even the [[Khwarezmid Empire]], sources such as [[Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] and others clearly refer to Khwarezm as being part of the ''Iranian'' (Persian) empire.<ref>[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun]].

ISBN 964-379-023-1. p.35</ref> The fact that [[Pahlavi script]] which was used by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[bureaucracy]] alongside [[Old Persian]], passed into use in Khwarezmia where it served as the first local [[alphabet]] about the [[Anno Domini|AD]] 2nd century, as well as evidence that [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezm-Shahs]] such as [[Ala ad-Din Tekish|<U+02BF>Al<U+0101> al-D<U+012B>n Tekish]] (1172<U+2013>1200) issued all their orders (both administrative and public) in [[Persian language]] ''<small>(see A.

Sometimes it was under [[Sassanid]] control.

In 712 Khwarezm was conquered by the [[Arab]] [[Umayyad]]s. It thus came vaguely under Muslim suzerainty, but it was not until the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th century that an Afrighid Shah was first converted to [[Islam]] appearing with the popular convert<U+2019>s name of <U+02BF>Abdallah (slave of God). In the course of the 10th century, when some geographers such as [[Istakhri]] in his ''Al-Masalik wa-l-mamalik'' mention Khwarezm as part of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiania]], the local family of the [[Ma'munids]] who were based in [[K<U+00F6>ne<U+00FC>rgen<U+00E7>|Gurganj]], on the left bank of the Amu Darya grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids of Kath and themselves assumed the traditional title of Khwarazm-Shah. Briefly, the area was under [[Samanid]] suzerainty, before it passed to [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] in 1017. From then on, Turco-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turco-Mongol dynasties supplanted the [[Iranian people|Iranian]] character of the region<ref name="MuslimDynasties"/> although the title of Khwarezm-Shah was maintained well up to the 13th century.<ref name="MuslimDynasties"/>

==Khwarezmid Empire==
[[File:Premongol.png|thumb|350px|Political map of Asia, Europe and Africa around 1200 AD showing the Khwarezmid Empire in dark green]]
{{main|Khwarezmid Empire}}
In the 12th century, the '''[[Khwarezmid Empire]]''' was founded and, in the early 13th century, ruled over all of Persia under the [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|<U+02BF>Al<U+0101><U+02BE> al-D<U+012B>n Muhammad II]] (1200<U+2013>1220). In 1141, [[Yel<U+00FC> Dashi]] won the [[battle of Qatwan]] against a [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] army commanded by [[Sanjar]], as a result, Khwarezm became a vassal of the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]].<ref>Biran, Michel, The empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian history, (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref> Then from 1218 to 1220 [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongols]] launched the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|invasion of Central Asia]] and destroyed the Kara-Khitan Khanate and the Khwarezmid Empire, including the splendid capital of the latter, [[Gurganj]].

"The Korasmins (i.e. Khwarezmids), a fierce, uncivilized race, thus driven from their homes, spread themselves, in their turn, over the south of Asia with fire and sword, in search of a resting place.  In their impetuous course they directed themselves towards [[Egypt]], whose Sultan, unable to withstand the swarm that had cast their longing eyes on the fertile valleys of the Nile... sent emissaries to Barbaquan, their leader, inviting them to settle in [[Palestine]]... they came, burning and slaying, and were at the walls of [[Jerusalem]]... they tore down every vestige of Christian faith..."<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]], [[Charles Mackay]], p221</ref>

"The Sultans of [[Syria]] preferred the Christians to this fierce horde for their neighbours.  Even the Sultan of Egypt began to regret the aid he had given to such barbarous foes, and united with those of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Emissa]] and [[Damascus]] to root them from the land.  The Korasmins amounted to but twenty thousand men, and were unable to resist the determined hostility... The Sultans defeated them in several engagements, and the peasantry rose up in masses to take vengeance upon them. No mercy was shown them in defeat.  Barbaquan was slain..."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

{{main|Khanate of Khiva}}
The region of Khwarezm was split between the [[White Horde]] and [[Jagatai Khanate]], and its rebuilt capital Gurganj (by now known as "Urganch") again became one of the largest and most important trading centers in Central Asia. In the mid-14th century Khwarezm gained independence from the [[Golden Horde]] under the [[Sufid]] dynasty. However, [[Timur]] regarded Khwarezm as a rival to [[Samarkand]], and over the course of 5 campaigns, he destroyed Urganch completely in 1388. This together with a shift in the course of the Amu-Darya caused the center of Khwarezm to shift to [[Khiva]], which became in the 16th century the capital of the '''[[Khanate of Khiva]]''', ruled over by the dynasty of the [[Khanate of Khiva|Arabshahids]].

The discovery of [[gold]] on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] during the reign of Russia's [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], together with the desire of the [[Russian Empire]] to open a trade route to the Indus (modern day [[Pakistan]]), prompted an armed trade expedition to the region, led by Prince [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky]], which was repelled by Khiva.

It was under Tsars [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] that serious efforts to annex the region started. One of the main pretexts to Russian military expeditions to Khiva was to free Russian slaves in the khanate and to prevent future slave capture and trade.

Early in [[The Great Game]], Russian interests in the region collided with those of the [[British Empire]] in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1839.

The Khanate of Khiva was gradually reduced in size from Russian expansion in [[Turkestan]] (including Khwarezm) and, in 1873, a peace treaty was signed that established Khiva as a quasi-independent Russian [[protectorate]].

After the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power in the [[October Revolution]], a short lived '''[[Khorezm SSR|Khorezm People<U+2019>s Soviet Republic]]''' (later the '''Khorezm SSR''') was created out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva, before in 1924 it was finally incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]], with the former Khanate divided between the new [[Turkmen SSR]], [[Uzbek SSR]] amd [[Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karakalpakstan ASSR]] (initially part of [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh ASSR]] as Karakalpak Oblast).

The larger historical area of Khwarezm is further divided. Northern Khwarezm became the [[Uzbek SSR]], and in 1925 the western part became the [[Turkmen SSR]]. Also, in 1936 northwestern part became [[Kazakh SSR]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, these became [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] respectively. Southern Khwarezmia is today a part of [[Iran]]. Many of the ancient Khwarezmian towns are situated currently in [[Xorazm Province]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Today, the area that was Khwarezm has a mixed population of [[Uzbeks]], [[Karakalpaks]], [[Turkmens]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Tatars]], and [[Kazakhs]].

==Khwarezm in Persian literature==
[[File:Pir 'Ali al-Jami - A Court Scene with Timur and His Maiden From Khwarezm - Walters W64837A - Full Page.jpg|thumb|[[Emir]] [[Timur]] and his maiden from Khwarezm.]]

Khwarezm and her cities appear in [[Persian literature]] in abundance, in both prose and poetry. [[Dehkhoda]] for example defines the name [[Bukhara]] itself as "full of knowledge", referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse. [[Rumi]] verifies this when he praises the city as such:

Other examples illustrate the eminent status of Khwarezmid and Transoxianian cities in Persian literature in the past 1500 years:

''---[[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]''

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], who visited Khwarezm and its capital in 1219, wrote: "I have never seen a city more wealthy and beautiful than [[Konye-Urgench|Gurganj]]". The city, however, was destroyed during several invasions, in particular when the Mongol army broke the dams of the [[Amu Darya]] which flooded the city. He reports that for every Mongol soldier, four inhabitants of Gurganj were killed. [[Najmeddin Kubra]], the great [[Sufi]] master, was among the casualties. The Mongol army that devastated Gurganj was estimated to have been near 80,000 soldiers. The verse below refers to an early previous calamity that fell upon the region:

<U+0622><U+062E><U+0631> <U+0627><U+06CC> <U+062E><U+0627><U+06A9> <U+062E><U+0631><U+0627><U+0633><U+0627><U+0646> <U+062F><U+0627><U+062F> <U+06CC><U+0632><U+062F><U+0627><U+0646><U+062A> <U+0646><U+062C><U+0627><U+062A><br />

''---Divan of [[Anvari]]''

Nevertheless the beauty and fame of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarqand]] are well known in [[Persian literature]]. The following famous [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] [[ode]] perhaps best provides a notable example of this:

<U+0627><U+06AF><U+0631> <U+0622><U+0646> <U+062A><U+0631><U+06A9> <U+0634><U+06CC><U+0631><U+0627><U+0632><U+06CC> <U+0628><U+0647> <U+062F><U+0633><U+062A> <U+0622><U+0631><U+062F> <U+062F><U+0644> <U+0645><U+0627> <U+0631><U+0627><br />

I would sell even the jewel cities of [[Samarqand]] and [[Bukhara]] for the Indian mole on her cheek."<br />
''---[[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]''

Legend has it that [[Tamerlane]] sent for Hafiz regarding this verse and asked angrily: "Are you he who was so bold as to offer my two great cities [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] for the mole on thy mistress's cheek?" Hafiz then replied, "Yes, sire, and it is by such acts of generosity that I have brought myself to such a state of destitution that I have now to solicit your bounty." Tamerlane is written to have been so pleased at his ready wit that he dismissed the poet with a handsome present.
