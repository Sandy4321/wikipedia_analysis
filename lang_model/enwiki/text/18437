It is named after the sound made when water drips down from the upper basin. Staehli, a Swiss woodcarver who immigrated to Portland, designed the fountain to serve as a [[watering trough]] for horses pulling carriages into the park. It is based on a Rennaissance fountain and was originally painted white and included a boy statuette, possibly depicting [[Cupid]]. However, the figure was damaged, thrown out by the 1940s, and never replaced.

The fountain was restored in 1960, but is no longer functional. It was considered "treatment urgent" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in February 1994. ''Chiming Fountain'' has been included in published biking and walking tours of Portland and has mentioned as a highlight of Washington Park in guides recommending family-friendy activities in the city.

==Description and history==

The decorative fountain is located at the junction of Southwest Sacajawea Boulevard and Southwest Sherwood Boulevard in the main circle of Washington Park. It was designed by John "Hans" Staehli, a Swiss woodcarver who immigrated to Portland and was known for his decorative carvings of churches.<ref name=Harvey>{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Joan|title=Architect who helped save buildings dies|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/obituaries/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1241747712278220.xml&coll=7|accessdate=November 30, 2014|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=Advanced Publications|date=May 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Skidmore/Old Town Historic District|url=http://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/or/SkidmoreHD.pdf|publisher=United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service|accessdate=November 30, 2014|page=77}}</ref> The fountain was commissioned by the City of Portland in 1891 for $400 and completed by Staehli later that year, becoming the city's second piece of public art.<ref name=SI/><ref name=PPR>{{cite web|title=1852<U+2013>1900|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/95955|publisher=[[Portland Parks & Recreation]]|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}</ref> It served as a [[watering trough]] for horses pulling carriages into the park.<ref name=Foster/><ref name=Cook>Sybilla Avery Cook:

The fountain is made of cast iron and measures approximately {{Convert|12|ft|m}} tall with a {{Convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter. It has a pedestal and two round bronze basins separated by a narrow post, and stands in an octagonal concrete base which serves as a retaining pool.<ref name=SI/><ref name=WP>{{cite web|title=Washington Park|url=http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&propertyid=841&action=viewpark|publisher=Portland Parks & Recreation|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}</ref> The pedestal has four horned gargoyle-like figures.<ref name=SI/><ref name=WP/> On the bottom of the pedestal's west side is an unsigned inscription which reads: "J.

Staehli's design is based on a Rennaissance fountain and was originally painted white and included a figure of a boy carrying a staff (or possibly a fish or a torch) from which water spouted.<ref name=SI/><ref name=PPR/> According to [[Portland Parks & Recreation]], the figure was last recorded in 1912 when Willis McElroy's band was photographed in the nearby bandstand.<ref name=PPR/> However, in the 1920s, freezing weather expanded water in the fountain, damaging the figure. The boy statuette was thrown out by the 1940s and was not replaced.<ref name=SI/><ref name=PPR/> Some sources suggest the figure depicted [[Cupid]], hence one of the fountain's nicknames, "Cupid's Fountain".<ref name=Foster/>

The city planned to remove the fountain in 1960 for being in a state of disrepair. However, Mayor [[Terry Schrunk]] instructed the park bureau to begin a restoration after Francis J. Murnane, local longshoreman and advocate for historic preservation, appealed its removal. Much of its original decoration was absent, so replicas were constructed from existing pieces for $450. The restoration cost around $1,775, including assembly and installation.<ref name=PPR/> Despite its restoration, the fountain is no longer functional. It was surveyed and considered "treatment urgent" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in February 1994, and was administered by the City of Portland's Metropolitan Arts Commission at that time.<ref name=SI/>
