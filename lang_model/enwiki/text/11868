'''RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge''' was a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] training base located in coastal [[Charlotte County, New Brunswick|Charlotte County]], [[New Brunswick]] in the hamlet of [[Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick|Pennfield Ridge]].

Construction of the aerodrome began in the summer of [[1940]] after a suitable site was selected on a ridge high above the surrounding coastal plain of the north shore of the [[Bay of Fundy]], east of the town of [[St. George, New Brunswick|St. George]]. Proximity to a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line running between [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] eased the transport of building materials. General contractor Dexter Construction had 200 workers on the project by August 1940 and the runways were finished by November. The base was located southwest of the '''Camp Utopia''', an army training facility for southwestern New Brunswick.

The first test flights took place on [[January 1]], [[1941]] and the base officially opened on [[July 21]] of that year, housing the No. 2 Air Navigational School (ANS) and later the No. 34 Operational Training Unit (OTC), under the command of the No. 3 Training Command, which was headquartered in [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] as part of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] (BCATP).

By the end of summer 1941, over 40 buildings were constructed on the base, including 4 large [[hangar]]s, an observation tower, barracks, drill hall, mess halls and classrooms, along with a water supply and internal telephone system. The three runways were lengthened in the fall of 1941 into the classic BCATP triangle arrangement.

The air base was decommissioned by the RCAF toward the end of [[World War II]], with air force activities in eastern Canada being concentrated at RCAF Station Greenwood, RCAF Station Debert, RCAF Station Summerside and RCAF Station Chatham. The Pennfield Ridge base became the operational location for Heavy Transport until it was purchased several years later and operated by a commercial airline company as an alternative to the inadequate airport serving Saint John at Millidgeville.

After the new [[Saint John Airport]] was opened in the early 1950s, Pennfield Ridge closed as an operational airfield. One of its runways was used as a [[drag racing]] track by the New Brunwsick Drag Racing Association during the [[1950s]]-[[1970s]]. Today, 2 of the 3 runways are used for drying [[seaweed]] which is then marketed as a natural plant fertilizer. The remaining runway is still able to handle small aircraft under visual flight rules (VFR) conditions; there is a small fuel reserve tank for the use of [[J.D. Irving Limited]] and New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources aircraft.

Less than 2 kilometers to the east of the airfield is the location of the [[Jim Mollison]] landing in August 1932, in which Mollison completed the first solo East-to-West trans-atlantic flight. His aircraft was a [[de Havilland]] Puss Moth (G-ABXY) dubbed "''The Heart's Content''".

On September 24, 2006, a memorial was erected at a nearby park in Pennfield to honor the sixty-one (61) men that died while on training at Pennfield Ridge.
