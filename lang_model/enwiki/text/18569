'''Nicolaus Copernicus''' (February 19, 1473 <U+2013> May 24, 1543) was the first <!-- no assertion of nationality here! see section on his nationality, the discussion page and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view --> [[astronomer]] to formulate a scientifically-based [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] that displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe. His epochal book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), is often regarded as the starting point of modern [[astronomy]] and the defining [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that began the [[Scientific Revolution]].

Although [[Greek astronomy|Greek]], [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim]] [[Polymath|savant]]s had published heliocentric [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] centuries before Copernicus, his publication of a scientific theory of heliocentrism, demonstrating that the motions of celestial objects can be explained without putting the Earth at rest in the center of the universe, stimulated further scientific investigations and became a [[landmark]] in the [[history of science|history of modern science]] that is known as the [[Copernican Revolution]]. 

Among the great [[polymath]]s of the [[Renaissance]], Copernicus was a [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[physician]], [[classical scholar]], [[translator]], [[visual arts|artist]],<ref>A [[self-portrait]] helped confirm the identity of his [[cranium]] when it was discovered at Frombork Cathedral in 2008.</ref> [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic cleric]], [[jurist]], [[governor]], [[military|military leader]],  [[diplomacy|diplomat]] and [[economist]]. Among his many responsibilities, astronomy figured as little more than an [[avocation]] <U+2014> yet it was in that field that he made his mark upon the world.

===Family===
[[Image:CopernicusHouse.jpg|thumb|left|115px|Copernicus' birthplace]]
[[Image:<U+0141>ukasz Watzenrode.jpeg|thumb|right|135px|Copernicus' uncle, [[Lucas Watzenrode the Younger|Lucas Watzenrode]]]]
Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 in a house on St. Anne's Street (now Copernicus Street) in the city of [[Toru<U+0144>]] (''Thorn''). Toru<U+0144>, situated on the [[Vistula River]], was part of [[Royal Prussia]], a region of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385<U+2013>1569)|Kingdom of Poland]].<ref>Barbara Bie<U+0144>kowska, ''The Scientific World of Copernicus: On the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of His Birth, 1473<U+2013>1973'', 1973, p. 137: "His country was the province of ancient [[Royal Prussia]], composed of his native [[Toru<U+0144>]] and [[Warmia]], both components of the Polish state since 1454."</ref> <ref name="Sedlar"> Jean W. Sedlar, ''East Central Europe in the Middle Ages 1000-1500'', 1994, p. 281-282 [http://books.google.ie/books?id=ANdbpi1WAIQC&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=royal-prussia&source=web&ots=tPM6sVA1CM&sig=Of4b4nKAgNiEW3jOopzXCso3nn4&hl=en#PPA282,M1]: "The Prussians themselves viewed their territory as united to Poland only through the king's person. [...] Social and ethnic differences reinforced this separateness."</ref> 

Nicolaus was named after his father, who about 1458 had moved to Toru<U+0144> from [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] in [[Lesser Poland]]. The father was a wealthy [[copper]] trader who had become a respected citizen of Toru<U+0144>. Nicolaus' mother, Barbara Watzenrode (died after 1495), had been born into a wealthy merchant family that was part of the city's [[patrician]] class.

Nicolaus' father died between 1483 and 1485. After that, his maternal uncle, [[Lucas Watzenrode the Younger]] (1447<U+2013>1512), a church [[canon (priest)|canon]] who would later become [[List of bishops of Warmia|Prince-Bishop]] of the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]], took young Nicolaus under his protection and saw to his education and future career.

Nicolaus was the youngest of four children. His brother Andreas became an [[Augustinian]] [[canon (priest)|canon]] at [[Frombork]] (''Frauenburg''). His sister Barbara (named after her mother) became a [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. His sister Katharina married Barthel Gertner, a businessman and city councilor.

===Name===
[[Image:Torun pomnik Kopernika 01.jpg|thumb|right|Monument in [[Toru<U+0144>]] by [[Christian Friedrich Tieck|Friedrich Tieck]]]]
Numerous variants of Copernicus' name are documented.<ref>Koeppen (1973)</ref> Until the mid-1530s, he mostly signed himself ''Coppernic''. Afterward, he followed the academic custom of his time and adopted a [[Latin|Latinized]] version of his name. Thus, on the title page of his epochal book, ''Nicolai Copernici Torinensis De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium Libri VI'', the astronomer's name appears as ''Nicolaus Copernicus''.

In 1776, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] introduced the spelling ''Nikolaus Kopernikus'', which replaced each ''c'' with ''k'' and changed ''pp'' to ''p''. This spelling became popular in [[German language|German]] writings, although scholars argued for ''Coppernicus''. The [[Polish language|Polish]] rendering is ''Miko<U+0142>aj Kopernik''; the surname means "one who works with [[copper]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glos.uni.torun.pl/2003/05/historia/|title=O historii i o wsp<U+00F3><U+0142>czesno<U+015B>ci|accessdate=2007-04-22 |format= |work=In Polish}}</ref>

===Education===
[[Image:Courtyard of Collegium Maius, Krakow.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Jagiellonian University|Krak<U+00F3>w University's]] ''[[Collegium Maius]]'']]

In 1491 Copernicus enrolled at the [[Jagiellonian University|Krak<U+00F3>w Academy]] (now Jagiellonian University), where he probably first encountered astronomy with Professor [[Albert Brudzewski]]. Astronomy soon fascinated him, and he began collecting a large library on the subject. Copernicus' library would later be carried off as war booty by the Swedes during [[The Deluge (Polish history)|"the Deluge"]] and is now at the [[Uppsala University Library]].

After four years in Krak<U+00F3>w, followed by a brief stay back home in Toru<U+0144>, Copernicus went to study [[law]] and [[medicine]] at the universities of [[Bologna]] and [[Padua]]. Copernicus' uncle, [[Lucas Watzenrode the Younger]], financed his education and hoped that Copernicus too would become a [[bishop]]. Copernicus, however, while studying [[canon law|canon]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at Bologna, met the famous astronomer, [[Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara]]. Copernicus attended Novara's lectures and became his disciple and assistant. The first observations that Copernicus made in 1497, together with Novara, are recorded in Copernicus' epochal book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.

In 1497 Copernicus' uncle was ordained [[Bishop of Warmia]], and Copernicus was named a [[canon (priest)|canon]] at Frombork Cathedral. But Copernicus remained in Italy, where he attended the great [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] of 1500. He also went to [[Rome]], where he observed a lunar [[eclipse]] and gave some lectures in astronomy and mathematics.

In 1501 Copernicus returned to Frombork. As soon as he arrived, he obtained permission to complete his studies in [[Padua]], where he studied [[medicine]] (with Guarico and [[Fracastoro]]), and at [[Ferrara]], where in 1503 he received his doctorate in [[canon law]]. One of the subjects that Copernicus must have studied at that time was [[astrology]], since it was considered an important part of a medical education.<ref>Rabin [[#Reference-Rabin-2005|(2005)]].</ref> However, unlike most other prominent Renaissance astronomers, he appears never to have practiced it or expressed any subsequent interest in it.<ref>Gingerich [[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|(2004, pp.187&ndash;189,201 )]]; Koyr<U+00E9> [[#Reference-Koyre-1973| (1973, p.94)]]; Kuhn [[#Reference-Kuhn-1957|(1957, p.93)]]; Rosen [[#Reference-Rosen-2004|(2004, p.123)]]; Rabin [[#Reference-Rabin-2005|(2005)]].</ref> It has also been surmised that it was in Padua that he encountered passages from [[Cicero]] and [[Plato]] about opinions of the ancients on the movement of the Earth, and formed the first intuition of his own future theory. In 1504 Copernicus began collecting observations and ideas pertinent to his theory.

===Work===
In 1503, Copernicus returned to Polish [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], to the [[Prince-Bishop]]ric of [[Warmia]], where he resided the rest of his life. From 1503 until 1510 he had the position of secretary to his maternal uncle Lucas Watzenrode, Bishop of Warmia, and until 1510 resided in the Bishop's castle at [[Lidzbark Warmi<U+0144>ski]] (''Heilsberg''). It is there that he started work on his heliocentric view of the heavens.<ref>Repcheck (2007), p. 51</ref> 

In 1510, he moved to [[Frombork]] (''Frauenburg''), a town in the north and downstream of Toru<U+0144> on the [[Vistula Lagoon]]. The Bishopric of Warmia, within Royal Prussia, though subject to the Polish crown, enjoyed substantial [[autonomy]], with its own [[Diet (assembly)|diet]], army, monetary unit (the same as in the other parts of Prussia) and treasury.<ref>Sedlar (1994)</ref> Some time before his return to Warmia, he received a position at the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross in [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]] (''Breslau''), [[Silesia]], [[Bohemia]], which he held for many years and only resigned for health reasons shortly before his death. Copernicus remained for the rest of his life a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] of Warmia ([[Bishopric of Warmia]]). During the [[Protestant Reformation#Lutheranism adopted by the German territorial princes|Protestant Reformation]], he remained a loyal subject of the Catholic [[Bishops of Warmia|Prince-Bishops]] and the Catholic Polish King. Throughout his life, he performed astronomical observations and calculations, but only as time permitted and never in a professional capacity.
[[Image:Olsztyn-zamek.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Olsztyn|Olsztyn Castle]]]]
In 1516-21, Copernicus resided at Olsztyn Castle as economic administrator of [[Warmia]], including Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]) and Mehlsack ([[Pieni<U+0119><U+017C>no]]), and wrote the manuscript  ''[[Locationes mansorum desertorum]]'' (Locations of Deserted Fiefs).

When [[Olsztyn]] was besieged by the Teutonic Knights during the [[Polish-Teutonic War (1519<U+2013>1521)]], Copernicus was in charge of the defenses of Olsztyn and Warmia at the head of Royal Polish forces. He also participated in the peace negotiations.<ref>Repcheck (2007), p.66</ref>
[[Image:Kopernikus-Olsztyn.jpg|thumb|115px|''Copernicus'' before [[Olsztyn|Olsztyn Castle]]]]
Copernicus worked for years with the Royal Prussian diet, and with Duke [[Albert of Prussia]], and advised Poland's King [[Sigismund I the Old]] on [[monetary reform]]. Holding the office of [[canon (priest)|canon]], he traveled extensively on government business and as a [[diplomat]] on behalf of the Prince-Bishop of Warmia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/~flwstv/copernicus.html|title=Copernicus|author=Prof. Fred L. Wilson of the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]}}</ref> He participated in the discussions in the [[Duchy of Prussia|East Prussian]] diet about coin reform in the Prussian countries. One question at issue to members of the Diet concerned who had the right to mint [[coin]]. The matter required much diplomacy, but was resolved successfully. Some of the difficulties were caused by the political upheavals occurring in Prussia at the time, including the 1525 establishment of the Duchy of Prussia as a Protestant state. Copernicus translated his coin-reform treatise into Latin for external use. In 1530 an agreement was negotiated with Duke Albert at [[Elbl<U+0105>g]] (''Elbing'').

In 1526, Copernicus wrote a study on the value of [[money]], ''[[Monetae cudendae ratio]]''. In it he formulated an early iteration of the theory, now called "[[Gresham's Law]]," that "bad" ([[debasement|debased]]) [[coinage]] drives "good" (un-debased) coinage out of circulation, 70 years before Gresham. He also formulated a version of [[quantity theory of money]]. Copernicus' recommendations on monetary reform were widely read by leaders of both Prussia and Poland in their attempts to stabilize currency.<ref>''Minor Works'', translated by E. Rosen, Baltimore,  Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992, pp. 176-215.</ref>

Two years before Copernicus' death, Duke Albert urgently summoned him to [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]] to treat one of his counsellors, who was dangerously ill. The patient recovered within a month or so, and Copernicus then returned to Frombork.<ref>[[#Reference-Koyre-1973|Koyr<U+00E9> (1973, p.80)]], [[#Reference-Armitage-1951| Armitage (1951, pp.52&ndash;53)]]</ref>

In 1551, eight years after Copernicus' death, [[Erasmus Reinhold]] would publish, under Duke Albert's sponsorship, the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'', a set of astronomical tables based on Copernicus' work, which astronomers and astrologers quickly adopted in place of superseded tables.<ref>[[#Reference-Kuhn-1957|Kuhn (1957, pp.187&ndash;88)]]</ref>

===Heliocentrism===
[[Image:Jan Matejko-Astronomer Copernicus-Conversation with God.jpg|right|thumb|225px|''Astronomer Copernicus: Conversation with God'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]
In 1514 Copernicus made available to friends his ''[[Commentariolus]]'' (Little Commentary), a six page hand-written text describing his ideas about the heliocentric hypothesis. It contained seven basic assumptions. Thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work.

In 1533, [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]] delivered in [[Rome]] a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by [[Pope Clement VII]] and several Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].

On 1 November 1536, [[Archbishop of Capua]] [[Nikolaus Cardinal von Sch<U+00F6>nberg|Nicholas Sch<U+00F6>nberg]] wrote a letter to Copernicus from Rome:

{{quote|Some years ago word reached me concerning your proficiency, of which everybody constantly spoke. At that time I began to have a very high regard for you... For I had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well but had also formulated a new cosmology. In it you maintain that the earth moves; that the sun occupies the lowest, and thus the central, place in the universe... Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject ...<ref>[http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html Full text - Nicholas Copernicus, "De Revolutionibus (On the Revolutions)," 1543 C.E.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

By then Copernicus' work was nearing its definitive form, and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over Europe. Despite urgings from many quarters, Copernicus delayed with the publication of his book, perhaps from fear of criticism <U+2014> a fear delicately expressed in the subsequent [[Dedication to Pope Paul III|Dedication]] of his masterpiece to [[Pope Paul III]]. Scholars disagree on whether Copernicus' concern was limited to physical and philosophical objections from other natural philosophers, or whether he was also concerned about religious objections from theologians.<ref name=fear>Koyr<U+00E9> [[#Reference-Koyre-1973|(1973, pp.27, 90)]] and Rosen [[#Reference-Rosen-1995| (1995, pp.64,184)]] take the view that Copernicus was indeed concerned about possible objections from theologians, while Lindberg and Numbers [[#Reference-Lindberg&Numbers-1986|(1986)]] argue against it. Koestler [[#Reference-Koestler-1963|(1963)]] also denies it. Indirect evidence that Copernicus was concerned about objections from theologians comes from a letter written to him by [[Andreas Osiander]] in 1541, in which Osiander advises Copernicus to adopt a proposal by which he says "you will be able to appease the Peripatetics and theologians whose opposition you fear." [[#Reference-Koyre-1973|(Koyr<U+00E9>, 1973, pp.35, 90)]]</ref>

===The book===
[[Image:De revolutionibus orbium coelestium.jpg|thumb|left|110px|''[[De revolutionibus]]'', 2nd ed., [[Basel]], 1566]]
[[Image:ADurerMelancthonengraving1526.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]]]]

Copernicus was still working on ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (even if not convinced that he wanted to publish it) when in 1539 [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], a [[Wittenberg]] [[mathematician]], arrived in Frombork. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] had arranged for Rheticus to visit several astronomers and study with them.

Rheticus became Copernicus' pupil, staying with him for two years and writing a book, ''[[Narratio prima]]'' (First Account), outlining the essence of Copernicus' theory. In 1542 Rheticus published a treatise on [[trigonometry]] by Copernicus (later included in the second book of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]'').

Under strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen the favorable first general reception of his work, Copernicus finally agreed to give ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]'' to his close friend, [[Tiedemann Giese]], bishop of [[Che<U+0142>mno]] (''Kulm''), to be delivered to Rheticus for printing by [[Johannes Petreius]] at [[Nuremberg]] (''N<U+00FC>rnberg'').

===Death===
[[Image:Katedra we Fromborku.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Frombork]] Cathedral, where Copernicus was buried]]

Copernicus died in [[Frombork]] on 24 May 1543. Legend has it that the first printed copy of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]'' was placed in his hands on the very day that he died, allowing him to take farewell of his life's work. He is reputed to have wakened from a [[stroke]]-induced [[coma]], looked at his book, and died peacefully.

Copernicus was reportedly buried in Frombork Cathedral, where archeologists long searched in vain for his remains. In August 2005 a team led by Jerzy G<U+0105>ssowski, head of an [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] institute in [[Pu<U+0142>tusk]], after scanning beneath the cathedral floor, discovered what they believe to be Copernicus' remains.<ref name="DNA_Remains1">{{cite web| date=| title=Scientists say Copernicus' remains found| publisher=The Associated Press-Kansas City.com| url=http://www.kansascity.com/451/story/900344.html| accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7740908.stm|title= Polish tests 'confirm Copernicus'|accessdate=21 November 2008 |work= Europe|publisher= [[BBC News]]|date= 21 November 2008}}</ref> The find came after a year of searching, and the discovery was announced only after further research, on November 3, 2008.<ref name="DNA_Remains1" /> G<U+0105>ssowski said he was "almost 100 percent sure it is Copernicus."

==Copernican system==
{{main|Copernican heliocentrism}}

===Predecessors===
Early traces of a [[heliocentric]] model are found in several anonymous [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] before the 7th century BCE. Additionally, in the sixth century the [[Indian science and technology|Indian]] astronomer and mathematician [[Aryabhata]] anticipated elements of Copernicus's work, although he did not maintain heliocentrism.

[[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BCE elaborated some theories of [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis, the revolution of Venus and Mercury around the Sun) to propose what was the first scientific model of a heliocentric solar system: the Earth and all other planets revolving around the Sun, the Earth rotating around its axis daily, the Moon in turn revolving around the Earth once a month. His heliocentric work has not survived, so we can only speculate about what led him to his conclusions. It is notable that, according to [[Plutarch]], a contemporary of Aristarchus accused him of impiety for "putting the Earth in motion".

Copernicus cited [[Aristarchus]] and [[Philolaus]] in a surviving early manuscript of his book, stating: "Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of [[Samos Island|Samos]] was of that opinion." For reasons unknown (possibly from reluctance to quote pre-Christian sources), he did not include this passage in the published book. It has been argued that in developing the mathematics of heliocentrism Copernicus drew on not just the Greek, but also the work of [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]], especially the works of [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] ([[Tusi-couple]]), [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] (Urdi lemma) and [[Ibn al-Shatir]]. In his major work, Copernicus also discussed the theories of [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Averroes]].

===Ptolemy===
[[Image:Ptolemaeus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ptolemy]]: medieval rendition]]
[[Image:Nicolas Copernicus Polish.JPG|thumb|right|Copernicus: a 16th-century portrait]]

The prevailing theory in Europe as Copernicus was writing was that created by the [[Greeks|Greek]] astronomer [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' (<U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B7>), dating from about A.D. 150. The [[Ptolemaic system]] drew on many previous theories that viewed Earth as a stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere which rotated relatively rapidly, while the planets dwelt in smaller spheres between <U+2014> a separate one for each planet.

===Copernicus===
Copernicus' major theory was published in the book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), in the year of his death, 1543, though he had arrived at his theory several decades earlier.

In his ''Commentariolus'' Copernicus had summarized his system with the following list of seven assumptions:<ref name="seven assumptions">Translated by Rosen [[#Reference-Rosen-2004|(2004, p. 58&ndash;59)]].</ref>

{{Quote|
# There is no one center of all the celestial circles or spheres.
# The center of the earth is not the center of the universe, but only of gravity and of the lunar sphere.
# All the spheres revolve about the sun as their mid-point, and therefore the sun is the center of the universe.
# The ratio of the earth's distance from the sun to the height of the [[firmament]] is so much smaller than the ratio of the earth's radius to its distance from the sun that the distance from the earth to the sun is imperceptible in comparison with the height of the firmament.
# Whatever motion appears in the firmament arises not from any motion of the firmament, but from the earth's motion. The earth together with its circumjacent elements performs a complete rotation on its fixed poles in a daily motion, while the firmament and highest heaven abide unchanged.
# What appear to us as motions of the sun arise not from its motion but from the motion of the earth and our sphere, with which we revolve about the sun like any other planet. The earth has, then, more than one motion.
# The apparent retrograde and direct motion of the planets arises not from their motion but from the earth's. The motion of the earth alone, therefore, suffices to explain so many apparent inequalities in the heavens.}}

''De revolutionibus'' itself was divided into six books:

# General vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his idea of the World
# Mainly theoretical, presents the principles of spherical astronomy and a list of stars (as a basis for the arguments developed in the subsequent books)
# Mainly dedicated to the apparent motions of the Sun and to related phenomena
# Description of the Moon and its orbital motions
# Concrete exposition of the new system
# Concrete exposition of the new system

==Copernicanism==
[[Image:copernicus.jpg|thumb|left|Copernicus, astronomer]]

At original publication, Copernicus' epoch-making book caused only mild controversy, and provoked no fierce sermons about contradicting ''[[Holy Scripture]]''. It was only three years later, in 1546, that a [[Dominican]], Giovanni Maria Tolosani, denounced the theory in an appendix to a work defending the absolute truth of ''Scripture''.<ref>Rosen [[#Reference-Rosen-1995|(1995, pp.151&ndash;59)]]</ref> He also noted that the Master of the Sacred Palace (i.e., the Catholic Church's chief [[censor]]), [[Bartolomeo Spina]], a friend and fellow Dominican, had planned to condemn ''De revolutionibus'' but had been prevented from doing so by his illness and death.<ref>Rosen [[#Reference-Rosen-1995|(1995, p.158)]]</ref>

It has been much debated why it was not until six decades after Spina and Tolosani's attacks on Copernicus's work that the Catholic Church took any official action against it. Proposed reasons have included the personality of [[Galileo Galilei]] and the availability of evidence such as [[telescope]] observations.
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]]]

In March 1616, in connection with the [[Galileo affair]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[Congregation of the Index]] issued a decree suspending ''De revolutionibus'' until it could be "corrected," on the grounds that the supposedly [[Pythagorean]] doctrine<ref>In fact, in the Pythagorean cosmological system the Sun was not motionless.</ref> that the [[Earth]] moves and the [[Sun]] doesn't was "false and altogether opposed to ''[[Holy Scripture]]''."<ref>Decree of the General Congregation of the Index, March 5, 1616 (translated from the Latin by Finocchiaro,[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], as cited by Gagn<U+00E9>, [[#Reference-Gagne-2005| 2005]] [http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree ]).</ref><!--- <ref>Trial of Galileo. [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/admonition.html]</ref> --> The same decree also prohibited any work that defended the mobility of the Earth or the immobility of the Sun, or that attempted to reconcile these assertions with ''Scripture''.

On the orders of [[Pope Paul V]], Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] gave Galileo prior notice that the decree was about to be issued, and warned him that he could not "hold or defend" the Copernican doctrine.<ref>Fantoli [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005| (2005, pp.118&ndash;19)]]; Finocchiaro [[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|(1989)]], as cited by Gagn<U+00E9> [[#Reference-Gagne-2005|(2005)]].  Inquisition Minutes of 25 February, 1616 [http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#inqminutes]; Cardinal Bellarmine's certificate of 26 May, 1616 [http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#certificate]. This would not have prevented Galileo from discussing heliocentrism solely as a mathematical hypothesis, but a stronger [http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#specinj formal injunction] not to teach it "in any way whatever, either orally or in writing", allegedly issued to him by the Commissary of the Holy Office, Father Michelangelo Segizzi, would certainly have done so [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005| (Fantoli, 2005, pp.119&ndash;20, 137)]]. There has been much controversy over whether the copy of this injunction in the Vatican archives is authentic; if so, whether it was ever issued; and if so, whether it was legally valid  [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005| (Fantoli, 2005, pp.120&ndash;43)]].</ref> The corrections to ''De revolutionibus'', which omitted or altered nine sentences, were issued four years later, in 1620.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04352b.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia''].</ref>

In 1633 [[Galileo Galilei]] was convicted of grave suspicion of [[heresy]] for "following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of ''Holy Scripture'',"<ref>Papal Condemnation (Sentence) of Galileo, June 22, 1633 (translated from the Latin), in Giorgio de Santillana, ''The Crime of Galileo'', University of Chicago Press, 1955, pp. 306-10.</ref> and was placed under [[house arrest]] for the rest of his life.

Galileo had gotten off lightly. Another Copernican, [[Giordano Bruno]], had been prosecuted in [[Rome]] by the same Cardinal [[Bellarmine]] and on 17 February 1600, burned at the stake as a [[heretic]] primarily for his theologic views and not necessarily his scientific ones.

The Catholic Church's 1758 ''[[Index of Prohibited Books]]'' omitted the general prohibition of works defending heliocentrism,<ref name="omission of general ban">Heilbron [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|(2005, p. 307)]]; Coyne [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|(2005, p. 347)]].</ref> but retained the specific prohibitions of the original uncensored versions of ''De revolutionibus'' and Galileo's ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]''. Those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 ''Index''.<ref name="omission of specific ban">McMullin [[#Reference-McMullin-2005| (2005, p. 6)]]; Coyne [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|(2005, p. 346-47)]].</ref>

It has been asserted<ref>By [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] [[#Reference-Russell-1997|(1997, p.64)]], for instance</ref> that medieval scholars had known that the Earth was a sphere and that, paradoxically, it might have been Copernicus' criticism of the early Christian author [[Lactantius]] (ca. 240 <U+2013> ca. 320 C.E.) in ''De revolutionibus'' that later developed into the [[flat Earth|flat-Earth myth]].

Copernicus' ethnicity and nationality are disputed. His father has been described as a Pole, and his mother was most likely of German origin.<ref>

The family came originally from the [[Silesia]]n village of the same name (Coprnik, Copernik, Copirnik, Copernic, Kopernic, today [[Koperniki]]) near [[Nysa]]. In the 14th century, members of the family had begun moving to Silesian and later to Polish cities: [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] (1367) and [[Toru<U+0144>]] (1400), and also to [[Lw<U+00F3>w]]. The astronomer's father (probably the son of Jan) came from the Krak<U+00F3>w line. He appears in records for the first time in 1448 as a well-to-do merchant who dealt in copper with [[Gda<U+0144>sk]] ''(Danzig)''. In the early period of the [[Pomerania]]n cities' struggle for independence from the [[Teutonic Order]], in August 1454, he mediated financial negotiations between Cardinal [[Zbigniew Ole<U+015B>nicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Ole<U+015B>nicki]] and the great Prussian cities regarding repayment of a loan for the Polish-Teutonic war. About 1458 the future astronomer's father moved from Poland's capital, Krak<U+00F3>w, to Toru<U+0144>, where a few years later (before 1464) he married Barbara, daughter of a wealthy Toru<U+0144> patrician and city councillor, Lucas Watzenrode the elder (died 1462).<ref>Jerzy Dobrzycki and Leszek Hajdukiewicz, "Kopernik, Miko<U+0142>aj", ''[[Polski s<U+0142>ownik biograficzny]]'', vol. XIV, 1969, pp. 3-4.</ref>
[[Image:Nicolaus Copernicus bust at UN New York.JPG|thumb|right|Copernicus bust at [[United Nations]], [[New York City|New York]]]]

The Watzenrodes had likewise come from Silesia, from the [[<U+015A>widnica]] (Schwednitz) region, and had settled in Toru<U+0144> after 1360. The astronomer's grandfather Watzenrode was a decided opponent of the Teutonic Order. In 1453 he was the delegate from Toru<U+0144> at the [[Grudzi<U+0105>dz]] conference that planned the anti-Teutonic-Order uprising, and during the [[Thirteen Years' War]] he actively supported the struggle of the Prussian cities not only with substantial monetary subsidies but with political activity in Toru<U+0144> and Gda<U+0144>sk as well as with his own personal participation in battles at <U+0141>aszyn and [[Malbork]]. He died in 1462, leaving three children: Lucas (1447<U+2013>1512), future Bishop of [[Warmia]] and the astronomer's patron, and two daughters: Barbara, the astronomer's mother (died after 1495), and Christina (died before 1502), who in 1459 married the merchant and Toru<U+0144> mayor, Tiedeman von Allen. Through the Watzenrodes' extensive family relationships by marriage, the future astronomer was related both to wealthy [[bourgeoisie|burgher]] families of Krak<U+00F3>w, Toru<U+0144>, Gda<U+0144>sk and [[Elbl<U+0105>g]] and to prominent noble families of Prussia: the Dzia<U+0142>y<U+0144>ski, Ko<U+015B>cielicki and Konopacki families.<ref>Dobrzycki and Hajdukiewicz, ''[[Polski s<U+0142>ownik biograficzny]]'', vol. XIV, p. 4.</ref>

It remains a matter of dispute whether a nationality should be ascribed to Nicolaus Copernicus retrospectively and, if so, whether he should be considered German or Polish.<ref name="Understanding Contemporary Germany">Stuart Parkes, ''Understanding Contemporary Germany''.
