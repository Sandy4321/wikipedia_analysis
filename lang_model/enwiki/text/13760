'''''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''''' is the debut solo album by [[John Frusciante]] released on [[March 8]], [[1994]] on [[American Recordings]]. Frusciante released the album after encouragement from several friends who told him that there was "no good music around anymore".

''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' consists of guitar, piano playing and various effects such as synthesizers and keyboards, all of which were recorded on a 4-track recorder. Most of the songs on the album were recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992, when he and the Chili Peppers were recording ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''. ''Usually Just a T-Shirt'', on the other hand, was after Frusciante left. The album sold poorly before it was taken off the market in 1998 at Frusciante's request. 

==Context==
Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the age of 18 and recorded his first album with the group, ''[[Mother's Milk]]'', in 1988. The follow-up album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', was recorded in an empty mansion that the band decided to live in for the duration of recording.<ref name=pp274>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 274<U+2013>275</ref> Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up the album's first half, ''Niandra Lades''.<ref name=pp274/> ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' was released on [[September 24]], [[1991]] and was an instant success. The album peaked at #3 on the [[Billboard Top 200]] and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide.<ref name=billboardrhcp>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Charting|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref><ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=Certification search|accessdate=2007-09-21|publisher=RIAA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/discographies/a/redhotdisc.htm|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers discography|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=Top40}}</ref> Soon after the album's release, Frusciante began to dislike the band's newfound popularity. He felt that the band was too famous, and wished they were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he joined the group.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229</ref> By his own admission, the band's rise to popularity took Frusciante by surprise, and he could not cope with it.<ref>{{ cite web | last = Gabriella. | url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/rhcp_int.htm | title = "Interview with the Red Hot Chili Peppers".

After quitting the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante continued to write and record music. He had been writing songs since age nine, but had never considered releasing them to the public.<ref name=VPRO>VPRO Interview with John Frusciante; 1994</ref> Several of his friends<U+2014>including [[Johnny Depp]], [[Perry Farrell]], and [[Gibby Haynes]]<U+2014>encouraged him to release the material he recorded in his spare time during the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' sessions.<ref name=VPRO/><ref name=bboard>Kenneally, Tim. (October 1, 1994) "Frusciante Steps Out With American Set". ''Billboard Magazine''</ref> Frusciante began recording final cuts of the songs and [[Record producer|producing]] them at his home in late 1993, but this was hampered by his intensifying addiction to heroin. Most of ''Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was recorded while Frusciante was heavily intoxicated by the drug. An example of this can be heard on the album's tenth track, "Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire".<ref name=jfcom-niandra>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/niandra.php|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Frusciante was under the influence of heroin and [[crack cocaine]] during the final stages of recording in late 1993, viewing them as the only way to "make sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul."<ref name=jfcom-niandra/><ref name=VPRO/>

Frusciante also wrote the album in order to create interesting music, which he felt no longer existed.He felt that contemporary musicians were not writing material he deemed worth listening to, and that the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity.<ref name=VPRO/> Frusciante increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Pepper's success, such as the song "Blood on My Neck From Success".<ref name=selvaggio>{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/interviews/translation_mucchioselvaggio.pdf|title= "John Frusciante: Perso e Ritrovato"|format=[[Pdf]]|publisher=Il Mucchio.

Frusciante recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself.<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> He felt that it should be cut in half, with ''Usually Just a T-Shirt'' remaining untitled.<ref name=selvaggio/> The album was released on Rubin's label [[American Recordings]]. [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], the Chili Peppers' label, had rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was living as a recluse, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album on his own label.<ref name="pnt">{{cite web | last = Wilonsky | first = Robert | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/Issues/1996-12-12/music/music3.html | title = Blood on the Tracks | publisher = ''Phoenix New Times Music'' | date = [[December 12]], [[1996]] | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref>

==Reception and aftermath==

The album was not widely reviewed, and yielded mixed reactions. Steve Huey of [[All Music Guide]] said it was "an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers," and that "the sparse arrangements of the first half help set the stage for the gossamer guitar work later on."<ref name=amgreview>{{Cite web|url=http://wm10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ke0qoaeauijx|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' review|author=Huey, Steve|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> He felt ''Usually Just a T-Shirt''<U+2014>the latter half of the album<U+2014>contained "pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects."<ref name=amgreview/> Huey rated the album four out of five stars. ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' Christian Hoard, on the other hand, felt "Frusciante's eccentricities run seriously amok," and that it "sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section, but that's a minor distinction. Mostly what you get are Frusciante's acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings."<ref name=rollingstone>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/146562/review/5944990/niandra_lades__usually_just_a_tshirt|author=Hoard, Christian|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' review|publisher=''Rolling Stone''|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

Frusciante's drug addiction worsened as the years progressed. An article published by the ''[[New Times LA]]'' described him as "a skeleton covered in thin skin".<ref name="pnt"/> He participated in an interview with Dutch public broadcast station [[VPRO]]<U+2014>the first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers.<ref name=VPRO/> In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on the brain and proudly admits to being a [[junkie]]. He goes on to confess his addiction to heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine, but ultimately felt he was in the best health of his life.<ref name=VPRO/> In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album ''[[Smile From the Streets You Hold]]'', mainly for drug money.<ref name=jfsmile>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wc10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9fixqqjld0e|title=''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' review|author=Raggett, Ned|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998 after rejoining the Chili Peppers.<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> ''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' was withdrawn from the market a year later.<ref name=jfsmile>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wc10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9fixqqjld0e|title=''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' review|author=Raggett, Ned|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> In 2002 ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was re-released on American Recordings.<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> Frusciante has said he plans to re-release ''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' sometime in the future, but has not given any indication as to when.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/news.php|title="A Little Message from John to the Fans"|date=[[March 16]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref>
