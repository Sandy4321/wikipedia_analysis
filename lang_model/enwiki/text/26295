'''Miroslav "Mika" Anti<U+0107>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041C><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432> "<U+041C><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430>" <U+0410><U+043D><U+0442><U+0438><U+045B>) (March 14, 1932 <U+2013> June 24, 1986) was a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslavian]] poet, film director, journalist and painter. He was a major figure of the [[Yugoslav Black Wave]]. He had six children. His oldest son, [[Igor Anti<U+0107>]], is a visual artist.

He wrote poems, articles, dramas, movie and TV scripts and documentaries. As film-maker, he was considered as a part of the "Black Wave" of Yugoslav film. His films, in particular ''Breakfast with the devil'' in which Anti<U+0107> criticized the double morality of the communists during Tito<U+2019>s time, were forbidden and destroyed. They were rediscovered and restored in the end of the 1990s. Mika also acted in several movies and was a painter. He is well known as a bohemian.

Mika Anti<U+0107> is best known as a children and youth poet, a master of delicate and gentle sentiments. In addition to poems about [[Romani]] people with whom he identified (despite being of Serbian ancestry), because of his bohemian lifestyle, and the long poem on [[Vojvodina]] published as a separate book, he is especially well known for much recited at poetry gatherings and competitions poems about teenagers ''Plavi <U+010D>uperak'' (A Blond Lock of Hair).

==Bohemian lifestyle==

His bohemian, hard-drinking lifestyle is best illustrated by a barely translatable [[pun]] about him: 

: ''"<U+010C>ika Jova deci, <U+010D>ika Mika Anti<U+0107> dva deci"''

"<U+010C>ika Jova deci"  meaning "Uncle Jova to the children", referring to [[Jovan Jovanovi<U+0107> Zmaj]], possibly the best known children's poet.
"<U+010C>ika Mika Anti<U+0107> dva deci" means "Uncle Mika Anti<U+0107> two deciliters", referring to drinking from a glass, likely of alcohol.
