'''Bi-dimensional space''' is a geometric model of the planar projection of the physical [[universe]] in which we live.  
The two dimensions are commonly called length and width. Both directions lie in the same [[plane (geometry)|plane]].

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a [[real coordinate space|sequence of ''n'' real numbers]] can be understood as a [[point (geometry)|location]] in ''n''-dimensional space. When ''n''<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>2, the set of all such locations is called '''2-dimensional space''' or '''bi-dimensional space''', and usually is thought of as an [[Euclidean space]].

In physics, our bi-dimensional space is viewed as a planar representation of the space in which we move, described as bi-dimensional space or two-dimensional space.

==History of two-dimensional space==
[[Euclid's Elements]] dealt almost exclusively with two-dimensional geometry, developing such notions as similarity of shapes, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (Proposition 47), equality of angles and [[area]]s, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are "equal" (have the same area), among many other topics.

Later, the plane was described in a so-called ''Cartesian coordinate system'', a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]]. Each reference line is called a ''coordinate axis'' or just ''axis'' of the system, and the point where they meet is its ''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'', usually at ordered pair (0,&#8239;0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in writings by Descartes and independently by [[Pierre de Fermat]], although Fermat also worked in three dimensions, and did not publish the discovery.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=analytic geometry|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|year=2008|edition=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> Both authors used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' ''[[La G<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trie]]'' was translated into Latin in 1649 by [[Frans van Schooten]] and his students. These commentators  introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=p. 374}}</ref>

Later, the plane was thought of as a [[field (mathematics) |field]], where any two points could be multiplied and, except for 0, divided. This was known as the [[complex plane]]. The complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane because it is used in Argand diagrams. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768<U+2013>1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745<U+2013>1818).<ref>Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806. (Whittaker & Watson, 1927, p. 9)</ref> Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

===Polytopes===
{{main|Polygon}}
In two dimensions, there are infinitely many regular polytopes: the polygons. The first few are shown below:

====Convex====
The [[Schl<U+00E4>fli symbol]] {p} represents a [[Regular polygon|regular ''p''-gon]].

====Degenerate (spherical)====
The regular [[henagon]]<U+00A0>{1} and regular [[digon]]<U+00A0>{2} can be considered degenerate regular polygons. They can exist nondegenerately in non-Euclidean spaces like on a [[sphere|2-sphere]] or a [[torus|2-torus]].

====Non-convex====
There exist infinitely many non-convex regular polytopes in two dimensions, whose Schl<U+00E4>fli symbols consist of rational numbers {n/m}. They are called [[star polygon]]s and share the same [[vertex arrangement]]s of the convex regular polygons.

In general, for any natural number n, there are n-pointed non-convex regular polygonal stars with Schl<U+00E4>fli symbols {''n''/''m''} for all ''m'' such that ''m''<U+00A0><<U+00A0>''n''/2 (strictly speaking {''n''/''m''}<U+00A0>=<U+00A0>{''n''/(''n''<U+00A0><U+2212><U+00A0>''m'')}) and ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]].

===Hypersphere===
{{main|Circle}}
[[File:CIRCLE 1.svg|200px|right]]
The [[hypersphere]] in 2 dimensions is a [[circle]], sometimes called a 1-sphere<U+00A0>(''S''<sup>1</sup>) because it is an one-dimensional [[manifold]]. In a Euclidean plane, it has the length<U+00A0>2&pi;''r'' and the [[area]] of its [[interior (topology)|interior]] is
:<math>A = \pi r^{2}</math>
where <math>r</math> is the radius.

==Coordinate systems in two-dimensional spaces<!-- now correct: if a sphere included, then there is no unique 2d space -->==
{{main|Coordinate system}}

The most popular coordinate systems are the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the [[polar coordinate system]] and the [[geographic coordinate system]].

==Topological properties of the plane==
In [[topology]], the plane is characterized as being the unique [[contractible]] [[2-manifold]]. 

Its dimension is characterized by the fact that removing a point from the plane leaves a space that is connected, but not [[simply connected]].

==Planar graphs==
In [[graph theory]], a '''planar graph''' is a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] that can be [[graph embedding|embedded]] in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints.  In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory|year=1993|publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-67870-2|pages=64|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html|edition=Corrected, enlarged republication.|accessdate=8 August 2012|quote=Thus a planar graph, when drawn on a flat surface, either has no edge-crossings or can be redrawn without them.}}</ref>  Such a drawing is called a '''plane graph''' or '''planar embedding of the graph'''. A plane graph can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane, and from every edge to a [[plane curve]] on that plane, such that the extreme points of each curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on their extreme points.
