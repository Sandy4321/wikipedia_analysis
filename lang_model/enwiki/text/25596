'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[drama film]], directed by and starring [[Orson Welles]]. The film is often considered the [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest of all time]] and is particularly praised for its innovative [[cinematography]], [[Film music|music]] and narrative structure. ''Citizen Kane'' was Welles' [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award]]s in nine categories; it won an [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman Mankiewicz]] and Welles. It was released by [[RKO Pictures]].

The story is a ''[[roman <U+00E0> clef]]'' that examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based upon the American newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] and Welles' own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, the story is revealed through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud."

After his success in the theatre with his [[Mercury Players]] and his controversial 1938 radio broadcast of ''[[War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story and use his own cast and crew, and was given [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he developed the screenplay of ''Citizen Kane'' with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in [[1941 in film|1941]].

A critical success, ''Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box-office. The film faded from view soon after but its reputation was restored, initially by French critics and more widely after its American revival in 1956. There is a semi-official consensus among film critics that ''Citizen Kane'' is the greatest film ever made, which has led [[Roger Ebert]] to quip: "So it's settled: ''Citizen Kane'' is the official greatest film of all time."<ref name="ebert080904">{{cite web| last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/09/whats_your_favorite_movie.html | title=What's your favorite movie?| publisher= ''Chicago Sun-Times'' | work=Roger Ebert's Journal | date=4 September 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref> It topped both the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list and the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary Update]], as well as all of the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls of the 10 greatest films for nearly half a century.

==Plot==
Charles Foster Kane ([[Orson Welles]]), an enormously wealthy [[media proprietor]], has been living alone in his vast palatial estate [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]] for the last years of his life, with a "No trespassing" sign on the gate. He dies in a bed while holding a [[snow globe]] and utters "Rosebud..."; the globe slips from his lifeless hand and smashes. Kane's death then becomes sensational news around the world. Newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson ([[William Alland]]) tries to find out about Kane's private life and, in particular, to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks. Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander ([[Dorothy Comingore]]), now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own club, but she refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the private archive of Walter Parks Thatcher ([[George Coulouris]]), a deceased banker who served as Kane's guardian during his childhood and adolescence. It is through Thatcher's written memoirs that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. Thompson then interviews Kane's personal business manager Mr. Bernstein ([[Everett Sloane]]), best friend Jedediah Leland ([[Joseph Cotten]]), Susan for a second time, and Kane's butler Raymond ([[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]) at Xanadu.

Flashbacks reveal that Kane's childhood was spent in poverty (his parents ran a [[boarding house]]), until the "world's third largest gold mine" was discovered on an apparently worthless property his mother had acquired. He is forced to leave his mother ([[Agnes Moorehead]]) when she sends him away to live with Thatcher, to be educated. After gaining full control over his possessions at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business with sensationalized [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the newspaper, the ''New York Inquirer'', and hires all the best journalists. His attempted rise to power is documented, including his manipulation of public opinion for the [[Spanish American War]]; his first marriage to Emily Monroe Norton ([[Ruth Warrick]]), a [[President of the United States|President's]] niece; and his campaign for the office of governor of [[New York State]], for which alternative newspaper headlines are created depending on the result.

Kane's marriage disintegrates over the years, and he begins an affair with Susan Alexander. Both his wife and his opponent discover the affair, simultaneously ending his marriage and his political career. Kane marries his mistress, and forces her into an [[opera]]tic career for which she has no talent or ambition. She attempts [[suicide]], and eventually, after a span of time spent in boredom and isolation in Xanadu, leaves him.

Kane spends his last years building his vast estate and lives alone, interacting only with his staff. The butler recounts that Kane had said "Rosebud" after Susan left him, right after seeing a snow globe.

At Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being catalogued, most of which are practically worthless. During this time, Thompson finds that he is unable to solve the mystery and concludes that "Rosebud" will forever remain an enigma. He theorizes that "Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost." In the ending of the film, it is revealed to the audience that Rosebud was the name of the [[sled]] from Kane's childhood - an allusion to the only time in his life when he was truly happy. The sled, thought to be junk, is burned and destroyed by Xanadu's departing staff in a basement furnace.

The film's end credits read "Most of the principal actors are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them."<ref name="AFIcat"/> Welles along with his partner [[John Houseman]] had assembled them into a group known as the Mercury Players to perform his productions in the Mercury Theatre in 1937. After accepting his Hollywood contract in 1939, Welles worked between Los Angeles and New York where the Mercury Theatre continued their weekly radio broadcasts for ''[[The Campbell Playhouse]]''.<ref name="shadows"/> Welles had wanted all the Mercury Players to debut in his first film, but the cancellation of ''The Heart of Darkness'' project in December 1939 created a financial crisis for the group and some of the actors worked elsewhere.<ref name="shadows"/> This caused friction between Welles and Houseman, and their partnership ended.<ref name="shadows">{{cite book|title=Walking Shadows: Orson Welles, William Randolph Hearst and Citizen Kane|last=Walsh|first=John Evangelist|pages=31<U+2013>37|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=978-0299205003|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref>

RKO executives were dismayed that so many of the major roles went to unknowns, but Welles's contract left them with no say in the matter. The film features debuts from William Alland, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warrick and Welles himself. An uncredited [[Alan Ladd]] appears as one of the newspaper reporters.

==Production==
===Development===
Orson Welles' notoriety following ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' broadcast earned him [[Hollywood]]'s interest, and [[RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer's]] unusual contract.<ref name=anatomy>{{cite video | people = [[Barry Norman]] (host) | title = Anatomy of a Classic | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios|Universal]] |date= 2003}}</ref> Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939 to produce, direct, write, and act in two feature films.<ref name="carringer">Carringer 1996, p. 1.</ref> The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000.

The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there."<ref name="carringer2">Carringer 1996, p. 15.</ref> First, Welles tried to adapt ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with [[point of view shot]]s. Welles considered adapting [[Cecil Day-Lewis]]' novel ''The Smiler With The Knife'', but realized that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.<ref name=empire>{{cite news|author=[[Kim Newman|Newman, Kim]]|coauthors=[[Ian Freer]], Rob Fraser|title=Citizen Kane|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 2003|pages=146 to 156}}</ref>

Screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was recuperating from a car accident and in-between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on ''The Campbell Playhouse'' radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles' film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on ''Citizen Kane'' and needed the job.<ref name="carringer3">Carringer 1996, p. 16</ref> There is dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use William Randolph Hearst as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. Welles claimed it was his idea while film critic [[Pauline Kael]] (in her essay "Raising Kane"<ref>Reprinted in Kael, et al ''The Citizen Kane Book'', Little, Brown, 1971</ref>) and Welles' former business partner [[John Houseman]] claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea.<ref name="carringer4">Carringer 1996, p. 17.</ref> For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure&nbsp;<U+2013> perhaps a gangster&nbsp;<U+2013> whose story would be told by the people that knew him.<ref name="Callow">Callow 1995, p. 484.</ref>

Mankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, ''The Tree Will Grow'' about [[John Dillinger]]. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character.<ref name="Callow"/> Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and Marion Davies.<ref name="Callow"/> Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer's drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused.<ref name="carringer4"/> Welles also sought inspiration from [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Samuel Insull]] (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.<ref name=empire/>

During production, ''Citizen Kane'' was referred to as ''RKO 281''. Most of the filming took place between June 29, 1940 and October 23, 1940 in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount lot in [[Hollywood]]. There was some location filming with [[Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-12-09/things-to-do/me-and-orson-welles-star-christian-mckay-brings-legend-to-life|title=Me and Orson Welles' star Christian McKay brings legend to life|publisher=SDNN.com|accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref> [[San Diego Zoo]] and [[Oheka Castle]] in [[Huntington, New York]] representing Kane's San Simeon estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oheka.com/index.php?page=filmtvphoto|title=Oheka Castle - Film, TV & Still Photography|publisher=Oheka.com|accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref> Welles prevented studio executives of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. Welles' RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.<ref name="AFIcat"/>

===Pre-release controversy===
Welles ran a closed set, limited access to rushes and managed the publicity of ''Kane'' to make sure that its influence from Hearst's life was a secret.<ref name="carringer29">Carringer 1996, p. 111.</ref> Publicity materials stated the film's inspiration was ''[[Faust]]''.<ref name=empire/> RKO hoped to release the film in mid-February 1941. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941. ''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on [[Louella Parsons]], Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers, and made a fool of her in public. Reportedly, she was furious and demanded an immediate preview of the film. [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]], who was present at the screening, said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called George Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released ''Kane''.<ref name="carringer29"/> The next day, the front page headline in ''Daily Variety'' read, "HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS."<ref name="dailyvariety">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Hearst Bans RKO From Papers | pages = | language = | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] | date = January 10, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> In two weeks, the ban was lifted for everything except ''Kane."<ref name="carringer29"/>

''The Hollywood Reporter'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios in order to force RKO to shelve ''Kane''.<ref name="carringer29"/> Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Scheck, head of MGM's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of [[Louis B. Mayer]] and other Hollywood executives to reimburse RKO if it would destroy the film.<ref name="carringer30">Carringer 1996, p. 111<U+2013>112.</ref> Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that ''Kane'' would be released as scheduled and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers.<ref name="carringer31">Carringer 1996, p. 112.</ref> There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst.<ref name="carringer32">Carringer 1996, p. 112<U+2013>113.</ref> Welles agreed and Wise was brought in to cut the film's running time from two hours, two minutes and 40 seconds to one hour, 59 minutes and 16 seconds. This cut of ''Kane'' satisfied the corporate lawyers.<ref name="carringer33">Carringer 1996, p. 113.</ref>

==Screenplay==
===Development===
====Mankiewicz as co-writer====
Richard Carringer, author of ''The Making of Citizen Kane'' (1996), described the early stages of the screenplay:
:"Welles's first step toward the realization of ''Citizen Kane'' was to seek the assistance of a screenwriting professional. Fortunately, help was near at hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When Welles moved to Hollywood, it happened that a veteran screenwriter, [[Herman Mankiewicz]], was recuperating from an automobile accident and between jobs... Mankiewicz was an expatriate from Broadway who had been writing for films for almost fifteen years."<ref name=Carringer/>{{Rp|16|date=May 2009}}

However, according to film author Harlan Lebo, he was also "one of Hollywood's most notorious personalities."<ref name=Lebo>Lebo, Harlan. ''Citizen Kane: Fiftieth Anniversary Album'', Doubleday Publishing (1990)</ref>{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Mankiewicz was the older brother of producer-director [[Joseph Mankiewicz]] and was a former writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' and had moved to Hollywood in 1926. By the time Welles contacted him he had "established himself as a brilliant wit, a writer of extraordinary talent, [and] a warm friend to many of the screen world's brightest artists&nbsp;... [he] produced dialogue of the highest caliber."<ref name=Lebo/>{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Yet Mankiewicz's behavior, according to Welles's close friend and associate [[John Houseman]], was also a "public and private scandal. A neurotic and homophobic drinker and compulsive gambler..." Houseman adds, however, that he was also one of the most intelligent, informed, witty, humane and charming men I have ever known."<ref name=Lebo/>{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Despite those apparent contradictions in his personality, Welles "recognized the writer's abilities and trusted him to produce", wrote Lebo. Orson Welles himself later commented, "Nobody was more miserable, more bitter, and funnier than Mank<U+2014>a perfect monument to self-destruction. But when the bitterness wasn't focused straight at you &ndash; he was the best company in the world."<ref name=Lebo/>

====Ideas and collaboration====
According to film historian Clinton Heylin, "the idea of ''Citizen Kane'' was the original conception of Orson Welles, who in early 1940 first discussed the idea with [[John Houseman]], who then suggested that both he and Welles leave for Los Angeles and discuss the idea with scriptwriter [[Herman Mankiewicz]]. He adds that Mankiewicz "probably believed that Welles had little experience as an original scriptwriter...[and] may even have felt that ''John Citizen USA'', Welles's working title, was a project he could make his own."<ref name=Heylin>Heylin, Clinton. ''Despite the System: Orson Welles Versus the Hollywood Studios'', Chicago Review Press (2006)</ref>{{Rp|43|date=May 2009}}
Orson Welles said that his preparation before making Citizen Kane was to watch [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' forty times.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Still incapacitated with a broken leg, Mankiewicz was happy to work with Welles, and an "alliance" formed, noted Houseman. This combination of a "brash new director, a nervous studio, and an erratic genius" gave birth to ''Citizen Kane'', in what Houseman called, "an absurd venture."<ref name=Lebo/>{{Rp|14|date=May 2009}}

Houseman recalled that Mankiewicz, during his convalescence, had "revived a long-simmering idea of creating a film biography in which a man's life would be brought to the screen after his death through the memories and opinions of the people who knew him best." And Welles himself, writes Lebo, also had ideas "that meshed well with this concept and had considered a newspaper publisher the best subject for the story:

:"I'd been nursing an old notion<U+2014>the idea of telling the same thing several times<U+2014>and showing exactly the same thing from wholly different views", Welles said. "Mank liked it, so we started searching for the man it was going to be about&nbsp;... some big American figure&nbsp;... [[Howard Hughes]] was the first idea. But we got pretty quickly to the press lords."<ref name=Lebo/>{{Rp|14|date=May 2009}}

Welles then assigned Mankiewicz, writes Lebo, "to work on an original screenplay<U+2014>not an adaptation as his first two projects would have been." Welles next traveled to New York and desperately "pleaded and persuaded Houseman to return to Los Angeles to manage Mankiewicz and his writing schedule."<ref name=Lebo/>

====Hearst as story model====
According to film critic and author Pauline Kael, Mankiewicz "was already caught up in the idea of a movie about Hearst" when he was still working at the ''New York Times'', in 1925. She learned from his family's babysitter, Marion Fisher, that she once typed as "he dictated a screenplay, organized in flashbacks. She recalls that he had barely started on the dictation, which went on for several weeks, when she remarked that it seemed to be about William Randolph Hearst, and he said, 'You're a smart girl.'"<ref name=Kael1/>{{Rp|269|date=May 2009}}

In Hollywood, Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred.<ref name="Callow"/> And Hearst was also a person known to Welles. "Once that was decided", wrote author Don Kilbourne, "Mankiewicz, Welles, and [[John Houseman]], a cofounder of the Mercury Theatre, rented a place in the desert, and the task of creating ''Citizen Kane'' began."<ref name=Kilbourne>Kilbourne, Don. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography: American Screenwriters'', Gale Research Co. (1984)</ref>{{Rp|221|date=May 2009}} This "place in the desert" was on the historic Verde ranch on the Mojave River in Victorville. In later years, Houseman gave Mankiewicz "total" credit for "the creation of ''Citizen Kane's'' script" and credited Welles with "the visual presentation of the picture."<ref name=Lebo/>{{Rp|32|date=May 2009}}

Mankiewicz was put under contract by [[Mercury Theater|Mercury Productions]] and was to receive no credit for his work as he was hired as a script doctor. According to his contract with RKO, Welles would be given sole screenplay credit, and had already written a rough script consisting of 300 pages of dialogue with occasional stage directions under the title of ''John Citizen, USA''.<ref name="Callow"/><!--

The sled, being used by Kane to attack Thatcher when taken away from his parents, may also explain his later attitude towards life (including his relationship with his friends and women, his lust for power and his sometimes irrational behaviour). It seems to be that deprivation of his mother's care and love, the ruthless raising by Thatcher which resulted in an abnormal childhood, combined with unwanted wealth, had a traumatic impact upon his character. He felt unloved, and therefore sought love aggressively, at any cost, be it from his wives, the public, his friends. His collapse is a result of his failure to fulfill this inner urge of his. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}-->

===Debate over authorship===

John Houseman (right) is holding screenplay pages.]]
One of the long standing debates of ''Citizen Kane'' has been the proper accreditation of the authorship of the screenplay, which the credits attribute to both [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and [[Orson Welles]]. Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes, including the way the movie was promoted. For instance, when RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1, 1941, followed by showings at theaters in other large cities, the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of Welles as "the one-man band, directing, acting, and writing." In a letter to his father afterward, Mankiewicz wrote, "I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writing &ndash; writing from and by me &ndash; before ever a camera turned."<ref name=Meryman>Meryman, Richard. ''Mank'', William Morrow, (1978)</ref>{{Rp|270|date=May 2009}} Film historian Otto Friedrich said it made Mankiewicz "unhappy to hear Welles quoted in [[Louella Parsons]]'s column, before the question of screen credits was officially settled, as saying, 'So I wrote ''Citizen Kane''.'"<ref name=Friedrich/>

According to film critic [[Pauline Kael]], Rita Alexander, who was hired to be Mankiewicz's personal secretary, stated that she "took the dictation from Mankiewicz from the first paragraph to the last&nbsp;... and later did the final rewriting and the cuts, and handled the script at the studio until after the film was shot. ...[and said] Welles didn't write (or dictate) one line of the shooting script of ''Citizen Kane.'' She added that "Welles himself came to dinner once or twice...[and] she didn't meet him until after Mankiewicz had finished dictating the long first draft."<ref name=Kael1/>{{Rp|273|date=May 2009}} However Welles had his own secretary, Katherine Trosper, who typed up Welles' suggestions and corrections, which were incorporated into the final script; Kael did not interview Trosper before producing her article.<ref name="Arena">BBC, ''Arena: The Orson Welles Story'', 1982</ref>

Nevertheless, Mankiewicz went to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and declared that he was the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along, but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit."<ref name=Friedrich>Friedrich, Otto, ''City of Nets&nbsp;<U+2014> a portrait of Hollywood in 1940s'', (1986) Harper & Row</ref> According to Pauline Kael, "he had ample proof of his authorship, and when he took his evidence to the Screen Writers Guild&nbsp;... Welles was forced to split the credit and take second place in the listing."<ref name=Kael1>Kael, Pauline. ''For Keeps'', Penguin Books (1994), republished section from ''Raising Kane'', 1971</ref>{{Rp|274|date=May 2009}} 

However, Charles Lederer, a screenwriter and a source for Kael's article, insisted that the credit never came to the Writer's Guild for arbitration. In a famous 15page article written by Peter Bogdanovich for Esquire Magazine, a rebuttal to Kael's claim for Mankiewicz as the true author of the film, first published in 1972 as "The Kane Mutiny", Lederer noted that the Writer's Guild of America had guidelines to ensure proper procedure was followed regarding assigning the credit for the film and if such a case arrived than the Guild might well have given Welles full credit. Bogdanovich notes that Welles constantly re-wrote and re-shaped Mankiewicz's ideas during the pre-production and production processes and he also noted that Kael's article was poorly researched as it did not consult anyone involved in the actual production of the film such as Katherine Trosper, Welles' secretary, Richard Barr, the film's associate producer and misquoted Lederer who claimed that Kael vastly distorted what he said. [THIS IS ORSON WELLES, Introduction : My Orson, pages xxii-xxvii. DA CAPO Press, 1998 edition]. 

Kael argues that Mankiewicz was the true author of the screenplay and therefore responsible for much of what made the movie great. This angered many critics of the day, most notably critic-turned-filmmaker (and close friend of Welles) [[Peter Bogdanovich]], who rebutted many of Kael's claims in an article for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' titled ''The Kane Mutiny'', and [[Robert L. Carringer]], who did likewise in an article for the Winter 1978 edition of ''[[Critical Enquiry (magazine)|Critical Enquiry]]'', referring to early script drafts with Welles' incorporated handwritten contributions.

By the time the movie was released, however, Mankiewicz's contribution to the film was generally known, according to Kael. The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote the credit as "Written by Herman Mankiewicz;" Burns Mantle, in his newspaper column, referred to Mankiewicz having written it; and [[Ben Hecht]] wrote, "This movie was not written by Orson Welles. It is the work of Herman J. Mankiewicz." Kael noted in 1971 that "Under the present rules of the Guild, Welles's name would probably not have appeared."<ref name=Kael1/> She also came to an ironic conclusion:

{{bquote|And so it was by an awful fluke of justice that when Academy Awards night came, and Welles should have got the awards he deserved as director and actor, the award he got (the only Academy Award he has ever got) was as co-author of the Best Original Screenplay.}}

According to film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], however, "No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay, but no one who has seen the film as often as it deserves to be seen would dream that Welles is not its only begetter."<ref name=Thomson>{{cite book| first=David | last=Thomson | title= A New Biographical Dictionary of Film| location= London| publisher= Little Brown | year=2002 | page=924}}</ref> Carringer considered that at least three scenes were solely Welles' work and, after weighing both sides of the argument, including sworn testimony from Mercury assistant Richard Baer, concluded, "We will probably never know for sure, but in any case Welles had at last found a subject with the right combination of monumentality, timeliness, and audacity."<ref name=Carringer>Carringer, Robert L. ''The Making of Citizen Kane'', (2nd ed., revised) University of California Press (1996)</ref>{{Rp|17|date=May 2009}} Harlan Lebo agrees, and adds, "of far greater relevance is reaffirming the importance of the efforts that both men contributed to the creation of Hollywood's greatest motion picture."<ref name="Lebo"/>{{Rp|32|date=May 2009}}

[[French New Wave]] filmmaker and auteur [[Jean-Luc Godard]] said on the topic of Orson Welles, "Everyone will always owe him everything."

==Sources==
===Charles Foster Kane===
====William Randolph Hearst====
Welles never confirmed who the principal source was for the character of Charles Foster Kane. It is believed that he is a synthesis of different personalities although main inspiration was the life of media tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]].<ref name="PBS">Epstein, Michael and Thomas Lennon. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kane2/kane2ts.html "The Battle Over Citizen Kane."] ''[[PBS]]'', 1996. Retrieved: January 14, 2008.</ref> The film is seen by critics as a fictionalized, unrelentingly hostile [[parody]] of Hearst. According to film historian Don Kilbourne, "much of the information for ''Citizen Kane'' came from already-published material about Hearst... [and] some of Kane's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst's. When Welles denied that the film was about the still-influential publisher, he did not convince many people."<ref name="Kilbourne"/>{{Rp|222|date=May 2009}}

Welles himself insisted that there were also differences between the men. In 1968, he told [[Peter Bogdanovich]], "You know, the real story of Hearst is quite different from Kane's. And Hearst himself <U+2014> as a man, I mean <U+2014> was very different." Hearst's biographer, David Nasaw, finds the film's depiction of Hearst unfair:
<blockquote>Welles' ''Kane'' is a cartoon-like caricature of a man who is hollowed out on the inside, forlorn, defeated, solitary because he cannot command the total obedience, loyalty, devotion, and love of those around him. Hearst, to the contrary, never regarded himself as a failure, never recognized defeat, never stopped loving Marion [Davies] or his wife. He did not, at the end of his life, run away from the world to entomb himself in a vast, gloomy art-choked hermitage.<ref name="Nasaw">{{cite news | last = Nasaw | first = David | coauthors = | title = The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst | work = | page = 574 | language = | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref></blockquote>

====Samuel Insull====
''Citizen Kane'' is in part based on the life of [[Samuel Insull]] and his wife Gladys. Playwright Herman J. Mankiewicz based Susan Alexander's catastrophic operatic debut in ''Citizen Kane'' on Gladys Wallis Insull's New York role as Lady Teazle in a charity revival of ''[[The School for Scandal]]''.<ref>Higham, Charles, ''Orson Welles: Rise and Fall of an American Genius'', (2002)</ref> Jed Leland's review of Susan Alexander's debut in ''Kane'' echoes Mankiewicz's actual 1925 review of Gladys Insull. His 1925 review began: "As Lady Teazle, Mrs. Insull is as pretty as she is diminutive; with a clear smile and dainty gestures. There is a charming grace in her bearing that makes for excellent deportment. But Lady Teazle seems much too innocent to lend credit to her part in the play."

====Welles as Kane====
[[File:Orson Welles-Citizen Kane1.jpg|alt=A mustachioed man in a suit leans on a lectern and points to his right. Behind him to the left is a large picture of himself wearing a hat.|thumb|right|250px|Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane]]
There are autobiographical elements to the film. Orson Welles lost his mother when he was nine years old and his father when he was 15. After this, he became the ward of Chicago's Dr. Maurice Bernstein; Bernstein is the last name of the only major character in ''Citizen Kane'' who receives a generally positive portrayal.

===Susan Alexander===
Movie tycoon [[Jules Brulatour]]'s second and third wives, [[Dorothy Gibson]] and [[Hope Hampton]], both fleeting stars of the silent screen who later had marginal careers in opera, are believed to have provided inspiration for the Susan Alexander character.

Welles also claimed that business tycoon [[Harold Fowler McCormick]]'s lavish promotion of his second wife, [[Ganna Walska]], was a direct influence on the screenplay. McCormick spent thousands of dollars on voice lessons for her and even arranged for Walska to take the lead in a production of ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' at the Chicago Opera in 1920. Like the Susan Alexander character, she had a terrible voice, pleasing only to McCormick. But unlike Alexander, Walska got into an argument with director Pietro Cimini during dress rehearsal and stormed out of the production before she appeared. [[Roger Ebert]], in his DVD commentary on ''Citizen Kane'', also suggests that the Alexander character was based on Walska, and had very little to do with [[Marion Davies]].<ref name="Ebertcommentary"/> The film's composer, [[Bernard Herrmann]], also suggested that Kane is based on McCormick but also in great part on Welles himself.<ref name="americancomposers"/>

===Jim Gettys===
The character of political boss Jim Gettys is based on [[Charles F. Murphy]],<ref name="Murphy">{{Cite book | publisher = Methuen | isbn = 9780413582904 | last = Mankiewicz | first = Herman Jacob | coauthors = Orson Welles, Pauline Kael | title = The Citizen Kane book | year = 1985 }}</ref> a political leader in New York City's infamous [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, who was an enemy of Hearst. In one scene Gettys admonishes Kane for printing a cartoon showing him in prison stripes. This is based on the fact that Murphy, who was a horse-cart driver and owned several bars, was depicted in a 1903 Hearst cartoon wearing striped prison clothes.<ref name="Murphy"/> A caption, referring to the restaurant Murphy frequented, said: "Look out, Murphy. It's a short lock-step from [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico's]] to [[Sing Sing]]."

===Rosebud===
According to Welles author David Thomson, "Rosebud is the greatest secret in cinema..."<ref name=Thomson/>{{Rp|801|date=May 2009}}<ref>Thomson, David, ''The Story of Orson Welles'' (1996) Vintage Books</ref>

Orson Welles, explaining the idea behind the word "Rosebud", said, "It's a gimmick, really, a rather tawdry device, a dollar-book [[Freudian psychology|Freudian]] gag."<ref>Kael, Pauline, ''The Citizen Kane Book'', Boston, 1971).</ref> Three "Rosebud" sleds were used in production, of which only one was not burned.

According to Louis Pizzitola, author of ''Hearst Over Hollywood'', "Rosebud" was a nickname that Orrin Peck, a friend of William Randolph Hearst, gave to his mother, Phoebe Hearst.<ref name="Pizzitola">Pizzitola, Louis. [http://www.hearstoverhollywood.com "Hearst Over Hollywood."] [[Columbia University]] Press, 2002.</ref> It was said that Phoebe was as close, or even closer, to Orrin than she was to her own son, lending a bitter-sweet element to the word's use in a film about a boy being separated from his mother's love.

In 1989, essayist [[Gore Vidal]] cited contemporary rumors that "Rosebud" was a nickname Hearst used for his mistress [[Marion Davies]]; a reference to her [[clitoris]],<ref name="Vidal">Vidal, Gore. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4016 "Remembering Orson Welles."] ''[[New York Times]]'', June 1, 1989. Retrieved: 14 January 2008.</ref><ref name="Vidal2">Vidal, Gore. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3942 "Rosebud."] ''[[New York Times]]'', August 17, 1989. Retrieved: 14 January 2008.</ref> a claim repeated as fact in the 1996 documentary ''The Battle Over Citizen Kane'' and again in the 1999 dramatic film ''[[RKO 281]]''.
Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] has been a bit more specific than Vidal about the source, saying on his commentary track for the September 2001 DVD release that "[[Herman J. Mankiewicz|Herman Mankiewicz]], the co-author with Welles of the screenplay, happened to know that "Rosebud" was William Randolph Hearst's [[pet name]] for an intimate part of Marion Davies' anatomy."<ref name="Ebertcommentary">{{cite video |people= Ebert, Roger |date= 2001 |title=Audio Commentary |medium= DVD |publisher=Turner Entertainment/Warner Home Video |time=2:48 |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=Some people have fallen in love with the story that Herman Mankiewicz, the co-author with Welles of the screenplay, happened to know that "Rosebud" was William Randolph Hearst's pet name for Marion Davies' cliterus. |ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= A Viewer's Companion to 'Citizen Kane' | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040101/COMMENTARY/401010335 | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date= January 1, 2004 | last=Ebert | first=Roger |  accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref>  A resultant joke noted, with heavy innuendo, that Hearst and/or Kane died "with 'Rosebud' on his lips."<ref name="PBS"/>

==Filmmaking innovations==
===Cinematography===
[[Image:Citizen Kane deep focus.jpg|alt=A stern looking man and a woman sit on the right side of a table with documents on the table. A top hat is on the table. An unkempt man stands to the left of the picture. In the background a boy can be seen through a window playing in the snow.|thumb|right|A deep focus shot: everything, including the hat in the foreground and the boy (young Kane) in the distance, is in sharp focus.]]Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles' attempt to create a new style of [[filmmaking]] by studying various forms of movie making, and combining them all into one. The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]].<ref name="Ogle">{{cite news | last = Ogle | first = Patrick L | coauthors = Bill Nichols | title = Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States | work = Movies and Methods | page = 73 | language = | publisher = [[University of California]] Press | year = 1985 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. This was done by cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Specifically, Toland often used telephoto lenses to shoot close-up scenes. Any time deep focus was impossible&nbsp;<U+2014> for example in the scene when Kane finishes a bad review of Alexander's opera while at the same time firing the person who started the review&nbsp;<U+2014> an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus (visually layering one piece of film onto another). However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous example of the scene where Kane breaks into Susan Alexander's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way [[low-angle shot]]s were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes.<ref name="Toland">{{cite news | last = Toland | first = Gregg | coauthors = | title = The Motion Picture Cameraman | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Theater Arts magazine |date = September 1941| url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 | accessdate = 2008-01-14 }}</ref> Since movies were primarily filmed on [[sound stage]]s and not on location during the era of the [[Hollywood]] [[studio system]], it was impossible to film at an angle that showed ceilings because the stages had none. In some instances, Welles' crew used [[muslin]] draped above the set to produce the illusion of a regular room with a ceiling, while the boom microphones were hidden above the cloth and even dug a trench into the floor to allow the low-angle shot to be used in the scene where Kane meets Leland after his election loss.<ref>{{cite book|title=Orson Welles's citizen Kane: a casebook|publisher=OUP USA|last=Naremore|first=James|isbn=978-0195158915|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref>

Toland had approached Welles in 1940 to work on ''Citizen Kane''. Welles' reputation for experimentation in the theatre appealed to Toland and he found a sympathetic partner to "test and prove several ideas generally being accepted as radical in Hollywood".<ref name="AFIcat"/>

===Storytelling techniques===

''Citizen Kane'' eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.<ref name="watched">{{cite book|title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique|first=Marilyn|last=Fabe|publisher=University of California Press|pages=81<U+2013>84|isbn=978-0520238916|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood movies.<ref name="watched"/> Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping.<ref name="politics"/> The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a [[communist]] and a [[fascist]].<ref name="watched"/> The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films such as ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' in 1939 and ''[[The Power and the Glory (film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' in 1933 but no film was so immersed in this technique as ''Citizen Kane''. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.<ref name="politics">{{cite book|title=Politics and politicians in American film|first=Phillip L|last=Gianos|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=170<U+2013>184|isbn=978-0275967666|year=1999|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref>

One of the narrative voices is the ''News on the March'' segment.<ref name="watched"/> Its stilted dialogue and portentous voiceover is a parody of ''[[The March of Time]]'' newsreel series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/wood/mot/html/kane.htm|title=Citizen Kane and other imitators|publisher=University of Virginia|author=Mary Wood|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> which itself references an earlier newsreel which showed the 85-year old arms czar [[Sir Basil Zaharoff]] getting wheeled to his train. Welles had earlier provided voiceovers for ''the March of Time'' radio show. ''Citizen Kane'' makes extensive use of stock footage to create the newsreel.

One of the story-telling techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space. Using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in 5 vignettes, which takes 16 years of story time and condenses it into two minutes of screen time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches|first=Linda|last=Costanzo Cahir|pages=59<U+2013>60|publisher=McFarland & Co|isbn=978-0786425976|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref>

====Special effects====
Welles also pioneered several visual effects in order to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene where the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for the second Mrs. Kane's performance was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]]. A loud, full-screen closeup of a typewriter typing a single word ("weak"), magnifies the review for the ''Chicago Inquirer''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas, Fran<U+00E7>ois|editor=Naremore, James|title=Citizen Kane: The Sound Track, in Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&pg=PA173|page=173|publisher=Oxford University Press via Google Books limited preview|location=US|isbn=0-1951-5891-1|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref>

====Makeup====
The non-union make up artist Maurice Seiderman created the make-up for the film.<ref name=anatomy/> RKO wanted the young Kane to look handsome and dashing, and Seiderman transformed the already-overweight Welles, beginning with his nose, which Welles always disliked. Welles was as made up as a young man as he was an old man, and could barely move. For the old Kane, Seiberman created a red plastic compound which he applied to Welles, allowing the wrinkles to move naturally.<ref name=anatomy/> Kane's mustache was made of several hair tufts. Transforming Welles into the old Kane required six to seven hours, meaning he had to start at two in the morning to begin filming at nine, meaning he held conferences in the make-up chair, and would also work a total of 16 hours a day. Even breaking a leg during filming could not stop him from directing around-the-clock, and he quickly returned to acting, using a steel leg bracer.<ref name=anatomy/>

====Soundtrack====
Welles brought his experience with sound from radio along to filmmaking, producing a layered and complex soundtrack. In one scene, the elderly Kane strikes Susan in a tent on the beach, and the two characters silently glower at each other while a woman at the nearby party can be heard hysterically laughing in the background, her giddiness in grotesque counterpoint to the misery of Susan and Kane. Elsewhere, Welles skillfully employed reverberation to create a mood, such as the chilly echo of the monumental Thatcher library, where the reporter is confronted by an intimidating, officious librarian.

In addition to expanding on the potential of sound as a creator of moods and emotions, Welles pioneered a new aural technique, known as the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. In offering a continuous sound track, Welles was able to join what would otherwise be extremely rough cuts together into a smooth narrative. For example, the audience witnesses Kane grow from a child into a young man in just two [[shot (film)|shots]]. As Kane's guardian hands him his sled, Kane begrudgingly wishes him a "Merry Christmas". Suddenly we are taken to a shot of his guardian fifteen years later, only to have the phrase completed for us: "and a Happy New Year". In this case, the continuity of the soundtrack, not the image, is what makes for a seamless narrative structure.<ref>Cook, 330.</ref>

Welles also carried over techniques from radio not yet popular in the movies (though they would become staples). Using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, the result gave the impression of a whole town talking&nbsp;<U+2014> and, equally important, what the town was talking about. Welles also favored the overlapping of dialogue, considering it more realistic than the stage and movie tradition of characters not stepping on each other's sentences. He also pioneered the technique of putting the audio ahead of the visual in scene transitions (a [[J-cut]]); as a scene would come to a close, the audio would transition to the next scene before the visuals did.

===Music===
In common with using personnel he had previously worked with in the Mercury Theatre, Welles recruited his close friend [[Bernard Herrmann]] to score Citizen Kane.<ref name="herrmann"/> Herrmann was a longtime collaborator with Welles, providing music for almost all his radio broadcasts including ''The Fall of the City'' (1937) and the ''War of the Worlds'' (1938) broadcast.<ref name="stephensmith"/> The film was Herrmann's first motion picture score<ref name="herrmann">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemusicuk.us/herrmann.htm|publisher=Moviemusicuk.us|title=Bernard Herrmann|accessdate=2009-01-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and would be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]], but would lose out to his own score for the film ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)|All That Money Can Buy]]''.<ref name="herrmann"/>

Herrmann's score for Citizen Kane was a watershed in film soundtrack composition and proved as influential as any of the film's other innovations, establishing him as an important voice in film soundtrack composition.<ref name="americancomposers">{{cite web|url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_herrmann.htm|title=American Composers Orchestra&nbsp;<U+2014> David Raksin remembers his colleagues|publisher=Americancomposers.org|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref><ref name="stephensmith">{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Stephen C.|title= A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann|publisher= [[University of California Press]] |year= 2002 |pages= 76<U+2013>84|isbn= 0520229398}}</ref> The score eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues which typically lasted between five and fifteen seconds to bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotiv]] played by low [[woodwind]]s, including a quartet of bass [[flutes]].<ref name="stephensmith"/> Much of the music used in the newsreel was taken from other sources; examples include the ''News on the March'' music which was taken from RKO's music library, ''Belgian March'' by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], and accompanies the newsreel titles; and an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' which is used as the background for the exploration of Xanadu.<ref name="stephensmith"/> In the final sequence of the film, which shows the destruction of Rosebud in the fireplace of Kane's castle, Welles choreographed the scene while he had Herrmann's cue playing on the set.<ref name="alexross">
{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/27/050627crmu_music|title=Sound and Vision: The New Yorker|publisher=NewYorker.com|
accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>

For the operatic sequence which exposed Kane's protege Susan Alexander for the amateur she was, Herrmann composed a quasi-romantic scene, ''Aria from Salammb<U+00F4>''.<ref name="americancomposers"/> There did exist two treatments of this work by [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s 1862 novel, including an opera by [[Ernest Reyer]] and an incomplete treatment by [[Modeste Mussorgsky]]. However, Herrmann made no reference to existing music. Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.<ref name="americancomposers"/><ref name="stephensmith"/> Herrmann said he wanted to convey the impression of "a terrified girl floundering in the quicksand of a powerful orchestra".<ref name="americancomposers"/> On the soundtrack it was soprano [[Jean Forward]] who actually sang the vocal part for actress [[Dorothy Comingore]].<ref name="americancomposers"/>

In 1972 Herrmann said "I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!"<ref name="stephensmith"/> Shortly before his death in 1985, Welles told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that that the score was fifty per cent responsible for the film's artistic success.<ref name="stephensmith"/>

However, Herrmann was vocal in his criticism of Pauline Kael's claim that it was Mankiewicz, not Welles, who made the main thrust of the film, and also her assumptions about the use of music in the film without consulting him:
:Pauline Kael has written in ''The Citizen Kane Book'' (1971), that the production wanted to use Massenet's "Thais" but could not afford the fee. "But Miss Kael never wrote or approached me to ask about the music. We could easily have afforded the fee. The point is that its lovely little strings would not have served the emotional purpose of the film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=176 |title=The Orson Welles Web Resource <U+00BB> Blog Archive <U+00BB> BERNARD HERRMANN on working with ORSON WELLES and CITIZEN KANE |publisher=Wellesnet |date=2007-06-24 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>

Opera lovers are frequently amused by the parody of vocal coaching that appears in a singing lesson given to Susan Alexander by Signor Matiste. The character attempts to sing the famous cavatina "Una voce poco fa" from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]], but the lesson is interrupted when Alexander sings a high note flat.

An uncredited [[Nat King Cole]] is believed to provide the music in two key scenes in the film. He can be heard playing piano, but not singing, "This Can't Be Love" (actually sung by Alton Redd),<ref name="Meeker"/> in the scene where Susan fights with Kane.<ref name="Naremore">{{cite book|title=Orson Welle's Citizen Kane:a casebook|author=Naremore,James|isbn=0195158911}}</ref> Welles heard him playing at a bar and created the scene around the song.<ref name="Naremore"/>{{Rp|28-29|date=May 2010}} Unconfirmed reports suggest he can also be heard playing in the scene where Thompson questions a down-at-heel Susan in the nightclub she works;<ref name="Meeker"/> however, Bernard Herrmann denied any knowledge of this to musicologist David Meeker.<ref name="Meeker">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.jots.200014490/default.html|title=CITIZEN KANE/Orson Welles Bibliographic Record Brief Display|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>

===Release and contemporary responses===
''Citizen Kane'' was supposed to open at [[Radio City Music Hall]] but did not because Parsons told [[Nelson Rockefeller]] that if the film was screened, Hearst's ''American Weekly'' magazine would run a negative article about his grandfather.<ref name="carringer34">Carringer 1996, p. 115.</ref> Other exhibitors feared retaliation and refused to handle the film. Schaefer lined up a few theaters but Welles grew impatient and threatened RKO with a lawsuit. Hearst papers refused to accept advertising for the film. ''Kane'' opened at the RKO Palace on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in [[Chicago]] on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8.<ref name="carringer34"/> ''Kane'' did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles' film as part of a package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst.<ref name="carringer35">Carringer 1996, p. 117.</ref> The film lost $150,000 during its initial run.<ref name=empire/>

The reviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive, although some reviewers were challenged by Welles' break with Hollywood traditions.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8231805 SCREEN REALISM MAY BE A LITTLE TOO REAL] Argus 7 February 1942, Supplement page 6</ref> Kate Cameron, in her review for the ''New York Daily-News'', said that ''Kane'' was "one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio".<ref name="Cameron">{{cite news | last = Cameron | first = Kate | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'' | pages = | language = | work = New York Daily-News | date = May 2, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> In his review for the ''New World Telegram'', William Boehnel said that the film was "staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements".<ref name="Boehnel">{{cite news | last = Boehnel | first = William | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'' | pages = | language = | work = New World Telegram | date = May 2, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> [[Otis Ferguson]], in his review for ''[[The New Republic]]'', said that ''Kane'' was "the boldest free-hand stroke in major screen production since [[D.W.

In a 1941 review, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] called ''Citizen Kane'' a "metaphysical detective story", in that "...&nbsp;[its] subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined..." Borges noted that "Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him." As well, "Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum." Borges points out, "At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a [[simulacrum]], a chaos of appearances."<ref name="Borges">Borges, Jorge Luis.

=====Other awards=====
The [[National Board of Review]] gave 1941 "Best Acting" awards to Orson Welles and George Coulouris, and the film itself "Best Picture." That same year, the ''[[New York Times]]'' named it one of the Ten Best Films of the year, and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for "Best Picture" also went to ''Citizen Kane''.<ref>Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:9737~T4 Awards]</ref>

===Hearst's response===
Hearing about the film enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles. Following lobbying from Hearst, the head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Louis B Mayer]], acting on behalf of the whole film industry, made an offer to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative.<ref name="thomson2001"/> Welles used Hearst's opposition to ''Citizen Kane'' as a pretext for previewing the movie in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.<ref name="thomson2001"/>

When [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] of RKO rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing&nbsp;<U+2014> or even mentioning&nbsp;<U+2014> the movie. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.<ref name="Street, Sarah 1996">Street, Sarah. (1996). Citizen Kane. History Today, 46(3), 48. Retrieved October 26, 2009, from Research Library Core. (Document ID: 9345422).</ref> The documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' lays the blame for ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. Even though it did decent business at the box office and went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, this fell short of its creators' expectations, but was still acceptable to its backers. In ''The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst'', David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.<ref>Nasaw, 572-573</ref>

In a pair of ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' documentaries about Welles' career produced and broadcast domestically by the [[BBC]] in 1982, Welles claimed that during opening week, a policeman approached him one night and told him: "Do not go to your hotel room tonight; Hearst has set up an undressed, underage girl to leap into your arms when you enter and a photographer to take pictures of you. Hearst is planning to publish it in all of his papers." Welles thanked the man and stayed out all night. However, it is not confirmed whether this was true. Welles also described how he accidentally bumped into Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont Hotel]] when ''Kane'' was opening in San Francisco. Welles' father had been friends with Hearst, so Welles tried to comfortably ask if Hearst would see the film. Hearst ignored him. "As he was getting off at his floor, I said 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled the director. "And Kane would have you know. That was his style."<ref name=empire/>

Although Hearst's efforts to suppress it damaged the film's success, they [[Streisand effect|backfired in the long run]], since almost every reference to Hearst's life and career made today typically includes a reference to the film's parallel to it. The irony of Hearst's efforts is that the film is now inexorably connected to him. This connection was reinforced by the publication in 1961 of [[W.A. Swanberg|W. A. Swanberg's]] extensive [[biography]], ''Citizen Hearst''.

===Subsequent re-evaluation and recognition===
By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished from America until 1956. In that period, ''Kane'''s and Welles' reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic [[Richard Griffith]] in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Kane'' as "tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]."

Due to [[World War II]], ''Citizen Kane'' was little seen in Europe. It was not until 1946 that it was shown in [[France]], where it gained considerable acclaim, particularly from [[film critics]] such as [[Andr<U+00E9> Bazin]] and from ''[[Cahiers du cinema]]'' writers, including future film directors [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. In his 1950 essay "The Evolution of Cinema", Bazin placed ''Citizen Kane'' centre stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bazin|first=Andre|title=What is Cinema?|publisher=University of California Press|year=1950|page=37|doi=1950|isbn =978-0520242272}}</ref>

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States. RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television. Around the same time the film was rereleased theatrically to coincide with Welles return to the New York stage where he played ''[[King Lear]].'' That year American film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote "Citizen Kane: The American Baroque" for ''[[Film Culture]]'' and described it as "the great American film,"<ref name="Sarris">{{cite news | last = Sarris | first = Andrew | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'': The American Baroque | pages = | language = | work = Film Culture | year = 1956 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> further enhancing the film's status. During the [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' the greatest film ever made, while ''Kane'' was part of the top ten. When a group of young film directors cast their vote for their top six, they were booed at the announcement for not including the film.<ref name=empire/> In the decades since, its critical status as one of [[films that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest films ever made]] has grown with numerous essays and books on it including influential books like Peter Cowie's ''The Cinema of Orson Welles'', Ronald Gottesman's ''Focus on Citizen Kane'', a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, "Raising ''Kane''", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.<ref name="carringer38">Carringer 1996, p. 120.</ref> Despite its criticism of Welles it further popularized the notion of ''Citizen Kane'' as ''the'' great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.<ref name="carringer37">Carringer 1996, p. 119.</ref>

The British magazine ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952 and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste.<ref>{{cite web | title='Citizen Kane' fave film of movie elite | publisher=rogerebert.com | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020811/COMMENTARY/88010305|accessdate=2008-01-01 }}</ref> ''Citizen Kane'' was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll and<ref name="BFI1962">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1962 | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[British Film Institute]] | year = 1962 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1962.html | accessdate = 2008-01-14}}</ref> it has retained the top spot in every subsequent poll.<ref name="bficritics">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Critics' Top Ten Poll | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[British Film Institute]] | year = 2002 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html | accessdate = 2008-01-14 }}</ref><ref name="bfidirectors">{{cite news|title=Directors' Top Ten Poll|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2002|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors.html|accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Despite its status as a revered classic, ''Citizen Kane'' is not entirely without its critics. [[Boston University]] film scholar [[Ray Carney]], although noting its technical achievements, criticized what he saw as the film's lack of emotional depth, shallow characterization and empty metaphors. Listing it among the most overrated works within the film community, he accused the film of being "an all-American triumph of style over substance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/carncult/orfilms.shtml |title=Carney on Culture: Over-Rated Films |publisher=People.bu.edu |date=1999-05-14 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref> The [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]] once stated his dislike for the movie, calling it "a total bore" and claiming that the "performances are worthless." He went on to call Orson Welles an "infinitely overrated filmmaker."

Similarly, [[James Agate]] wrote, "I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to [[Moscow]] about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull...Mr. Welles's high-brow direction is of that super-clever order which prevents you from seeing what that which is being directed is all about."<ref>[http://www.tookeysfilmguide.com/Film.asp?id=2874 Tookeys Film Guide - Film Reviews since 1902]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>

==Prints==
The original camera negative of ''Citizen Kane'' was destroyed in a [[New Jersey]] film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were ultimately derived from a nitrate fine grain positive made in the 1940s.<ref>Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck ''Our Movie Heritage'', 1997, Rutgers University Press, p135-36.</ref>

Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical revival reissue in 1991 (released by [[Paramount Pictures]]). The 2003 British [[DVD]] edition is taken from an [[interpositive]] held by the [[British Film Institute]]. The current US DVD version (released by Warner Home Video) is taken from another digital restoration, supervised by Turner's company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The transfer to Region 1 DVD has been criticized by some film experts for being too bright. Also, in the scene in Bernstein's office (chapter 10), rain falling outside the window has been digitally erased, probably because it was thought to be excessive film grain. These alterations are not present in the UK Region 2, which is also considered to be more accurate in terms of contrast and brightness.

In 2003, Orson Welles' daughter Beatrice sued [[Turner Entertainment]] and RKO Pictures, claiming that the Welles estate is the legal [[copyright]] holder of the film. Her attorney said that Orson Welles had left RKO with an exit deal terminating his contracts with the studio, meaning that Welles still had an interest in the film and his previous contract giving the studio the [[copyright]] of the film was null and void. Beatrice Welles also claimed that, if the courts did not uphold her claim of copyright, RKO nevertheless owed the estate 20% of the profits, from a previous contract which has not been lived up to.

On May 30, 2007, the appeals panel agreed that Beatrice Welles could proceed with the lawsuit against Turner Entertainment; the opinion partially overturns the 2004 decision by a lower court judge who had found in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=entertainment&id=5353309 Heir to sue for 'Citizen Kane' video rights] ABC local, retrieved May 31, 2007</ref>

In the 1980s, this film became the catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of black and white films. When [[Ted Turner]] told members of the press that he was considering colorizing ''Citizen Kane'', his comments led to an immediate public outcry. About two weeks before his death, and almost a year before Turner acquired the rights to the MGM catalog, Welles had asked filmaker [[Henry Jaglom]], "Please do this for me. Don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lebo|first=Harlan|title=Citizen Kane:the fiftieth -anniversary album|publisher=Doubleday|year=1990|page=194|isbn=9780385414739|accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> The uproar was for nothing, as Turner could not have colorized the film had he wanted to. Welles' original contract prevented any alteration to the film without his, and eventually his estate's, express consent.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957100,00.html American Notes Hollywood - Kane Steals Ted's Crayons]. Time Magazine February 27, 1989</ref> Turner later claimed that this was a joke intended to needle colorization critics, and that he had never had any intention of colorizing the film.

==Legacy==
Despite the critical success of ''Citizen Kane'' it nevertheless marked a decline in Welles' fortune. In the book ''Whatever Happened to Orson Welles?'', Joseph McBride argues that the problems in making ''Citizen Kane'' caused lasting damage to his career. The damage started with RKO violating their contract with him by taking his next film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' away from him and adding a happy ending against his will.<ref name=empire/> Hollywood's treatment of Welles and his work ultimately led to his self imposed exile in Europe for much of the rest of his career where he found a more sympathetic audience.

The documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' points out the great irony that Welles's own life story resembled that of Kane far more than Hearst's: an overreaching ''[[wunderkind]]'' who ended up mournful and lonely in his old age. ''Citizen Kane'''s editor [[Robert Wise]] summarized: "Well, I thought often afterwards, only in recent years when I saw the film again two or three years ago when they had the fiftieth anniversary, and I suddenly thought to myself, well, Orson was doing an autobiographical film and didn't realize it, because it's rather much the same, you know. You start here, and you have a big rise and tremendous prominence and fame and success and whatnot, and then tail off and tail off and tail off. And at least the arc of the two lives were very much the same..."<ref name="PBS"/>

[[Peter Bogdanovich]], who was friends with Welles in his later years, disagreed with this on his own commentary on the ''Citizen Kane'' DVD, saying that Kane was nothing like Welles. Kane, he said, "had none of the qualities of an artist, Orson had all the qualities of an artist." Bogdanovich also noted that Welles was never bitter "about all the bad things that happened to him", and was a man who enjoyed life in his final years.
In addition, critics have reassessed Welles<U+2019> career after his death, saying that he wasn<U+2019>t a failed [[American cinema|Hollywood filmmaker]], but a successful [[independent film]]maker.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pwb7WR2wVZ0C&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=%2BWelles&source=bl&ots=Z9-YzsHfqL&sig=eNpHDG7-LsRDYWIQW0ksFK83QvE&hl=en&ei=8yJYSvWxOMuMtgft1MjdCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 |title='&#39;Movie Wars'&#39; by Jonathan Rosenbaum |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>

Film critic [[Kim Newman]] believed the film's influence was visible in the [[film noir]] that followed, as well as the 1942 Hepburn-Tracy film ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]].'' Film directors [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Bryan Singer]], [[Stephen Frears]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[John Frankenheimer]], [[Tommy Wiseau]], the [[Coen brothers]], [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Luc Besson]] are all fans of ''Citizen Kane'' and it influenced their work.

In 1982 Spielberg spent $60,500 to buy the Rosebud sled,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DF1E30F934A3575AC0A960948260|title=Movie Meoribilia| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2009-01-22 | date=1986-09-07}}</ref> and paid homage to the film in the final shot of the [[government warehouse (fiction)|government warehouse]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Spielberg commented, "Rosebud will go over my typewriter to remind me that quality in movies comes first."<ref>''Video Viewer'' (August, 1982).</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Sara|last=Medina| date=21 June 1982 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925482,00.html |title=People|publisher=Time.com |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>

The film's structure influenced the biographical films ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]''&nbsp;<U+2013> which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks&nbsp;<U+2013> as well as Welles' thriller ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''.<ref name=empire/>
