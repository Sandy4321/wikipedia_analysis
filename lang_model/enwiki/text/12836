'''Beaver Creek''' was a Children's amusement park inside [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]]. It closed on September 5, 2010 when Amanda Thompson, owner of Pleasure Beach, Blackpool announced that it would be working with American Company, [[Nickelodeon]] to bring the new [[Nickelodeon Land, Pleasure Beach Blackpool | Nickelodeon Land]]. Nickelodeon Land opened in Beaver Creeks place on May 5, 2011.<ref>http://blackpoolaloud.org.uk/2010/09/07/beaver-creek-loses-its-magic/</ref><ref>http://blackpoolaloud.org.uk/2010/07/27/nickelodeon-land-announced-at-pleasure-beach/</ref>

Bradley Beaver Catering Co. Closed in 2010 after [[Nickelodeon Land, Pleasure Beach Blackpool | Nickelodeon Land]] was announced.

Many of the rides have either been re-themed and put back into place, or moved into a different part of the park and later re-named. For example, Thor's Turnpike was moved to a different place in the park and re-named Alpine Rallye, same with Veteran Carousel, which is now known as Vintage Carousel.
