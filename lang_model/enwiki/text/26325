'''''Yes Minister''''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[British sitcom]] written by [[Antony Jay]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] that was first transmitted by [[BBC television]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] between 1980 and 1984, split over three seven-episode series. The sequel, '''''Yes, Prime Minister''''', ran from 1986 to 1988. In total this made 38 episodes, all but one of which last half an hour.

Set in the private office in [[Whitehall]] of a British government cabinet minister (and, in the sequel, in [[10 Downing Street]]), the series follows the [[Minister (government)|ministerial]] career of [[James Hacker]] [[British House of Commons|MP]], played by [[Paul Eddington]]. His various struggles to bring in legislation or departmental changes are opposed by the will of the [[British Civil Service]], in particular his [[Permanent Secretary]] (senior civil servant), [[Sir Humphrey Appleby]], played by [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. His  [[Principal Private Secretary]] [[Bernard Woolley]], played by [[Derek Fowlds]] is usually caught between the two, although heavily influenced by Sir Humphrey. Almost every programme ends with the line "Yes, Minister" (or "Yes, Prime Minister"), uttered (usually) by Sir Humphrey as he quietly relishes his victory over his "political master" (or, occasionally, acknowledges defeat).

A huge critical and popular success, the series received a number of awards, including several [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTAs]] and in 2004 came sixth in the ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'' poll. It was the favourite television programme of the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="cockerell">{{cite book |last=Cockerell |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Cockerell |title= Live From Number 10: The Inside Story of Prime Ministers and Television |year=1988 |publisher= Faber and Faber|location= London|id= ISBN 0-571-14757-7|pages=288}}</ref>

==Situation==
As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government, most of the scenes take place in private locations, such as offices and exclusive lounges. Lynn says "here was not a single scene set in the [[House of Commons]] because... government does not take place in the House of Commons; some politics... and much theatre takes place there. Government happens in private. As in all public performances, the real work is done in rehearsal, behind closed doors. Then the public, and the House, are shown what the government wishes them to see."<ref name="lynnweb">{{cite web |title=Yes Minister Questions & Answers |work=Jonathan Lynn Official Website |url=http://www.jonathanlynn.com/tv/yes_minister_series/yes_minister_qa.htm |accessdate=2007-09-06 }}</ref>

The dominant running theme is the struggle between ([[The Right Honourable|The Rt Hon.]]) [[James Hacker|James "Jim" Hacker]], the newly-appointed [[Political minister|Minister]] in the (fictional) Department of Administrative Affairs, and his civil servants and ministerial colleagues. Chief among his officials are [[Sir Humphrey Appleby]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Royal Victorian Order|MVO]], [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] [[University of Oxford|(Oxon)]], who is the department's Permanent Secretary, and [[Bernard Woolley]], Hacker's Principal Private Secretary. "Behind the scenes" influence is also exerted when Sir Humphrey consults (or is summoned by) the Cabinet Secretary (or in the second series, ex-Secretary) at their St James's gentlemen's club.

The different ideals and self-interested motivations of the characters are frequently contrasted. Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things, he ultimately sees his re-election as the only endorsement of his success. In order to achieve this he must appear to the voters as effective, and responsive to the public will, and to his party (and in the first series, the Prime Minister) as a loyal and effective party animal. Sir Humphrey, on the other hand, genuinely believes (along with most of the other civil servants who are depicted) that it is the Civil Service that knows what is best for the country, which is usually "coincidentally" what is best for the Civil Service. Most of Sir Humphrey's actions are motivated by his wish to maintain the prestige, power, and influence he enjoys inside a large, bureaucratic organisation, and also to preserve the numerous perks of his position: automatic honours, a substantial income, a fixed retirement age and a large [[indexation|index-linked]] pension, and the practical impossibility of being made redundant or being sacked. In fact, a good deal of the tension in their relationship comes from Hacker being aware that it is the politicians who are liable to lose ''their'' jobs if civil service ineptitude comes to public attention. In the episode "[[Doing the Honours]]" he says, "In private industry if you screw things up you get the boot; in the civil service if you screw things up I get the boot."

Hacker, then, sees his task as the initiation of reforms and economies in the department, a reduction of the level of bureaucracy and staff numbers in the Civil Service, and the government of the country according to his party's policies. To do so, or to at least look as if he has, would be a vote-winner. Conversely, Sir Humphrey sees his role as ensuring that politics is kept out of government as much as possible, and that the ''status quo'' is upheld as a matter of principle. He will block any move that seeks either to prevent the further expansion of the civil service or to reduce the complexity of its bureaucracy.

Much of the show's humour thus derives from the antagonism between [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] ministers (who believe they are in charge) and the members of the British Civil Service who really run the [[United Kingdom|country]]. A typical episode centres on Jim Hacker's suggesting and pursuing a reform, and Sir Humphrey's ingenious blocking of all Hacker's lines of approach. More often than not Sir Humphrey prevents him from achieving his goal, while mollifying Hacker with some positive publicity, or at least a means to cover up his failure. However, Hacker occasionally gets his way, as in "[[The Greasy Pole]]."

Initially Woolley na<U+00EF>vely sees his job as the disinterested implementation of the Minister's policies, but he gradually finds that this conflicts with his institutional duty to the department and sometimes, since Sir Humphrey is responsible for formally assessing Woolley's performance, his own potential career development.<ref name="ymBBC"/>

The first series featured Frank Weisel, Hacker's political advisor, played by [[Neil Fitzwiliam]]. While his name is pronounced W-"eye"-sel, Sir Humphrey and Bernard persistently call him "Mr Weasel". Weisel does not appear after the first series, following his convenient acceptance of a position on a [[quango]] (Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation) tasked, appropriately, with investigating the appointment of other quangos.<ref name="ymBBC"/> After the third series, following Sir Humphrey's promotion to [[Cabinet Secretary]], Hacker becomes Prime Minister and requests that Bernard Woolley continue as his Principal Private Secretary. The first series of ''Yes, Prime Minister'' introduced Dorothy Wainwright (played by [[Deborah Norton]]) as a highly able Special Political Advisor to the Prime Minister. Her experience and insight into many civil service tricks ensures a lasting mutual distrust between her and Sir Humphrey.<ref name="bbs">{{cite episode |title=Yes Minister |series=Britain's Best Sitcom |credits=Written by Armando Iannucci; prod. Verity Newman |network=BBC |station=BBC Two |airdate=2004-01-17}}</ref>

Hacker's home life is shown occasionally throughout the series. His wife, Annie ([[Diana Hoddinott]]), is clearly frustrated by the disruptions caused by her husband's political career and is at times somewhat cynical about her husband's politics. Meanwhile, his sociology student daughter, Lucy ([[Gerry Cowper]]), becomes an environmental activist in one episode (her only on-screen appearance, despite several other mentions), campaigning against one of her father's departmental policies.

Sir Humphrey's personal characteristics include his [[Logorrhoea|complicated sentences]], his cynical views on government, and his superciliousness. Hacker's attributes include occasional indecisiveness, and a tendency to launch into ludicrous [[Winston Churchill|Churchillian]] speeches. Bernard is apt to linguistic pedantry. Sir Humphrey often discusses matters with other Permanent Secretaries, who appear similarly sardonic and jaded, and the Cabinet Secretary (whom he will eventually succeed in ''Yes, Prime Minister''), Sir Arnold Robinson ([[John Nettleton (actor)|John Nettleton]]) an archetype of cynicism, haughtiness and conspiratorial expertise. This fairly counter-intuitive view of government administration is not only Sir Humphrey's: it is completely taken for granted by the civil service.

The ''Yes, Prime Minister'' episode "[[The Bishop's Gambit]]" parodied [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and politics in the [[Church of England|Anglican church]]. Hacker thought that the church is a Christian institution, but Sir Humphrey gleefully informed him that most of the [[bishop]]s do not believe in [[God]], and that a [[theologian]]'s job is partly to explain why an [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]] can be a church leader.

Almost all the episodes end with one of the characters (usually Sir Humphrey) saying "Yes, Minister" or "Yes, Prime Minister". Each episode of the former series was more or less self-contained, but ''Yes, Prime Minister'' had a loose [[story arc]].

==Politics==
Lynn joined the [[Students' union|union society]] in his first year at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] because he thought that he might like to enter politics. "All of the main debaters there, aged twenty, were the most pompous, self-satisfied, self-important bunch of clowns that I've ever clapped eyes on. They were all behaving as if they were on the government front bench, and twenty years later they all were: [[Michael Howard]]; [[John Selwyn Gummer]]; [[Kenneth Clark]]. I thought at that point that the only that I could ever contribute to politics is making fun of the politicians."<ref name="bbs"/>

The series, then, intended to satirise politics and government in general, rather than any specific party. The writers placed Hacker at the centre of the political spectrum, and were careful to identify his party headquarters as "Central House" (a combination of [[Conservative Central Office]] and Labour's Transport House). The terms "[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]" and "[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]" are scrupulously avoided throughout the series, favouring terms such as "the party" or "the Government" and "the opposition."<ref name="ymBBC"/> In the first scene of the first episode, "[[Open Government (Yes Minister)|Open Government]]", Hacker is shown at the declaration of his constituency result wearing a white [[rosette]], with other candidates sporting the red and blue rosettes associated with the two leading British parties. The one exception to this neutrality occurs very briefly in "[[The National Education Service]]", when Sir Humphrey explains to Bernard how the policy of [[comprehensive school|comprehensive education]] is retained through successive governments, using different arguments according to which party is in power. Despite this, the overall thrust was towards government reduction rather than government expansion. The episode "[[Jobs for the Boys]]", for example, rejected [[corporatism]].

In a 2004 documentary, [[Armando Iannucci]] compared ''Yes Minister'' to [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' in how it has influenced the public's view of the state. Although Lynn comments that the word '[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]' has "probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,"<ref name="lynnweb"/> Iannucci posits that the show "taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras."<ref name="bbs"/> The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the [[media training]] they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from [[Teleprompter|autocue]] effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode "[[The Ministerial Broadcast]]," in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode "[[A Conflict of Interest]]" deconstructs the various political stances of Britain's newspapers through their readership.

==Inspirations==
The writers were inspired by a variety of sources, including sources inside government, published material and contemporary news stories. Some situations were conceived as fiction, but were later revealed to have real-life counterparts. The episode "[[The Compassionate Society]]" depicts a hospital with five hundred administrative staff but no doctors, nurses or patients. Lynn recalls that "after inventing this absurdity, we discovered there were six such hospitals (or very large empty wings of hospitals) exactly as we had described them in our episode."<ref name="lynnweb"/>

In a programme screened by the BBC in early 2004, paying tribute to the series, it was revealed that Jay and Lynn had drawn on information provided by two insiders from the governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]], namely [[Marcia Matilda Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]] and [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]].<ref name="bbs"/> The published diaries of [[Richard Crossman]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Crossman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Crossman |title=Diaries of a Cabinet Minister: Selections, 1964<U+2013>70 |year=1979 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd |location=London |id= ISBN 0-241-10142-5}}</ref> also provided inspiration.<ref name="lynnweb"/>

The episode entitled "[[The Moral Dimension]]", in which Hacker and his staff engage in the scheme of secretly consuming [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] on a trade mission to the fictional [[Islam]]ic state of [[Qumran (fictional country)|Qumran]], was based on a real incident that took place in [[Pakistan]]. Jay says that "I can't tell you where, I can't tell you when and I can't tell you who was involved; all I can tell you is that we knew that it had actually happened. That's why it was so funny. We couldn't think up things as funny as the real things that had happened."<ref name="lith">{{cite episode |title=Part 3: Modern Times |series=[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]: Laughter in the House |credits = Prod.

Fusing inspiration and invention, Lynn and Jay worked on the story "for anything from three days to two weeks," and only took "four mornings to write all the dialogue. After we wrote the episode, we would show it to some secret sources, always including somebody who was an expert on the subject in question. They would usually give us extra information which, because it was true, was usually funnier than anything we might have thought up."<ref name="lynnweb"/> Designers Valerie Warrender and Gloria Clayton were given access to the Cabinet Rooms and the State Drawing Rooms.

==Main characters==
[[Image:Administrative Affairs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The three main characters. From left, Sir Humphrey Appleby, Bernard Woolley and Jim Hacker in the Minister's Office at the Department of Administrative Affairs.]]
'''[[Jim Hacker]]''' ([[Paul Eddington]]) was an academic political researcher, [[polytechnic]] lecturer and editor of a newspaper, Reform, before entering Parliament, where he apparently spent a good deal of time in Opposition before his party won an election. In ''Yes Minister'' he is the Minister for Administrative Affairs (a fictitious ministry of the British government) and a cabinet minister.  Hacker received his degree from the [[London School of Economics]], for which he is frequently derided by the [[Oxford University|Oxford]]-educated Sir Humphrey. His early character is that of a gung-ho, but na<U+00EF>ve, politician, bringing sweeping changes to his department. Before long, Hacker begins to notice that Civil Service tactics are preventing his planned changes being put into practice.  As he learns he becomes more sly and cynical, and uses some of the Civil Service ruses himself.  While Sir Humphrey initially held all the aces, Hacker now and again plays a trump card of his own.

Throughout ''Yes Minister'', Hacker is often portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, prone to potentially embarrassing blunders, and who elicits bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the [[Chief Whip]]. In ''Yes, Prime Minister'' Hacker quickly develops statesmanlike skills.  He practises more grandiose speeches, dreams up his "grand design", and hones his diplomatic skills, and these nearly all land him in trouble. In a ''[[Radio Times]]'' interview to promote ''Yes, Prime Minister'', Paul Eddington stated, "He's beginning to find his feet as a man of power, and he's begun to confound those who thought they'd be able to manipulate him out of hand."<ref name="radio4-10">''Radio Times'': 4<U+2013>10 January 1986</ref>

'''[[Humphrey Appleby|Sir Humphrey]]''' ([[Nigel Hawthorne]]) serves throughout the series as [[Permanent Secretary]] under the ministry of James Hacker at the Department of Administrative Affairs.  He is appointed Cabinet Secretary just as Hacker's party enters a leadership crisis, and is instrumental in Hacker's elevation to Prime Minister. He is committed to maintaining the ''[[status quo]]'' for the country in general and for the [[British Civil Service|Civil Service]] in particular.<ref name="bbs"/> Sir Humphrey is a master of [[obfuscation]] and [[Social influence|manipulation]], baffling his opponents with technical jargon and circumlocutions, strategically appointing allies to supposedly impartial boards, and setting up interdepartmental committees to smother his [[political minister|Minister's]] proposals in [[red tape]]. {{sound sample box align right|Audio sample:}}

{{multi-listen item|filename=Yes Minister - Sir Humphrey speech.ogg|title="Sir Humphery's big speeches"|description=An example of Hawthorne's performance of the "big speeches," from the episode "[[Man Overboard (Yes, Prime Minister)|Man Overboard]]"|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}In ''Britain's Best Sitcom'', [[Stephen Fry]] comments that "we love the idea of the coherence and articulacy of Sir Humphrey... it's one of the things you look forward to in an episodes of ''Yes Minister''... when's the big speech going to happen. And can I see if he's reading it from an [[idiot board]]... he's really learned it, and it's superb."<ref name="bbs"/> Derek Fowlds posited to a concerned Eddington that these speeches were the reason why Hawthorne won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance four times in a row, while Eddington didn't win at all.<ref name="bbs"/>

Loquacious and verbose, he frequently uses both his mastery of the English language and even his superb grasp of [[Latin]] and [[Greek]] grammar both to perplex his political master and to obscure the relevant issues. In a ''[[Radio Times]]'' interview to promote the second series of ''Yes, Prime Minister'', producer Sydney Lotterby stated that he always tried to give Eddington and Hawthorne extra time to rehearse as their scenes invariably featured lengthy dialogue exchanges.<ref>''Radio Times'' [[28 November]] <U+2013> [[04 December]] [[1987]]</ref>

'''[[Bernard Woolley|Bernard]]''' ([[Derek Fowlds]]) is Jim Hacker's [[Principal Private Secretary]]. His loyalties are therefore split between his Minister and his Civil Service boss, Humphrey Appleby: while he is theoretically responsible to Hacker personally, it is Sir Humphrey who writes his performance reviews and influences Bernard's Civil Service career.  This leads to difficult situations for the young civil servant. He usually handles these situations well, and maintains his reputation in the Civil Service as a "high flier".

Woolley is always quick to point out the physical impossibilities of Sir Humphrey's or Hacker's [[mixed metaphor]]s, with almost obsessive [[pedant]]ry. He can occasionally appear rather childlike, by making animal noises and gestures or by acting out how such an analogy cannot work.

In a 2004 retrospective, [[Armando Iannucci]] commented that Fowlds had a difficult task because he had to "spend most of his time saying nothing but looking interested in everyone else's total and utter guff" but "his one line frequently had to be the funniest of the lot."  Iannucci suggests that Bernard is essential to the structure of the show because both Hacker and Appleby confide in him, "which means we get to find out what they're plotting next."<ref name="bbs"/>

==Other characters==
The series featured a cast of recurring characters. Frank Weisel, played by [[Neil Fitzwiliam]], was Hacker's political advisor in the first series. It was not until ''Yes, Prime Minister'' that another such character appeared regularly: Dorothy Wainwright, special advisor to the Prime Minister, who was played by [[Deborah Norton]]. Hacker also had a Press Secretary, Bill Pritchard, played by Antony Carrick. Meanwhile, Sir Humphrey's civil service colleagues were regularly featured. They included Sir Arnold Robinson (played by [[John Nettleton (actor)|John Nettleton]]), Cabinet Secretary in ''Yes Minister'' and later President of the Campaign for [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information]]; Sir Frederick Stewart (played by [[John Savident]]), Permanent Secretary of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], known as "Jumbo" to his friends; and Sir Frank Gordon, who appeared in both series as Permanent Secretary to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] (played by [[Peter Cellier]]). Sir Humphrey also had an old acquaintance: Sir Desmond Glazebrook (played by [[Richard Vernon]]), who was Board member, then Chairman, of Bartlett's Bank. He became Governor of the [[Bank of England]] in the ''Yes, Prime Minister'' episode "[[A Conflict of Interest]]". (Bizarrely, this was to avoid, as one possibility, Britain's expulsion from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]!)

Hacker's family comprised his wife, Annie (played by [[Diana Hoddinott]]), who appeared in several episodes, and his daughter, Lucy (played by [[Gerry Cowper]]), who only featured on-screen in one, "[[The Right to Know]]", but is referred to intermittently throughout. At one point (in "[[Party Games (Yes Minister)|Party Games]]") it is suggested that the Hackers have more than one child, but as this occurs when stating a well-rehearsed rebuttal, this could be seen as one more instance where the Minister has become "house trained" to conform to departmental convenience (even though the Minister is in the running for the leadership).

Hacker's chaffeur, George ([[Arthur Cox]]), appeared in five episodes. He is a character who is always more in touch with current events than the Minister <U+2013>ndash; anything from empty [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals to [[Cabinet shuffle|Cabinet reshuffles]]. This often irritates Hacker, who when asking George where he got the information, is usually told that it is common knowledge among the Whitehall drivers. Well-known broadcasters who played themselves included [[Robert McKenzie]], [[Ludovic Kennedy]] and [[Sue Lawley]]. [[Robert Dougall]] regularly played a newsreader, which was his own real life profession.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister episodes}}
A total of thirty-eight episodes were made, and all but one are of 30 minutes' duration. As was standard BBC practice for situation comedies at the time, they were videotaped in front of a studio audience. The actors did not enjoy filming as they felt that the studio audience added additional pressure. Lynn, however, posits that the studio audience on the soundtrack was necessary because laughter is a "communal affair." The laughter also acted as insurance: Jay observes that politicians would be unable to put pressure on the BBC not to "run this kind of nonsense" if "200-250 people were falling about with laughter."<ref name="bbs"/> There were occasionally film inserts of any location sequences, and some shots of Hacker travelling in his car were achieved by means of [[chroma key]]. Each instalment usually comprised around six scenes.

The pilot was produced in 1979 but not transmitted until 1980 in fear that it could influence the results of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 UK General Election]].<ref name="bbs"/> ''Yes Minister'' ran for three series, each of seven episodes, between 1980 and 1982. These were followed by two [[Christmas special]]s: one 10-minute sketch as part of an anthology presented by [[Frank Muir]],<ref>{{cite web |work=The British Comedy and Drama Website | title= Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister |url= http://www.britishcomedy.org.uk/comedy/minister.htm| accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> and then the hour-long "[[Party Games (Yes Minister)|Party Games]]", in 1984. The latter's events led to Hacker's elevation to Prime Minister, dovetailing into the sequel, ''Yes, Prime Minister''. This ran for two series, each of eight episodes, from 1986 to 1988.

==Opening titles and music==
[[Image:Scarfejh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|frame|Gerald Scarfe's caricature of Paul Eddington as Hacker]]
The opening titles were drawn by artist [[Gerald Scarfe]], who provided distinctive [[caricature]]s of Eddington, Hawthorne and Fowlds in their respective roles to represent distortion.<ref name="bbs"/> He [[animation|animated]] them as 'self-drawing' by positioning the camera above his paper, adding parts of lines, and then photographing two frames at a time. The sequence ended with the title of the episode superimposed on a blank 'government memo'. Scarfe created a second set of graphics for ''Yes, Prime Minister'', featuring different artwork for each episode title card. Derek Fowlds wanted to buy an original drawing but was unable to afford it.<ref name="bbs"/> The series' performance credits typically only featured those of the actors who appeared in the particular episode, not the names of characters.

The [[theme music]] was composed by [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]] and is largely based on the [[Westminster Quarters]]: the chimes of [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]. When asked in an interview about its [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] influence, Hazlehurst replied, "That's all it is. It's the easiest thing I've ever done."<ref>{{cite web |work=bbc.co.uk |title= BBC New Talent: Advice for new TV composers |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newtalent/music/realmedia/ronnie.ram |accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> Scarfe's and Hazlehurst's work was not used for the first episode, "[[Open Government (Yes Minister)|Open Government]]". The final version of the titles and music had yet to be agreed, and both differ substantially from those used for subsequent instalments. The opening and closing title caption cards feature drawings of most of the cast, but are less exaggerated than those of Scarfe, while the uncredited music is a more up-tempo piece for [[brass band]]. The Scarfe and Hazelhurst credits were used for some repeat broadcasts of the first episode, but the original pilot credits were retained for the DVD release.

==Reception==
The series gained high audience figures, and 90+ on the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|audience appreciation index]].<ref name="gcbtv"/> Critics, such as Andrew Davies in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' and Armando Iannucci, have noted that the show demanded high expectations from its audience.<ref name="gcbtv"/> Lynn posits that the public are more intelligent than most situation comedies, which often patronise, give them credit. Jay believes that the audience was just as intelligent as the writers, but there were some things that they didn't know that they ought to.<ref name="bbs"/>

''Yes Minister'' won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for Best Comedy Series for 1980, 1981 and 1982, and the "Party Games" special was nominated in the Best Light Entertainment Programme category for 1984. ''Yes, Prime Minister'' was shortlisted for Best Comedy Series for both 1986 and 1987. Nigel Hawthorne's portrayal of Sir Humphrey Appleby won the BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times (in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987). Eddington was also nominated on all four occasions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Awards for "Yes Minister" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080306/awards  |work=IMDb.com |accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> ''Yes Minister'' came sixth in a 2004 [[BBC]] poll to find '[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'.<ref>{{cite web |work=bbc.co.uk |title=Britain's Best Sitcom: The Final Top 10 Sitcoms |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/winner.shtml |accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted by industry professionals, ''Yes Minister'' and ''Yes, Prime Minister'' were jointly placed ninth.

''The Guinness Television Encylopedia'' suggests that "real politicians ... enjoyed the show's cynical dismissal of [[Whitehall]] intrigue and its insights into the machinations of government."<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Jeff |title=The Guinness Television Encylopedia |year=1995 |publisher=Guinness |location=Middlesex |id= ISBN 0-85112-744-4|pages=586}}</ref> They were the favourite programme of then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. She told ''[[The Telegraph]]'' that "its clearly-observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy."<ref name="gcbtv"/> [[Gerald Kaufman]] described it as "The Rt. Hon. [[Faust]] MP, constantly beset by the wiles of Sir [[Mephistopheles]]."<ref name="gcbtv"/> As a supporter of Thatcher, Jay embraced her appreciation, although the more leftist Lynn was concerned.<ref name="bbs"/>
[[Image:Yes Minister - Thatcher sketch.jpg|thumb|Hawthorne and Eddington performing the sketch with Thatcher in January 1984.]]
Thatcher performed a short sketch with Eddington and Hawthorne on [[20 January]] [[1984]] at a ceremony where the writers were presented with an award from [[Mary Whitehouse]]'s [[NVLA]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Stringer |title=Thatcher stars in "Yes Minister" |url = http://www.yessirnigel.com/thatcher_script.html |format=Reprint on website |work=Daily Telegraph |date=[[1984-01-21]] |accessdate= 2006-08-30}}</ref> Various sources attribute authorship of the sketch. In ''Britain's Best Sitcom'', [[Bernard Ingham]] says that he wrote it; other sources give Thatcher sole credit, while [[Michael Cockerell]] says that she wrote it with Ingham's help.<ref name="cockerell"/> Another source gives renegade credit to [[Charles Powell]].<ref name="gcbtv"/> The actors, who were both starring in separate [[West End theatre|West End]] plays at the time, were not enthusiastic at the idea and asked Lynn to "get them out" of it. The writer, however, was not in a position to help. Hawthorne says he and Eddington resented Thatcher's attempts to "make capital" from their popularity.<ref name="lith"/>  Ingham says that it "went down a bomb", while Lynn brands it a "dreadful sketch" that was only funny because Thatcher was doing it.<ref name="bbs"/> Accepting the award from the NVLA, Lynn thanked Thatcher "for taking her rightful place in the field of situation comedy." Everyone, except the Prime Minister, laughed.<ref name="lith"/>

When Paul Eddington visited Australia during the 1980s, he was treated as a visiting British PM by the then Australian leader, [[Bob Hawke]], who was obviously a great fan of the show. At a rally, Hawke said "You don't want to be listening to me; you want to be listening to the real Prime Minister", forcing Eddington to improvise.<ref>{{cite web |work=yes-minister.com |title= Hacker in Australia: footage of Paul Eddington visiting Australia |url= http://www.yes-minister.com/video/hackerinaustralia.ram| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> In an interview to promote the first series of ''Yes, Prime Minister'', Derek Fowlds said that "both political sides believe that it satirises their opponents, and civil servants love it because it depicts them as being more powerful than either. And of course, they love it because it's all so authentic."<ref name="radio4-10"/>

==Legacy==
The show has been remade several times. The first was the [[Canada|Canadian]] remake in 1987 ''[[Not My Department]]'', which only lasted one season. ''Rosenbaddarna'' (from 1990) was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] unofficial remake. The title of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] remake, ''Sim, Sr. Ministro'' (from 1996), is a direct translation of the original's title. ''[[Ji, Mantriji]]'' (2001) was the remake in [[Hindi]] (with the BBC's permission) by [[STAR Plus]], [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[India]]n satellite TV channel. Both Sir Humphrey and Jim Hacker are portrayed there by the same actors who dubbed them on TV. A computer game version of ''Yes Minister'' was released in 1987 for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. The premise was to survive one week in office as Jim Hacker.<ref>{{cite web |author=Scott, Steve|work=lemon64.com |title= Yes, Prime Minister |year=1987 |url= http://www.lemon64.com/index.php?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/reviews/view.php%3Fid%3D556| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

In 2005, [[BBC Four]] launched ''[[The Thick of It]]'', described by director [[Armando Iannucci]] as "''Yes Minister'' meets ''[[The Larry Sanders Show|Larry Sanders]]''",<ref>{{cite web |title=The Thick of It: Interview: Armando Iannucci, Chris Langham & Peter Capaldi |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/thickofit/armando-iannucci.shtml | work=BBC Four website |date=[[2005-04-19]] |accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> and ''[[The Telegraph]]'' called it "a ''Yes, Minister'' for the [[New Labour]] years."<ref>{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Sylvester |title=New TV satire puts Labour in the thick of it |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/30/ntv30.xml |format=Reprint on telegraph.co.uk |work=Daily Telegraph |date=April 30, 2005 |accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref> The style shows many identifiable hallmarks of ''Yes Minister'', namely the blundering politician virtually entirely dependent on those whose presentational and political nous greatly eclipse his own personal experience.

==Radio==
Sixteen episodes<ref>Episodes included "Open Government", "Big Brother", "The Economy Drive", "The Writing on the Wall", "The Smoke Screen", "The Ministerial Broadcast", "Official Secrets" and "A Conflict of Interest", "The Quality of Life", (vol.3) "The Compassionate Society", "The Greasy Pole", "The Skeleton in the Cupboard", "A Question of Loyalty" (vol.4) "The Whisky Priest", "The Death List" and "The Moral Dimension"</ref> of ''Yes Minister'' were adapted and re-recorded for broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]], with the principal cast reprising their roles. Produced by Peter Atkin, they were broadcast across two seasons, each with eight episodes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Rod |title=The Guinness Book of Sitcoms |year=1994 |publisher=Guinness |location=Middlesex |id= ISBN 0-85112-638-3|pages=278}}</ref> The first series aired [[18 October]] to [[7 December]] [[1983]], with the second originally transmitted [[8 October]] to [[27 November]] [[1984]].<ref name="ymBBC"/> The complete set was released on cassette in February 2000, and on compact disc in October 2002. The series was repeated on the digital radio station [[BBC 7]] in early 2007.

In 1997, Derek Fowlds reprised the role of Bernard Woolley to read Antony Jay's ''How To Beat Sir Humphrey: Every Citizen's Guide To Fighting Officialdom''. It was broadcast in three daily parts by Radio 4 from [[29 September]] to [[01 October]] [[1997]]<ref name="ymBBC"/> and released by BBC Audiobooks on cassette in October 1997.

===Books===
Several books have been published surrounding the series. The scripts were edited and transformed into prose, and published by BBC Books in the form of diaries. Scenes that did not involve Hacker took the form of private memos between civil servants, or 'interviews' and written correspondence from other characters.

The three series of ''Yes Minister'' were published as paperbacks in 1981, 1982 and 1983 respectively before being combined into a revised hardback omnibus edition, ''The Complete Yes Minister: The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister'', in 1984. ''Yes, Prime Minister: The Diaries of the Right Hon. James Hacker'' were published as two volumes in 1986 and 1987 respectively, before also receiving an omnibus edition in 1988. Both series were published as omnibus paperback editions in 1989:
*''The Complete Yes Minister'' ISBN 0-563-20665-9
*''The Complete Yes, Prime Minister'' ISBN 0-563-20773-6

Antony Jay's ''How to Beat Sir Humphrey: Every Citizen's Guide to Fighting Officialdom'' was published in April 1997. It was illustrated by Gerald Scarfe and Shaun Williams. It was read by Derek Fowlds on Radio 4 later that year.
