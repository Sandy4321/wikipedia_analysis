'''Hurricane Francelia''' brought significant flooding to [[Central America]], especially [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season]], Francelia developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the southeastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on August&nbsp;29. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September&nbsp;1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching [[Central America]], the storm intensified and peaked as a 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) Category&nbsp;3 hurricane on September&nbsp;2. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near [[Punta Gorda, Belize]] (then [[British Honduras]]){{#tag:ref|[[British Honduras]], formerly a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]], attained its independence in 1981 and became the country of Belize.<ref>{{cite web|date=2012-08-02|title=Belize country profile|agency=BBC News|accessdate=2013-01-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1211472.stm|work=[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profiles/default.stm BBC Country Profiles]}}</ref> The territory is referred to as Belize in the article.|group="nb"}} late on September&nbsp;3. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day.

During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269&nbsp;people and caused $15&nbsp;million in damage.{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1969 [[United States dollar]]s.|group="nb"}} In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared [[Football War]], causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]], and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. Several rivers in the region flooded, with the [[Belize River]] reaching {{convert|36|ft|m}} above normal. Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998. Overall damage was estimated at $35.6&nbsp;million, and there were 271&nbsp;deaths.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Francelia 1969 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Francelia were from a [[tropical wave]] &ndash; an elongated [[low pressure area]] &ndash; that exited the western coast of Africa on August&nbsp;19. It moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and the annual summary of 1969 tropical cyclone activity indicated there may have been a [[tropical cyclone|tropical depression]] &ndash; a cyclone with sustained winds of less 40&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) &ndash; briefly located within the system. On August&nbsp;26, an area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, developed along the wave, about 800&nbsp;miles (1300&nbsp;km) east of [[Barbados]]. A [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight two days later reported no [[atmospheric circulation|low-level circulation]]. As the system moved through the southern [[Lesser Antilles]], ship and land observations suggested a circulation had developed, signalling the formation of a tropical depression in the extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea early on August&nbsp;29.<ref name="mwr"/>

The new tropical cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August&nbsp;30 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed and turned to the west-southwest on September&nbsp;1 due to a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), and late on September&nbsp;1 Francelia passed over [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Island]]. During its passage, an [[atmospheric sounding]] occurred in its [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]; a sounding is a measurement of the physical properties of the atmosphere, and the process had only occurred four times previously.<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=R.H. |last2=Sugg |first2=Arnold L. |month=April |year=1970 |title=The Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1969 |journal=Monthly Weather Review |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=293<U+2013>306 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/mwr_pdf/1969.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode = 1970MWRv...98..293S |doi = 10.1175/1520-0493-98.4.293 }}</ref>

Hurricane Francelia continued west-southwestward toward the northern coast of Central America, strengthening significantly despite its proximity to land. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September&nbsp;2 reported winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of {{convert|973|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}} as the hurricane crossed over the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]], only 30&nbsp;miles (50&nbsp;km) off the coast of Honduras. Francelia weakened slightly as its forward movement slowed, but it remained a hurricane as it approached land, based on confirmation from ship reports.<ref name="mwr"/> Late on September&nbsp;3, the hurricane made landfall with winds estimated at 110&nbsp;mph (180&nbsp;km/h), just north of [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] in southern [[Belize]], then known as [[British Honduras]].<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|date=1969-09-04|title=Tropical Cyclone Discussion: Hurricane Francelia|accessdate=2010-10-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0005-jpg/1969/atlantic/francelia/tropdisc/tcd040300z.jpg|format=JPG}}</ref> Tropical storm force winds spread across the country, although hurricane force winds occurred only in a small area near where the hurricane made landfall. Francelia weakened quickly over land, dissipating late on September&nbsp;4 over Guatemala. The system continued slowly across Central America, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean three days after it moved ashore.<ref name="mwr"/> On September&nbsp;8, the remnants of Francelia redeveloped into [[1969 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Glenda|Tropical Storm Glenda]] off the coast of Mexico, which moved parallel to the southwest Mexican coast before dissipating on September&nbsp;12.<ref name="mwr"/><ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|author2=Hurricane Research Division|author3=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|date=2013-04-05|accessdate=2013-12-23|title=The Northeast and North Central Pacific hurricane database 1949-2012|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-nencpac-1949-2012-040513.txt|format=TXT}}</ref>

Before Francelia made its final landfall, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) issued warnings for countries in the western Caribbean, although there were few observations confirming the track while it was active due to inadequate regional weather stations and lack of the Hurricane Hunters close to land.<ref name="usaid"/> When Francelia nearly stalled off the coast of [[Central America]], it brought prolonged rainfall and extensive flooding.<ref name="mwr"/> In Guatemala, daily rainfall reached 7.27&nbsp;in (184.6&nbsp;mm) at a station along the [[Achiguate River]],<ref>{{cite report|section=Rainfall|title=Fuego Volcano, Guatemala|publisher=Michigan Technological University |accessdate=2013-12-12|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/fuego/rainfall.html}}</ref> and totals reached about {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} in some mountainous areas.<ref name="usaid"/> Along the Belizean coast, the hurricane produced a [[storm tide]] of about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|agency=United Press International|title=Hurricane Slams Honduran Coast|date=1969-09-03|newspaper=The News and Courier|accessdate=2013-12-12|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BFlJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JAoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=922,249847&dq=hurricane&hl=en}}</ref> Mountain rainfall resulted in overflown rivers, with the Belize River rising to over {{convert|36|ft|m}} above normal.<ref name="mwr"/> The hurricane forced over 20,000&nbsp;people to evacuate their homes.<ref name="usaid">{{cite report|page=115-128|accessdate=2013-12-12|year=1970|title=Foreign Disaster Emergency Relief Tenth Report|publisher=Agency for International Development|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdacl011.pdf}}</ref>

Offshore northern Honduras, the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] experienced heavy rainfall and high tides from the hurricane. Most of the houses in French Harbor were damaged or destroyed, leaving 400&nbsp;families homeless. About half of the town of [[Coxen Hole]] on [[Roat<U+00E1>n]] was destroyed, and the rest of the buildings were damaged. Damage was less severe on [[<U+00DA>tila]] and [[Guanaja]] islands. Francelia flooded most of the northern coast of Honduras, inundating the airport in [[San Pedro Sula]] to a depth of {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In San Pedro Sula, the storm cut the water supply for several days, and the floods cut road and rail links between there and [[Puerto Cort<U+00E9>s]] along the coast. Across the region, Francelia caused widespread power outages. Along the [[Ul<U+00FA>a River]], several residents were stranded when their cars stalled in flooded roadways. The floods wrecked four bridges on a road between [[La Lima]] and [[Tela]]. Flooding also ruined over 50% of the [[United Fruit Company]]'s banana crop, forcing over {{convert|15000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} to be replaced.<ref name="usaid"/> Banana damage totaled $4.7&nbsp;million,<ref name="mwr"/> and United Fruit estimated it would take two years to reach production levels before the hurricane. Other damaged crops included corn, sugar, coconut, and bean. Nationwide, the hurricane destroyed about 1,000&nbsp;houses, leaving 5,000&nbsp;people homeless. Damage was estimated at $19&nbsp;million.<ref name="usaid"/>

In neighboring Guatemala, Francelia caused [[flash flood]]ing along the Pacific coast due to the heavy rainfall. The rains overflowed rivers, canals, and the crater lake of [[Volc<U+00E1>n de Agua]], causing widespread landslides. The floods and landslides wrecked highways, rail lines, and many boats, leaving several towns isolated. A {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} portion of the [[Pan-American Highway]] was washed out in the country's western portion, and another bridge was destroyed by a landslide between [[Quetzaltenango]] and [[Huehuetenango]]; landslides also forced the closure of two roads in [[Quich<U+00E9> Department]]. In [[Amatitl<U+00E1>n]], the floods covered the entire town with mud to shoulder-height. Five entire towns were largely destroyed, leaving 10,200&nbsp;people homeless nationwide. Francelia destroyed 1,704&nbsp;houses, mostly along rivers and in landslide zones. The floods also damaged power lines and crops. Throughout the country, the hurricane killed 269&nbsp;people and caused $15&nbsp;million in damage.<ref name="usaid"/>

Francelia's rainfall extended into El Salvador, where about 1,000&nbsp;homes were flooded along the [[Lempa River]]. Isolated residents along the [[Paz River]] required food to be airdropped. The floods damaged corn and sorghum crops, and some livestock were killed. Francelia destroyed 42&nbsp;houses in El Salvador, destroyed a bridge, and caused $1.6&nbsp;million in damage. The hurricane killed two people and injured 40&nbsp;others.<ref name="usaid"/> Heavy damage also occurred along the Belize coast, and communications were cut.<ref name="oc">{{cite news|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=2013-12-12|title=Francelia Hits Guatemala Hills|date=1969-09-04|agency=Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19690904&id=OHxPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5133,462727}}</ref> The storm caused extensive damage to crops,<ref name="mwr"/> including heavy losses to the banana industry. High waves and heavy rainfall caused power outages and flooded coastal roadways.<ref name="oc"/>

==Aftermath==
By September&nbsp;5, or two days after the hurricane's landfall, floods were receding across Honduras, and flights were restored to the Bay Islands. Floods receded a day later in Guatemala and not until September&nbsp;9 in El Salvador.<ref name="usaid"/>

Shortly after Francelia struck the Bay Islands, the Honduran health ministry flew a doctor and nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a [[Football War|war]] earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods with the assistance of the United States, installing two [[Bailey bridge]]s that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and [[C-ration]]s. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10&nbsp;tons of medicine from Brazil, 500&nbsp;blankets from Chile, and 200&nbsp;bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.<ref name="usaid"/>
