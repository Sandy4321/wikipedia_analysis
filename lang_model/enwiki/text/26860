'''If Day''' ({{lang-fr|"'''Si un jour'''"}}, "If one day"<ref name=burch/>) was a simulated [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invasion of the Canadian city of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], and surrounding areas on February 19, 1942, during the [[Second World War]]. It was organized by the Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan organization, which was led by prominent Winnipeg businessman [[J. D. Perrin]]. The event was the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point.

If Day included a staged firefight between Canadian troops and volunteers dressed as German soldiers, the internment of prominent politicians, the imposition of Nazi rule, and a parade. The event was a fundraiser for the war effort: over [[C$]]3&nbsp;million was collected in Winnipeg on that day. It was later the subject of a 2006 documentary, and was included in [[Guy Maddin]]'s film ''[[My Winnipeg]]''.

==Background==
[[File:GiveUsTheTools.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[A. J. Casson]]'s Canadian Victory Bonds poster ''Give Us The Tools'' 1941]]
If Day was an elaborate campaign to promote the purchase of [[war bond|Victory Bonds]]. These bonds, which were loans to the government to allow for increased war spending, were sold to individuals and corporations throughout Canada.  If Day was the second Victory Loan campaign of the Second World War. The campaign began on February 16, 1942, and continued until March 9. [[Manitoba]]<U+2019>s fundraising target was $45&nbsp;million ($620 million in 2011 dollars<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=20 August 2011|publisher=Bank of Canada|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/|title=Inflation Calculator}}</ref>), including $24.5 million from [[Winnipeg]]. The Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan committee, a regional branch of the [[National War Finance Committee]], organized If Day under chairman J. D. Perrin. The organizers believed that bringing the war (or, rather, a simulation thereof) to people's homes would result in a change of attitude among those not directly affected by the war.<ref name=newman>{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=Michael|title=February 19, 1942: If Day|journal=Manitoba History|date=Spring 1987|issue=13|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/13/ifday.shtml|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

The committee drew up a map of Manitoba, which was divided into 45 sections, each representing $1&nbsp;million of their fundraising target. As money came in from those selling Victory Bonds, the sections were "reclaimed" from the Nazi invaders.<ref name=dawn/> The map was posted at the corner of Portage and Main, the city's central intersection.<ref name=werier/> The campaign was publicized in local newspapers for a few days before the event, although the "invasion" took many citizens by surprise.<ref name=dawn/><ref name=ctv/> To prevent a rush to emergency shelters, residents of neighbouring northern [[Minnesota]] were also warned because radio broadcasts dramatizing the event could be received in that area.<ref name=dawn/>{{#tag:ref|Organizers hoped to avoid a similar situation to the [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|1938 radio drama ''The War of the Worlds'']], when a fictional broadcast of an alien invasion was interpreted as real by frightened citizens.<ref name=burch/>|group="note"}} [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] aircraft painted to look like German fighter planes flew over the city on February 18, 1942.<ref name=if>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|title=If|page=1|author=Groom, Kick|date=5 January 1985}}</ref> [[Selkirk, Manitoba|Selkirk]], a small town northeast of Winnipeg, held its own fundraising simulation, a one-hour blackout and mock bombing, on February 18, 1942 in preparation for the main If Day event.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=18 February 1942|title=War's nightmare staged in vivid Selkirk raid to boost Victory Loan|page=1}}</ref>

Nazi patrols in the city began before 5:30&nbsp;am on February 19. A radio announcer was detained and his microphone commandeered for radio broadcasts, beginning at 5:45&nbsp;am.

The firefight included large-scale troop movements and the simulated destruction of major bridges.<ref name=floresco/><ref name=morn/> Nine troop formations held three positions each during the tightly scripted invasion sequence; they were directed via telephone (one line per formation) and [[flash-lamp]] signals from the headquarters established at the Chamber of Commerce building. The defensive pattern employed was similar to that used during the [[First World War]] in [[Paris]] to conduct soldiers to the [[front (military)|front]].<ref name=tactics/> Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified.<ref name=burch/> Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8&nbsp;am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event, a soldier who sprained his ankle and a woman who cut her thumb preparing toast during the early-morning blackout.<ref name=grim/>

At 9:30&nbsp;am, the Canadian troops surrendered to the Nazis and withdrew to the downtown muster point,<ref name=dawn/> and the city was occupied. The fake Nazis began a widespread harassment campaign, sending armed troops throughout the city. A tank was driven down Portage Avenue, one of the main streets of the downtown area.<ref name=floresco/> Some people were taken to an internment camp at [[Lower Fort Garry]]; those interned included prominent local politicians like Premier [[John Bracken]] (arrested with several members of his [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] at a [[caucus]] meeting), Mayor [[John Queen]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba]] [[Roland Fairbairn McWilliams]], and visiting Norwegian ambassador to the United States [[Wilhelm Thorleif von Munthe af Morgenstierne|Wilhelm de Morgenstierne]].<ref name=grim>{{cite news|title=Grim realism marks arrest at legislature|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=19 February 1942|pages=1, 10}}</ref><ref name=floresco/> One council member, Dan McClean, escaped but was recaptured after an intensive search.<ref name=if/> Chief of Police George Smith avoided capture because he was dining out when soldiers arrived at his office.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|title=Blitz swoops on city|date=19 February 1942|page=1}}</ref> The [[Union Flag]] at Lower Fort Garry was replaced with the [[flag of Nazi Germany|swastika]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Tribune|page=10|title=If IF DAY Were Real|date=19 February 1942}}</ref> The city was renamed "[[Heinrich Himmler|Himmlerstadt]]", and Main Street was termed "Hitlerstrasse".<ref name=if/><ref>{{cite book|page=175|title=Savage detours|author=Morton, Lisa; Adamson, Kent|publisher=McFarland & Co|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7864-4353-6}}</ref>

Erich von Neurenberg was installed as ''[[gauleiter]]'' (provincial leader); he was assisted by George Waight, who acted as the local [[Gestapo]] chief.<ref name=if/><ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=17 December 1985|title=Obituaries: George Waight|page=A14}}</ref> Their stated purpose was to assist Hitler in his plans to take advantage of Canada's relatively low population density by colonizing the country.<ref name=newman/> Von Neurenberg issued the following decree, which was posted throughout the city:

==Effects==
[[File:If day map.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Map showing the sale of Victory Bonds in Manitoba]]
The If Day event not only resulted in Victory Bond sales well over Greater Winnipeg's goal, but brought Winnipeg's innovative efforts to the attention of people throughout North America. ''[[Life Magazine]]'' ran a pictorial spread of the If Day activities in Winnipeg and in smaller centres across Manitoba, photographed by William Shrout.<ref name=life>{{cite journal|title=Winnipeg is 'conquered'|journal=Life|date=9 March 1942|pages=30<U+2013>32|volume=12|number=10}}</ref> Reporters from several American publications, including ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', were also present for the event;<ref name=if/> cameraman [[Lucien Roy]] shot newsreel footage.<ref name=life/> Newspapers as far away as New Zealand included stories about the event.<ref name=floresco/> An estimated 40 million people worldwide saw coverage of If Day.<ref name=if/>

The money raised for the Victory Loan campaign on If Day was $3.2&nbsp;million, which was the city's largest single-day total.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|title=Record day for war loan|page=1|date=19 February 1942}}</ref> Winnipeg passed its $24&nbsp;million Victory Loan quota on February 24, largely because of the effects of If Day.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|title=Winnipeg leaps past its war bond quota|date=24 February 1942|page=1}}</ref> The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60&nbsp;million, well above its target quota of $45&nbsp;million. The campaign raised approximately $2&nbsp;billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day was considered one of the most successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive.<ref name=floresco/>  Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Tribune|title=Only 23 enlist during If Day|page=13|date=20 February 1942}}</ref>

If Day was successful enough to spark imitations in other communities. The US government contacted the organizing committee for details of the event. A smaller-scale invasion was staged in [[Vancouver]], using promotional materials from the Winnipeg campaign.<ref name=if/>

In 2006, a television documentary of the events was made by [[Aaron Floresco]].<ref name=PPP>{{cite web|title=If Day (2006)|url=http://www.pastperfectpro.com/ifday.html|publisher=Past Perfect Productions|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> The work incorporates newsreel footage from the event, as well as interviews with historians and participants.<ref name=ctv>{{cite news|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|title=What if Nazis invaded city?
