'''Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Knight of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Companion of Honour|CH]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Royal Academician|Hon. RA]]}} (30 November 1874{{spaced ndash}}24 January 1965) was a [[British people|British]] [[politician]] who was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945 (that is, for most of the [[Second World War]]) and again from 1951 to 1955. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century, Churchill was also an [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[British Army]], a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British Prime Minister to have received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and was the first person to be made an [[honorary citizen of the United States]].

Churchill was born into the aristocratic family of the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukes of Marlborough]], a branch of the [[Spencer family]]. His father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], was a charismatic politician who served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]; his mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Jerome]], was an American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in [[British India]], [[Sudan|The Sudan]], and the [[Second Boer War]]. He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns.

At the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions. Before the First World War, he served as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] as part of the [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] [[Liberal Government 1905<U+2013>1915|Liberal government]]. During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous [[Gallipoli Campaign]] caused his departure from government. He then briefly resumed active army service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as commander of the 6th Battalion of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]. He returned to government as [[Minister of Munitions]], [[Secretary of State for War]], and [[Secretary of State for Air]]. After the War, Churchill served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] ([[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]]) government of 1924<U+2013>29, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy. Also controversial was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of [[Edward VIII]].

Out of office and politically "in the wilderness" during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in warning about [[Nazi Germany]] and in campaigning for rearmament. On the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of [[Neville Chamberlain]] on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister. His steadfast refusal to consider defeat, surrender, or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone among European countries in its active opposition to [[Adolf Hitler]]. Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts, which helped inspire the British people. He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.

After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] ([[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]) government. After winning the 1951 election, he again became Prime Minister, before retiring in 1955. Upon his death, [[Elizabeth II]] granted him the honour of a [[state funeral]], which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history.<ref name="news">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4421081.stm|title=Largest Assemblage of Statesmen at funeral since Churchill|work=BBC News|first=Peter|last=Gould|date=8 April 2005}}</ref> Named the [[100 Greatest Britons|Greatest Briton]] of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history, consistently ranking well in [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]].

Churchill's father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], the third son of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], was a politician; and his mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] ({{n<U+00E9>e}} Jennie Jerome) was the daughter of American millionaire [[Leonard Jerome]]. Churchill was born on 30 November 1874, two months prematurely, in a bedroom in [[Blenheim Palace]], Woodstock, Oxfordshire.<ref>Jenkins, p. 7</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Churchill|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=0143117998|page=4}}</ref>

From age two to six, he lived in [[Dublin]], where his grandfather had been appointed [[Viceroy]] and employed Churchill's father as his private secretary. Churchill's brother, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill]], was born during this time in Ireland. It has been claimed that the young Churchill first developed his fascination with military matters from watching the many parades pass by the Vice Regal Lodge (now [[<U+00C1>ras an Uachtar<U+00E1>in]], the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civildefence.ie/cdweb.nsf/documents/AEEB06284977F81C80256E8A003C631F |title=Introduction to Civil Defence in Ireland <U+2013> Background |publisher=[[Civil Defence Ireland#Civil Defence College|Civil Defence College]] (Ireland) |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>O<U+2019>Farrell, Padraic (2000).

Churchill's earliest exposure to education occurred in Dublin, where a governess tried teaching him reading, writing, and arithmetic (his first reading book was called 'Reading Without Tears'). With limited contact with his parents, Churchill became very close to his nanny, 'Mrs' [[Elizabeth Anne Everest]], whom he called 'Old Woom'. She served as his confidante, nurse, and mother substitute.<ref>Jenkins, p. 10</ref> The two spent many happy hours playing in [[Phoenix Park]].<ref>Jordan, Anthony (1995).

Independent and rebellious by nature, Churchill generally had a poor academic record in school, for which he was punished.<ref name="britannica">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117269/Sir-Winston-Churchill |title=Sir Winston Churchill Biography |work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica}}</ref> He was educated at three independent schools: [[St. George's School, Ascot]], Berkshire; [[Stoke Brunswick School|Brunswick School]] in [[Hove]], near Brighton (the school has since been renamed [[Stoke Brunswick School]] and relocated to [[Ashurst Wood]] in West Sussex); and at [[Harrow School]] from 17 April 1888. Within weeks of his arrival at Harrow, Churchill had joined the [[Combined Cadet Force|Harrow Rifle Corps]].<ref name="Centre-Hussars">[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/biography/the-soldier/lt-churchill-4th-queens-own-hussars Lt Churchill: 4th Queen's Own Hussars], The Churchill Centre. Retrieved 28 August 2009.</ref>

{{stack|float=right|[[File:Blenheim main entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Blenheim Palace]], the Churchill family home]]}}
Churchill was rarely visited by his mother, and wrote letters begging her either to come to the school or to allow him to come home. His relationship with his father was distant; he once remarked that they barely spoke to one another.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>  His father died on 24 January 1895, aged 45, leaving Churchill with the conviction that he too would die young and so should be quick about making his mark on the world.<ref>Haffner, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FI2LNFtBLasC&pg=PA32&dq=die+young p. 32]</ref>

===Speech impediment===
Churchill had a [[lisp]] that continued throughout his career, reported consistently by journalists of the time and later. Authors writing in the 1920s and 1930s, before sound recording became common, also mentioned Churchill having a stutter, describing it in terms such as 'severe' or 'agonizing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/sharp/Churchill.htm |title= Winston Churchill, Stutterer}}</ref> Churchill described himself as having a "speech impediment" which he worked to overcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The Churchill Centre and Museum says the majority of records show his impediment was a lisp, while Churchill's stutter is a myth.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mather | first = John | title = Churchill<U+2019>s speech impediment was stuttering | publisher = The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Churchill War Rooms, London | date = 5 September 2009 | url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/myths/he-stuttered | accessdate = 27 December 2012}}. "Reports of Churchill by his family and cousins do not mention stuttering. Later on Churchill dictated to many <U+2018>secretaries<U+2019> and none mention any hesitation (possible stuttering) in his speech but rather a charming lisp. All secretaries that took dictation, but one, agree that any hesitation was a <U+2018>searching<U+2019> for the right words."</ref>

His dentures were specially designed to aid his speech ([[Demosthenes]]' pebbles).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6954|title=Churchill's teeth sell for almost $24,000}}</ref> After many years of public speeches carefully prepared not only to inspire, but also to avoid hesitations, he could finally state, "My impediment is no hindrance".<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Fb3PKOd6A2cC&pg=PA162|title=Public speaking in the reshaping of... |publisher=Google books|date=1987-10|accessdate=12 April 2010|isbn=978-0-87413-315-8|author1=Oliver, Robert Tarbell}}</ref>

===Marriage and children===
[[File:Winston Churchill (1874-1965) with fianc<U+00E9>e Clementine Hozier (1885-1977) shortly before their marriage in 1908.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A young Winston Churchill and fianc<U+00E9>e [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|Clementine Hozier]] shortly before their marriage in 1908]]
Churchill met his future wife, [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine Hozier]], in 1904 at a ball in Crewe House, home of the [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Earl of Crewe]] and Crewe's wife [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe#Family|Margaret Primrose]] (daughter of [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], and [[Rothschild family|Hannah Rothschild]]).<ref>[[Mary Soames|Soames, Mary]]: ''Speaking for Themselves: The Personal Letters of Winston and Clementine Churchill''. p. 1</ref> In 1908, they met again at a dinner party hosted by [[Susan Jeune, Baroness St Helier]]. Churchill found himself seated beside Clementine, and they soon began a lifelong romance.<ref>Soames, p. 6</ref> He proposed to Clementine during a house party at Blenheim Palace on 10 August 1908, in a small [[Blenheim Palace#Park and gardens|Temple of Diana]].<ref>Soames, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>

On 12 September 1908, he and Clementine were married in [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]]. The church was packed; the [[Alfred George Edwards|Bishop of St Asaph]] conducted the service.<ref>Soames, p. 17</ref> The couple spent their honeymoon at [[Highgrove House, Eastcote|Highgrove House]] in [[Eastcote]].<ref>Edwards, 1987, p. 12</ref> In March 1909, the couple moved to a house at 33 Eccleston Square.

Their first child, [[Diana Churchill|Diana]], was born in London on 11 July 1909. After the pregnancy, Clementine moved to Sussex to recover, while Diana stayed in London with her nanny.<ref>Soames, pp. 18, 22, 25</ref> On 28 May 1911, their second child, [[Randolph Churchill|Randolph]], was born at 33 Eccleston Square.<ref>Soames, pp. 40, 44</ref>

Their third child, [[Sarah Tuchet-Jesson, Baroness Audley|Sarah]], was born on 7 October 1914 at [[Admiralty House (London)|Admiralty House]]. The birth was marked with anxiety for Clementine, as Churchill had been sent to [[Antwerp]] by the Cabinet to "stiffen the resistance of the beleaguered city" after news that the Belgians intended to surrender the town.<ref>Soames, p. 105</ref>

Clementine gave birth to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the official end of the First World War.<ref>Soames, p. 217</ref> In the early days of August 1921, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent named [[Miss|Mlle.]] Rose. Clementine, meanwhile, travelled to [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]] to play tennis with [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster]], and his family. While still under the care of Mlle. Rose, Marigold had a cold, but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed with hardly any notice, it turned into [[septicaemia]]. Following advice from a landlady, Rose sent for Clementine. However the illness turned fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] three days later.<ref>Soames, pp. 239, 241</ref>

On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child, [[Mary Soames, Baroness Soames|Mary]], was born. Later that month, the Churchills bought [[Chartwell]], which would be their home until Winston's death in 1965.<ref>Soames, p. 262</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Crowhurst |first=Richard |year=2006 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |title=Chartwell: Churchill's House of Refuge |url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/06/Oct/chartwell.shtml |publisher=Moira Allen}}</ref>

==Military service==
[[File:Winston Churchill 1874 - 1965 ZZZ5426F.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill in military uniform, 1895]]

After Churchill left Harrow in 1893, he applied to attend the [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst|Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. He tried three times before passing the entrance exam; he applied for cavalry rather than infantry because the grade requirement was lower and did not require him to learn mathematics, which he disliked. He graduated eighth out of a class of 150 in December 1894,<ref>Jenkins, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref> and although he could now have transferred to an infantry regiment as his father had wished, chose to remain with the cavalry and was commissioned as a [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] ([[Second Lieutenant]]) in the [[4th Queen's Own Hussars]] on 20 February 1895.<ref name="Centre-Hussars"/> In 1941, he received the honour of being appointed [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Regimental Colonel]] of the 4th [[Queen's Royal Hussars#Privileges & traditions|Hussars]], an honour which was increased after the Second World War when he was appointed as [[Colonel-in-Chief]]; a privilege usually reserved for royalty.

Churchill's pay as a second-lieutenant in the 4th Hussars was <U+00A3>300 annually. However, he believed that he needed at least a further <U+00A3>500 (equivalent to <U+00A3>55,000 in 2012 terms)<ref>Bank of England inflation calculatorhttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/inflation/calculator/flash/default.aspx</ref> to support a style of life equal to that of other [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] of the regiment. His mother provided an allowance of <U+00A3>400 per year, but this was repeatedly overspent. According to biographer [[Roy Jenkins]], this is one reason why he took an interest in war correspondence.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 21<U+2013>45</ref> He did not intend to follow a conventional career of promotion through army ranks, but rather to seek out all possible chances of military action, using his mother's and family influence in high society to arrange postings to active campaigns. His writings brought him to the attention of the public, and earned him significant additional income. He acted as a war correspondent for several London newspapers<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the character and achievement of Sir Winston Churchill|journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science, Vol 23, No. 2 May 1957 (May 1957)|pages=173<U+2013>194|author=G.K. Lewis}}</ref> and wrote his own books about the campaigns.

===Cuba===
In 1895, Churchill, and fellow officer [[Reginald Barnes]], travelled to [[Cuba]] to observe the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] fight the [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban guerrillas]]; he had obtained a commission to write about the conflict from the ''[[The Graphic|Daily Graphic]]''. He came under fire on his twenty-first birthday,<ref name="Centre-Hussars"/> the first of about 50 times during his life, and the Spanish awarded him his first medal.<ref name="johnson2009">{{cite book | title=Churchill | publisher=Viking | author=Johnson, Paul | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-101-14929-4}}</ref>{{rp|17}} Churchill had fond memories of Cuba as a "...large, rich, beautiful island..."<ref>Churchill, Winston S. 1951 The Second World War, Volume 5: Closing the Ring. Houghton Miffin Edition. Bantam Books, New York No ISBN or other number provided. p. 606. "Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary 5. Feb (19)44. Your minute about raising certain legations to the status of embassy. I must say that Cuba has as good a claim as some other places<U+2013>'la perla de Las Antillas'. Great offence will be given if all the others have it and this large, rich, beautiful island, the home of the cigar, is denied. Surely Cuba has much more claim than Venezuela. You will make a bitter enemy if you leave them out, and after a bit you will be forced to give them what you have given to the others."</ref> While there, he soon acquired a taste for Havana cigars, which he would smoke for the rest of his life. While in New York, he stayed at the home of [[William Bourke Cockran|Bourke Cockran]], an admirer of his mother. Bourke was an established American politician, and a member of the House of Representatives.

He soon received word that his nanny, Mrs Everest, was dying; he then returned to England and stayed with her for a week until she died. He wrote in his journal, "She was my favourite friend."

In 1897, Churchill attempted to travel to both report and, if necessary, fight in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]], but this conflict effectively ended before he could arrive. Later, while preparing for a leave in England, he heard that three brigades of the [[British Army]] were going to fight against a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe in the North West Frontier of India and he asked his superior officer if he could join the fight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arthursclassicnovels.com/arthurs/churchill/mkdff10.html |title=The Story Of The Malakand Field Force&nbsp;<U+2013> An Episode of Frontier War |author=Sir Winston S.

Jeffery sent him with fifteen scouts to explore the [[Mamund]] Valley; while on reconnaissance, they encountered an enemy tribe, dismounted from their horses and opened fire. After an hour of shooting, their reinforcements, the 35th [[Sikh Regiment|Sikhs]] arrived, the firing gradually ceased and the brigade and the Sikhs marched on. Hundreds of tribesmen then ambushed them and opened fire, forcing them to retreat. As they were retreating, four men were carrying an injured officer, but the fierceness of the fight forced them to leave him behind. The man who was left behind was slashed to death before Churchill's eyes; afterwards he wrote of the killer, "I forgot everything else at this moment except a desire to kill this man."<ref name="Mamund"/> However, the Sikhs' numbers were being depleted, so the next commanding officer told Churchill to get the rest of the men to safety.

Before he left, he asked for a note so that he would not be charged with desertion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Winston |title=My Early Life |year=2002 |month=October |publisher=Eland Publishing Ltd |isbn=0-907871-62-3 |page=143}}</ref> He received the note, quickly signed, headed up the hill and alerted the other brigade, whereupon they then engaged the army.

===Sudan and Oldham===
[[File:WinstonChurchillRiverWar.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The River War]]'' was published in 1899.]]
Churchill was transferred to [[Egypt]] in 1898. He visited [[Luxor]] before joining an attachment of the [[21st Lancers]] serving in the [[Sudan]] under the command of General [[Herbert Kitchener]]. During this time he encountered two military officers with whom he would work during the First World War: [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], then a captain, and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]], then a gunboat lieutenant.<ref>Jenkins, p. 40</ref> While in the Sudan, he participated in what has been described as the last meaningful British [[charge (warfare)|cavalry charge]], at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] in September 1898.<ref>[[Terry Brighton|Brighton, Terry]], ''The Last Charge: the 21st Lancers and the Battle of Omdurman''. Marlborough: Crowood, 1998. ISBN 1-86126-189-6</ref> He also worked as a war correspondent for the ''[[Morning Post]]''. By October 1898, he had returned to Britain and begun his two-volume work; ''[[The River War]]'', an account of the reconquest of the Sudan which was published the following year. Churchill resigned from the British Army effective from 5 May 1899.

{{main|Oldham by-election, 1899}}
He soon had his first opportunity to begin a Parliamentary career, when he was invited by [[Robert Ascroft]] to be the second [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate in Ascroft's [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]] constituency. Ascroft's sudden death caused a double by-election and Churchill was one of the candidates. In the midst of a national trend against the Conservatives, both seats were lost; however Churchill impressed by his vigorous campaigning.

===South Africa===
Having failed at Oldham, Churchill looked about for some other opportunity to advance his career. On 12 October 1899, the [[Second Boer War]] between Britain and the [[Boer Republics]] broke out and he obtained a commission to act as war correspondent for ''[[The Morning Post]]'' with a salary of <U+00A3>250 per month. He rushed to sail on the same ship as the newly appointed British commander, [[Redvers Buller|Sir Redvers Buller]]. After some weeks in exposed areas, he accompanied a scouting expedition in an armoured train, leading to his capture and imprisonment in a [[POW camp]] in [[Pretoria]] (converted school building for [[Pretoria High School for Girls]]). His actions during the ambush of the train led to speculation that he would be awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], Britain's highest award to members of the armed forces for gallantry in the face of the enemy, but this was not possible, as he was a civilian.<ref name="Centre-Hussars"/>

He escaped from the prison camp and travelled almost {{convert|300|mi|km}} to Portuguese [[Maputo|Louren<U+00E7>o Marques]] in [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], with the assistance of an English mine manager.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 55<U+2013>62</ref> His escape made him a minor [[hero|national hero]] for a time in Britain though, instead of returning home, he rejoined General Buller's army on its march to relieve the British at the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] and take Pretoria.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref> This time, although continuing as a war correspondent, he gained a commission in the [[South African Light Horse]]. He was among the first British troops into [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] and Pretoria. He and his cousin, [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough|the Duke of Marlborough]], were able to get ahead of the rest of the troops in Pretoria, where they demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref>

In 1900 he retired from the regular army, and in 1902 joined the [[Yeomanry|Imperial Yeomanry]], where he was commissioned as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars]] on 4 January 1902.<ref name="yeoman1">{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/commissions-and-military-attachments |title=Churchill's Commissions and Military Attachments, The Churchill Centre |publisher=Winstonchurchill.org |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> In that same year, he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] at Studholme Lodge #1591, London, and raised to the Third Degree on 25 March 1902.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Beresiner |first=Yasha |year=2002 |month=October |title=Brother Winston: Churchill as a Freemason |journal=Masonic Quarterly Magazine |issue=3 |location=London |publisher=Grand Lodge Publications Limited for the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] |accessdate=29 July 2012 |url=http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-3/p-06.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://204.3.136.66/web/articles/jan-feb05/morris.htm |title=Brother Winston S.

===First Lord of the Admiralty===
In October 1911, Churchill was appointed [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. While serving in this position, he put strong emphasis on modernisation and was also in favour of using [[aeroplane]]s in combat.(''See [[Bertram Dickson|Captain Bertram Dickson]]'') He launched a program to replace coal power with oil power. When he assumed his position, oil was already being used on submarines and destroyers, but most ships were still coal-powered, though oil was sprayed on the coals. Churchill began this program by ordering that the upcoming {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s were to be built with oil-fired engines. Churchill also established a Royal Commission chaired by Admiral [[Jackie Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John Fisher]], which confirmed the benefits of oil over coal in three classified reports, and judged that ample supplies of oil existed, but recommended that oil reserves be maintained in the event of war. The delegation then travelled to the [[Persian Gulf]], and the government, largely through Churchill's advice, eventually invested in the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], bought most of its stock, and negotiated a secret contract with a 20-year supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epmag.com/archives/digitalOilField/5911.htm |title=Naval innovation: From coal to oil |publisher=Epmag.com |date=4 July 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/winston_churchill.htm |title=Winston Churchill |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>

Churchill continued to serve as First Lord of the Admiralty into [[World War I]]. When a coalition government was formed in May 1915 Churchill was removed from the Admiralty because he had proposed the disastrous [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. He remained in the Cabinet for six months as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] until the decision was made to evacuate the Gallipoli bridgehead.

===Western Front===
[[File:WinstonChurchill1916Army.gif|thumb|Winston Churchill commanding the 6th Battalion, the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]], 1916]]
After his resignation, Churchill rejoined the [[British Army]], attempting to obtain an appointment as brigade commander, but settling for command of a battalion. After spending some time as a Major with the 2nd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]], he was appointed [[Lieutenant-Colonel]], commanding the 6th Battalion, [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] (part of the [[9th (Scottish) Division]]), on 1 January 1916. Correspondence with his wife shows that his intent in taking up active service was to rehabilitate his reputation, but this was balanced by the serious risk of being killed. As a commander he continued to exhibit the reckless daring which had been a hallmark of all his military actions, although he disapproved strongly of the mass slaughter involved in many [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] actions.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 301<U+2013>02</ref>

[[Bill Deedes|Lord Deedes]] opined to a gathering of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 2001 why Churchill went to the front line: "He was with [[Grenadier Guards]], who were dry at battalion headquarters. They very much liked tea and condensed milk, which had no great appeal to Winston, but alcohol was permitted in the front line, in the trenches. So he suggested to the colonel that he really ought to see more of the war and get into the front line. This was highly commended by the colonel, who thought it was a very good thing to do."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Churchill Remembered: Recollections by Tony Benn MP, Lord Carrington, Lord Deedes and Mary Soames |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |pages=393<U+2013>414 [404] |author=T Benn et al. |volume=11 |year=2001 |doi=10.1017/S0080440101000202 |jstor=3679430 |issue=11}}</ref> (Near the end of his life, a new MP asked the former prime minister if he would like some tea.

===Early years in Parliament===
{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}
Churchill stood again for the [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|seat of Oldham]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]].<ref name="LG 6 November 1900">{{London Gazette |issue=27244 |date=6 November 1900 |startpage=6772 |endpage= |supp= |accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> After winning the seat, he went on a speaking tour throughout Britain and the United States, raising <U+00A3>10,000 for himself (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10000|1900|r=-4}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} In Parliament, he became associated with a faction of the Conservative Party led by [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood|Lord Hugh Cecil]]; the [[Hughligans]]. During his first [[parliamentary session]], he opposed the government's military expenditure<ref>Jenkins, pp. 74<U+2013>76</ref> and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s proposal of extensive tariffs, which were intended to protect Britain's economic dominance. His own constituency effectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for Oldham until the next general election. After the [[Whitsun]] recess in 1904, he [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to sit as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. As a Liberal, he continued to campaign for [[free trade]]. When the Liberals took office with [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] as prime minister, in December 1905, Churchill became [[Under-Secretary of State]] for the Colonies, dealing mainly with South Africa after the Boer War. From 1903 until 1905, Churchill was also engaged in writing ''[[Lord Randolph Churchill (book)|Lord Randolph Churchill]]'', a two-volume biography of his father which was published in 1906 and received much critical acclaim.<ref>Jenkins, p. 101</ref>

Following his deselection in the seat of Oldham, Churchill was invited to stand for [[Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North West]]. He won the seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]] with a majority of 1,214 and represented the seat for two years, until 1908.<ref name="centre-710">{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/churchills-elections|title=Churchill's Elections|accessdate=28 August 2009|last=Hall|first=Douglas J.|publisher=The Churchill Centre}}</ref> When Campbell-Bannerman was succeeded by [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] in 1908, Churchill was promoted to the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Trade]].<ref name=gilbert /> Under the law at the time, a newly appointed Cabinet Minister was obliged to seek re-election at a by-election; Churchill lost his seat but was soon back as a member for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee constituency]].

[[File:Churchill 1904 Q 42037.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill in 1904]]
Churchill also assisted in passing the [[People's Budget]],<ref>Jenkins, pp. 157<U+2013>66</ref> becoming President of the Budget League, an organisation set up in response to the opposition's "Budget Protest League".<ref>Jenkins, p. 161</ref> The budget included the introduction of new taxes on the wealthy to allow for the creation of new social welfare programmes. After the budget bill was passed by the Commons in 1909 it was vetoed by the [[House of Lords]]. The Liberals then fought and won two general elections in January and December 1910 to gain a mandate for their reforms. The budget was passed after the first election, and after the second election the [[Parliament Act 1911]], for which Churchill also campaigned, was passed. In 1910, he was promoted to [[Home Secretary]]. His term was controversial after his responses to the [[Siege of Sidney Street]] and the [[Tonypandy Riot|dispute at the Cambrian Colliery]] and the [[suffragettes]].

In 1910, a number of [[coal miners]] in the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valley]] began what has come to be known as the [[Tonypandy Riot]].<ref name=toye /> The Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested troops be sent in to help police quell the rioting. Churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them to go as far as [[Swindon]] and [[Cardiff]], but blocked their deployment. On 9 November, ''[[The Times]]'' criticised this decision. In spite of this, the rumour persists that Churchill had ordered troops to attack, and his reputation in Wales and in Labour circles never recovered.<ref>Churchill, Randolph. Winston S. Churchill: Young Statesman. (c) 1967 C & T Publications pp. 359<U+2013>65</ref>

[[File:Sidney street churchill.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill (''highlighted'') at Sidney Street, 3 January 1911]]
In early January 1911, Churchill made a controversial visit to the [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in London. There is some uncertainty as to whether he attempted to give operational commands, and his presence attracted much criticism. After an inquest, [[Arthur Balfour]] remarked, "he [Churchill] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was [[the right honourable]] gentleman doing?"<ref>Churchill, Randolph. ''Winston S. Churchill: Young Statesman''. (c) 1967 C & T Publications: p. 395</ref> A biographer, [[Roy Jenkins]], suggests that he went simply because "he could not resist going to see the fun himself" and that he did not issue commands.<ref>Jenkins, p. 194</ref> Another account said the police had the miscreants<U+2014>[[Latvia]]n anarchists wanted for murder<U+2014>surrounded in a house, but Churchill called in the [[Scots Guards]] from the [[Tower of London]] and, dressed in top hat and astrakhan collar greatcoat, directed operations. The house caught fire and Churchill prevented the fire brigade from dousing the flames so that the men inside were burned to death. "I thought it better to let the house burn down rather than spend good British lives in rescuing those ferocious rascals."<ref>{{cite news |title=What next to tackle the riots? Curfew? Water cannon?

Churchill's proposed solution to the suffragette issue was a referendum on the issue, but this found no favour with [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and women's suffrage remained unresolved until after the First World War.<ref>Jenkins, p. 186</ref>

In 1911, Churchill was transferred to the office of [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], a post he held into the First World War. He gave impetus to several reform efforts, including development of [[naval aviation]] (he undertook flying lessons himself);<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/newreply.php?do=newreply&noquote=1&p=347553 Churchill took flying lessons, 1911], The Aerodrome.com</ref> the construction of new and larger warships; the development of tanks; and the switch from coal to oil in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>''Naval innovation: from coal to oil'', Erik J. Dahl, [[Joint Force Quarterly]], 2000</ref>

===First World War and the Post-War Coalition===
On 5 October 1914, Churchill went to [[Antwerp]], which the Belgian government proposed to evacuate. The [[Royal Marine]] Brigade was there and at Churchill's urgings the 1st and 2nd Naval Brigades were also committed. Antwerp fell on 10 October with the loss of 2500 men. At the time he was attacked for squandering resources.<ref>''The World Crisis'' (new edition), Odhams 1938, p. 323</ref> It is more likely that his actions prolonged the resistance by a week (Belgium had proposed surrendering Antwerp on 3 October) and that this time saved Calais and Dunkirk.<ref>Robert Rhodes James. ''Churchill: A Study in Failure''. Pelican, 1973, p. 80</ref>

Churchill was involved with the development of the [[tank]], which was financed from naval research funds.<ref name=WW1Tank/> He then headed the [[Landships Committee]] which was responsible for creating the first tank corps and, although a decade later development of the battle tank would be seen as a tactical victory, at the time it was seen as misappropriation of funds.<ref name=WW1Tank>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/tanks.htm|title=The First World War, The development of the Tank, sponsored by Winston Churchill|accessdate=16 December 2007}}</ref> In 1915, he was one of the political and military engineers of the disastrous [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] landings on the [[Dardanelles]] during the First World War.<ref name=Dardanelles>{{cite book|last=Callwell|first=C.E.|title=Dardanelles, a study of the strategical and certain tactical aspects of the Dardanelles campaign|publisher=Naval & Military Press Ltd|year=2005|location=London|isbn=978-1-84574-273-7}}</ref> He took much of the blame for the fiasco, and when [[H.

For several months Churchill served in the sinecure of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. However on 15 November 1915 he resigned from the government, feeling his energies were not being used<ref>Jenkins, p. 287</ref> and, though remaining an MP, served for several months on the [[Western Front]] commanding the 6th [[Battalion]] of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]], with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 301</ref><ref name="army.mod.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/4598.aspx |title=20th and early 21st Century&nbsp;<U+2013> British Army Website |publisher=Army.mod.uk |accessdate=3 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> While in command he personally made 36 forays into [[no man's land]], and his section of the front at [[Ploegsteert Wood|Ploegsteert]] became one of the most active.<ref name="army.mod.uk"/> In March 1916, Churchill returned to England after he had become restless in France and wished to speak again in the House of Commons.<ref>Jenkins, p. 309</ref> Future prime minister David Lloyd George acidly commented: "You will one day discover that the state of mind revealed in (your) letter is the reason why you do not win trust even where you command admiration.

A major preoccupation of his tenure in the [[War Office]] was the Allied intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Churchill was a staunch advocate of foreign intervention, declaring that [[Bolshevism]] must be "strangled in its cradle".<ref name="centre-282">{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031216033237/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282|archivedate=16 December 2003|title=Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness|accessdate=26 February 2007|author=Jeffrey Wallin with Juan Williams|date=4 September 2001|publisher=Churchill Centre}}</ref> He secured, from a divided and loosely organised Cabinet, intensification and prolongation of the British involvement beyond the wishes of any major group in Parliament or the nation<U+2014>and in the face of the bitter hostility of Labour.

===Rejoining the Conservative Party<U+2014>Chancellor of the Exchequer===
In September, the Conservative Party withdrew from the Coalition government, following a meeting of [[backbencher]]s dissatisfied with the handling of the [[Chanak Crisis]], a move that precipitated the looming [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|October 1922 General Election]]. Churchill fell ill during the campaign, and had to have an [[appendicectomy]]. This made it difficult for him to campaign, and a further setback was the internal division which continued to beset the Liberal Party. He came fourth in the poll for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]], losing to [[Scottish Prohibition Party|prohibitionist]] [[Edwin Scrymgeour]]. Churchill later quipped that he left [[Dundee]] "without an office, without a seat, without a party and without an appendix".<ref name="centre-710"/> He stood for the Liberals again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]], losing in [[Leicester]], and then as an independent, first without success in a [[Westminster Abbey by-election, 1924|by-election]] in the [[Westminster Abbey (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster Abbey constituency]], and then successfully in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|general election of 1924]] for [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping]]. The following year, he formally rejoined the Conservative Party, commenting wryly that "anyone can rat, but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat."<ref name="centre-710"/><ref>{{cite web

Churchill was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1924 under [[Stanley Baldwin]] and oversaw Britain's disastrous return to the [[Gold Standard]], which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike that led to the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/budget_99/budget_briefing/279928.stm Budget Blunders: Mr Churchill and the Gold Standard (1925)], BBC News. Retrieved 2 12 2007.</ref> His decision, announced in the 1924 Budget, came after long consultation with various economists including [[John Maynard Keynes]], the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]] and the board of the [[Bank of England]]. This decision prompted Keynes to write ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'', arguing that the return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925 (<U+00A3>1=$4.86) would lead to a world [[Great Depression|depression]]. However, the decision was generally popular and seen as 'sound economics' although it was opposed by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and the Federation of British Industries.<ref>James, p. 207</ref>

Churchill later regarded this as the greatest mistake of his life. However in discussions at the time with former Chancellor [[Reginald McKenna|McKenna]], Churchill acknowledged that the return to the gold standard and the resulting 'dear money' policy was economically bad. In those discussions he maintained the policy as fundamentally political<U+2014>a return to the pre-war conditions in which he believed.<ref>James, p. 206</ref> In his speech on the Bill he said "I will tell you what it [the return to the Gold Standard] will shackle us to. It will shackle us to reality."<ref>{{cite web|title=Speeches&nbsp;<U+2013> Gold Standard Bill|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/115-gold-standard-bill|date=4 May 1925|publisher=The Churchill Centre|accessdate=28 August 2009}}</ref>

The return to the pre-war exchange rate and to the Gold Standard depressed industries. The most affected was the coal industry, already suffering from declining output as shipping switched to oil. As basic British industries like cotton came under more competition in export markets, the return to the pre-war exchange was estimated to add up to 10% in costs to the industry. In July 1925, a Commission of Inquiry reported generally favouring the miners rather than the mine owners' position.<ref>Jenkins, p. 405</ref> Baldwin, with Churchill's support proposed a subsidy to the industry while a Royal Commission prepared a further report.

That Commission solved nothing and the miners' dispute led to the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]]. Churchill was reported to have suggested that machine guns be used on the striking miners. Churchill edited the Government's newspaper, the ''[[British Gazette]]'', and during the dispute he argued that "either the country will break the General Strike, or the General Strike will break the country" claiming that the fascism of [[Benito Mussolini]] "rendered a service to the whole world," showing "a way to combat subversive forces"<U+2014>that is, he considered the regime to be a bulwark against the perceived threat of communist revolution. At one point, Churchill went as far as to call Mussolini the "Roman genius... the greatest lawgiver among men."<ref>Picknett, Lynn, Prince, Clive, Prior, Stephen and Brydon, Robert (2002). ''War of the Windsors: A Century of Unconstitutional Monarchy'', p. 78. Mainstream Publishing. ISBN 1-84018-631-3.</ref>

Later economists, as well as people at the time, also criticised Churchill's budget measures. These were seen as assisting the generally prosperous rentier banking and salaried classes (to which Churchill and his associates generally belonged) at the expense of manufacturers and exporters which were known then to be suffering from imports and from competition in traditional export markets,<ref>Henderson, H. The Interwar Years and other papers. Clarendon Press</ref> and as paring the Armed Forces too heavily.<ref>James, p 22 212 <!-- ? page nos. --></ref>

===Political isolation===

The Conservative government was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 General Election]]. Churchill did not seek election to the Conservative Business Committee, the official leadership of the Conservative MPs. Over the next two years, Churchill became estranged from Conservative leadership over the issues of protective tariffs and [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian Home Rule]], by his political views and by his friendships with press barons, financiers and people whose characters were seen as dubious. When [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931, Churchill was not invited to join the Cabinet. He was at the low-point in his career, in a period known as "the wilderness years".<ref name=gilbert2>{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|title=Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years|publisher=Pimlico|year=2004|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-418-2}}</ref>

He spent much of the next few years concentrating on his writing, works including ''[[Marlborough: His Life and Times]]''<U+2014>a biography of his ancestor [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]<U+2014>and ''[[A History of the English Speaking Peoples]]'' (though the latter was not published until well after the Second World War),<ref name=gilbert2 /> ''Great Contemporaries'' and many newspaper articles and collections of speeches. He was one of the best paid writers of his time.<ref name=gilbert2 /> His political views, set forth in his 1930 Romanes Election and published as ''Parliamentary Government and the Economic Problem'' (republished in 1932 in his collection of essays "Thoughts and Adventures") involved abandoning [[universal suffrage]], a return to a property franchise, [[proportional representation]] for the major cities and an economic 'sub parliament'.<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/writings/bibliography Books Written by Winston Churchill (see Amid these Storms)], The Churchill Centre, 2007</ref>

====Indian independence====
{{See also|Simon Commission|Government of India Act 1935}}
Churchill opposed [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi's]] peaceful disobedience revolt and the Indian Independence movement in the 1930s, arguing that the [[Round Table Conference]] "was a frightful prospect".<ref>247 House of Commons Debates 5s col 755</ref> Later reports indicate that Churchill favoured letting Gandhi die if he went on a hunger strike.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4573152.stm|title=Churchill took hardline on Gandhi|publisher=BBC News |date=1 January 2006|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> During the first half of the 1930s, Churchill was outspoken in his opposition to granting [[Dominion]] status to India. He was a founder of the [[India Defence League]], a group dedicated to the preservation of British power in India. Churchill brooked no moderation. "The truth is," he declared in 1930, "that [[Gandhism|Gandhi-ism]] and everything it stands for will have to be grappled with and crushed."<ref name="independent.ie">{{cite news|author=Kevin Myers|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/kevin-myers-seventy-years-on-and-the-soundtrack-to-the-summer-of-1940-is-filling-britains-airwaves-2286560.html|title=Seventy years on and the soundtrack to the summer of 1940 is filling Britain's airwaves|work=The Irish Independent |accessdate=7 November 2010|date=6 August 2010}}</ref> In speeches and press articles in this period, he forecast widespread unemployment in Britain and civil strife in India should independence be granted.<ref>James, p. 260</ref> The [[Viceroy]] [[Lord Irwin]], who had been appointed by the prior Conservative Government, engaged in the Round Table Conference in early 1931 and then announced the Government's policy that India should be granted Dominion Status. In this the Government was supported by the Liberal Party and, officially at least, by the Conservative Party. Churchill denounced the Round Table Conference.

At a meeting of the West Essex Conservative Association, specially convened so that Churchill could explain his position, he said "It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious [[Middle Temple]] lawyer, now posing as a [[fakir]] of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace... to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor."<ref>Gilbert, Martin.

Two incidents damaged Churchill's reputation greatly within the Conservative Party in this period. Both were taken as attacks on the Conservative front bench. The first was his speech on the eve of the [[Westminster St George's by-election, 1931|St George by-election]] in April 1931. In a secure Conservative seat, the official Conservative candidate [[Duff Cooper]] was opposed by an independent Conservative. The independent was supported by [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Lord Beaverbrook and their respective newspapers. Although arranged before the by-election was set,<ref>James, p. 262</ref> Churchill's speech was seen as supporting the independent candidate and as a part of the press baron's campaign against Baldwin. Baldwin's position was strengthened when Duff Cooper won, and when the civil disobedience campaign in India ceased with the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]]. The second issue was a claim by Churchill that Sir [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] and [[Edward George Villiers Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to change evidence it had given to the Joint Select Committee considering the Government of India Bill, and in doing so had breached Parliamentary privilege. He had the matter referred to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Privilege Committee which, after investigations in which Churchill gave evidence, reported to the House that there had been no breach.<ref>James, pp. 269<U+2013>72</ref> The report was debated on 13 June. Churchill was unable to find a single supporter in the House and the debate ended without a division.

Churchill permanently broke with [[Stanley Baldwin]] over Indian independence and never again held any office while Baldwin was prime minister. Some historians see his basic attitude to India as being set out in his book ''My Early Life'' (1930).<ref>James, p. 258</ref> Another source of controversy about Churchill's attitude towards Indian affairs arises over what some historians term the Indian 'nationalist approach' to the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], which has sought to place significant blame on Churchill's wartime government for the excessive mortality of up to three million people.<ref>Leonard A. Gordon, Review of ''Prosperity and Misery in Modern Bengal: The Famine of 1943<U+2013>1944'' by Greenough, Paul R., ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 88, No. 4 (October 1983), p. 1051</ref><ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1874145 JSTOR profile]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mukerjee |first=Madhusree |url=http://www.hnn.us/articles/129891.html |title=History News Network &#124; Because the Past is the Present, and the Future too |publisher=Hnn.us |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> While some commentators point to the disruption of the traditional marketing system and maladministration at the provincial level,<ref>Gordon, ''American Historical Review'', p. 1051</ref> Arthur Herman, author of ''Churchill and Gandhi'', contends, 'The real cause was the fall of Burma to the Japanese, which cut off India's main supply of rice imports when domestic sources fell short...[though] it is true that Churchill opposed diverting food supplies and transports from other theatres to India to cover the shortfall: this was wartime.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/in-the-media/churchill-in-the-news/575-the-bengali-famine|title=The Bengali Famine|publisher=Winstonchurchill.org|accessdate=10 August 2009}}</ref> In response to an urgent request by the Secretary of State for India, [[Leo Amery]], and Viceroy of India, [[Wavell]], to release food stocks for India, Churchill responded with a telegram to [[Wavell]] asking, if food was so scarce, "why [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] hadn't died yet."<ref>''[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/08/13/070813crbo_books_mishra?currentPage=3 Exit Wounds]'', by [[Pankaj Mishra]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 13 August 2007.</ref> In July 1940, newly in office, he welcomed reports of the emerging conflict between the Muslim League and the Indian Congress, hoping "it would be bitter and bloody".<ref name="independent.ie"/>

====German rearmament and conflicts in Europe, Asia and Africa====
[[File:Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill by Ambrose McEvoy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Churchill by [[Ambrose McEvoy]]]]
Beginning in 1932, when he opposed those who advocated giving Germany the right to military parity with France, Churchill spoke often of the dangers of Germany's rearmament.<ref>James, pp. 285<U+2013>86</ref> He later, particularly in ''The Gathering Storm'', portrayed himself as being for a time, a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen itself to counter the belligerence of Germany.<ref>Picknett, et al., p. 75</ref> However [[George Ambrose Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Lord Lloyd]] was the first to so agitate.<ref>Lord Lloyd and the decline of the British Empire J Charmley pp. 1, 2, 213ff</ref>

In 1932 Churchill accepted the presidency of the newly founded [[New Commonwealth Society]], a peace organization which he described in 1937 as "one of the few peace societies that advocates the use of force, if possible overwhelming force, to support public international law".<ref>James W. Muller, ''Churchill's "Iron Curtain" Speech Fifty Years Later'' (1999), p. 101</ref>

Churchill's attitude towards the fascist dictators was ambiguous. After the World War I defeat of Germany, a new danger occupied the political consciousness<U+2014>the spread of [[communism]].  A newspaper article penned by Churchill and published on 4 February 1920, had warned that world peace was threatened by the [[Bolsheviks]], a movement which he linked through historical precedence to [[Jewish conspiracy]].<ref>Julius, Anthony, <U+201C>The Trials of the Diaspora, A History of Anti-Semitism in England, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 408, Churchill was an admirer of conspiracy theory writer, [[Nesta H. Webster]]; <U+201C>Churchill cited her with approval in his 1920 newspaper article <U+201C> ''Zionism versus Bolshevism<U+201D>'' <U+201C></ref>  He wrote in part:

:"This movement among Jews is not new... but a "world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality."<ref>Baker, Nicolson, "Human Smoke: The Beginnings of WWII, The End of Civilization," Simon & Schuster, 2008, Chapter 1</ref>

In 1931, he warned against the [[League of Nations]] opposing the Japanese in Manchuria "I hope we shall try in England to understand the position of Japan, an ancient state.... On the one side they have the dark menace of Soviet Russia. On the other the chaos of [[Republic of China|China]], four or five provinces of which are being tortured under communist rule".<ref>James, p. 329 quoting Churchill's speech in the Commons</ref> In contemporary newspaper articles he referred to the Spanish Republican government as a communist front, and [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] army as the "Anti-red movement".<ref>James, p. 408</ref> He supported the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] and continued up until 1937 to praise Benito Mussolini.<ref>Taylor, A.J.P.  Beaverbrook Hamish Hamilton 1972 p. 375</ref>

Speaking in the House of Commons in 1937, Churchill said "I will not pretend that, if I had to choose between communism and Nazism, I would choose communism".<ref>{{Cite book|year=2005|title=In the footsteps of Churchill|author1=Richard Holmes|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-03082-8|page=185|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kyd945KSiQwC&pg=PA185&dq=%22I+would+choose+communism%22}}</ref> In a 1935 essay titled "Hitler and his Choice", which was republished in his 1937 book ''Great Contemporaries'', Churchill expressed a hope that Hitler, if he so chose, and despite his rise to power through dictatorial action, hatred and cruelty, might yet "go down in history as the man who restored honour and peace of mind to the great Germanic nation and brought it back serene, helpful and strong to the forefront of the European family circle."<ref>Churchill, Winston. Great Contemporaries. (c) 1937 GP Putnam Sons, Inc. New York, NY: p. 225</ref> Churchill's first major speech on defence on 7 February 1934 stressed the need to rebuild the [[Royal Air Force]] and to create a Ministry of Defence; his second, on 13 July urged a renewed role for the League of Nations. These three topics remained his themes until early 1936. In 1935, he was one of the founding members of ''The Focus'', which brought together people of differing political backgrounds and occupations who were united in seeking "the defence of freedom and peace".<ref>for a history of The Focus see E Spier ''Focus'' Wolff 1963</ref> ''The Focus'' led to the formation of the much wider Arms and the Covenant Movement in 1936.

Churchill, holidaying in Spain when the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Germans reoccupied the Rhineland]] in February 1936, returned to a divided Britain. The Labour [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] was adamant in opposing sanctions and the National Government was divided between advocates of economic sanctions and those who said that even these would lead to a humiliating backdown by Britain as France would not support any intervention.<ref>Harold Nicholson's letter to his wife on 13 March summed up the situation: "If we send an ultimatum to Germany she ought in all reason to climb down. But then she will not climb down and we shall have war.... The people of this country absolutely refuse to have a war. We would be faced with a general strike if we suggested such a thing. We shall therefore have to climb down ignominiously", ''Diaries and Letters 1930<U+2013>1939'' p. 249</ref> Churchill's speech on 9 March was measured, and praised by [[Neville Chamberlain]] as constructive. But within weeks Churchill was passed over for the post of [[Minister for Co-ordination of Defence]] in favour of  Attorney General Sir [[Thomas Inskip]].<ref>James, pp. 333<U+2013>37</ref> [[A.J.P. Taylor|Alan Taylor]] called this "an appointment rightly described as the most extraordinary since [[Caligula]] made his horse a consul".<ref>''The Origins of the Second World War'' p. 153</ref> In June 1936, Churchill organised a deputation of senior Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain and Halifax. He had tried to have delegates from the other two parties and later wrote, "If the leaders of the Labour and Liberal oppositions had come with us there might have been a political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action".<ref>''The Gathering Storm'' p. 276</ref> As it was, the meeting achieved little, Baldwin arguing that the Government was doing all it could, given the anti-war feeling of the electorate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

On 12 November, Churchill returned to the topic. Speaking in the Address in Reply debate, after giving some specific instances of Germany's war preparedness, he said "The Government simply cannot make up their mind or they cannot get the prime minister to make up his mind. So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotency. And so we go on preparing more months more years precious perhaps vital for the greatness of Britain for the locusts to eat."<ref name="locusts-speech">{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/Locusts.html|title=The Locust Speech|accessdate=28 August 2013|publisher=Churchill Society}}</ref>

R.R. James called this one of Churchill's most brilliant speeches during this period, Baldwin's reply sounding weak and disturbing the House. The exchange gave new encouragement to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.<ref>James, p. 343</ref>

====Abdication crisis====
{{Main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
In June 1936, [[Walter Monckton]] told Churchill that the rumours that King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] intended to marry [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Mrs Wallis Simpson]] were true. Churchill then advised against the marriage and said he regarded Mrs Simpson's existing marriage as a 'safeguard'.<ref>Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead '' Walter Monckton '' Weidenfield and Nicholson 1969 p. 129</ref> In November, he declined [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s invitation to be part of a delegation of senior Conservative backbenchers who met with Baldwin to discuss the matter. On 25 November he, [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] and Liberal leader [[Archibald Sinclair]] met with Baldwin, were told officially of the King's intention, and asked whether they would form an administration if Baldwin and the National Government resigned should the King not take the Ministry's advice. Both Attlee and Sinclair said they would not take office if invited to do so. Churchill's reply was that his attitude was a little different but he would support the government.<ref>Middlemas, K.R. and Barnes, J. ''Stanley Baldwin'' Weidenfield and Nicholson 1969 p. 999</ref>

The Abdication crisis became public, coming to a head in the first two weeks of December 1936. At this time, Churchill publicly gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3 December. Churchill was a major speaker and later wrote that in replying to the Vote of Thanks, he made a declaration 'on the spur of the moment' asking for delay before any decision was made by either the King or his Cabinet.<ref>''The Gathering Storm'' pp. 170<U+2013>71. Others including Citrine who chaired the meeting wrote that Churchill did not make such a speech. Citrine ''Men and Work'' Hutchinson 1964 p. 357</ref> Later that night Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it. On 4 December, he met with the King and again urged delay in any decision about abdication. On 5 December, he issued a lengthy statement implying that the Ministry was applying unconstitutional pressure on the King to force him to make a hasty decision.<ref>James, pp. 349<U+2013>51 where the text of the statement is given</ref> On 7 December, he tried to address the Commons to plead for delay. He was shouted down. Seemingly staggered by the unanimous hostility of all Members, he left.<ref>Beaverbrook, Lord; Edited by Taylor, A.J.P. (1966). The Abdication of King Edward VIII. London: Hamish Hamilton.</ref>

Churchill's reputation in Parliament and England as a whole was badly damaged. Some such as [[Alistair Cooke]] saw him as trying to build a King's Party.<ref>Alistair Cook 'Edward VIII' in ''Six Men'' Bodley Head 1977</ref> Others like [[Harold Macmillan]] were dismayed by the damage Churchill's support for the King had done to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.<ref>Macmillan, H. ''The Blast of War'' Macmillan 1970</ref> Churchill himself later wrote "I was myself so smitten in public opinion that it was the almost universal view that my political life was at last ended."<ref>''The Gathering Storm'' p. 171</ref> Historians are divided about Churchill's motives in his support for Edward VIII. Some such as [[A.J.P. Taylor]] see it as being an attempt to 'overthrow the government of feeble men'.<ref>Taylor A.J.P. ''English History (1914<U+2013>1945)'' Hamilton, Hamish 1961 p. 404</ref> Others such as R.R. James see Churchill's motives as entirely honourable and disinterested, that he felt deeply for the King.<ref>James, p. 353</ref>

===Return from exile===

Churchill later sought to portray himself as (to some extent) an isolated voice warning of the need to rearm against Germany. While it is true that he had a small following in the House of Commons during much of the 1930s, he was given privileged information by some elements within the Government, particularly by disaffected civil servants in the War Ministry. The "Churchill group" in the latter half of the decade consisted of only himself, [[Duncan Sandys]] and [[Brendan Bracken]]. It was isolated from the other main factions within the Conservative Party pressing for faster rearmament and a stronger foreign policy;<ref>These factions were headed by [[Anthony Eden]] and [[Leo Amery]] James, p. 428</ref>{{r|blake1993}} one meeting of anti-Chamberlain forces decided that Churchill would make a good [[Minister of Supply]].<ref name="rhodesjames1993">{{cite book | title=Churchill | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=James, Robert Rhodes | year=1993 | location=Oxford | pages=513, 515<U+2013>517 | chapter = Churchill the Parliamentarian, Orator, and Statesman | editor=Blake, Robert B.; Louis, William Roger | isbn=0-19-820626-7}}</ref>

Even during the time Churchill was campaigning against Indian independence, he received official and otherwise secret information. From 1932, Churchill's neighbour, Major [[Desmond Morton (officer)|Desmond Morton]] with [[Ramsay MacDonald|Ramsay MacDonald's]] approval, gave Churchill information on German air power.<ref>James, p. 302</ref> From 1930 onwards Morton headed a department of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] charged with researching the defence preparedness of other nations. [[Lord Swinton]] as Secretary of State for Air, and with Baldwin's approval, in 1934 gave Churchill access to official and otherwise secret information.

Swinton did so, knowing Churchill would remain a critic of the government, but believing that an informed critic was better than one relying on rumour and hearsay.<ref>James, pp. 316<U+2013>18</ref> Churchill was a fierce critic of [[Neville Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain's]] appeasement of Adolf Hitler<ref>Picknett, et al., pp. 149<U+2013>50</ref> and in a speech to the House of Commons, he bluntly and prophetically stated, "You were given the choice between war and dishonour.

==="Winston is back"===
After the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and a member of the War Cabinet, as he had been during the first part of the First World War. When they were informed, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: "Winston is back".<ref>Churchill, Winston: "The Second World War" (abridged edition), p. 163. Pimlico, 2002.

Churchill advocated the pre-emptive occupation of the neutral Norwegian [[iron ore|iron-ore]] port of [[Narvik]] and the iron mines in [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|Kiruna]], Sweden, early in the war. However, Chamberlain and the rest of the [[War Cabinet]] disagreed, and the operation was delayed until the successful [[Norwegian campaign|German invasion of Norway]].

[[File:Wc0107-04780r.jpg|thumb|Churchill wears a helmet during an air raid warning in the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940]]

On 10 May 1940, hours before the German invasion of France by a [[Blitzkrieg|lightning advance]] through the [[Low Countries]], it became clear that, following failure in Norway, the country had no confidence in Chamberlain's prosecution of the war and so Chamberlain resigned. The commonly accepted version of events states that [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] turned down the post of prime minister because he believed he could not govern effectively as a member of the [[House of Lords]] instead of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although the prime minister does not traditionally advise the King on the former's successor, Chamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all three major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]], led to the recommendation of Churchill, and, as constitutional monarch, [[George VI]] asked Churchill to be prime minister. Churchill's first act was to write to Chamberlain to thank him for his support.<ref>Self, Robert (2006). ''Neville Chamberlain: A Biography'', p. 431. Ashgate. ISBN 978-0-7546-5615-9.</ref>

In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{r|blake1993}} He immediately put his friend and confidant, industrialist and newspaper baron [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], in charge of aircraft production. It was Beaverbrook's business acumen that allowed Britain to quickly gear up aircraft production and engineering, which eventually made the difference in the war.<ref>Allen, Hubert Raymond.

[[File:Churchill CCathedral H 14250.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill walks through the ruins of [[Coventry Cathedral]], 1941]]

The war energised Churchill, who was 65 years old when he became Prime Minister. An American journalist wrote in 1941: "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began ... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people".{{r|knickerbocker1941}} Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first speech as prime minister was the famous "I have nothing to offer but [[blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]". One historian has called its effect on Parliament as "electrifying"; the House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s "was now listening, and cheering".{{r|rhodesjames1993}} Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the [[Battle of Britain]]. One included the words:

{{quote|... we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, [[we shall fight on the beaches]], we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.<ref name="centre-beaches">{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/128-we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches |title=We Shall Fight on the Beaches, 4 June 1940 |accessdate=20 December 2007 |publisher=Churchill Centre}}</ref>}}

[[File:Brooke - Churchill - Montgomery.jpg|thumb|Churchill with Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] (left) and Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], 1944]]
At the height of the Battle of Britain, his bracing survey of the situation included the memorable line "[[Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few]]", which engendered the enduring nickname ''[[The Few]]'' for the RAF fighter pilots who won it.<ref>Speech to the House of Commons on 20 August 1940</ref> He first spoke these famous words upon his exit from No. 11 Group's underground bunker at [[RAF Uxbridge]], now known as the [[Battle of Britain Bunker]] on 16 August 1940. One of his most memorable war speeches came on 10 November 1942 at the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in London, in response to the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Churchill stated:

Without having much in the way of sustenance or good news to offer the British people, he took a risk in deliberately choosing to emphasise the dangers instead.

"Rhetorical power", wrote Churchill, "is neither wholly bestowed, nor wholly acquired, but cultivated." Not all were impressed by his oratory. [[Robert Menzies]], prime minister of Australia and himself a gifted phrase-maker, said of Churchill during the Second World War: "His real tyrant is the glittering phrase so attractive to his mind that awkward facts have to give way."<ref>{{cite web |last=Menzies |first=Robert |url=http://www.oph.gov.au/menzies/churchillandthewarcabinet.htm |title=Menzies; 1941 War Diary&nbsp;<U+2013> Churchill and the War Cabinet |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071228111033/http://www.oph.gov.au/menzies/churchillandthewarcabinet.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=28 December 2007}}</ref> Another associate wrote: "He is... the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas....

Throughout his life Winston Churchill suffered from clinical depression which he called his "Black Dog". His personal physician Lord Moran ([[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran]]) in his book states that during the war years Winston sought solace in his tumbler of whiskey and soda and his cigar. He was also a very emotional man and would break into tears during meetings when he heard of bad news. During some of his broadcast speeches it was noticeable that he was trying to hold back the tears. It was during a meeting at the White House, when Churchill was handed a signal that Tobruk had fallen, that he burst into tears. The US President stood up, approached Churchill and said to him "What can we do to help?".<ref name="Lord Moran">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pTAGuwAACAAJ |title=Winston Churchill: The Struggle for Survival, 1940<U+2013>1965 : Taken from the Diaries of Lord Moran|author=Charles McMoran Wilson (Lord Moran)|year=1966|newspaper= |accessdate= |publisher=Constable }}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>

Perhaps the person best placed to summarise Churchill's contradictory motivations and flawed character during the war was the man who arguably worked most closely with him throughout most of the conflict, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) from December 1941 on, Field Marshall [[Alan Brooke]]. His diary (Alanbrooke War Diaries - Phoenix - 2001 -p590) entry for 10 September 1944 is particularly revealing :<br />
{{quote|...&nbsp;And the wonderful thing is that 3/4 of the population of the world imagine that Churchill is one of the Strategists of History, a second Marlborough, and the other 1/4 have no idea what a public menace he is and has been throughout this war! It is far better that the world should never know, and never suspect the feet of clay of this otherwise superhuman being. Without him England was lost for a certainty, with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and again&nbsp;... Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent.

Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment. Put simply, Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the US; and so [[Lend-lease]] was born. Churchill had 12 strategic [[List of World War II conferences|conferences]] with Roosevelt which covered the [[Atlantic Charter]], [[Europe first]] strategy, the [[Declaration by the United Nations]] and other war policies.
After [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor was attacked]], Churchill's first thought in anticipation of US help was, "We have won the war!"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokesbury|first=James L.|title=A Short History of WWII|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1980|location=New York|page=171|isbn=0-688-03587-6}}</ref> On 26 December 1941, Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], asking of Germany and Japan, "What kind of people do they think we are?"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1941/411226a.html Prime Minister Winston Churchill's Address to the Congress of the United States] 1941, IBiblio.org</ref> Churchill initiated the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) under [[Hugh Dalton|Hugh Dalton's]] [[Minister of Economic Warfare|Ministry of Economic Warfare]], which established, conducted and fostered covert, subversive and partisan operations in [[German-occupied Europe|occupied territories]] with notable success; and also the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] which established the pattern for most of the world's current [[Special Forces]].

Churchill's health was fragile, as shown by a mild heart attack he suffered in December 1941 at the White House and also in December 1943 when he contracted pneumonia. Despite this, he travelled over {{convert|100000|mi|km|-4}} throughout the war to meet other national leaders. For security, he usually travelled using the alias Colonel Warden.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1Ok4AAAAIAAJ&q=colonel+warden&dq=colonel+warden|title=The War and Colonel Warden|year=1963|chapter=Flight to Cairo|quote=Colonel Warden was his favourite pseudonym|last=Pawle|first=Gerald|publisher=George G.

Churchill was party to treaties that would redraw post-Second World War European and Asian boundaries. These were discussed as early as 1943. At the [[Second Quebec Conference]] in 1944 he drafted and, together with Roosevelt, signed a less-harsh version of the original [[Morgenthau Plan]], in which they pledged to convert Germany after its unconditional surrender "into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character."<ref>Michael R. Beschloss, (2002) ''The Conquerors'': p. 131</ref> Proposals for European boundaries and settlements were officially agreed to by [[Harry S. Truman]], Churchill, and [[Joseph Stalin]] at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. Churchill's strong relationship with Harry Truman was also of great significance to both countries. While he clearly regretted the loss of his close friend and counterpart Roosevelt, Churchill was enormously supportive of Truman in his first days in office, calling him, "the type of leader the world needs when it needs him most."<ref>Jenkins, p. 849</ref>

When [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]], Winston Churchill, a vehement anti-communist, famously stated "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons," regarding his policy toward Stalin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/churchill_papers/biography/|title=The Churchill Papers: Biography|publisher=Chu.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref> Soon, British supplies and tanks were flowing to help the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stokesbury|first=James L.|title=A Short History of WWII|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1980|location=New York|page=159|isbn=0-688-03587-6}}</ref>

The [[Casablanca Conference]], a meeting of Allied powers held in [[Casablanca]], Morocco, on 14 January through 23 January 1943, produced what was to be known as the <U+201C>[[Casablanca Declaration]].<U+201D> In attendance were Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Charles de Gaulle. Joseph Stalin had bowed out, citing the need for his presence in the Soviet Union to attend to the Stalingrad crisis. It was in Casablanca that the Allies made a unified commitment to continue the war through to the <U+201C>unconditional surrender<U+201D> of the Axis powers. In private, however, Churchill did not fully subscribe to the doctrine of <U+201C>unconditional surrender,<U+201D> and was taken by surprise when Franklin Roosevelt announced this to the world as Allied consensus.<ref>www.ww2db.com, Chen, Peter C., <U+201C>Casablanca Conference, 14 Jan. 1943,<U+201D> retrieved 27 August 2012</ref><ref>www.nytimes.com, Middleton, Drew, ''On This Day'', "Roosevelt, Churchill Map 1943 War Strategy,<U+201D> 24 January 1943.

The settlement concerning the borders of Poland, that is, the [[Curzon line|boundary between Poland and the Soviet Union]] and [[Oder-Neisse line|between Germany and Poland]], was viewed as a betrayal in Poland during the post-war years, as it was established against the views of the [[Polish government in exile]]. It was Winston Churchill, who tried to motivate [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Miko<U+0142>ajczyk|Miko<U+0142>ajczyk]], who was prime minister of the Polish government in exile, to accept Stalin's wishes, but Miko<U+0142>ajczyk refused. Churchill was convinced that the only way to alleviate tensions between the two populations was the [[Polish population transfers (1944<U+2013>1946)|transfer of people]], to match the national borders.

As he expounded in the House of Commons on 15 December 1944, "Expulsion is the method which, insofar as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made.

During October 1944, he and Eden were in Moscow to meet with the Russian leadership. At this point, Russian forces were beginning to advance into various eastern European countries. Churchill held the view that until everything was formally and properly worked out at the [[Yalta conference]], there had to be a temporary, war-time, working agreement with regard to who would run what.<ref name=tsww>{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston|title=The Second World War|publisher=Penguin|year=1989|location=London|page=852|isbn=0-14-012836-0}}</ref> The most significant of these meetings was held on 9 October 1944 in the [[Kremlin]] between Churchill and Stalin.

{{bquote|Let us settle about our affairs in the Balkans. Your armies are in Rumania and Bulgaria. We have interests, missions, and agents there. Don't let us get at cross-purposes in small ways.

Stalin agreed to this [[Percentages agreement|Percentages Agreement]], ticking a piece of paper as he heard the translation. In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]''), authorities of the Soviet Union denied that Stalin accepted the "imperialist proposal".<ref name=percent/>

One of the conclusions of the Yalta Conference was that the Allies would return all Soviet citizens that found themselves in the Allied zone to the Soviet Union.

Because of the cultural importance of the city, and of the number of [[civilian casualties]] close to the end of the war, this remains one of the most controversial Western Allied actions of the war. Following the bombing Churchill stated in a top-secret telegram:{{bquote|It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed...

On reflection, under pressure from the Chiefs of Staff and in response to the views expressed by Sir [[Charles Portal]] ([[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]) and [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Harris]] ([[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief|AOC-in-C]] of [[RAF Bomber Command]]), among others, Churchill withdrew his memo and issued a new one.<ref name="Longmate-346">Longmate, Norman (1983).

Ultimately, responsibility for the British part of the attack lay with Churchill, which is why he has been criticised for allowing the bombings to occur. German historian [[J<U+00F6>rg Friedrich (author)|J<U+00F6>rg Friedrich]] claims that Churchill's decision was a war crime",<ref>{{cite web|author= Harding, Luke |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1067232,00.html |title=   German historian provokes row over war photos |date=21 October 2003|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate= 2 January 2013}}</ref> and writing in 2006 the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] questioned the whole strategic bombing campaign by the RAF, presenting the argument that although it was not a war crime it was a moral crime that undermines the Allies' contention that they fought a [[just war]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.C.|authorlink=A.C. Grayling|year=2006|title=Among the Dead Cities|publisher=Walker Publishing Company Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8027-1471-4}} pp. 237<U+2013>38</ref> On the other hand, it has also been asserted that Churchill's involvement in the bombing of Dresden was based on the strategic and tactical aspects of winning the war. The destruction of Dresden, while immense, was designed to expedite the defeat of Germany. As historian and journalist [[Max Hastings]] wrote in an article subtitled "the Allied Bombing of Dresden": "I believe it is wrong to describe strategic bombing as a war crime, for this might be held to suggest some moral equivalence with the deeds of the Nazis. Bombing represented a sincere, albeit mistaken, attempt to bring about Germany's military defeat." British historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] asserts that "All sides bombed each other's cities during the war. Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia. That's roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids."<ref>Hawley, Charles.

===The Second World War ends===

In June 1944, the Allied Forces [[Invasion of Normandy|invaded Normandy]] and pushed the Nazi forces back into Germany on a broad front over the coming year. After being attacked on three fronts by the Allies, and in spite of Allied failures, such as [[Operation Market Garden]], and German counter-attacks, including the [[Battle of the Bulge]], Germany was eventually defeated. On 7 May 1945 at the [[SHAEF]] headquarters in [[Rheims]] [[end of World War II in Europe|the Allies accepted Germany's surrender]]. On the same day in a BBC news flash [[John Snagge]] announced that 8 May would be [[Victory in Europe Day]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/coming_home/cominghome_archive.shtml Coming Home] [[BBC Four]], 9&nbsp;am to 9.45&nbsp;am, 9<U+2013>13 May 2005.</ref> On Victory in Europe Day, Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final cease fire on all fronts in Europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_3580000/3580163.stm On this day 8 May 1945] BBC.

In the evening he made another broadcast to the nation asserting the defeat of Japan in the coming months.<ref name=gilbert /> The Japanese later surrendered on 15 August 1945.

As Europe celebrated peace at the end of six years of war, Churchill was concerned with the possibility that the celebrations would soon be brutally interrupted.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080528222149/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/10/01/nwar101.html The secret strategy to launch attack on Red Army].

Although Churchill's role in the Second World War had generated much support for him amongst the British population, he was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 election]].<ref>Picknett, et al., p. 190</ref> Many reasons for this have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 789<U+2013>94</ref> It was anticipated that Churchill would step down and hand over the leadership to [[Anthony Eden]], who became his deputy after the election defeat, but Churchill (despite now being in his seventies) was determined to fight on as leader and Eden was too loyal to challenge his leadership. It would be another decade before Churchill finally did hand over the reins to Eden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/behindcloseddoors/biographies/eden.html |title=WWII Behind Closed Doors: Stalin, the Nazis and the West .

During this trip he gave his [[Iron Curtain]] speech about the USSR and the creation of the Eastern Bloc. Speaking on 5 March 1946 at [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]], Missouri, he declared:

{{quote|From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.

Churchill also argued strongly for British independence from the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which he saw as a Franco-German project. He saw Britain's place as separate from the continent, much more in-line with the countries of the Commonwealth and the Empire, and with the United States, the so-called [[Anglosphere]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 810 and pp. 819<U+2013>14<!-- check poss 819<U+2013>24 --></ref><ref name="quote-data">{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk|title=Remembrance Day 2003|accessdate=25 April 2007|publisher=Churchill Society London}}</ref>

===Return to government and the decline of the British Empire===
After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|General Election of 1951]], Churchill again held the office of Minister of Defence between October 1951 and January 1952. He also became prime minister in October 1951, and his third government<U+2014>after the wartime national government and the brief caretaker government of 1945<U+2014>lasted until his resignation in April 1955. In domestic affairs, various reforms were introduced such as the Mines and Quarries Act of 1954 and the Housing Repairs and Rent Act of 1955. The former measure consolidated legislation dealing with the employment of young persons and women in mines and quarries, together with safety, health, and welfare. The latter measure extended previous housing Acts, and set out details in defining housing units as <U+201C>unfit for human habitation.<U+201D><ref>Poverty, inequality and health in Britain, 1800<U+2013>2000: a reader edited by George Davey Smith, Daniel Dorling, Mary Shaw, P.LXXIX</ref> In addition, tax allowances were raised,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=69EJz1ewsLIC&pg=PA306&dq=martin+pugh+rab+butler+tax+allowances#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party - Martin Pugh - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 24 March 2010|accessdate=7 May 2012|isbn=9781407051550}}</ref> construction of council housing was accelerated, and pensions and national assistance benefits were increased.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2XEZbswz2JIC&pg=PA1952&dq=Churchill+1951-55+government+expanded+national+assistance#v=onepage&q=Churchill%201951-55%20government%20expanded%20national%20assistance&f=false |title=OCR A Level History B: The End of Consensus: Britain 1945<U+2013>90 - Pearson Education - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 27 February 2009|accessdate=7 May 2012|isbn=9780435312374}}</ref> Controversially, however, charges for prescription medicines were introduced.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JeXT0dW6kr4C&pg=PA676&dq=UK+prescription+charges+medicines+introduced+1952#v=onepage&q=UK%20prescription%20charges%20medicines%20introduced%201952&f=false |title=The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine - John P.

Housing was an issue the Conservatives were widely recognised to have made their own, after the Churchill government of the early 1950s, with [[Harold Macmillan]] as Minister for Housing, gave housing construction far higher political priority than it had received under the Attlee administration (where housing had been attached to the portfolio of Health Minister [[Aneurin Bevan]], whose attention was concentrated on his responsibilities for the [[National Health Service]]). Macmillan had accepted Churchill's challenge to meet the latter's ambitious public commitment to build 300,000 new homes a year, and achieved the target a year ahead schedule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Churchill's domestic priorities in his last government were overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power. Being a strong proponent of Britain as an [[power in international relations|international power]], Churchill would often meet such moments with [[direct action]]. One example was his dispatch of British troops to [[Kenya]] to deal with the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]].<ref name="Jenkins p843">Jenkins, pp. 843<U+2013>61</ref> Trying to retain what he could of the Empire, he once stated that, "I will not preside over a dismemberment."<ref name="Jenkins p843"/>

===War in Malaya===
This was followed by events which became known as the [[Malayan Emergency]]. In [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948.<ref name=Malaya/> Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not.<ref name=gilbert /><ref name=Stubbs>{{cite book|last=Stubbs|first=Richard|title=Hearts and Minds in Guerilla Warfare: The Malayan Emergency 1948<U+2013>1960|publisher=Eastern University|year=2001|location=New York|id=981210352X }}</ref> While the rebellion was slowly being defeated, it was equally clear that [[colonialism|colonial rule]] from Britain was no longer sustainable.<ref name=Malaya>{{cite book|last=Harper|first=T.N.|title=The End of Empire and the Making of Malaya|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|location=London|isbn=978-0-521-00465-7}}</ref><ref name=Empire2>{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Niall|title=Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|year=2000|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-100754-0}}</ref>

===Relations with the United States===
Churchill also devoted much of his time in office to Anglo-American relations and, although Churchill did not always agree with President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]],<ref>{{Cite book|year=1993|title=Churchill|author1=Robert Blake|author2=William Roger Louis|editor=Robert Blake|editor2=William Roger Louis|publisher=W. W.

He made four official transatlantic visits to America during his second term as prime minister.<ref>Jenkins, p. 847</ref>

===The series of strokes===
Churchill had suffered a mild stroke while on holiday in the south of France in the summer of 1949. In June 1953, when he was 78, Churchill suffered a more severe stroke at [[10 Downing Street]]. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate from the effects of the stroke which had affected his speech and ability to walk.<ref name=gilbert /> He returned to public life in October to make a speech at a Conservative Party conference at [[Margate]].<ref name=gilbert /><ref>Jenkins, pp. 868<U+2013>71</ref> However, aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill retired as prime minister in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. He suffered another mild stroke in December 1956.

==Retirement and death==
{{Main|Later life of Winston Churchill}}
[[File:Chartwell02.JPG|thumb|right|Churchill spent much of his retirement at his home [[Chartwell]] in [[Kent]]. He purchased it in 1922 after his daughter [[Mary Churchill|Mary]] was born.]]
[[Elizabeth II]] offered to create Churchill [[Duke of London]], but this was declined due to the objections of his son Randolph, who would have inherited the title on his father's death.<ref>Rasor, p. 205</ref> He did, however, accept a knighthood as Garter Knight. After leaving the premiership, Churchill spent less time in parliament until he stood down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 General Election]].
As a mere "back-bencher," Churchill spent most of his retirement at Chartwell and at his home in Hyde Park Gate, in London, and became a habitu<U+00E9> of high society on the French Riviera.<ref name=gilbert /><ref name="Lovell2011">{{cite book|author=Mary Lovell|title=The Churchills|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n5YlSoQqx9YC&pg=PT486|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1711-6|pages=486<U+2013>}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] Churchill's majority fell by more than a thousand, since many young voters in his constituency did not support an 85-year-old who could only enter the House of Commons in a wheelchair. As his mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose the battle he had fought for so long against the "black dog" of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=gilbert />

There was speculation that Churchill may have had [[Alzheimer's disease]] in his last years, although others maintain that his reduced mental capacity was merely the result of a series of [[cerebral thrombosis|strokes]]. In 1963, US President [[John F. Kennedy]], acting under authorisation granted by an [[Act of Congress]], proclaimed him an [[Honorary Citizen of the United States]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Winston Churchill|url=http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/pl8806.pdf|work=Pub.L. 86-6|publisher=U.S. Senate|accessdate=17 March 2011|date=9 April 1963}}</ref> but he was unable to attend the White House ceremony.<ref name=jenkins911/>

Despite poor health, Churchill still tried to remain active in public life, and on [[St George's Day]] 1964, sent a message of congratulations to the surviving veterans of the 1918 [[Zeebrugge Raid]] who were attending a service of commemoration in [[Deal, Kent]], where two casualties of the raid were buried in the [[Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal, Kent.|Hamilton Road Cemetery]]. On 15 January 1965, Churchill suffered a severe stroke that left him gravely ill. He died at his London home nine days later, at age 90, on the morning of Sunday 24 January 1965, 70 years to the day after his father's death.<ref name=jenkins911>Jenkins, p. 911</ref>

Winston Churchill was an accomplished artist and took great pleasure in painting, especially after his resignation as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] in 1915.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref> He found a haven in art to overcome the spells of depression which he suffered throughout his life.

Churchill is best known for his [[impressionism|impressionist]] scenes of landscape, many of which were painted while on holiday in the South of France, Egypt or Morocco.<ref name="TimesOnline-mogg"/> Using the pseudonym "Charles Morin",{{r|knickerbocker1941}} he continued his hobby throughout his life and painted hundreds of paintings, many of which are on show in the studio at Chartwell as well as private collections.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lady Soames|url=http://winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=576|title=Winston Churchill the Painter|accessdate=9 January 2008}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> Most of his paintings are oil-based and feature landscapes, but he also did a number of interior scenes and portraits. In 1925 [[Lord Duveen]], [[Kenneth Clark]], and [[Oswald Birley]] selected his ''Winter Sunshine'' as the prize winner in a contest for anonymous amateur artists.{{r|johnson2009}}{{rp|46<U+2013>47}} Due to obvious time constraints, Churchill attempted only one painting during the Second World War.

Some of his paintings can today be seen in the Wendy and [[Emery Reves]] Collection at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].

Despite his lifelong fame and upper-class origins, Churchill always struggled to keep his income at a level which would fund his extravagant lifestyle. MPs before 1946 received only a nominal salary (and in fact did not receive anything at all until the [[Parliament Act 1911]]) so many had secondary professions from which to earn a living.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/members_faq_page2.cfm|title=FAQ about Parliament|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=9 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> From his [[The Story of the Malakand Field Force|first book]] in 1898 until his second stint as Prime Minister, Churchill's income was almost entirely made from writing books and opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines. The most famous of his newspaper articles are those that appeared in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' from 1936 warning of the rise of Hitler and the danger of the policy of appeasement.

Churchill was also a prolific writer of books, writing a novel, two biographies, three volumes of [[memoir]]s, and several histories in addition to his many newspaper articles. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 "for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/|title=Official Nobel Page|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref> Two of his most famous works, published after his first premiership brought his international fame to new heights, were his six-volume memoir ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'' and ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]''; a four-volume history covering the period from [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] (55 BC) to the beginning of the First World War (1914).<ref>Jenkins, pp. 819<U+2013>23 and pp. 525<U+2013>26</ref>

Churchill was also an amateur [[bricklayer]], building buildings and garden walls at his country home at Chartwell,{{r|knickerbocker1941}} where he also bred butterflies.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/aug/19/winston-churchill-butterfly Winston Churchill's butterfly house brought back to life | Environment]. The Guardian (19 August 2010). Retrieved on 14 July 2013.</ref> As part of this hobby Churchill joined the [[Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers]],<ref>Radio Times, 12 March 2011, pp. 130<U+2013>131</ref> but was expelled because of his membership in the Conservative Party.{{r|knickerbocker1941}}

In addition to the honour of a [[state funeral]], Churchill received a wide range of awards and other honours. For example, he was the first person to become an [[Honorary Citizen of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas|title=The Orders, Decorations and Medals of Sir Winston Churchill|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Centre|isbn=}}</ref>

In 1945, while Churchill was mentioned by [[Halvdan Koht]] as one of seven appropriate candidates for the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]], the nomination went to [[Cordell Hull]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?action=show&showid=3319|accessdate=8 June 2010|title=Record from The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Peace, 1901<U+2013>1956|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref>

Churchill received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1953 for his numerous published works, especially his six-volume set ''The Second World War.'' In a 2002 BBC poll of the "[[100 Greatest Britons]]", he was proclaimed "The Greatest of Them All" based on approximately a million votes from BBC viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons.shtml|title=Poll of the ''100 Greatest Britons''|accessdate=22 December 2007|publisher=BBC  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060514084331/www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons.shtml |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref> Churchill was also rated as one of the most influential [[leaders]] in history by ''TIME''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/time100poll.html|title=The Most Influential People of the 20th Century|accessdate=22 December 2007|work=Time Magazine|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215051008/http://www.time.com/time/time100/time100poll.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=15 December 2007}}</ref> [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] was founded in 1958 to memorialise him.

On 29 November 1995, during a visit to the United Kingdom, President [[Bill Clinton]] of the United States announced to both Houses of Parliament that an {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|2}} would be named the {{USS|Winston S. Churchill|DDG-81}}. This was the first United States warship to be named after a non-citizen of the United States since 1975.
