The song is predominantly played with an [[acoustic guitar]] and a steady [[electronic drum]] beat, with a light [[orchestra]] accompanying the song towards the end.<ref name="musictimes">{{cite web|last=Menyes|first=Carolyn|title=LISTEN: Coldplay return to 'Parachutes' roots for new song 'Oceans' from 'Ghost Stories'|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/5674/20140423/listen-coldplay-return-parachutes-roots-new-song-oceans-ghost-stories.htm|publisher=[[Music Times]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The song's lyrics, which share the same motif as the rest of the songs featured on ''Ghost Stories'', deal with a troubled relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grow|first=Kory|title=Coldplay Mourn a Dying Relationship in New Song 'Oceans'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/coldplay-mourn-a-dying-relationship-in-new-song-oceans-20140423|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner{{!}}Wenner Media]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

==Recording==
The song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in [[North London]], [[England]], both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008's ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'' and 2011's ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'' respectively.

==Reception==
"Oceans" received positive reception upon it's debut during the band's appearance on [[Live Lounge]]. Carolyn Menyes of ''[[Music Times]]'', who described the song as "dreamy", wrote a positive review of the song, describing it further as "sleepy, comforting and straight up pretty in all the right ways; at least on the surface".<ref name="musictimes"/> Bruna Nessif of ''[[E!]]'' also wrote positively of Martin's performance of the song, writing that "there are notes Martin hits that are just incredible, and they sound just as amazing as they do while playing on repeat on your radio at home".<ref name="E">{{cite web|last=Nessif|first=Bruna|title=Chris Martin Sings About Trying to Fix a Relationship in New Coldplay Song "Oceans"<U+2014>Watch Their Live Performance!|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/535111/chris-martin-sings-about-trying-to-fix-a-relationship-in-new-coldplay-song-oceans-watch-their-live-performance|work=[[E!]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Carl Williott of ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'', upon mentioning comparisons of the song to ''[[Parachutes]]'', wrote that the song "is the first track that truly feels like it could<U+2019>ve come from a ''Parachutes'' session. There<U+2019>s hardly a hook to be found, but it<U+2019>s a lovely, slightly forlorn sway of a song, with an acoustic guitar anchoring Chris Martin<U+2018>s meandering falsetto amidst some swirling atmospherics".<ref>{{cite web|last=Williott|first=Carl|title=Coldplay Debut <U+201C>Oceans<U+201D> For BBC Radio 1: Watch|url=http://www.idolator.com/7515309/coldplay-oceans-live-bbc-ghost-stories|work=[[Idolator (website){{!}}Idolator]]|publisher=[[Spin Media]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Alex Young of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' jokingly stated that the song would "make for a good [[Starbucks]] soundtrack, though I only really drink diet Coke".<ref name="cos"/>
