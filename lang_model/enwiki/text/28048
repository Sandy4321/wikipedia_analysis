==Plot==
Rangan (Nasser) is a very ugly man and therefore lives a tough life. He is kicked out of jobs, ill-treated constantly, and the girl he loves hates him. (Think "The Elephant Man.") Then one day, Rangan goes to the house of his make-up artist friend (Manivannan) and finds a strange mask that he picks up and wears. The mask adheres to his face, and Rangan becomes very handsome. (Think "The Mask"). With the Mask, Rangan generates followers, becomes a film star, and gets a wife who loves him solely for his handsome face (Roja). Nearing the end, Rangan takes off the Mask for a moment, and wishes people would respect him for who he is on the inside. His wife walks in, sees his ugly face, and throws him out, mistaking him for a robber. Rangan's former followers throw him to the side. Deciding that only beauty can bring him respect, Rangan puts the mask back on.

==Release==
A critic felt that "The storyline would be excellent to read in a novel, but the reality in film is incredibly slow-paced and implausible."  and "that the actors do the best with what they have, but the result is still a very boring long drawn-out masterpiece gone horribly wrong."<ref>http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Reviews/articles/Mugam_103022.html</ref>

The film became a box office failure and was played on television within a month of release.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/gcnnov99.html</ref>
