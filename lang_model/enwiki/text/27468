== Economy and Revitalization ==

Viroqua was dubbed "The Town That Beat [[Walmart]]" by [[Smithsonian Magazine]] in 1992 by fostering businesses that co co-exist with the retail giant [http://www.npr.org/news/specials/walmart/].  The city promoted small business development through several state and federal programs.  It is a Wisconsin Main Street City and its downtown is listed on the Wisconsin and [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Temple Theatre serves as an example of the town's resurgence.  The 1.6 million dollar restoration of the 1922 [[Classical Revival]] style [[vaudeville]] and movie theatre was driven by volunteers.  It currently serves as an arts and cultural center for the surrounding counties.
