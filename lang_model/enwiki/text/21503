The '''''Hohle Fels''''' (also '''''Hohlefels''''', '''''Hohler Fels''''', the [[German language|German]] for "hollow rock") is a [[cave]] in the [[Swabian Alb]] of [[Germany]] that has yielded a number of important archaeological finds dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Artifacts found in the cave represent some of the earliest examples of [[prehistoric art]] and [[prehistoric music|musical instruments]] ever discovered. The cave is just outside the town of [[Schelklingen]] in the state of [[Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg]], near [[Ulm]].

==Features==
The cave entrance is at {{convert|534|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} above sea level. The cave consists of a tunnel of about {{convert|15|m|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and a hall holding about {{convert|6000|m3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, making the cave hall one of the largest of Southern Germany.
 
==Discoveries==
The first excavation took place in 1870, yielding remnants of [[cave bear]]s, [[reindeer]], [[mammoth]]s and [[horse]]s as well as tools belonging to the [[Aurignacian]] culture of the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. 

Further excavations in 1958 to 1960, 1977, and 2002 yielded a number of spectacular finds, including several specimens of [[Prehistoric art|prehistoric sculpture]] such as an ivory bird and a human-lion [[Hybrid (mythology)|hybrid]] figure similar to the [[lion man of the Hohlenstein Stadel]] but only 2.5 cm tall.

In 2008, a team from the [[University of T<U+00FC>bingen]], led by archaeologist Nicholas Conard, discovered an artifact known as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], dated to around 35,000 to 40,000 years ago.<ref name="Conard">{{cite journal
