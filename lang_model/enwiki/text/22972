'''KVDA''' is the local [[Telemundo]] affiliate in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States|USA]] owned by [[NBC Universal]]. 

==Noticero 60==
'''''Noticero 60''''' was the name of KVDA's newscast, which competed with [[KWEX]]'s news broadcast. However, because of budget cuts announced by Telemundo's parent company NBC-Universal, this newscast was replaced in early 2007 by a regional newscast based out of the new Telemundo Production Center in Dallas, which houses newscasts of sister station [[KXTX]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
