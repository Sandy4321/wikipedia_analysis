The '''London and North Eastern Railway''' (LNER) was the second-largest of the "[[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four]]" railway companies created by the [[Railways Act 1921]] in Britain. It existed from 1 January 1923 until nationalisation on 1 January 1948, when it was divided into the new [[British Railways]]' [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], [[North Eastern Region of British Railways|North Eastern Region]] and partially the [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish Region]].

[[Sir Ralph Wedgwood]] was the Chief Officer of the LNER for its first 16 years.

== Formation ==

The LNER was formed out of a number of [[List of constituents of the London and North Eastern Railway|constituent railway companies]], the principal of which were:

* [[Great Eastern Railway]]
* [[Great Central Railway]]
* [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]
* [[Great North of Scotland Railway]]
* [[Hull and Barnsley Railway]]
* [[North British Railway]]
* [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]

The total route mileage was {{convert|6590|mi}}. The North Eastern Railway owned the largest route mileage, {{convert|1757|mi}} as compared with the Hull and Barnsley Railway, at just {{convert|106.5|mi}}.

The LNER also owned:
* 7,700 locomotives, 20,000 coaching vehicles, 29,700 freight vehicles, 140 items of electric rolling stock, 6 electric locomotives and 10 rail motor cars
* 6 turbine and 36 other steamers, and a number of river boats and lake steamers, etc.

In partnership with the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the LNER was co-owner of the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]], the UK's biggest joint railway system, much of which competed with the LNER's own lines. The M&GNJR was wholly incorporated into the LNER system in 1936.  In 1933, on the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], the LNER acquired the remaining operations of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] Company.

The LNER was the majority partner in the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] and the [[Forth Bridge Railway Company]].

== Geographic area ==

The LNER, as its name suggests, covered the arc of the country between north and east of [[London]]. It included the [[East Coast Main Line]] from London to [[Edinburgh]] via [[York]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and the routes from Edinburgh to [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Most of the country east of the [[Pennines]] was the LNER's purview, including the large expanse of [[East Anglia]]. The LNER's main workshops were in [[Doncaster]], with others at [[Darlington]], [[Inverurie]] and [[Stratford, London]].<ref name="Bonavia">{{harvnb|Bonavia|1980|p={{page needed|date=April 2012}}}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1987|p=146}}</ref>

The LNER inherited four of London's terminal stations: {{stnlnk|Fenchurch Street}} (ex-[[London and Blackwall Railway]];<ref>{{harvnb|Awdry|1990|p=144}}</ref> [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] (ex-[[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]); {{stnlnk|Liverpool Street}} (ex-[[Great Eastern Railway]]); and {{stnlnk|Marylebone}} (ex-[[Great Central Railway]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Whitehouse|Thomas|1989|pp=57,59}}</ref> In addition, it ran London suburban services to {{stnlnk|Broad Street}} ([[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]) and {{stnlnk|Moorgate}} ([[Metropolitan Railway]], later [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1987|p=50}}</ref>

== Ancillary activities ==

The LNER inherited:
* 8 canals, including the Ashton; Chesterfield; Macclesfield; Nottingham & Grantham; Peak Forest
* Docks and harbours in 20 locations, including the North East coast ports ([[Grimsby]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Immingham]], [[Middlesbrough]]), some eastern [[Scotland|Scottish]] ports, [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]], Lowestoft and [[London]]
* Other wharves, staithes, piers
* 2 electric tramways
* 23 hotels
* A 49% stake in the haulage firm Mutter, Howey & Co. Ltd.<ref name="Bonavia">Bonavia (1980)</ref>

It took shares in a large number of local bus companies, including for a time a majority stake in [[United Automobile Services]] Ltd.  In [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and [[Sheffield]], it participated in Joint Omnibus Committees with the LMS and the Corporation.<ref name="Bonavia">Bonavia (1980)</ref>

In 1935, with the LMS, [[Wilson Line of Hull]] and others it formed the shipping company [[Associated Humber Lines]] Ltd.<ref name="Bonavia">Bonavia (1980)</ref>

In 1938 it was reported that the LNER, with 800 mechanical horse tractors, was the world's largest owner of this vehicle type.<ref name="Whitaker">Whitaker (1938)</ref>

===Ships===
The LNER operated a number of ships.

In 1932 she had modifications carried out including an extension to her promenade deck and inaugurated a programme of short summer cruises to the near continent which were to become very successful and which continued until 1939. During this pre-war period she was considered "the pride of the Harwich fleet".    Sold in 1941 to the Ministry of War Transport and converted to a troopship. Post-war the vessel operated under LNER/BR management as a leave ship for the British Army of the Rhine with services from [[Harwich]] - [[Hook of Holland]] and [[Tilbury]] - [[Ostend]]. She was based at [[Harwich]] during that period where she suffered an engine room explosion in February 1952 which killed two crewmembers. She was withdrawn from service in June 1960 and scrapped later that year in Belgium.<ref name=Simplon/><ref>{{harvnb|Haws|1993|p=152}}</ref>

== Liveries ==
[[File:LNER teak coaches.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of LNER teak panelled coaches, preserved on the [[Severn Valley Railway]]]]
The LNER used a number of liveries on its trains. Most common were lined apple green on its passenger locomotives (much lighter and brighter than the green used by the [[Great Western Railway]]) and unlined black on freight locomotives, both with gold lettering. Passenger carriages were generally varnished [[teak]] (wood) finish; the few metal-panelled coaches were painted to represent teak.

Some special trains and [[LNER Class A4|A4 Pacific]] [[locomotives]] were painted differently, including silver-grey and garter blue.

== Advertising ==

The LNER covered quite an extensive area of Britain, running trains from London to the north east of England and Scotland. The enforced re-grouping of the railway companies in 1923 meant that former rivals within the LNER, spread across England and Scotland, had to work together. The task of creating an instantly recognisable public image for the LNER went to William M. Teasdale, their first advertising manager. Teasdale was influenced by the philosophies and policies of [[Frank Pick]], who controlled the style and content of the London Underground's widely-acclaimed poster advertising. Teasdale did not confine his artists within strict guidelines but allowed them a free hand. The artist [[William Barribal]] designed a series of bold [[Art Deco]] posters for the LNER in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Beverley|title=Railway Posters 1923-1947|year=1992|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|isbn=1-85669-014-8|pages=160|author=Richard Durack|page=128|format=Paperback}}</ref> When Teasdale was promoted to Assistant General Manager of the LNER, this philosophy was carried on by Cecil Dandridge who succeeded him and was the LNER's Advertising Manager until nationalisation in 1948. Dandridge was largely responsible for the adoption of the Gill Sans typeface; it was later adopted by British Railways.

The LNER was a very industrial company: hauling more than one-third of Britain's coal, it derived two thirds of its income from freight. Despite this, the main image that the LNER presented of itself was one of glamour, of fast trains and sophisticated destinations.  
The LNER's advertising campaign was highly sophisticated and advanced compared to those of its rivals. Teasdale and Dandridge commissioned top graphic designers and poster artists such as [[Tom Purvis]] to promote its services and encourage the public to visit the holiday destinations of the east coast during the summer.

== Chief mechanical engineers ==

The public face of a railway system is in large part the [[locomotive]]s and [[rolling stock]] in service upon it, and therefore the personalities of the Chief Mechanical Engineers of the LNER impressed their distinctive visions upon the railway. There were three CMEs of the LNER.

===Sir Nigel Gresley===
[[Sir Nigel Gresley]] was the first CME and held the post for most of the LNER's existence, and thus he had the greatest effect on the company. He came to the LNER via the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], where he was CME. He was noted for his "Big Engine" policy, and is best remembered for his large express passenger locomotives, many times the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives.  [[LNER Class A4]] [[Whyte notation|4-6-2]] [[4-6-2|Pacific]] locomotive ''[[LNER 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]'' holds the record to this day. Gresley died in office in 1941.

===Edward Thompson===
[[Edward Thompson (engineer)|Edward Thompson]]'s short reign (1941<U+2013>1946) was a controversial one. A noted detractor of Gresley even before his elevation to the post of CME, there are those who interpret many of his actions as being motivated by dislike of his predecessor. Against this it must be said that Gresley's designs had their flaws as well as their brilliance. His record is best served by his solid and dependable freight and mixed-traffic locomotives built under and for wartime conditions. He retired in 1946.

===Arthur H. Peppercorn===
[[Arthur H. Peppercorn|Peppercorn]]'s career was cut short by nationalisation and was CME for only 18 months. In this short period and in an atmosphere of reconstruction rather than great new endeavours, his only notable designs were his A1 and A2 Pacific express passenger locomotives, most of which were completed after nationalisation. Peppercorn was a student and admirer of Gresley and his locomotives combined the classic lines of Gresley's with the reliability and solidity Gresley's locomotives never quite achieved.

== After the Second world war ==

The company was nationalised in 1948 along with the rest of the railway companies of Great Britain. The London & North Eastern Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949.<ref>[[#RM195002|''The Railway Magazine'' (February 1950)]] "Main-Line Companies Dissolved", p.73</ref>

On the privatisation of BR in 1996, the franchise to run long distance express trains on the East Coast Main Line was initially won by [[Sea Containers Ltd]], who named the new operating company [[Great North Eastern Railway]] (GNER), a name and initials deliberately chosen to echo the former LNER.
