'''Shover's Green Baptist Chapel''' is a former [[Strict Baptists|Strict Baptist]] place of worship in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Shover's Green in [[East Sussex]], England.  Shover's Green is in [[Wealden]], one of six [[Districts of England|local government districts]] in the English county of [[East Sussex]], and stands on the road between the [[market town]] of [[Wadhurst]] and the village of [[Ticehurst]] in the neighbouring district of [[Rother]].  Founded by Strict Baptists from nearby [[Burwash]] in 1816, the chapel<U+2014>one of three Baptist places of worship in Wadhurst parish<U+2014>continued to serve the community until the 1970s, when it was sold for conversion to a house.  Its design is similar to that of the nearby [[Rehoboth Chapel, Pell Green|Rehoboth Chapel at Pell Green]]. The chapel is protected as a Grade II [[Listed building]].

==History==
Shover's Green is on the Wadhurst<U+2013>Ticehurst road about {{convert|2.25|mi|km|sigfig=2}} west of the latter.<ref name="Pevsner613">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=613.}}</ref>  It is also close to Burwash, a village which had a growing congregation of Strict and Particular Baptists in the early 19th century (reflecting the prevalence of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Nonconformism|Nonconformity]] in the county of Sussex as a whole).<ref name="Stell329">{{Harvnb|Stell|2002|p=329.}}</ref>  In November 1815, 24 members of Providence Chapel in Burwash left to found an additional chapel at Shover's Green.<ref name="Stell352">{{Harvnb|Stell|2002|p=352.}}</ref><ref name="About">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticehurst.info/wadhurst/trefoil/churches.htm|title=Wadhurst Churches and Chapels|year=2010|work=The Wadhurst and Ticehurst Website (including Stonegate and Flimwell)|publisher=Greenman Enterprise|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="Chambers81">{{Harvnb|Chambers|1953|p=81.}}</ref>  Work started in March 1816,<ref name="Chambers82">{{Harvnb|Chambers|1953|p=82.}}</ref> and the building was ready in 1817.<ref name="PoW50">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=50.}}</ref>  A Baptist congregation had existed in Wadhurst itself since 1815<U+2014>it later moved into a former [[Methodism|Methodist chapel]], and stopped meeting in the 1930s<U+2014><ref name="PoW53">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=53.}}</ref> and [[Rehoboth Chapel, Pell Green|Rehoboth Chapel]] was built in a similar style to the Shover's Green church in 1824.<ref name="Stell352"/><ref name="About"/>  (The chapel at Burwash, now vanished, was also associated with the founding in 1842 of [[Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel, Robertsbridge|Bethel Chapel]] at nearby [[Robertsbridge]].)<ref name="Chambers88">{{Harvnb|Chambers|1953|p=88.}}</ref>

The chapel was renovated in 1876, when the original [[weatherboarding]] and [[timber framing]] was replaced by brickwork and tiles.<ref name="Stell352"/><ref name="About"/>  As the congregation declined in the late 20th century, the building fell out of religious use, was closed in about 1973 and was converted into a house.<ref name="PoW50"/>  Its registration for the [[Marriage#Christianity|solemnisation of marriages]] was formally cancelled by the [[General Register Office]] in March 1980.<ref name="LG-48142-4737">{{London Gazette|issue=48142|date=27 March 1980|startpage=4737|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>
