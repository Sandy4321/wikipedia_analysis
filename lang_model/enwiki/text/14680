'''Operation Charnwood''' was a [[Second World War]] Anglo-Canadian offensive that took place from 8<U+2013>9 July 1944, during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]. The operation was intended to capture the German-occupied city of [[Caen]] ({{IPA-fr|k<U+0251><U+0303>}}), which was a major Allied objective during the opening stages of [[Operation Overlord]]. It was also hoped that the attack would pre-empt the transfer of German armoured units from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the lightly-screened American sector, where the eventual Allied breakout was to be engineered. The British and Canadians advanced on a broad front and by the evening of the second day had taken the northern half of Caen, up to the [[Orne River|Orne]] and [[River Odon|Odon]] rivers.

Preceded by a controversial bombing raid that destroyed much of Caen's historic Old City, Operation Charnwood began at dawn on 8 July, with battalions of three infantry divisions attacking German positions north of Caen behind a creeping artillery barrage. Supported by three armoured brigades, the forces of the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|British I Corps]] made gradual progress against the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]] and 16th [[Luftwaffe Field Division]]. By the end of the day the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|3rd Canadian]] and British [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd]] and [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division|59th (Staffordshire)]] Infantry Divisions had cleared the villages in their path and reached Caen's outskirts. Moving into the city at dawn the following morning, the Allies encountered resistance from remnants of German units who were beginning a withdrawal across the Orne. Carpiquet airfield fell to the Canadians during the early morning, and by 18:00, the British and Canadians had linked up and were on the Orne's north bank. Discovering Caen's remaining bridges to be defended or impassable, and with German reserves positioned to oppose their crossing, I Corps closed down the operation.

With northern Caen's capture and the heavy casualties inflicted on the two German divisions defending the immediate sector, Operation Charnwood was a partial tactical-success. Strategically, it achieved mixed results; although it forced the Germans to pull back all formations north of the Orne River, it did not completely succeed in stopping the flow of formations to the American front. The Germans were able to establish a strong second defensive line along two ridges to the south of the city, but the Allies maintained the initiative and launched the simultaneous Anglo-Canadian operations [[Operation Goodwood|Goodwood]] and [[Operation Atlantic|Atlantic]]  a week later, during which the rest of Caen was secured.

== Background ==
{{see|Invasion of Normandy|Operation Overlord}}

The Normandy town of [[Caen]] was one of the [[Invasion of Normandy|D-Day]] objectives for the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 3rd Infantry Division]] which landed on [[Sword Beach]] on 6 June 1944.<ref>Williams, p. 24</ref> The capture of Caen, while "ambitious", was described by historian L F Ellis as the most important D-Day objective assigned to Lieutenant-General Crockers's [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]].{{#tag:ref|"The quick capture of that key city [Caen] and the neighbourhood of Carpiquet was the most ambitious, the most difficult and the most important task of Lieutenant-General J.T. Crocker's I Corps".<ref>Ellis, p. 171</ref> Wilmot states "The objectives given to Crocker's seaborne divisions were decidedly ambitious, since his troops were to land last, on the most exposed beaches, with the farthest to go, against what was potentially the greatest opposition."<ref>Wilmot, p. 272</ref> However, Miles Dempsey always considered the possibility that the immediate seizure of Caen might fail.<ref>Buckley (2004), p. 23</ref>|group=nb}} Operation Overlord called for the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] to secure the city and then form a front line from [[Caumont-l'<U+00C9>vent<U+00E9>]] to the southeast of [[Caen]], in order to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the [[United States First Army]] while it moved on [[Cherbourg]].<ref>Ellis, p. 78</ref> Possession of Caen and its environs would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], which could then be used as the pivot for a swing right to advance on [[Argentan]] and then towards the [[Touques River]].<ref>Ellis, p. 81</ref> The terrain between Caen and [[Vimont, Calvados|Vimont]] was especially attractive to Allied planners, being open, dry, and conducive to swift offensive operations. Since the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units, creating the conditions for a fluid, fast moving battle was to their advantage.<ref>Van Der Vat, p. 146</ref>

The 3rd Infantry Division came ashore as planned, but hampered by congestion in its beachhead, the diversion of its strength en route, and the late arrival of much of its armoured support, the division was unable to assault Caen in force and its lead elements were brought to a halt short of the city's outskirts.<ref>Cawthorne, p. 41</ref><ref name=VdV114>Van der Vat, p. 114</ref> Follow-up attacks were unsuccessful as German resistance solidified around the rapidly-arriving [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]],<ref name=VdV114/> so the British abandoned the direct approach and on 7 June launched [[Operation Perch]], a [[pincer attack]] by [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I]] and [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX&nbsp;Corps]]. The intention was to encircle Caen from the east and west,<ref name=ellis250>Ellis, p. 250</ref> but I&nbsp;Corps, striking south of the [[Orne River]], was halted by the [[21st Panzer Division]],<ref name=VdV139>Van der Vat, p. 139</ref> while XXX&nbsp;Corps's attack  to the west of Caen stalled near [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]] in the face of heavy opposition from the [[Panzerlehrdivision]].<ref name=VdV139/> In an effort to force Panzerlehr to withdraw, on 13 June the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Armoured Division]] attacked the German flank through a gap in the line, aiming for high ground near [[Villers-Bocage, Calvados|Villers-Bocage]].<ref>D'Este, p. 172</ref> The resulting day-long [[Battle of Villers-Bocage|tank battle]] ended when the 7th Armoured's vanguard was pulled back;<ref>Taylor, p. 76</ref> the Panzerlehrdivision held its position until XXX&nbsp;Corps captured Tilly-sur-Seulles on 19 June.<ref>Clay, pp. 262&ndash;263</ref>

The next British offensive, codenamed [[Operation Epsom]], was launched by [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII&nbsp;Corps]] on 26 June. Preceded by [[Operation Martlet]]<ref name="Clark21">Clark, p. 21</ref> (also known as Operation Dauntless)<ref name="Ellis275">Ellis, p. 275</ref> to secure the corps's right flank,<ref name="Clark21"/> VIII&nbsp;Corps advanced to the west of Caen on a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) front between [[Carpiquet]] and Rauray.<ref>Hastings, p. 138</ref> Once across the Odon and Orne rivers the corps was to make for high ground near [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]] and encircle Caen.<ref>Clark, pp. 32&ndash;33</ref><ref>Clark, pp. 31&ndash;32</ref> The Germans managed to contain the offensive, but to do so were obliged to commit all their available strength,<ref>Hart, p. 108</ref> including two SS panzer divisions newly arrived in Normandy{{#tag:ref|The [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg]], the II SS Panzer Corps, were ordered to Normandy from the Eastern Front within six days of the start of the invasion.<ref>Reynolds (2002), p. 13</ref>|group=nb}} and earmarked for a planned offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.<ref>Wilmot, p. 334</ref>

On 27 June the 3rd Infantry Division<U+2019>s [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]], supported by the Staffordshire Yeomanry and specialist armour from the 79th Armoured Division, launched Operation Mitten. The objective was to seize two German-occupied [[ch<U+00E2>teaux]]<U+2014>la Londe and le Landel. The initial evening assault, led by the South Lancashire Regiment, was beaten off, but the following morning further attacks gained the objectives and destroyed several German tanks. Operation Mitten cost at least three British tanks<ref name="Scarfe6869"/><ref name="Fortin30">Fortin, p. 30</ref> and 268 men.<ref name="Copp113">Copp (2004), p. 113</ref> Norman Scarfe claims that had Mitten gone more smoothly, the [[9th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Brigade]], supported by the [[Canadian 9th Infantry Brigade]], would have launched Operation Aberlour, an ambitious plan to capture the villages of la Bijude, [[<U+00C9>pron]], Galmache, St. Contest, [[Authie, Calvados|Authie]] and [[Cussy]]. However, this was cancelled by I&nbsp;Corps's commander Lieutenant-General [[John Crocker]].<ref name="Scarfe6869">Scarfe, pp. 68&ndash;69</ref><ref name="Fortin30"/> Terry Copp calls the fighting for these ch<U+00E2>teaus the "bloodiest square mile in Normandy".<ref name="Copp113"/>

With Caen's strategic value to the Germans apparently lessening, [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], in overall command of German forces in the west ([[OB West]]), directed on 1 July that the city should be gradually abandoned. Rundstedt's intent was to shift the bulk of his armoured divisions to the American front,<ref name=keegan187>Keegan, p. 187</ref> but the city and its surroundings were considered by the German Armed Forces High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) to be the linchpin of Normandy's defence. OKW was determined to hold an arc of defensible terrain from the English Channel to the western banks of the Orne;<ref>Daglish, p. 36</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]]'s response was to dismiss Rundstedt from command and replace him with Generalfeldmarschall [[Gunther von Kluge]].<ref>D'Este, p. 251</ref> Learning of this, the Allied ground forces commander, [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], drew up an offensive with two goals: to capture Caen, and to prevent a large scale redeployment of German forces from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the American front.<ref name="Deste305">D'Este, p. 305</ref>

On 4 July, the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] launched [[Operation Windsor]], designed to seize Carpiquet and the adjacent airfield from the 12th SS Panzer Division.<ref>Copp (2004), p. 99</ref> Although Carpiquet fell on 5 July, the airfield remained in German hands.<ref name=VdV150>Van der Vat, p. 150</ref>

[[File:Charnwood.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.33|alt=Map of Caen and its immediate surroundings. Caen is in the centre, bisected by the Orne river which runs across the map from south to northeast; its tributary, the Odon river, comes in from the map's western edge to join the Orne near the city's southwestern suburbs. Scattered around the north and west of Caen are a number of German-occupied villages and Carpiquet airfield. The 7 July frontline follows the south bank of the Odon from the left of the map, then bulges north across the river to encompass the airfield, Caen, and the buffer-zone formed by the villages, before looping back south across the Orne on the map's right. More German units are stationed to the south and southeast of the city. The British second army is located around the north and west of the map, facing the airfield and villages. Also depicted is the 9 July frontline, which follows the line of the Odon and then the Orne rivers through Caen's centre.

The objective of Charnwood was to clear Caen of its defenders up to the Orne river, and if possible to secure bridgeheads in southern Caen.<ref name="Stacey157">Stacey, p. 157</ref> To achieve the latter it was planned to send an armoured column through the city to rush the bridges;<ref name="Wilmot351">Wilmot, p. 351</ref> it was hoped that I&nbsp;Corps could exploit the situation to sweep on through southern Caen towards the Verri<U+00E8>res and Bourgu<U+00E9>bus ridges, paving the way for the British Second Army to advance towards Falaise.<ref name=keegan-82-188/>

The 12th SS Panzer Division, commanded by [[Kurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)|Kurt Meyer]], consisted of three [[panzergrenadier]] regiments including one<U+2014>the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment<U+2014>borrowed from the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] (1st SS Panzer Division).<ref name="Roy46">Reginald, p. 46</ref><ref name="Reynolds152">Reynolds (2001), p. 152</ref>  With its 61 surviving tanks<ref name="Trew35">Trew, p. 35</ref> 12th SS Panzer was holding the northwest approaches to Caen, defending the city and Carpiquet airfield from the 3rd Canadian and 59th British Infantry Divisions.<ref name=copp102>Copp (2004), p. 102</ref> The main German defensive line, a {{convert|9|km|mi|adj=on}} arc of villages from the northeast to the west, was held by the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment<ref name="Trew35"/> and elements of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment.<ref>Swanston, p. 278</ref> Troops from the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment were holding the western flank,<ref name="Trew35"/> concentrating their strength, which included mortar batteries and a few tanks, in the area around Carpiquet airfield.<ref name="Roy46"/> The 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was occupying a line from Franqueville to the western end of [[Eterville]];<ref name="Reynolds152"/> the villages formed mutually-supporting strongpoints with dug-in tanks and assault guns, and the defensive line was 2<U+2013>3 miles (3.2<U+2013>4.8&nbsp;km) in depth, supplemented by anti-tank ditches, weapons pits, minefields and other obstacles.<ref>Ellis, pp. 310&ndash;311</ref> The rest of the division, with 35 tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment, were held in reserve, with elements located north, west and south of the city.<ref>Reynolds (2001), pp. 152&ndash;153</ref> Most of the division's artillery had been moved back across the Orne, and the divisional command centre had been relocated from the [[Ardenne Abbey]] to Abbaye-aux-Dames in the centre of Caen.<ref name="Trew35"/>

The 1st SS Panzer Division was roughly {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=off}} south of Caen with a regiment of dual purpose [[8.8 cm FlaK 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] from the III [[Flak corps|Flak Corps]].<ref name="Ellis311"/> The [[II SS Panzer Corps]] was to the west, with the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg]] around {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=off}} southwest of the city.<ref>Ellis, pp. 311&ndash;312</ref>

== Preliminary attacks ==

[[File:Bombing of caen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=An overhead view of a bomber aircraft, flying over a pall of smoke|A Handley Page Halifax, of No. 4 Group, over Caen's burning northern suburbs following the previous night's bombing.]]

On the night of 7 July, 467 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]] heavy bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]]<U+2014>half of Bomber Command's available strength at that time<U+2014>attacked Caen, dropping over 2,000 tons of bombs on the city.{{#tag:ref|The exact quantity of munitions dropped on Caen is subject to some degree of dispute.

In this the bombing largely failed; the main German armour and infantry positions to the north of Caen remained intact.<ref name=keegan-82-188/> Several tanks were hit and temporarily disabled, but only two Panzer IVs of the 12th SS Panzer Division were destroyed.<ref name="Trew37"/> However, General [[Miles Dempsey]], in command of the British Second Army, was more concerned with the bombing's morale-boosting effect on his troops than any material losses it might inflict on the Germans.<ref name="Wilmot351"/>

The pathfinders of [[No. 625 Squadron RAF]], tasked with dropping the target markers for the bombers, were instructed not to allow the target zone to "drift back" towards the Allied lines as had been the tendency in earlier missions.<ref name=keegan-82-188/> Together with the cautious shifting of the target zone during the planning stage, the effect was that in many cases the markers were dropped too far forward, pushing the bombed zone well into Caen itself and further away from the German defences. By 22:00 on 7 July the bombers had departed, leaving 80% of the city's northern sector destroyed.<ref>Van der Vat, p. 153</ref> Caen University was particularly hard hit, starting chemical fires that soon spread.<ref name=hastings222/>

At 22:50, six squadrons of [[de Havilland Mosquito|fast Mosquito bombers]] attacked individual targets,<ref name="Trew36"/> and ten minutes later the 636 guns of the assaulting divisions opened fire, with the battleship ''Rodney'' and other ships adding their support.<ref name=Copp101/> This prolonged bombardment was intensified by the artillery of VIII Corps,<ref name="Jackson61"/> which targeted the villages north of Caen in an effort to eliminate German strongpoints before the infantry assault began.<ref name=Copp101/>

== Advance begins ==

At 04:30 on 8 July, the artillery regiments of I and VIII Corps shifted their fire deeper into the German defensive belt, along the axes of advance of the Canadian 3rd and British 59th Infantry Divisions.<ref name=cawthorne120/> As the infantry and armour moved off their start-lines the barrage slowly crept forward, concentrating its fire on positions in front of the Anglo-Canadian troops;<ref name=copp103>Copp (2004), p. 103</ref> four battalions and two armoured regiments advancing on a two brigade front.<ref name=copp103/> At 07:00, 192 [[B-26 Marauder]] medium bombers arrived over the battlefield, but finding it obscured by cloud only 87 aircraft were able to drop their payload, totalling 133 tons. However, some bombs landed on the 12th SS Headquarters at Abbaye-aux-Dames.<ref name="Trew37"/>

[[File:Charnwood advance.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=A dispersed group of infantry moving through a field|Men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, advancing through a wheatfield during the final assault on Caen.]]
Crocker launched the operation's second phase at 07:30, although neither division had yet reached its objectives.<ref name=copp103/> In particular, the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was still in control of high ground around the Carpiquet airfield on the right flank of the advance. On the left, however, facing the relatively weak defences of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, the British 3rd Infantry were making good progress. They attacked L<U+00E9>bisey and rapidly pushed through the village, although fighting intensified as the division reached [[Herouville]].<ref name=DE318>D'Este, p. 318</ref> Concerned about the state of the Luftwaffe division, General [[Heinrich Eberbach]], in command of [[Panzer Group West]], ordered the 21st Panzer Division to redeploy northeast of Caen in support of the 16th.<ref name="Trew39">Trew, p. 39</ref> The manoeuvre was spotted, and when 21st Panzer attempted to cross the Caen Canal a strong naval barrage was directed against them. Facing the possibility of heavy losses, the move was abandoned.<ref name=Trew39/>

In the centre, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division was encountering much stiffer resistance from the 12th SS Panzer Regiment in Galmanche and la Bijude.<ref name=ellis314-15>Ellis, pp. 314&ndash;315</ref> The 176th Infantry Brigade incurred particularly heavy casualties in la Bijude, with one infantry company losing all of its senior officers when German flak batteries<U+2014>pressed into service in an anti-tank role<U+2014>prevented armoured support from reaching the village. The 176th's running-mate, the 197th Brigade, bypassed Galmanche and by noon had reached St-Contest.<ref name=copp103/>

Further to the west, units of the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division's 9th Infantry Brigade had been involved in heavy fighting in [[Buron]], which was defended by 200 men from the 12th SS. With support from the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment, by noon Buron had been taken, although the 9th Brigade's assault companies suffered 60% casualties in doing so.<ref name=copp104>Copp (2004), p. 104</ref> South of Buron, a counterattack by [[Panzer IV]] and [[Panther tank]]s of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment was defeated by [[17pdr SP Achilles|M10 Achilles self-propelled anti-tank guns]] and [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|17-pounder anti tank guns]] of 254th Battery, 62nd Antitank Regiment. Thirteen German tanks were destroyed in one of the most successful antitank engagement of the campaign, for the loss of four tank destroyers and a further four damaged.<ref>Copp (2004), pp. 103&ndash;104, 296&ndash;297</ref> Gruchy was captured with relative ease, with the [[7th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] encountering only mortar and artillery fire in their drive to [[Authie, Calvados|Authie]]. The capture of Authie facilitated the 59th (Staffordshire) Division's assault on St-Contest, and that town fell too, clearing the way for an advance on Caen itself.<ref name=copp104/> In Phase 3 of the operation, the 7th Brigade pushed towards the 12th SS Panzer Division's former headquarters at Ardenne Abbey, securing the position before midnight.<ref name=copp105>Copp (2004), p. 105</ref>

The British 3rd Infantry Division had by now brushed aside 16th Luftwaffe and was approaching Caen's outskirts from the northeast. At 19:15 that evening, both Meyer and Eberbach authorised the withdrawal of all 12th SS Panzer's heavy weapons, and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division, across the Orne to the southern side of Caen.<ref name=copp105/> Throughout the early evening the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Infantry Divisions as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable.<ref>Wood, p. 92</ref> Reports of this withdrawal came in to the British and Canadian divisional headquarters, prompting Crocker to prepare for I Corps to secure Caen the following day.<ref name=ellis314-15/>

[[File:Jupitermortar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|alt=A group of soldiers crouching beside a roadside hedge|Soldiers of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division take cover from German mortar fire during ''Jupiter'']]
On 10 July, the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] attacked the positions of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg]] to the southwest of Caen on [[Hill 112]].<ref name="Hasting223"/> Presaged by a two-day bombardment that included support from naval vessels and [[Hawker Typhoon]]s, the assault was designed to threaten Caen from the west and push back the 10th SS Panzer Division. This would secure the British Second Army an avenue for future offensives.<ref name=cawthorne120/> The 43rd Wessex began their assault at dawn on 10 July, supported by two additional armoured brigades.<ref name=copp106/>

By 08:00 British tanks and infantry were engaged with 10th SS Panzer and "well up" the slopes of Hill 112. Eterville was taken around mid-morning;<ref name="Hasting223"/> as the 4th Armoured Brigade and 43rd Wessex pressed their attack, Panzer Group West commander General Eberbach insisted that "Hill 112 is the pivotal point of the whole position West of Caen, and must therefore be held".<ref name=copp106/> The [[102 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion|102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion]] and the [[1st SS Panzer Division]] were committed to its defence.<ref name=copp106/> The 4th Armoured Brigade reached the summit,<ref>Hastings, p. 225</ref> but in the evening were counterattacked by remnants of the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions.<ref>Hastings, p. 226</ref>

The British offensive resumed the following day with the support of antitank regiments from the Second Army; these took heavy losses in a counterattack by the 102nd Panzer Battalion.<ref name=hastings227>Hastings, p. 227</ref> Hill 112 was briefly taken by a battalion of the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]], only to be lost to further German counterattacks in the late afternoon.<ref name=hastings227/> By the evening of 11 July, with both sides exhausted and having suffered heavily, the offensive had reached a stalemate.<ref name=copp106/> The 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and its supporting armour had sustained two thousand casualties in the two days of fighting.<ref name="Hasting223"/>

=== Overall ===

With Caen north of the River Orne in Allied hands, mine-clearance operations were launched, bulldozers were set to work to clear the streets, and a convoy of trucks carrying supplies for the civilian population was brought in. On 10 July the [[Flag of France|French flag]] was raised over the city, and three days later a parade was held in the Place Saint-Martin during which a second flag was raised to the strains of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Bagpipes|bagpipers]] playing [[La Marseillaise]].<ref name="Beevor273">Beevor, p. 273</ref>

=== Battle honours ===

The British and Commonwealth system of [[battle honours]] recognises the battle by the award to 55 units of the honour ''Caen'', for participation in the capture of Caen between 4&ndash;18 July 1944. Awarded from 1956 to 1959, the recognition was accompanied by honours for taking part in Operation Charnwood. For participating in the capture of Caen between 8&ndash;9 July three units were awarded the honour ''Orne'', nine the honour ''The Orne'', and two the honour ''The Orne (Buron)''.<ref>Rodger, pp. 243&ndash;244</ref>

== Analysis ==

Military historian [[Anthony Beevor]] calls Operation Charnwood a partial success, because although much of Caen was taken, the British and Canadians ultimately failed to secure enough ground to expand the Allied build-up; the bulk of the [[First Canadian Army]] was still waiting in the United Kingdom for transfer to Normandy.<ref name="Beevor273"/> [[Carlo D'Este]] states that unquestionably Charnwood did improve Second Army's position, but with the high ground to the south of the city in German hands, Caen itself was useless. He writes that the capture of the city was too little, too late, and a hollow victory.<ref name="Deste318319">D<U+2019>Este, pp. 318&ndash;319</ref> [[Chester Wilmot]] partially expands on this theme, stating that the southern suburbs with their factories and communications network were needed by Montgomery to maintain a credible threat to German-occupied Paris.<ref name="Wilmot351"/> Historians John Buckley and Terry Copp note that by the time the city was captured, the Germans<U+2014>weakened by the battles of late June and early July<U+2014>had already established defensive positions on the high ground to the south of the Orne;<ref>Copp, p. 106</ref><ref name="buck31"/> positions that blocked the way to the open terrain of the Falaise plain.<ref name="Wilmot351"/> In Charnwood's aftermath, the Supreme Allied Commander, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], expressed his concern that a breakout was now unlikely; it seemed as though the Germans would be able to keep the Allies penned up in Normandy. However, Montgomery did not subscribe to his chief's pessimism; in his opinion, the tenacity of the German defence was no barometer of its longevity.<ref>Wilmot, p. 352</ref> Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was apparently of the same mind; he mentioned to Lieutenant-Colonel [[Caesar von Hofacker]] that the front-line in France could only be held for another three weeks. Hofacker was a member of the German resistance and linked with the Hitler assassination plot, and according to historian Simon Trew, Rommel's comment led to the plot's timetable being decided.<ref name="Trew4748">Trew, pp. 47&ndash;48</ref>

The serious losses sustained in maintaining an increasingly costly static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]] had been replaced by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted.<ref name="Ellis320322">Ellis, pp. 320&ndash; 322</ref> The Commander in Chief West (OB West) soon followed; that evening, in a telephone conversation with [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] head Generalfeldmarschall [[Wilhelm Keitel]], von Rundstedt advised "Make peace, you fools."<ref name="Wilmot347">Wilmot. p. 347</ref> Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied "If you doubt what we're doing, get up here and take over this shambles yourself".<ref name="Hastings207">Hastings, p. 207</ref> The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge.<ref name="Hastings207"/> However, the costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-L<U+00F4>  convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct.<ref>Copp, p. 109</ref> The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon all major counterattacks and go over to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.<ref name="Trew4748"/>

[[File:Tankscaencenter.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=An intersection; a deployed anti-tank gun is covering the crossroads in the foreground, and in the street behind are some soldiers and two tanks|A 6-pounder anti-tank gun of the 1st [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]], along with two Sherman tanks, near St-Pierre Church, 10 July 1944.<ref>Trew, p. 41</ref>]]

Trew acknowledges that the capture of northern Caen had a psychological impact on the French population, convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could not be far off.<ref name="Trew4748"/> By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding those who had been evacuated due to sickness or those suffering from battle exhaustion.<ref>Copp, p. 110</ref> Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea, but one that proved better in concept than in execution<U+2014>influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results.<ref>Buckley (2006), p. 8</ref> In contrast, Copp states that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation.<ref name=copp106/> He suggests that Charnwood should have produced a rapid breakthrough, but concedes that the battle was one of the most difficult of the campaign.<ref>Copp (2004), p. 101&ndash;103</ref> Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and directing the infantry onto the objective, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer<U+2019>s opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. However, Buckley also comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate localised counterattacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops; losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.<ref name="buck31"/>

=== Bombing of Caen ===

One aspect of Operation Charnwood that has particularly exercised commentators was the decision to bomb Caen. [[Max Hastings]] writes that the bombing came to be seen by many as "one of the most futile air attacks of the war",<ref name=hastings222/> a position supported by Beevor, who calls the attack a "disaster".<ref name="Beevor269"/> Historian Michael Reynolds describes the results of the bombing as "pathetic",<ref>Reynolds (2001), p. 153</ref> while D'Este states that not only did it do little to assist I Corps, but actually hindered the Allied push into the city. D<U+2019>Este quotes Air Commodore E.J. Kingston-McCloughry and [[Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman|Solly Zuckerman]], who conducted a survey following Caen's capture and concluded that no targets of military value had been attacked nor were there any gun positions, tanks, or German dead in the target zone. Additionally they interviewed men of the British 3rd Infantry Division, who were reportedly bewildered as to why the bombers had been employed.<ref>D<U+2019>Este, p. 315</ref> However, the 3rd Division<U+2019>s historian, Norman Scarfe, counters this position, stating that in the wake of the air-raid the men "for the first time for weeks breathed freely. The full support of the Air Force gave them full hearts [...] and the men were encouraged".<ref>Scarfe, pp. 69&ndash;70</ref> The campaign<U+2019>s Canadian official historian, Charles Stacey, takes a similar line, citing several Canadian formations who reported an increase in morale.<ref name="stacey158">Stacey, p. 158</ref> Wilmot claims that the bombing was essential for this reason; it raised Second Army's morale while reducing that of the German defenders.<ref name="Wilmot351"/> A 21st Army Group intelligence report based on the interrogation of German prisoners goes so far as to claim the raid was "decisive"; it had reportedly destroyed the headquarters of the Luftwaffe infantry regiment based north of Caen, and deprived the German troops north of the city of ammunition and rations the following morning.<ref name="stacey158"/> Peter Gray grants that the bombing had an effect on the morale of both sides, but contends that this was only temporary.<ref>Buckley (2006), p. 166</ref> The campaign's [[History of the Second World War|official British historian]], L.F. Ellis, along with Trew and Stephen Badsey, provides an alternative interpretation; they state that the raid was designed to hamper the city's lines of communication, cutting off German reinforcements from the battle and hindering any attempt to withdraw south of the Orne river.<ref name="Ellis313"/><ref name="Trew37"/> However, Stacey notes that it was "obvious and desirable" for maximum advantage that the Allied ground forces should have advanced on the heels of the attack.<ref name="stacey158"/> Gray<U+2019>s conclusion is that one "cannot satisfactorily answer the question why" the city was bombed.<ref>Buckley (2006), p. 167</ref>

[[File:Britsoldiercaen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|alt=A soldier holding the arm of an elderly lady in a debris-strewn street, with ruined buildings in the background|A British soldier helps an old lady amongst the scene of utter devastation in Caen after its liberation.]]

Analysis by [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section Number 2]] (ORS2) concluded that the bombing of the first aiming point northwest of Caen was accurate, finding that the centre of the 90% zone (where 90% of the bombs fell) was 200-300 yards east of the aiming point, with some spillage to the south and west. Examination of the area after its capture indicated some destruction of German equipment, including the wreckage of 10 of the 40 trucks believed to be in the area at the time of the raid. The 48 hours that elapsed between the bombing and the Allied occupation of the area allowed the Germans time to recover from any shock and disorientation, and to salvage some damaged equipment. Examination of the second aiming point, "Northern Caen", failed to reveal a 90% zone, but it was noted that the obstructive effect of bombing a suburb was significant, and had caused substantial delays to vehicles of both sides by cratering and blocking roads. ORS2 concluded that the success of Charnwood owed little to the bombing, but made recommendations including changing to instantly fused bombs, dropping larger loads of smaller anti-personnel bombs, and rapidly following-up a bombardment with ground forces to take advantage of its main effect<U+2014>the temporary suppression of the enemy's will to resist. The benefit of this advice would be seen in subsequent operations; Goodwood, [[Operation Bluecoat]], [[Operation Cobra]], [[Operation Totalize]] and [[Operation Tractable]] all showed a distinct improvement in the ability of 21st Army Group to exploit the effect of preparatory strategic bombing.<ref>Copp (2000), pp. 71&ndash;77</ref>

[[File:Destroyedcaen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=A scenic cityscape showing destroyed and badly-damaged buildings|The aftermath of the bombing of Caen on 7 July 1944]]

The British initially announced that around 6,000 civilians had died during the air-raid, and a Soviet war correspondent attached to the 21st Army Group, Lieutenant Colonel Kraminov, put the figure as high as 22,000<U+2014>a claim that would later be used by French communists in post-war anti-British propaganda.<ref name="Beevor269">Beevor, p. 269</ref> However, it transpired after investigation that only 300&ndash;400 civilians were killed during the operation.<ref name="Stacey160"/> Despite the hardships they suffered, Caen's citizens showed genuine relief and provided their liberators with a welcome that the troops found very moving; French accounts of the time claim that "All [of] Caen was in the streets to greet them". Although Ellis calls the French welcome "pathetic", no Allied unit recorded any complaints about the reception they were given.<ref name="Stacey163">Stacey, p. 163</ref><ref>Trew, p. 44</ref><ref name="Ellis316"/> Stacey reports that the populace were "particularly delighted to find their city freed in part by men from Canada."<ref name="Stacey163"/> Beevor makes the point that most of the population were numb from the events they had gone through; he quotes a British soldier who recalled that "most ... women were crying, grief-stricken and anguished".<ref name="Beevor273"/> As early as 12 June the French Resistance had sent messengers to the British, informing them that refugees were gathering in the areas around the [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] and the Hopital du Bon Sauveur, and begging for these locations not to be bombed. Assurances were duly given, and these locations were almost untouched during the battle.<ref name="Stacey163"/> Gray notes that the city, following the war, regarded itself as being [[Martyr|martyred]]; a perception that remains to this day and is reflected in the city<U+2019>s war memorial.<ref>Buckley (2006), pp. 158, 168</ref>
