'''Lung cancer''', or '''carcinoma of the lung''', is a [[disease]] where [[epithelium|epithelial]] (internal lining) [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in the [[lung]] [[cell growth|grows]] out of control.

The main types of lung cancer are ''small cell lung carcinoma'' and ''non-small cell lung carcinoma''. This distinction is important because the treatment varies; non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is sometimes treated with [[lung cancer surgery|surgery]], while small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) usually responds better to [[chemotherapy]].<ref name="Cancer Medicine"/>

Lung cancer may be seen on [[chest x-ray]] and [[computed tomography]] (CT scan). The [[diagnosis]] is confirmed with a [[biopsy]]. This is usually performed via [[bronchoscopy]] or CT-guided biopsy.

Treatment and [[prognosis]] depend upon the [[histology|histological]] type of cancer, the [[staging (pathology)|stage]] (degree of spread), and the patient's [[performance status]]. Possible treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]]. With treatment, the five-year [[survival rate]] is 14%.<ref name="Harrison"/>

The vast majority of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]]s<U+2014>malignancies that arise from [[epithelial cell]]s. There are two main types of lung carcinoma, categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a [[histopathology|histopathologist]] under a [[microscope]]: ''non-small cell'' (80.4%) and  ''small-cell'' (16.8%) lung carcinoma.<ref name="Travis">{{cite journal | last =Travis | first =WD | coauthors =Travis LB, Devesa SS | title =Lung cancer | journal =Cancer | volume =75 | issue =Suppl. 1 | pages =191<U+2013>202 | date =Jan 1995 | url = | pmid =8000996 | accessdate = }}</ref> This classification, based on simple [[histology|histological]] criteria, has important implications for clinical management and prognosis of the disease.

==== Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) ====
The non-small cell lung carcinomas are grouped together because their prognosis and management are similar. There are three main sub-types: [[squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell lung carcinoma]], [[adenocarcinoma]] and large cell lung carcinoma.

Accounting for 31.1% of lung cancers,<ref name="Travis"/> squamous cell lung carcinoma usually starts near a central [[bronchus]]. [[Cavitation]] and [[necrosis]] within the center of the cancer is a common finding.

Adenocarcinoma accounts for 29.4% of lung cancers.<ref name="Travis"/> It usually originates in peripheral lung tissue. Most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking. However, among people who have never smoked ("never-smokers"), adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer.<ref name="Subramanian">{{cite journal | last =Subramanian | first =J | coauthors =Govindan R | title =Lung cancer in never smokers: a review | journal =Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume =25 | issue =5 | pages =561<U+2013>570 | publisher =American Society of Clinical Oncology | date =February 2007 | pmid =17290066 }}</ref> A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]], is more common in female never-smokers, and may have different responses to treatment.<ref name="Raz">{{cite journal | last =Raz | first =DJ | coauthors =He B, Rosell R, Jablons DM | title =Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: a review | journal =Clinical Lung Cancer | volume =7 | issue =5 | pages =313<U+2013>322 | publisher =Cancer Information Group | date =Mar 2006 | pmid =16640802 }}</ref>

==== Metastatic cancers ====
The lung is a common place for [[metastasis]] from tumors in other parts of the body.  These cancers are identified by the site of origin, thus a breast cancer metastasis to the lung is still known as breast cancer. They often have a characteristic round appearance on chest x-ray.<ref name="Seo">{{cite journal | last =Seo | first =JB | coauthors=Im JG, Goo JM et al. | title =Atypical pulmonary metastases: spectrum of radiologic findings | journal =Radiographics | volume =21 | issue=2 | pages =403<U+2013>417 | date =2001 | url =http://radiographics.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/21/2/403 | accessdate = 2007-09-10 | pmid = 11259704 }}</ref>

Primary lung cancers themselves most commonly metastasize to the [[adrenal gland]]s, liver, brain, and bone.<ref name="Cancer Medicine"/>

=== Staging ===
{{see also|Non-small cell lung carcinoma staging}}

Lung [[cancer staging]] is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is an important factor affecting the [[prognosis]] and potential treatment of lung cancer.

Non-small cell lung carcinoma is staged from IA ("one A", best prognosis) to IV ("four", worst prognosis).<ref>{{cite book | last =Mountain | first =CF | authorlink = | coauthors =Libshitz HI, Hermes KE | title =A Handbook for Staging, Imaging, and Lymph Node Classification | publisher =Charles P Young Company | date =2003 | url =http://www.ctsnet.org/book/mountain/index.html | accessdate =2007-09-01 }}</ref> Small cell lung carcinoma is classified as ''limited stage'' if it is confined to one half of the chest and within the scope of a single [[radiotherapy]] field. Otherwise it is ''extensive stage''.<ref name="Collins">{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = LG | coauthors = Haines C, Perkel R, Enck RE | title = Lung cancer: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 56<U+2013>63 | publisher = American Academy of Family Physicians | date = Jan 2007 | url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070101/56.html | pmid =17225705 | accessdate =2007-08-10 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s that suggest lung cancer include:<ref name="Hamilton">{{cite journal | last =Hamilton | first =W | coauthors =  Peters TJ, Round A, Sharp D | title =What are the clinical features of lung cancer before the diagnosis is made? A population based case-control study | journal =Thorax | volume =60 | issue=12 | pages =1059<U+2013>1065 | publisher = BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. | date =Dec 2005 | pmid =16227326 }}</ref>
* [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath)
* [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood)
* chronic [[coughing]] or change in regular coughing pattern
* wheezing
* [[chest pain]] or pain in the abdomen
* [[cachexia]] (weight loss), [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and loss of [[appetite]]
* [[dysphonia]] (hoarse voice)
* [[clubbing]] of the fingernails (uncommon)
* [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing).

If the cancer grows in the [[airway]], it may obstruct airflow, causing [[dyspnea|breathing difficulties]]. This can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, predisposing the patient to [[pneumonia]]. 

Many lung cancers have a rich blood supply. The surface of the cancer may be fragile, leading to bleeding from the cancer into the airway. This blood may subsequently be coughed up.

Depending on the type of tumor, so-called [[Paraneoplastic phenomenon|paraneoplastic phenomena]] may initially attract attention to the disease.<ref name="Honnorat">{{cite journal | last =Honnorat | first = J | coauthors = Antoine JC | title = Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume =2 | pages =22 | publisher = BioMed Central Ltd. | date = May 2007 | url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/2/1/22 | pmid =17480225 | doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-22 | accessdate =2007-09-05 }}</ref> In lung cancer, these phenomena may include [[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (muscle weakness due to [[autoimmune disorder|auto-antibodies]]), [[hypercalcemia]] or [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH). Tumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as [[Pancoast tumor]]s,<ref name="Jones">{{cite journal | last =Jones | first =DR | coauthors =Detterbeck FC | title =Pancoast tumors of the lung | journal =Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine | volume =4 | issue =4 | pages =191<U+2013>197 | date =Jul 1998 | pmid =10813231 }}</ref> may invade the local part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to changed sweating patterns and eye muscle problems (a combination known as [[Horner's syndrome]]), as well as muscle weakness in the hands due to invasion of the [[brachial plexus]].

Many of the symptoms of lung cancer ([[bone pain]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]]) are nonspecific; in the elderly, these may be attributed to [[comorbidity|comorbid illness]].<ref name="Cancer Medicine"/> In many patients, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Common sites of [[metastasis]] include the bone, such as the [[Vertebral column|spine]] (causing back pain and occasionally [[spinal cord compression]]), the liver and the brain. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest x-rays.<ref name="Harrison"/>

== Causes ==
The main causes of lung cancer (and cancer in general) include [[carcinogen]]s (such as those in tobacco smoke), [[ionizing radiation]], and [[virus (biology)|viral]] infection. This exposure causes cumulative changes to the [[DNA]] in the tissue lining the [[bronchi]] of the lungs (the bronchial [[epithelium]]). As more tissue becomes damaged, eventually a cancer develops.<ref name="Cancer Medicine"/>

===Smoking===
[[Image:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|thumb|300px|right|The incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking. Source: NIH.]]
[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]], particularly of [[cigarette]]s, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. In the United States, smoking is estimated to account for 87% of lung cancer cases (90% in men and 85% in women).<ref name="Samet2">{{cite journal | last =Samet | first =JM | coauthors =Wiggins CL, Humble CG, Pathak DR | title =Cigarette smoking and lung cancer in New Mexico | journal =American Review of Respiratory Disease | volume =137 | issue =5 | pages =1110<U+2013>1113 | date =May 1988 | pmid =3264122 }}</ref> Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%.

Additionally, nicotine appears to depress the immune response to malignant growths in exposed tissue. The length of time a person smokes as well as the amount smoked increases the person's chance of developing lung cancer. If a person stops smoking, this chance steadily decreases as damage to the lungs is repaired and contaminant particles are gradually removed.

===Radon gas===
[[Radon]] is a colorless and odorless [[gas]] generated by the breakdown of radioactive [[radium]], which in turn is the decay product of [[uranium]], found in the earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The radiation decay products [[ion]]ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon exposure is the second major cause of lung cancer after smoking.<ref name="Catelinois">{{cite journal | last =Catelinois | first =O | coauthors = Rogel A, Laurier D et al. | title =Lung Cancer Attributable to Indoor Radon Exposure in France: Impact of the Risk Models and Uncertainty Analysis | journal =Environmental Health Perspectives | volume =114 | issue =9 | pages =1361<U+2013>1366 | publisher =National Institute of Environmental Health Science | date =May 2006 | url =http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16966089 | doi =10.1289/ehp.9070 | pmid =16966089 | accessdate =2007-08-10 }}</ref>  

Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. For example, in areas such as [[Cornwall]] in the UK (which has [[granite]] as substrata), radon gas is a major problem, and buildings have to be force-ventilated with fans to lower radon gas concentrations. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that one in 15 homes in the U.S. has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 pico[[Curie]]s per liter (pCi/L).<ref name="EPA radon">{{cite web | last =EPA | authorlink =United States Environmental Protection Agency | title =Radiation information: radon | publisher =EPA | date =Oct 2006 | url =http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/radon.htm | accessdate =2007-08-11 }}</ref> [[Iowa]] has the highest average radon concentration in the United States; studies performed there have demonstrated a 50% increased lung cancer risk with prolonged radon exposure above the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L.<ref name="Field">{{cite journal | last =Field | first =RW | coauthors = Steck DJ, Smith BJ et al. | title =Residential radon gas exposure and lung cancer: the Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study | journal =American Journal of Epidemiology | volume =151 | issue =11 | pages =1091<U+2013>1102 | publisher =Oxford Journals | date =Jun 2000 | url =http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/151/11/1091  | pmid =10873134 | accessdate =2007-08-11 }}</ref><ref name="EPA Iowa">{{cite web | last =EPA | authorlink =United States Environmental Protection Agency | title =Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study | publisher =EPA | date =Jun 2000 | url =http://www.epa.gov/radon/iowastudy.html | accessdate =2007-08-11 }}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==

{{main|Carcinogenesis}}

Similar to many other cancers, lung cancer is initiated by activation of [[oncogene]]s or inactivation of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s.<ref name="Fong">{{cite journal | last =Fong | first =KM | coauthors = Sekido Y, Gazdar AF, Minna JD | title =Lung cancer. 9: Molecular biology of lung cancer: clinical implications | journal =Thorax | volume =58 | issue =10 | pages =892<U+2013>900 | publisher = BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. | date =Oct 2003 | pmid =14514947 }}</ref> Oncogenes are [[gene]]s that are believed to make people more susceptible to cancer.

Several [[genetic polymorphism]]s are associated with lung cancer.

== Diagnosis ==

[[Image:Thorax pa peripheres Bronchialcarcinom li OF markiert.jpg|thumb|Chest x-ray showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung]]

Performing a [[chest x-ray]] is the first step if a patient reports symptoms that may be suggestive of lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the [[mediastinum]] (suggestive of spread to [[lymph node]]s there), [[atelectasis]] (collapse), consolidation ([[pneumonia]]), or [[pleural effusion]]. If there are no x-ray findings but the suspicion is high (such as a heavy smoker with blood-stained sputum), [[bronchoscopy]] and/or a [[CT scan]] may provide the necessary information. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided [[biopsy]] is often used to identify the tumor type.<ref name="Harrison"/>

[[Image:Thorax CT peripheres Brronchialcarcinom li OF.jpg|thumb|left|CT scan showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung]]

The [[differential diagnosis]] for patients who present with abnormalities on chest x-ray includes lung cancer, as well as nonmalignant diseases. These include infectious causes such as [[tuberculosis]] or pneumonia, or inflammatory conditions such as [[sarcoidosis]]. These diseases can result in [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] [[lymphadenopathy]] or lung [[nodule (medicine)|nodules]], and sometimes mimic lung cancers.<ref name="Cancer Medicine"/>

== Prevention ==

{{see also|Smoking ban|List of smoking bans}}

Prevention is the most cost-effective means of fighting lung cancer. While in most countries industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco smoking is a primary goal in the prevention of lung cancer, and [[smoking cessation]] is an important preventative tool in this process.<ref name="Vineis">{{cite journal | last =Vineis | first =P | coauthors =Hoek G, Krzyzanowski M et al. | title =Lung cancers attributable to environmental tobacco smoke and air pollution in non-smokers in different European countries: a prospective study | journal =Environmental Health | volume =6 | issue = | pages =7 | publisher =BioMed Central | date =Feb 2007 | url =http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17302981 | doi =10.1186/1476-069X-6-7 | pmid =17302981 | accessdate =2007-08-11 }}</ref>

Policy interventions to decrease [[passive smoking]] in public areas such as restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many Western countries, with [[California]] taking a lead in banning smoking in public establishments in 1998, [[Ireland]] playing a similar role in [[Europe]] in 2004, followed by [[Italy]] and [[Norway]] in 2005, [[Scotland]] as well as several others in 2006, and [[England]] in 2007. [[New Zealand]] has also banned smoking in public places as of [[2004]].

The state of [[Bhutan]] has had a complete smoking ban since 2005.<ref name="Bhutan">{{cite web | last =Pandey | first =G | title =Bhutan's smokers face public ban | publisher =BBC | date =Feb 2005 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4305715.stm | accessdate =2007-09-07 }}</ref> In many countries, pressure groups are campaigning for similar bans. Arguments cited against such bans are [[criminalisation]] of smoking, increased risk of [[smuggling]] and the risk that such a ban cannot be enforced.<ref name="Gray">{{cite journal | last =Gray | first =N | title =A global approach to tobacco policy | journal =Lung Cancer | volume =39 | issue =2 | pages =113&ndash;117 | publisher =BioMed Central | date =Feb 2003 | pmid =12581561 }}</ref>

== Screening ==

{{main|Lung cancer screening}}

[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] refers to the use of [[medical test]]s to detect disease in asymptomatic people. Possible screening tests for lung cancer include [[chest x-ray]] or [[computed tomography]] (CT) of the chest. So far, screening programs for lung cancer have not demonstrated any clear benefit. [[Randomized controlled trial]]s are underway in this area to see if decreased long-term mortality can be directly observed from CT screening.<ref name="Gohagan">{{cite journal | last=Gohagan | first=JK | coauthors=Marcus PM, Fagerstrom RM et al. |title=Final results of the Lung Screening Study, a randomized feasibility study of spiral CT versus chest X-ray screening for lung cancer |journal=Lung Cancer |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=9<U+2013>15 | date=Jan 2005 |pmid=15603850 |doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.06.007}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has [[cancer staging|spread]], and the patient's [[performance status]]. Common treatments include [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[radiation therapy]].<ref name="Harrison"/>

=== Surgery ===

{{main|Lung cancer surgery}}

If investigations confirm lung cancer, CT scan and often [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) are used to determine whether the disease is localised and amenable to surgery or whether it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically.

[[Blood test]]s and [[spirometry]] (lung function testing) are also necessary to assess whether the patient is well enough to be operated on. If spirometry reveals poor respiratory reserve (often due to [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]), surgery may be contraindicated.

Surgery itself has an operative death rate of about 4.4%, depending on the patient's lung function and other risk factors.<ref name="Strand">{{cite journal | last =Strand | first =TE | coauthors =Rostad H, Damhuis RA, Norstein J  | title =Risk factors for 30-day mortality after resection of lung cancer and prediction of their magnitude | journal =Thorax | publisher =BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. | date =Jun 2007 | pmid =17573442 }}</ref> Surgery is usually only an option in non-small cell lung carcinoma limited to one lung, up to stage IIIA. This is assessed with medical imaging ([[computed tomography]], [[positron emission tomography]]). A sufficient pre-operative respiratory reserve must be present to allow adequate lung function after the tissue is removed.

Procedures include [[wedge resection (lung)|wedge resection]] (removal of part of a lobe), [[lobectomy (lung)|lobectomy]] (one lobe), bilobectomy (two lobes) or [[pneumonectomy]] (whole lung). In patients with adequate respiratory reserve, lobectomy is the preferred option, as this minimizes the chance of local recurrence. If the patient does not have enough functional lung for this, wedge resection may be performed.<ref name="El-Sherif">{{cite journal | last =El-Sherif | first =A | coauthors =Gooding WE, Santos R et al. | title =Outcomes of sublobar resection versus lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer: a 13-year analysis | journal =Annals of Thoracic Surgery | volume =82 | issue =2 | pages =408<U+2013>415 | date =Aug 2006 | pmid =16863738 }}</ref> Radioactive [[iodine]] [[brachytherapy]] at the margins of wedge excision may reduce recurrence to that of lobectomy.<ref name="Fernando">{{cite journal | last =Fernando | first =HC | coauthors =Santos RS, Benfield JR et al. | title =Lobar and sublobar resection with and without brachytherapy for small stage IA non-small cell lung cancer | journal =Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume =129 | issue =2 | pages =261<U+2013>267 | date =Feb 2005 | pmid =15678034 }}</ref>

=== Chemotherapy ===

Small cell lung carcinoma is treated primarily with chemotherapy, as surgery has no demonstrable influence on survival. Primary chemotherapy is also given in metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma.

The combination regimen depends on the tumor type. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is often treated with [[cisplatin]] or [[carboplatin]], in combination with [[gemcitabine]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], [[etoposide]] or [[vinorelbine]].<ref name="Clegg">{{cite journal | last =Clegg | first =A | coauthors =Scott DA, Hewitson P et al. | title =Clinical and cost effectiveness of paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine in non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review | journal =Thorax | volume =57 | issue =1 | pages =20<U+2013>28 | publisher =BMJ Publishing Group Ltd | date =Jan 2002 | pmid =11809985 }}</ref> In small cell lung carcinoma, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used.<ref name="Murray">{{cite journal | last =Murray | first =N | coauthors =Turrisi AT | title =A review of first-line treatment for small-cell lung cancer | journal =Journal of Thoracic Oncology | volume =1 | issue =3 | pages =270<U+2013>278 | date =Mar 2006 | pmid =17409868 }}</ref> Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, [[topotecan]] and [[irinotecan]] are also used.<ref name="Azim">{{cite journal | last =Azim | first =HA | coauthors =Ganti AK | title =Treatment options for relapsed small-cell lung cancer | journal =Anticancer drugs | volume =18 | issue =3 | pages =255<U+2013>261 | date =Mar 2007 | pmid =17264756 }}</ref><ref name="MacCallum">{{cite journal | last =MacCallum | first =C | coauthors = Gillenwater HH | title =Second-line treatment of small-cell lung cancer | journal =Current Oncology Reports | volume =8 | issue =4 | pages =258<U+2013>264 | date =Jul 2006 | pmid =17254525 }}</ref>

==== Adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma====

[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] refers to the use of chemotherapy after surgery to improve the outcome. During surgery, samples are taken from the [[lymph node]]s. If these samples contain cancer, then the patient has stage II or III disease. In this situation, adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival by up to 15%.<ref name="Winton">{{cite journal | last =Winton | first =T | coauthors =Livingston R, Johnson D et al. | title =Vinorelbine plus cisplatin vs. observation in resected non-small-cell lung cancer | journal =New England Journal of Medicine | volume =352 | issue =25 | pages =2589<U+2013>2597 | publisher =Massachusetts Medical Society | date =Jun 2005 | pmid =15972865 }}</ref><ref name="Douillard">{{cite journal | last =Douillard | first =JY | coauthors =Rosell R, De Lena M et al. | title =Adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation in patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association <nowiki>[ANITA]</nowiki>): a randomised controlled trial | journal =Lancet Oncology | volume =7 | issue =9 | pages =719<U+2013>727 | publisher =Elsevier | date =Sep 2006 | pmid =16945766 }}</ref> Standard practice is to offer platinum-based chemotherapy (including either cisplatin or carboplatin).<ref name="Tsuboi">{{cite journal | last =Tsuboi | first =M | coauthors =Ohira T, Saji H et al. | title =The present status of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected non-small cell lung cancer | journal = Ann Thorac Cardiovasc Surg | volume =13 | issue =2 | pages =73<U+2013>77 | date =Apr 2007 | url =http://www.atcs.jp/pdf/2007_13_2/73.pdf | format = PDF | pmid =17505412 | accessdate =2007-08-14 }}</ref>

=== Radiotherapy ===

[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma who are not eligible for surgery.

For both non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control ([[palliative care|palliative]] radiotherapy). Unlike other treatments, it is possible to deliver palliative radiotherapy without confirming the [[histology|histological]] diagnosis of lung cancer.

Patients with limited stage small cell lung carcinoma are usually given prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). This is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of [[metastasis]].<ref name="Ng">{{cite journal | last =Ng | first =M | coauthors =Chong J, Milner A et al. | title =Tolerability of accelerated chest irradiation and impact on survival of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer: review of a single institution's experience | journal =Journal of Thoracic Oncology | volume =2 | issue =6 | pages =506<U+2013>513 | publisher =International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer | date =Jun 2007 | pmid =17545845 }}</ref> More recently, PCI has also been shown to be beneficial in those with extensive small cell lung cancer. In patients whose cancer has improved following a course of [[chemotherapy]], PCI has been shown to reduce the cumulative risk of brain [[metastases]] within one year from 40.4% to 14.6%.<ref name="Slotman">{{cite journal | last=Slotman | first=B | coauthors=Faivre-Finn C, Kramer G et al. | title = Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive small-cell lung cancer | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 7 | pages = 664<U+2013>672 | date=Aug 2007 | id = PMID 17699816 }}</ref>

=== Interventional radiology ===

[[Radiofrequency ablation]] is more frequently used for this condition as it is nontoxic and causes little pain. It is especially effective when combined with chemotherapy as it catches the cells deeper inside a tumor<U+2014>the ones difficult to reach with chemotherapy due to reduced blood supply to the center of the tumor. It is done by inserting a small heat probe into the tumor to kill the tumor cells.<ref name="Simon">{{cite journal | last =Simon | first =CJ | coauthors =Dupuy DE, DiPetrillo TA et al. | title =Pulmonary radiofrequency ablation: long-term safety and efficacy in 153 patients | journal =Radiology | volume =243 | issue =1 | pages =268<U+2013>275 | date =Apr 2007 | pmid =17392258 }}</ref>

=== Targeted therapy ===

In recent years, various molecular targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. [[Gefitinib]] (Iressa) is one such drug, which targets the [[tyrosine kinase]] domain of the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGF-R) which is expressed in many cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma. It was not shown to increase survival, although females, Asians, non-smokers and those with [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]] appear to derive the most benefit from gefitinib.<ref name="Raz"/>

[[Erlotinib]] (Tarceva), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to increase survival in lung cancer patients<ref name="Feld">{{cite journal | last =Feld | first =R | coauthors =Sridhar SS, Shepherd FA et al. | title =Use of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review | journal =Journal of Thoracic Oncology | volume =1 | issue =4 | pages =367<U+2013>376 | publisher =International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer | date =May 2006 | pmid =17409886 }}</ref> and has recently been approved by the FDA for second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.

The [[angiogenesis inhibitor]] [[bevacizumab]] (in combination with [[paclitaxel]] and [[carboplatin]]) improves the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.<ref name="Sandler">{{cite journal | last =Sandler| first =A | coauthors =Gray R, Perry M et al. | title =Paclitaxel<U+2013>Carboplatin Alone or with Bevacizumab for Non<U+2013>Small-Cell Lung Cancer | journal =New England Journal of Medicine | volume =355 | issue =24 | pages =2542<U+2013>2550 | publisher =Massachusetts Medical Society | date =Dec 2006 | pmid =17167137 }}</ref> However this increases the risk of lung bleeding, particularly in patients with [[squamous cell carcinoma]].

== Prognosis ==

{{main|Non-small cell lung carcinoma staging|Manchester score}}

[[Prognosis]] depends on the cell type ([[histology]]), [[staging (pathology)|stage]] (degree of spread), and the patient's [[performance status]].

==Epidemiology==

[[Image:Lung cancer US distribution.gif|right|thumb|300px|Lung cancer distribution in the [[United States]]]]

Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality with 1.35 million new cases per year and 1.18 million deaths, with the highest rates observed in Europe and North America.<ref name="CancerStat" /> The population segment most likely to develop lung cancer is the over-fifties who also have a history of smoking. Lung cancer is the second most commonly occurring form of cancer in most western countries, and it is the leading cancer-related cause of death. Although the rate of men dying from lung cancer is declining in western countries, it is actually increasing for women due to the increased takeup of smoking by this group. Among lifetime non-smokers, men who have never smoked have higher age-standardized lung cancer death rates than women.

Not all cases of lung cancer are due to smoking, but the role of [[passive smoking]] is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for lung cancer, leading to policy interventions to decrease undesired exposure of non-smokers to others' tobacco smoke. Emissions from automobiles, factories and power plants also pose potential risks.<ref name="Kabir"/><ref name="Chiu"/><ref name="Parent">{{cite journal | last =Parent | first =ME | coauthors = Rousseau MC, Boffetta P et al. | title =Exposure to diesel and gasoline engine emissions and the risk of lung cancer | journal =American Journal of Epidemiology | volume =165 | issue =1 | pages =53<U+2013>62 | date =Jan 2007 | pmid = 17062632 }}</ref>

[[Eastern Europe]] has the highest lung cancer mortality among men, while northern Europe and the U.S. have the highest mortality among women. Lung cancer incidence is currently less common in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web | title =Gender in lung cancer and smoking research | publisher =World Health Organization | date =2004 | url =http://www.who.int/gender/documents/en/lungcancerlow.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =2007-05-26 }}</ref> However with increased smoking in developing countries, the incidence is expected to increase in the next few years, notably in China<ref>{{cite journal | last=Liu | first=BQ | coauthors=Peto R, Chen ZM et al. | title=Emerging tobacco hazards in China: 1.

==History==
Lung cancer was extremely rare before the advent of cigarette smoking.

The connection with [[radon]] gas was first recognized among miners in the [[Ore Mountains]] near [[Schneeberg, Saxony]]. [[Silver]] has been mined there since 1470. However these mines are rich in [[uranium]], with accompanying [[radium]] and radon gas. Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s. An estimated 75% of former miners died from lung cancer. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s due to the [[USSR]]'s need for uranium.<ref name="Greaves">{{cite book | last =Greaves | first =M | title =Cancer: the Evolutionary Legacy | publisher =Oxford University Press | date =2000 | pages =196<U+2013>197 | isbn=0-19-262835-6 }}</ref>
