'''Rancho San Francisco''' was a [[land grant]] of 48,612 [[acre]]s (196.7 km<U+00B2>) by Governor [[Juan B. Alvarado]] to [[Antonio del Valle]], a [[History of California to 1899#Spanish colonization and governance (1697 <U+2013> 1821)|Spanish]] army officer, in recognition for his service to the state of [[Alta California]]. The [[Ranchos of California|rancho]] was the location of the first documented discovery of [[gold]] in [[California]] in 1842.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rawls, James, J. and Richard J.

The rancho is a designated [[California Historical Landmark]].

==Early history==
After [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa<U+00F1>a]] was established in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more land for agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the [[Santa Clarita Valley]] to establish their ''estancia'', or mission rancho. Subsequently, the [[Tataviam]] Indians who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were [[Christianization|baptized]] and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of [[Castaic Creek]] and the [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]].

Following the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] were secularized and the land taken by the Mexican government. In 1834, Lt. Del Valle was assigned to inventory the property of Mission San Fernando. The rancho was supposed to be returned to the Tataviam, but Governor Alvarado deeded it to his friend Del Valle instead on [[January 22]] [[1839]]. The Del Valle family moved into the former ''estancia'' buildings (near what is now [[Castaic, California|Castaic]]).

Del Valle died in 1841. On his deathbed, he attempted to reconcile with his estranged son [[Ygnacio del Valle|Ygnacio]] by writing him a letter and offering the entire rancho to him as his inheritance. However, Del Valle died before the letter was delivered to his son.<ref name="hanson">{{cite news | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg090199a.htm | title=Del Valle descendant pursues her roots | publisher=The Signal | first=Marci | last=Wormser | date=September 1, 1999 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> Regardless, Ygnacio took control over the land.

==Gold discovery==
On [[March 9]] [[1842]], Francisco Lopez, the uncle of Antonio's second wife Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under an oak tree in [[Placerita Canyon]] and had a dream that he was floating on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild [[onion]]s from the ground only to find flakes of gold clinging to the roots.<ref name="coinage">{{cite news | title=California's REAL First Gold | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/coins/worden-coinage1005.htm | work=COINage magazine | first=Leon | last=Worden | date=October 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref> However, he was not just lucky. Lopez had studied [[mineralogy]] at the [[University of Mexico]] and it was likely he had been systematically looking for gold.<ref name="lw012496">{{cite news | title=The real story of California's first gold discovery | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/worden/lw012496.htm | first=Leon | last=Worden | publisher=The Signal | date=[[January 24]] [[1996]] | accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref> Moreover, evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area as many as thirty years prior, but Lopez's discovery was the first documented discovery of gold in the state.<ref name="lw081496">{{cite news | title=New Study Will Nag SCV Historians | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/worden/lw081496.htm | first=Leon | last=Worden | publisher=The Signal | date=[[August 14]] [[1996]] | accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref> This sparked a [[gold rush]] on a much smaller scale than the more famous [[California Gold Rush]] several years later. Approximately 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of [[Sonora]], came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.<ref name="coinage"/>

This discovery was mostly ignored by the American public. For one thing, California was not yet a [[U.S. state]], so this was in essence a Mexican discovery. However, certain people who later played a large role in the other gold rush took note. [[John Sutter]], who had sided with Gov. [[Manuel Micheltorena]] during his power struggle with former Gov. Alvarado, was imprisoned after the [[Battle of Providencia]] near Mission San Fernando after the insurrection had succeeded. After his release, he headed north through Placerita Canyon, and seeing the mining operation, determined to search for gold near his home, [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref name="coinage"/>

During the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]], Del Valle destroyed the mine to prevent the Americans from gaining access to it.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/times111101.htm | title=Del Valle Family Played a Starring Role in Early California | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Cecilia | last=Rasmussen | date=[[November 11]] [[2001]] | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> The tree where Lopez took his nap is now known as the "Oak of the Golden Dream" and is registered as California Historic Landmark #168.<ref name="ohp"/>

==Later history==
Following the war, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] allowed Mexican landowners to keep their lands. However, Feliz sued for control of Rancho San Francisco. The judgment for Feliz's lawsuit was handed down in 1857. Ygnacio received the westernmost portion of 13,599 acres (55.03 km<U+00B2>), Feliz (now Salaz<U+00E1>r) took 21,307 acres (86.23&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), and her six children received 4,684 acres (18.96&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) each.<ref name="lw2052">{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2052.htm | title=Ygnacio del Valle, Landowner | publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>

Unfortunately, at this time Southern California experienced a great deal of [[flood]]ing, and ranchers were forced to [[mortgage]] their properties in order to pay for damages. Feliz mortgaged her portion of the land to [[William Wolfskill]], who returned a portion of it back to Del Valle in exchange for him settling her debts. Floods were followed by [[drought]]s, which again exacerbated the ranchers. Finally, in 1862 Del Valle was forced to sell off most of his land to oil speculators, keeping only his [[Rancho Camulos]]. The oilmen were unable to find any oil, and Rancho San Francisco eventually landed in the hands of [[Henry Newhall]], whose name is now closely associated with the Santa Clarita Valley area.

Newhall granted right-of-way to [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to build a rail line to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and sold them a portion of the land, upon which sprang a new town that the company named after him, [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]].<ref>{{cite book | title=A California Legend: The Newhall Land and Farming Company | first=Ruth Waldo | last=Newhall | year=1992 | publisher=Newhall Land and Farming Company}}</ref> Another town grew around the [[train station]] and Newhall named it after his hometown, [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]].

After Newhall's death in 1882, his heirs formed the [[Newhall Land and Farming Company]], which managed the lands. In 1936, Atholl McBean, Newhall's grandson-in-law, discovered [[oil]] on the property and changed the name to [[Newhall Ranch]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/worden/lw060795.htm | title=Prime Valencia Real Estate, $2 an Acre | publisher=The Signal | first=Leon | last=Worden | date=[[June 7]] [[1995]] | accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>
