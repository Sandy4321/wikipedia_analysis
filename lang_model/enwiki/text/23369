'''Boston Road Railway Station''' was on the [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] of the [[List of Auckland railway stations|Auckland Suburban Railway Network]], near [[St Peter's College, Auckland#The "North train" and the railway station|St Peter's College]]<ref>See article on [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]] for an account of the origin of the Boston Road Railway Station.</ref><ref>Rick Maxwell, ''St Peter's College, Auckland'', Simerlocy Press, Auckland, 2008, pp. 7, 8, and 29.</ref> and [[Auckland Grammar School]]. The [[railway station|station]] was below [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]], one of the busiest motorways in New Zealand. At the southern end of the station is the north western wall of [[Mount Eden Prisons|Mt Eden Prison]]. The station closed on 10 April 2010, the day after the opening of the new [[Grafton Train Station|Grafton station]], and has since been largely demolished.

Until the station itself was double-tracked to Mt Eden in 2005, morning trains ran on the right through the loop and afternoon trains on the left, avoiding the need for St Peter's and Grammar pupils to cross the line.

== History ==
The line played an important part in the history of St Peter's College. From the time the school opened in 1939 many students came from the western suburbs of Auckland using the train service (known at that time at St Peter's College as the "North train") to attend the school. Until 1964 the nearest station was [[Mount Eden Train Station|Mt Eden]] station, a ten-minute walk to or from the school. By 1964 about 250 St Peter's boys<ref name="Own_Station_p4">Their Own Station, ''Auckland Star'', Tuesday 15 September 1964, p. 4,</ref> were using the train and walking between Mt Eden station and the school.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?BU=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.akcity.govt.nz%2Fdbtw-wpd%2Fheritageimages%2Fkeyword.htm&QF0=ID&QI0=7-A945&MR=1&TN=Heritage&RF=large&RL=0&NP=2&AC=QBE_QUERY Auckland Libraries heritage photos, No 7-A945 (retrieved 6 June 2011)  (Photograph taken 25 July 1964 - Unknown photographer) The track used by St Peter's train boys, having walked along Boston Rd from the Mt Eden Station, to cross the railway line before climbing up to the School.]</ref>

[[Congregation of Christian Brothers in New Zealand|Brother T. A. Monagle]], who supervised the train boys and who travelled on the train each day for that purpose, approached the [[New Zealand Railways Department|Railways Department]] to request that the train stop at the school. The college had several reasons for asking that the trains should stop there. "The traffic in Mt Eden Road had become very heavy, and was a constant danger to the younger and more thoughtless of our pupils, and another source of considerable danger existed at Mt Eden station where supervision was necessary to prevent accidents when the boys were boarding the train. Again, the train would disgorge its pupils at Mt Eden and then chug merrily past the school almost empty, leaving the boys to walk half a [[mile]], often in heavy rain."<ref>Our Railway Station, ''St Peter's College Magazine 1964'', St Peter's College, Page 39</ref>

Brother Monagle persuaded the Minister of Railways, [[John McAlpine|Mr John McAlpine]], to come and see for himself. In fact the Minister volunteered to walk up to the Mt Eden station from the school. "Well, somebody must have been pulling some strings up above, because on the day of the Minister's visit it rained cats and dogs, and even the odd pink elephant ..."<ref name="Train_Magaine_p25-26">The School Train, ''St Peter's Magazine 1968'', pages 25 and 26.</ref> and Brother Monagle's request was granted.<ref name="Train_Magaine_p25-26"/> The North train stopped at the St Peter's College station for the first time at 8.30am on Tuesday 15 September 1964 for the 250 St Peter's College boys and a dozen from [[Auckland Grammar School|Auckland Grammar]].<ref name="Own_Station_p4"/>

Another noteworthy event occurred in November 1965, when, for the last time, the North train was pulled by a steam engine. It was the last passenger train in the [[North Island]] to be pulled by a steam locomotive.<ref name="Train_Magaine_p25-26"/>

In relation to Brother Monagle, " ... it is generally agreed that he deserved the rank of Railway Employee. Surely no single person has ever held down so many positions at once - [[Station master|stationmaster]], [[Signalman (rail)|signalman]], [[Conductor (transportation)|ticket inspector]] and [[Conductor (transportation)|guard]], not to mention [[Construction engineering|construction engineer]], traffic officer and the occasional shot at [[Railroad engineer|engine-driving]]! During the many years that he was associated with the train, Brother Monagle became friends with most of the railway employees along the line as he made his trip each afternoon as far as [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mt Albert]]".<ref name="Train_Magaine_p25-26"/> Initially, only the "school" trains stopped at St Peter's College, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.<ref name="Own_Station_p4"/> The St Peter's College station attained full public station status with all trains stopping there from 1993 and was named the Boston Road Station.

== Station move ==

[[ONTRACK]] reconstructed two road bridges just to the east of the station to allow double-tracking in the section towards Newmarket Train Station, and to prepare for [[Auckland railway electrification|electrification]]. As part of the project, the train station shifted several hundred metres to the northeast, between Park Road and Khyber Pass Road, where a new bus / railway station was built. The station was renamed the [[Grafton Train Station|Grafton station]]. This station is able to better serve the [[Central Connector, Auckland|Central Connector]] and sites like the [[Auckland Hospital]] and the future development on the Lion Brewery site while still preserving direct access to their school for the hundreds of [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]] students who commute daily by train.<ref>[http://www.projectdart.org.nz/default.asp?s1=The%20Projects&s2=Newmarket&s3=Newmarket%27s%20western%20line%20-%20Kingdon%20St%20to%20Boston%20Rd Newmarket's Western Line - Kingdon St to Boston Rd] (from the 'ProjectDart.org.nz' website of [[ONTRACK]].
