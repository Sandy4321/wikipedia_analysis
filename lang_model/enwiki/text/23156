The '''19th Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[New Zealand Army|New Zealand Military Forces]], which served during the [[Second World War]] as part of the [[2nd Division (New Zealand)|New Zealand 2nd Division]]. In 1943, it was converted to armour and re-designated '''19th Armoured Regiment'''.

==History==
The 19th Battalion was formed in New Zealand in 1939 under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Frederick Varnham and was the second of three infantry battalions making up the [[4th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|4th Infantry Brigade]].{{#tag:ref|The other two infantry battalions were the [[18th Battalion (New Zealand)|18th]] and [[20th Battalion (New Zealand)|20th]].<ref name=Sinclair16>Sinclair, 1954, p. 16</ref>|group=Note}}  Its personnel were drawn from the lower half of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand and formed into [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]], Wellington/West Coast, [[Hawke's Bay, New Zealand|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Taranaki, New Zealand|Taranaki]] companies.<ref name=Sinclair2>Sinclair, 1954, p. 2</ref> After a period of training it embarked for the [[Middle East]]<ref name=Sinclair14>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> where it spent much of 1940 and early 1941 in Egypt, preparing and manning defences in [[Baggush Box|Baggush]].<ref name=Sinclair37>Sinclair, 1954, p. 37</ref> It was then shipped onto [[Greece]] in 1941 as part of the [[2nd New Zealand Division]].<ref name=Sinclair56>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> 

It participated in the [[Battle of Greece|Battles of Greece]]<ref name=McGibbon208>McGibbon, 2000, p. 207</ref> and later in [[Battle of Crete|Crete]].  Evacuated from Crete,<ref name=McGibbon124>McGibbon, 2000, pp. 124<U+2013>128</ref> it then fought in the [[North African Campaign]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel S. F. Hartnell.<ref name=Sinclair190>Sinclair, 1954, p. 190</ref>  The battalion suffered relatively few losses during [[Operation Crusader]] during which the two other battalions of the 4th Infantry Brigade were effectively destroyed by the [[15th Panzer Division]]. The battalion played a role in the breakout of the 2nd New Zealand Division from [[Minqar Qaim]] in June 1942, where it had been encircled by the [[21st Panzer Division]].<ref name=McGibbon389>McGibbon, 2000, pp. 389<U+2013>391</ref> The following month, the battalion suffered heavy casualties during the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] and many personnel were made prisoners of war.<ref name=Sinclair292>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 292<U+2013>293</ref>

In October 1943, the battalion, along with the rest of the 4th Infantry Brigade, was converted to an armoured unit and designated '''19th Armoured Regiment'''. Its commander, Hartnell, was promoted to [[brigadier]] and appointed second in command of the brigade and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel R. McGaffin. Under McGaffin, who had experience with armour,<ref name=Sinclair311>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 311<U+2013>312</ref> the regiment spent the next year training with Sherman tanks before embarking for Italy in October 1943 to join the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]].<ref name=Sinclair304>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 304<U+2013>305</ref> 

It participated in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at [[Cassino]].<ref name=McGibbon37>McGibbon, 2000, p. 37</ref>  The regiment finished the war in [[Trieste]] and remained there for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans also present in the city withdrew.<ref name=Sinclair517>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 517<U+2013>520</ref>  Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the regiment was disestablished in late 1945.<ref name=Sinclair526>Sinclair, 1954, pp. 526<U+2013>527</ref>
