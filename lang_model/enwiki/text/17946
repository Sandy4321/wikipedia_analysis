The [[Buddhist]] text known around the world as the '''''Diamond Sutra''''' (although a more accurate translation of the [[Sanskrit]] title might be, for instance, the  ''[[Vajra]] Cutter Sutra'') is a short [[Mahayana]] [[sutra]] of the [[Perfection of Wisdom]] (prajna-paramita) genre, which teaches the practice of the avoidance of abiding in extremes of mental attachment.  A copy of the ''Diamond Sutra'', found among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] in the early 20th century, is, in the words of the British Library, "the earliest complete survival of a dated [[Woodblock printing|printed book]]<ref>http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html</ref>."

The first translation of the Diamond Sutra into Chinese was done sometime around the beginning of the fifth century by the venerated and prolific translator [[Kumarajiva]]<ref>http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html</ref>.  The Kumarajiva translation has been particularly highly regarded over the centuries, and it is this version that appears on the 868 CE [[Dunhuang]] scroll.

The original [[Sanskrit]] title of the ''Diamond Sutra'' is <U+0935><U+091C><U+094D><U+0930><U+091A><U+094D><U+091B><U+0947><U+0926><U+093F><U+0915><U+093E> <U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+091C><U+094D><U+091E><U+093E><U+092A><U+093E><U+0930><U+092E><U+093F><U+0924><U+093E><U+0938><U+0942><U+0924><U+094D><U+0930> ''Vajracchedik<U+0101>-praj<U+00F1><U+0101>p<U+0101>ramit<U+0101>-s<U+016B>tra''. Some common translations of this title into major Asian languages include:

==Contents==
The ''Diamond Sutra'', like many [[sutra]]s, begins with the famous phrase "Thus have I heard" (<U+090F><U+0935><U+0902> <U+092E><U+092F><U+093E> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0941><U+0924><U+092E><U+094D>, ''{{IAST|eva<U+1E43> may<U+0101> <U+015B>rutam}}'', <U+5982><U+662F><U+6211><U+805E>). In the sutra [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] has finished his daily walk with the monks to gather offerings of food and sits down to rest.  One of the more senior monks, [[Subhuti]], comes forth and asks the Buddha a question.

What follows is an often repetitive dialogue regarding the nature of perception. The Buddha often uses paradoxical phrases like "What is called the highest teaching is not the highest teaching".<ref>Diamond Sutra, Sec. 8, Subsec. 5 <U+91D1><U+525B><U+7D93><U+FF0C><U+4F9D><U+6CD5><U+51FA><U+751F><U+5206><U+7B2C><U+516B><U+FF0C><U+4E94><U+FF1A><U+7D50><U+6B78><U+96E2><U+76F8></ref>

The Buddha is trying to help Subhuti unlearn his preconceived, limited notions of the nature of reality, [[bodhi|enlightenment]], and compassion. At one notable point the Buddha teaches Subhuti that what makes a [[Bodhisattva]] so great is that the Bodhisattva does not take pride in his work to save others, nor is his compassion calculated or contrived. The Bodhisattva practices sincere compassion that comes from deep within, without any sense of ego or gain.

In another section, Subhuti expresses concern that the ''Diamond Sutra'' will be forgotten 500 years after it is taught (or, alternatively, during the last 500 years of this era). The Buddha assures Subhuti that well after he is gone there will be some who can grasp the meaning of the Diamond Sutra and put it into practice. This section seems to reflect a concern found in other Buddhist texts that the teachings of the Buddha would eventually fade and become corrupted. A popular Buddhist concept, known as [[mappo]] in Japanese, also reflects this anxiety.

In section 18 it is stated that the [[Tathagata]] does have the [[human eye]] as well as the [[divine]] eye, the eye of [[insight]], the eye of transcendent [[wisdom]] and the [[Buddha eye]]. <ref>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/sutras/diamond1.html The Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra, see 18] taken from the site of Plumvillage</ref>

A famous four-line verse appears at the end of the sutra, a list of vivid metaphors for [[impermanence]]:<ref>Saunders, R. (1924) Epochs in Buddhist History: The Haskell Lectures, 1921.University of Chicago Press. ISBN 1-4325-6989-9</ref>
:Thus shall you think of this fleeting world:
:A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream,
:A flash of lightning in a summer cloud,
:A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.

==In Practice==
Since it can be read in approximately forty minutes, the Diamond Sutra is often memorized and chanted in Buddhist monasteries. This sutra has retained significant popularity in the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhist tradition for over a millennium, especially in East Asia, and most importantly within the East Asian meditation tradition ([[Zen]] and related disciplines), where it is extensively recited, taught, and commented upon even today.  The text resonates with a core aspect of Zen, the theme of [[non-abiding]].

It is repeatedly stated in the Diamond Sutra that if a person embodies even four lines of the sutra within his [[sadhana]] (spiritual practice), he will be blessed.

==As the earliest printed book==
[[Image:40130085 diamondsutra203.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Image from the [[British Library]] Copy]]
There is a [[woodblock printing|wood block printed]] copy in the [[British Library]] which, although not the earliest example of block printing, is the earliest example which bears an actual date. The copy is a scroll, about 16 feet long, purchased in 1907 by the [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]] in the walled-up [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]], in northwest [[China]] from a monk who was guarding the caves known as the "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas." <!--The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing.-->The [[colophon (book)|colophon]], at the inner end, reads: "Reverently made [caused to be] for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 15th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [11 May 868]". This is about 587 years before the [[Gutenberg Bible]].
