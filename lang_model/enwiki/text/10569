'''1950s' American automobile culture''' has had an enduring influence on the [[culture of the United States]], as reflected in popular music and mainstream acceptance of the "[[hot rod]]" culture. The American manufacturing economy switched from producing [[War economy|war-related items]] to [[consumer goods]] at the end of World War II, and by the end of the 1950s one in six working Americans were employed either directly or indirectly in the [[automotive industry]]. The United States became the world's largest manufacturer of [[automobile]]s, and [[Henry Ford]]'s goal of 40 years earlier, that any man with a good job should be able to afford an automobile, was achieved.{{sfnp|Weiss|2003|p=34}} A new generation of service businesses focused on customers and their automobiles sprang up during the 1950s.

The decade began with 25 million [[Vehicle register|registered]] automobiles on the road, most of which pre-dated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to [[Rationing#United States|rationing]] and restrictions.  By 1950, most factories had successfully made the transition to a consumer-based economy, and more than 8 million cars were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 million cars registered in the US, more than twice as many as there had been at the start of the decade.{{r|natpetnews}}

The dawning of the space age and the [[space race]] were reflected in contemporary American automotive styling.  Large [[Car tailfin|tailfin]]s,{{sfnp|Gunnell|2004|p=15}} flowing designs reminiscent of rockets, and [[Antenna (radio)|radio antennas]] that imitated [[Sputnik 1]] were common thanks to the efforts of design pioneers such as [[Harley Earl]].{{r|century2}}

==Interstate Highway System==
[[File:Interstate Highway plan September 1955.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map|The Interstate Highway System as it was designed in 1955]]
{{main|Interstate Highway System}}

The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly called the Interstate system) is a network of [[freeway]]s that forms a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] of the United States. While serving as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in Europe during World War II, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] had gained an appreciation of the German [[German autobahns|Autobahn]] network as an essential component of a national defense system, providing transport routes for military supplies and troop deployments.{{r|Petroski}} Construction was authorized by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]], and the original portion was completed 35 years later.  The system has contributed in shaping the United States into a world economic superpower and a highly industrialized nation.{{r|Genie}}

The Interstate grew quickly over the next few decades, along with the automobile industry. People were able to travel much greater distances in the same amount of time, and this new found mobility permeated ways of American life and culture as a large share of the population could travel long distances in their own vehicle at their leisure. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom,{{r|hofstra}} and for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence.  It became a statement of their personality and an extension of themselves.{{r|siedu}}

==Suburbanization==
The United States' investment in infrastructure such as highways and bridges coincided with the increasing availability of cars more suited to the higher speeds that better roads made possible, allowing people to live beyond the confines of major cities, and instead commute to and from work.{{r|Magazines1958}} 
[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|left|Levittown circa 1959]]
After World War II ended, land developers like [[William Levitt]] began to buy land just outside the city limits to build mass quantities of inexpensive tract houses.{{r|historychannel}} The promise of their own [[Single-family house|single-family]] home on their own land,{{r|waltermartin}} together with a free college education and low interest loans given to returning soldiers to purchase homes under the [[G.I. Bill]], drove demand for new homes to levels never seen before.  Additionally, 4 million babies were born every year during the 1950s. By the end of the baby boom era in 1964, almost 77 million <U+201C>baby boomers<U+201D> had been born,{{r|historychannel}} fueling the need for more housing in the suburbs, and automobiles to take them to and from the city centers for work and shopping.

By the end of the 1950s, fully 1/3 of Americans lived in the suburbs. Of the 12 largest cities in the US, 11 suffered population loss during the 1950s.  The cost in lost tax revenues and city culture was obvious.  Only [[Los Angeles]], itself a center for the car culture, gained population.{{r|schmoop}}  Economist Richard Porter commented that "The automobile made suburbia possible, and the suburbs made the automobile essential."{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}}  

One of the first examples of planned suburbanization is [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]], which was developed beginning in 1951 as a suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. {{r|natpetnews}}
{{clear}}

===Decline of the inner city===
More people joined the [[middle-class]] in the 1950s, with more money to spend than ever, and the availability of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile.{{r|historychannel}} Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their own identity, helping fuel a boom in new automobile sales.{{r|hofstra}}  Everything that was related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade.  New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour,{{r|siedu}} and the new found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities.  The 1950s saw the beginning of [[white flight]] and [[urban sprawl]], driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.{{r|siedu2}}

[[File:Car of the Future 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|Science and Mechanics magazine cover, The Car of the Future|Auto-related magazines became common in the 1950s]]
As more middle-class and affluent people fled the city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population.{{r|GreenbergWatts2008}} At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from [[The New Deal]] forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629&nbsp;percent.  This was in addition to hiring an average of 20&nbsp;percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities.{{r|GreenbergWatts2008}}  More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it wasn't practical to extend to the suburbs.{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}}  At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources.  During this time, the perception of using public transportation changed to a more negative one.  In what is arguably the most extreme example, [[Detroit]], which was the 5th largest city in the US in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents,{{r|detroit1950}} had shrunk to 706,585 people by 2010,{{r|PopEstCities}} a reduction of 62%.

In some instances, the automotive industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation.{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}}  The [[Great American streetcar scandal]] saw GM, [[Firestone Tire]], [[Standard Oil of California]], [[Phillips Petroleum]], [[Mack Trucks]] and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90&nbsp;percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued that this was a deliberate destruction of streetcars as part of a larger strategy to push the United States into [[automobile dependency]].{{r|Snell1974}} In ''United States v. National City Lines, Inc.'', many were found guilty of antitrust violations.{{r|seventhcircuit}} The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', ''[[Taken for a Ride (film)|Taken for a Ride]]'' and ''[[The End of Suburbia]]''.

==Motorsports==

==="Hot rod" becomes mainstream===
{{main|Hot rod}}

The increasing popularity of hot rodding cars is in part evident by the creation of special interest magazines that cater to this culture. ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|''Hot Rod'']]'' is the oldest such magazine, founded by [[Robert E. Petersen]] in 1948. His Petersen Publishing Company was the original publisher, and its first editor was [[Wally Parks]]. ''Hot Rod'' has licensed affiliation with [[Universal Technical Institute]].
[[File:Hot Rods 2 db.jpg|thumb|left|Hot rod]]
The relative abundance and inexpensive nature of [[Ford Model T]] and other cars from the 1920s to 1940s helped fuel the hot rod culture that developed, which was focused on getting the most linear speed out of these older automobiles.  While the origin of the term "hot rod" is unclear, the culture blossomed in the post-war culture of the 1950s.{{sfnp|Genat|Cox|Parks|2003|p=41}}

''Hot Rod'' magazine's November 1950 cover announed the first hot rod to exceed 200mph. The hand crafted car used an Edelbrock built [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] flathead V8 and set the record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]]{{r|hotrodmag2}}.  This 30,000 acres (45 square mile) region {{r|flats}} is perfect for [[Land speed record|land speed racing]], a tradition that grew rapidly in the 1950s and continues today.{{r|flats2}}

Hot rodding was about more than raw power. [[Kustom Kulture]] was started in the 1950s{{r|kustom}} when artists like [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]] changed the automobile [[pin striping]] from being a seldom used accent that followed the lines of the car into a freestyle form of art.  Von Dutch was as famous for his "flying eyeball"{{r|kustom}} as he was his intricate spider web designs.{{r|pinstripe}}  As the decade began, hand drawn pin stripping was almost unheard of, but by 1958 it had become an a popular method of customizing the looks of the hot rod.{{r|pinstripe}}

As the decade progressed, hot rodding became a popular hobby for a growing number of teenagers as the sport literally came to Main Street.{{r|hotrod2}}{{-}}

===Birth of the drag strip===
[[Drag racing]] has been around as long as there have been cars, but it was not until the 1950s that it began to become mainstream, starting with [[Santa Ana Drags]], the first [[Dragstrip|drag strip]] in the United States.{{r|nhra}} The strip was founded by C. J. "Pappy" Hart, Creighton Hunter and Frank Stillwell at the [[John Wayne Airport|Orange County Airport]] auxiliary runway in southern [[California]], and was operational from 1950 until June 21, 1959.{{r|wedidit}}

''Hot Rod'' editor Wally Parks created the [[National Hot Rod Association]] in 1951, which is still the largest governing body in the popular sport.{{r|nhra}} As of October 2012, there are at least 139 professional drag strip operational in the United States.{{r|dragtimes}}  One of the most powerful racing fuels ever developed is [[nitromethane]], which traces its roots as a racing fuel to the 1950s, and is still the primary component used in [[Top Fuel]] drag racing.{{r|dragtimes2}}

===NASCAR===
[[File:Tim FlockFabulousHudsonHornet.jpg|thumb|alt=NASCAR winner "The Fabulous Hudson Hornet"|NASCAR winner "The Fabulous Hudson Hornet"]]
{{main|NASCAR}}
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) was incorporated on February 21, 1948 by [[Bill France, Sr.]] and built its roots in the 1950s.{{r|nascar}} Two years later in 1950 the first asphalt "superspeedway", [[Darlington Speedway]], was opened in South Carolina, and the sport saw dramatic growth during the 1950s.{{r|nascar}} Because of the tremendous success of Darlington, construction of a 2.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway began near Daytona Beach, which is still in use.{{r|nascar}}

The [[NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] was started in 1949, with [[Jim Roper]] winning the first series.{{r|nascar}} By 2008, the most prestigious race in the series, the [[Daytona 500]] had attracted more than 17 million television viewers.{{r|jayski}}  Dynasties were born in the 1950s with racers like [[Lee Petty]] (father of [[Richard Petty]], grandfather of [[Kyle Petty]]) and [[Buck Baker]] (father of [[Buddy Baker]]).

NASCAR, and stock car racing in general, has its roots in [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] during [[Prohibition]].{{r|bootleg}}  [[Junior Johnson]] was one of many bootleggers who took part in the sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for operating his father's [[moonshine]] [[distillery|still]] as he is for his racing success.{{r|esquire}} He ended up spending a year in an Ohio prison,{{sfnp|Menzer|2001|p=59}} but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.{{r|bootleg}}

Today, NASCAR is the second most popular spectator sports in the United States behind the [[National Football League]].{{r|forbes}}

==New business models==
===Faster food===
[[File:DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NARA - 547855.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drive-in restaurant menu board|Drive-ins let you order using an intercom system, then a carhop accepts your payment and delivers your food on a tray that attaches to the car window.]]
As more Americans began driving cars, entirely new categories of businesses came into being to allow them to enjoy their products and services without having to leave their car.  This includes the drive-in restaurant, and later the drive-through window.  Still today, the [[Sonic Drive-In]] restaurant chain provides primarily drive-in service by [[carhop]] in {{formatnum:3561}} restaurants in 43 [[U.S. state]]s, serving approximately 3 million customers per day.{{r|10K}}{{r|bg909}}   Known for its use of carhops on [[roller skates]], the company annually hosts a competition to determine the top skating carhop in its system.{{r|vegassun}}

A number of other successful "drive up" businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including [[McDonald's]], which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and walk up to the window, taking their order "to go".  Automation and the lack of dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bag full.  By 1948, they had fired their car hops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu, and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the "Speedee Service System".{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|pp=19<U+2013>20}}  They redesigned their sign specifically to make it easier to see from the road, creating the now familiar double arch.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|p=20}}

Businessman [[Ray Kroc]] joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.{{r|mcdonalds}} Both of these restaurant models initially relied on the new and ubiquitous ownership of automobiles, and the willingness of patrons to eat in their automobiles, and today drive-through service accounts for 65&nbsp;percent of their profits.{{r|slate}}

[[Carl Karcher]] opened his first [[Carl's Jr.]] in 1956, and rapidly expanded, locating his restaurants near California's new freeway off-ramps.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|pp=21<U+2013>22}}

===Drive-in movies===
{{main|Drive-in theater}}

The '''drive-in theater''' is a form of [[movie theater|cinema]] structure consisting of a large outdoor [[movie screen]], a projection booth, a [[concession stand]] and a large [[parking lot|parking area]] for automobiles, where patrons view the movie from the comfort of their car and listened via a speaker placed at each parking spot.  
[[File:ForkUnionDriveIn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View of screen from back row|Drive-in theater just before the movie starts]]
Although drive-in movies first appeared in 1933,{{sfnp|Sanders|Sanders|2003|p=162}} it was not until well after the post-war era that they became popular, enjoying their greatest success in the 1950s, reaching a peak of more than 4,000 theaters in the United States alone.{{r|cnbcdrive}}{{r|tropes}} Drive-in theaters have been romanticized in popular culture with the movie [[American Graffiti]] and the television show [[Happy Days]]. They developed a reputation for both showing [[B movie]]s, typically monster or horror movies, and as being "passion pits", a place for teenagers to [[Kissing|make out]].{{r|tropes}}  While drive-in theaters are more rare today with only 366 remaining {{r|cnbcdrive}} and no longer unique to America, they are still associated as part of the 1950s' American car culture.{{sfnp|Sanders|Sanders|2003|p=4}}  Drive-in movies have seen somewhat of a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century, due in part to [[baby boomer]] nostalgia.{{r|tropes}}

[[Robert Schuller]] started the nation's first drive-in church in 1955 in [[Garden Grove, California]].  After his regular 9:30&nbsp;am service in the chapel 4 miles away, he would travel to the drive-in for a second Sunday service.{{r|penner1992}}  Worshipers listened to his sermon from the comfort of their own cars, using the movie theater's speaker boxes.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|p=19}}{{-}}

===Malls===
[[File:2009-0611-003-Southdale.jpg|thumb|alt=interior, center courtyard and stairs|Southdale Center in 2009]]
The first modern [[shopping mall]]s were built in the 1950s{{r|newmall}}, such as [[The Outlets at Bergen Town Center|Bergen Mall]], which was the first to use the term "mall" to describe the business model.  Other early malls moved retailing away from the dense, commercial downtowns into the largely residential suburbs. [[Northgate Mall (Seattle)|Northgate]] in [[Seattle]] is credited as being the first modern mall design, with two rows of businesses facing each other and a walkway separating them. It opened in 1950.  [[Shopper's World]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] was the two-story mall, and opened a year later.{{r|newmall}} The design was modified again 1954 when [[Northland Center]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], used a centralized design with an anchor store in the middle of the mall, ringed by other stores. This was the first mall to have the parking lot completely surrounding the shopping center, and to provide [[HVAC|central heat and air-conditioning]].{{r|newmall}}

In 1956, [[Southdale Center]] opened in [[Edina, Minnesota]], just outside of Minneapolis.  It was the first to combine all these modern elements, being enclosed with a two-story design, central heat and air-conditioning plus a comfortable common area.  It also featured two large department stores as anchors. Most industry professionals consider Southdale Center to be the first modern regional mall.{{r|newmall}}

This formula (enclosed space with stores attached, away from downtown, and accessible only by automobile) became a popular way to build [[retail]] across the world.  [[Victor Gruen]], one of the pioneers in mall design,{{r|victormall}} came to abhor this effect of his new design; he decried the creation of enormous "land wasting seas of parking" and the spread of suburban sprawl.{{r|deadmall}}

===Aftermarket===
The 1950s jump started an industry of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. [[American Racing]], is the oldest aftermarket wheel company and started in 1956 and still builds "mag wheels" ([[alloy wheel]]s) for almost every car made.{{r|amracing}}  [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford offered in the 1957 Ford Thunderbird,{{r|holley}} and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts.  [[Edelbrock]] started during the [[Great Depression]] and expanded after the war.  They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at [[Bonneville Salt Flats]]{{r|Edelbrock}}  Owners were no longer bound by the original equipment provided by manufacturers, helping not only create the hot rod culture{{sfnp|Lucsko|2008|p=105}} but also the foundation for cosmetic modifications.  The creation and rapid expansion of the aftermarket made it possible for enthusiasts to personalize their automobiles.{{sfnp|Dregni|Williams|2010|p=35}}

===Auto industry changes===
[[File:1949 Crosley Hotshot & Appliance Display.jpg|thumb|alt=White car and refrigerator on display|Crosley autos were sold in a number of appliance stores in the early 1950s.]]
Most new cars were sold through [[Car dealership|automobile dealerships]] in the 1950s, but [[Crosley]] automobiles were still on sale at any number of appliance or department stores,{{r|crosleyapp}}{{sfnp|American Cars of the 1950s|2007|p=164}} and [[Allstate (automobile)|Allstate]] (a rebadged [[Henry J]]) could be ordered at any [[Sears|Sears and Roebuck]] in 1952 and 1953.{{sfnp|American Cars of the 1950s|2007|p=165}} By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.

Starting in the mid 1950s, new car introductions in the fall once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the [[Car model|models]] for the upcoming year each October.  In this era before information technology, the primary source of information on new models was the dealer.{{r|tstar}}  The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by then President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand.  The idea was reintroduce by [[President of the United States|President]] Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.{{r|tstar}}

During the decade, many of the smaller manufacturers could not compete with the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] and either went out of business{{r|outofbiz}} or merged. In 1954, [[American Motors]] was formed when [[Hudson (automobile)|Hudson]] merged with [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation]] in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in U.S. history at that time.{{r|amcstart}}

===Muscle cars===
The [[muscle car]] era is deeply rooted in the 1950s,{{r|dealership}} although there is some debate as to the exact beginning.  ''Old Cars Weekly'' claims it started with the introduction of the original Chrysler [[Chrysler_Hemi_engine#331|"Firepower" hemi]] V8 engine in 1951,{{r|Weekly2010}} while others such as ''Hot Rod'' magazine consider the first overhead valve engine by Chevrolet, the 265 cid V8 as the "heir apparent to to Ford flathead's position as the staple of racing", in 1955.{{r|hotrodmag}} The [[Chevrolet small-block engine|"small block Chevy"]] itself developed its own subculture that exists today.{{r|Mueller2005}}  Other contenders include the 1949 [[Oldsmobile V8 engine]], the first in a long line of such powerful V8 engines,{{r|Mueller2004}}{{r|AmbrogioLuckerman2006}} as well as the [[Cadillac_V8_engine#OHV|Cadillac V8]] of the same year.{{r|amercar}}

Regardless of how it is credited, the [[horsepower]] race centered around the V8 engine{{r|dealership}}{{r|time}} and the muscle car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s.  This in turn opened up new opportunities for aftermarket manufacturers like Edelbrock.{{r|hotrodmag}}  Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower,{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2008|p=7}} providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models.  Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, in the name of "planned obsolescence"{{r|planned}}{{r|planned2}} and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes and cruise control, in an effort to make the previous models seem outdated and facilitate the long drive from the suburbs.{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2008|p=7}}   Record sales made the decade arguably the "golden era" of automobile manufacturing.{{r|century3}}

Harley Earl and Bill France Sr. popularized the saying "Race on Sunday, sell on Monday",{{r|century}} a mantra that is still heard today in motorsports, particularly within NASCAR. During the muscle-car era, manufacturers not only sponsored the drivers, but designed [[Stock car racing|stock cars]] specifically to compete in the fast-growing and highly popular sport.{{r|dealership}}

==Songs celebrating the automobile==
As the automobile became more and more an extension of the individual, it was natural for this to be reflected in popular culture.  America's love affair with the automobile was most evident in the music of the era.

*''[[Rocket 88]]'' was first recorded in 1951 and originally credited to [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats, although later discovered to be [[Ike Turner]]'s [[Kings of Rhythm]].  It is often credited as the first [[Rock and Roll]] song ever produced.{{r|jahl}} and has been covered by other artists.
*''[[Hot Rod Lincoln]]'' was first recorded in 1955 by Charlie Ryan,{{r|charlie}}{{r|charlie2}} and has since been recorded by [[Roger Miller]];{{r|rmiller}} the 1960 [[Johnny Bond]] version charted at number 26 on Billboard Hot 100. Comedian [[Jim Varney]] produced a version with [[Ricky Skaggs]] for the motion picture ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.{{r|varney}}  The song is still a popular live song for artists such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]]{{r|allmusicasleep}} and [[Junior Brown]].{{r|hotrodjr}}
*''[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]]'' was released in 1959 and initially met with resistance by radio stations because of its dark message about a young girl who dies in an automobile/train accident.

Other songs recorded during the decade, such as "[[Brand New Cadillac]]", [[Sonny Burgess]]'s "Thunderbird" and [[Bo Diddley]]'s "Cadillac", also reflect the automobile's place in American culture.
