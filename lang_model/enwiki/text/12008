[[Kyle Busch]] appeared in victory lane after his [[victory lap]] to start celebrating his first win of the season, and his third at [[Richmond International Raceway]]. Following his win, he added, "I don<U+2019>t even remember what just happened. I drove it down into Turn 1 and hoped it stuck. I knew I had to baby it into Turn 3 and finally got to clear Jeff. We set sail there from there."<ref name=passedgordon />

After finishing second, [[Jeff Gordon]] stated, "A little disappointed again that we are coming up short, but we are getting plenty of practice. It<U+2019>s a little disappointing we haven<U+2019>t won some races yet. If we keep doing this, those will come. We<U+2019>ve got to keep putting ourselves in position."<ref name=passedgordon /> Gordon followed the race by saying, "I<U+2019>ve been doing this long enough to know that they don<U+2019>t give out trophies for leading any lap other than the last one."<ref name=passedgordon /> In the subsequent [[Press Conference|press conference]], Kyle Busch said, "I can<U+2019>t thank [[Dave Rogers (NASCAR)|Dave]] enough, it<U+2019>s unbelievable to be back in victory lane.

{{quote|"I figured I was going to get the outside [for the last restart]. All I wanted to do was just get into Turn 1 smooth and get a good launch up off Turn 2 down the backstretch<U+2014>and then make sure I got into [Turn] 3 without over-driving it. ...I knew if I could just get through Turn 3 OK and hammer down off Turn 4 and get him cleared that it would be pretty good<U+2014>and it worked. That<U+2019>s what I did. Did I have a plan? Was that exactly my plan? No. I was just going to drive it as hard as I could, and make whatever happened happen. It worked, just off the cuff."<ref name="polesitterkylewins" />}}

Dave Rogers, Kyle Busch's crew chief, stated, "It would have been great to keep that many cars a lap down, but it would have been selfish. Everybody behind us was going to pit. If we stay out, we keep all those guys down. Then the seven guys behind us are going to drive by us, we<U+2019>re going to lose our track position just to keep cars a lap down. It<U+2019>s not worth it."<ref name=passedgordon /> The race result moved Kevin Harvick in the lead for the Driver's Championship with 1,467 points.<ref name="points">{{cite web|title=Point Standing|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2010/10/data/standings_official.html|location=nascar.com|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> [[Jimmie Johnson]], who finished tenth, was second on 1,457, ninty-nine points ahead of Kyle Busch and 149 ahead of [[Matt Kenseth]].<ref name="points" /> [[Greg Biffle]] was fifth with 1,334 points.<ref name="points" /> In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained their lead with 76 points.<ref name=manufacturer /> Toyota maintained second with 58 points.<ref name=manufacturer /> Ford followed with 46 points, six points ahead of Dodge in fourth.<ref name=manufacturer />
