==History==

[[Image:Asifportrait2 - Asuf ud Daula.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Asaf-Ud-Dowlah|Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah]] (1775<U+2013>1797)<ref name="lucknow.nic.in">{{cite web|url=http://www.lucknow.nic.in/history.htm |title=history |publisher=Lucknow.nic.in |accessdate=26 March 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407191601/http://lucknow.nic.in/history.htm |archivedate = 7 April 2008}}</ref>]]
The ancient history of Lucknow is mired in mystries and folk sayings. It is popularly believed that Lucknow (<U+0932><U+0916><U+0928><U+090A>) derives its name from Lakshman (<U+0932><U+0915><U+094D><U+0937><U+094D><U+092E><U+0923>) (also known as Lakhan (<U+0932><U+0916><U+0928>)), younger brother of Lord Rama, greatest hero of Suryawanshi kshatriya clan of India. Ram ordered Lakshman to establish a new town near Ayodhya, the capital of Rama. Lakshman came and built a strong fort. The present Lakshman Teela (<U+0932><U+0915><U+094D><U+0937><U+094D><U+092E><U+0923> <U+091F><U+0940><U+0932><U+093E>) in Lucknow is believed to be the site of ancient city of Lakhanpur built by Lakshman.

Since 1350 AD Lucknow and parts of the [[Awadh]] region were ruled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Mughal Empire]], [[Nawabs of Awadh]], [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[British Raj]]. Lucknow was one of the major centres of [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], participated actively in [[Indian independence movement|India's Independence movement]], and emerged as an important city of [[North India]].

Until 1719, [[Subah (province)|subah]] of [[Awadh]] was a province of the [[Mughal Empire]] administered by a Governor appointed by the Emperor. [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Saadat Khan]] also called Burhan-ul-Mulk a Persian adventurer was appointed the Nazim of [[Awadh]] in 1722 and he established his court in Faizabad<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/fa/FaizabdInd.html Faizabad, town, India. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001<U+2013>07<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> near Lucknow.

Awadh, known as the granary of India, was important strategically for the control of the fertile plain between the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yamuna]] rivers known as the ''Doab''. It was a wealthy kingdom, able to maintain its independence against threats from the [[Maratha]]s, the British and the [[Afghanistan|Afghans]]. The third Nawab, [[Shuja-ud-Daula]], fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive [[Nawab of Bengal]] [[Mir Qasim]]. He was comprehensively defeated in the [[Battle of Buxar]] by the East India Company, which forced him to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory. The British appointed a resident in 1773 and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state.  They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and be brought face to face with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire.

Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established when the Mughal empire disintegrated. Awadh<U+2019>s capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth nawab, shifted his court here from Faizabad in 1775. The city was also North India<U+2019>s cultural capital, and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagnt lifestyles, were patrons of the arts. Under them music and dance flourished, and many monuments were erected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laxys.com/lucknow.html |title=Lucknow City |publisher=Laxys.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> Of the monuments standing today, the [[Bara Imambara]], the [[Chhota Imambara]], and the [[Rumi Darwaza]] are notable examples. One of the more lasting contributions by the ''Nawabs'' is the [[syncretic]] composite culture that has come to be known as the ''[[Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb]]''.

[[Image:Gates of Palace at Lucknow William Daniell 1801.jpg|thumb|left|Gates of the Palace at Lucknow by [[William Daniell|W. Daniell]], 1801]]
[[Image:Saadut Aly Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saadat Ali Khan II|Nawab Saadat Khan II]]]]
In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and  the British, and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped [[Saadat Ali Khan II|Saadat Ali Khan]] to the throne. Saadat Ali Khan was a puppet king, who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disband his troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it nationally continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819.

The treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh's vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh's armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh.

[[Image:Washah1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Wajid Ali Shah]] (1847<U+2013>1856)<ref name="lucknow.nic.in"/>]]
In 1856 the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state, which was placed under a chief commissioner <U+2013> Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]]. [[Wajid Ali Shah]], the then Nawab, was imprisoned, and then exiled by the Company to [[Calcutta]]. In the subsequent [[Revolt of 1857]] his 14-year old son [[Birjis Qadra]] son of [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]] was crowned ruler, and Sir Henry Lawrence killed in the hostilities. Following the rebellion's defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other rebel leaders obtained asylum in [[Nepal]].

Those company troops who were recruited from the state, along with some of the nobility of the state, were major players in the events of 1857. The rebels took control of Awadh, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region, months which included the famous [[Siege of Lucknow]]. [[Oudh]] was placed back under a chief commissioner, and was governed as a British province. In 1877 the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined in the same person; and in 1902, when the new name of [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]] was introduced, the title of chief commissioner was dropped, though Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.

The province of Awadh (anglicised to ''Oudh'') was annexed by the East India Company in 1856 under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]] and placed under the control of a chief commissioner. In the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] (also known as the [[First War of Indian Independence]] and the Indian Mutiny), the [[garrison]] based at the [[Residency (country subdivision)|Residency]] in Lucknow was [[siege|besieged]] by rebel forces. The famous [[Siege of Lucknow]] was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir [[Henry Havelock]] and Sir [[James Outram (British officer)|James Outram]], followed by a stronger force under Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]]. Today, the ruins of the Residency, and the picturesque ''Shaheed Smarak'' offer reminiscences of Lucknow's role in the stirring events of 1857.

Because of its historical importance, commercial activity, and cultural activity, Lucknow has frequently been a center of political activity, prominent in the independence movement. The [[Lucknow Pact]] of 1916 was negotiated there, between the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] to support pressuring the Raj for greater autonomy, a marked shift for the Muslim League.

The [[Khilafat Movement]] had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating a united platform against the British rule. In the Khilafat Movement [[Maulana Abdul Bari]] of [[Firangi Mahal]], Lucknow actively participated and cooperated  with [[Mahatama Gandhi]] and [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]].

In 1901, after remaining the capital of [[Oudh]] since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged in the newly formed [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]].<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lucknow Lucknow, 1911] {{1911}}</ref> However, it became the [[province|provincial]] capital in 1920 when the seat of government was moved from [[Allahabad]]. Upon [[Indian independence]] in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of [[Uttar Pradesh]], the erstwhile United Provinces.

The [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) was formed at the Lucknow session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 11 April 1936 with the legendary nationalist [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] elected as its first President,<ref>{{cite book

Lucknow is known as a seat of Shi'ism and the epitome of Shia culture in India. It is famous for [[Muharram]] and associated ''azadari movement''. All the communities including Hindus, observe the Moharram on the 10th of Moharram in the memory of [[Imam Husain]] (the grandson of the prophet [[Muhammad]]). Fourteen hundred years back in Karbala Iraq [[Yazid I|Yazid's]] forces killed Immam Hussain and his family on the [[day of Ashura]] and imprisoned remaining family.

The processions of Muharram in Lucknow have a special significance. They were started during the reign of the [[Nawab of Awadh|Awadh Nawabs]]. The Majalises, processions and other rituals that are observed by the Shia community to commemorate the sacrifice of Husain are known as Azadari.

These processions which started during the reign of the [[Nawab of Awadh|Awadh Nawabs]] continued till the year 1977 when [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] banned the Azadari processions in public. For next twenty years processions and gatherings were carried in private or community space like, Talkatora karbala, Imambara Asifi(Bara Imambara), Imambara Husainabad(Chhota Imambara), Dargah Hazrat Abbas, Shah Najaf, Ghufra'ma'ab  etc. Ban was partially lifted in 1997 and Shias were successful in taking out the first Azadari procession in January 1998 (21st of Ramzan). Today the Shias have been given nine processions out of nine hundred that are registered in the festival register of the Shias.
