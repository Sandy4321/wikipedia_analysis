'''Hurricane Neki''' was the final [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2009 Pacific hurricane season]]. It developed on October&nbsp;18 as an unusually large disturbance from a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] south of [[Hawaii]]. Moving northwestward, it slowly organized at first due to its large size. After reaching hurricane status on October&nbsp;21, Neki intensifed at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h). It later turned to the north and north-northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions. While passing through the [[Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea Marine National Monument]], Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection. It caused little impact in the island chain. After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October&nbsp;27.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|Neki 2009 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Neki were from a surface [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] that persisted near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean in the middle of October 2009.<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Derek Wroe|date=2010-02-05|title=Hurricane Neki Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2009.php#neki}}</ref> The disturbance that became Neki was first identified by the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC) about 1,025&nbsp;mi (1,650&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Hilo, Hawaii]] by the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC) on October&nbsp;16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Kinel|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|date=2009-10-16|accessdate=2010-01-24|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=https://listserv.illinois.edu/wa.cgi?A2=ind0910c&L=wx-tropl&T=0&P=31188}}</ref> By the evening of October&nbsp;17, the disturbance became better defined and stalled south-southeast of Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Kinel|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|date=2009-10-17|accessdate=2010-01-24|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|url=https://listserv.illinois.edu/wa.cgi?A2=ind0910c&L=wx-tropl&T=0&P=49237}}</ref> An organized area of convection developed within the disturbance, creating an unusually large gyre for the region. Following the formation of a well-defined [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]], it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-C late on October&nbsp;18, about 730&nbsp;mi (1175&nbsp;km) south of [[Ka Lae]], [[Hawaii]].<ref name="cphc"/>

Upon developing into a tropical cyclone, the storm was moving west-northwestward, influenced by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north.<ref name="cphc"/> It was located over an area of warm [[sea surface temperature]]s and moderate [[wind shear]], which favored gradual intensification.<ref>{{cite web|author=Donaldson|date=2009-10-18|title=Tropical Depression Three-C Discussion One|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.001.0910182125}}</ref> The convection diminished during a diurnal cycle before redeveloping the next day.

On October&nbsp;19, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neki, and shortly thereafter the storm turned toward the northwest.<ref name="cphc"/> By the next day, the cyclone resembled the structure of a [[Monsoon trough#Embedded depression|monsoon depression]] typically found in the western Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kodama|date=2009-10-20|title=Tropical Storm Neki Discussion Six|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.006.0910200233}}</ref> However, the structure began to more resemble a tropical cyclone after the outermost convection diminished and the thunderstorms around the center increased.<ref>{{cite web|author=Donaldson|date=2009-10-20|title=Tropical Storm Neki Discussion Seven|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.007.0910200903}}</ref> Following the development of a [[eye (cyclone)|banding-eye feature]], Neki intensified into a hurricane early on October&nbsp;21 about 625&nbsp;mi (1010&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], or about 335&nbsp;mi (535&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Johnston Atoll]].<ref name="cphc"/>

After reaching hurricane status, Neki began [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensifying]] as it turned northward, due to an approaching upper-level trough to its north.<ref name="cphc"/> An [[anticyclone]] aloft provided favorable [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], which contributed in the strengthening.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wroe|date=2009-10-21|title=Hurricane Neki Discussion Thirteen|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.013.0910212136}}</ref> Early on October&nbsp;22, Neki reached its peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) about 215&nbsp;mi (345&nbsp;km) northeast of Johnston Atoll, based on estimates from satellite imagery using the [[Dvorak technique]]. Afterward, the trough that influenced the hurricane's track also began restricting westerly outflow and increasing wind shear, which caused a steady weakening trend. It maintained major hurricane status &ndash; a Category&nbsp;3 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] &ndash; for about 24&nbsp;hours, during which the track turned toward the north-northeast.<ref name="cphc"/> The weakening and deterioration of the storm's structure became more marked on October&nbsp;23 after the thunderstorms failed to persist over the center.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tanabe|date=2009-10-23|title=Tropical Storm Neki Discussion Twenty|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-27|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.020.0910231506}}</ref> 

While approaching the [[Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea Marine National Monument]], Neki weakened to tropical storm status.<ref name="cphc"/> Continued wind shear exposed the circulation from the convection,<ref>{{cite web|author=Ballard|date=2009-10-23|title=Tropical Storm Neki Discussion Twenty-One|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-27|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.021.0910232100}}</ref> although further weakening was slow to occur. On October&nbsp;24, Neki made its closest approach to land after passing within 13&nbsp;mi (21&nbsp;km) of the uninhabited [[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Necker Island]]. Its forward motion slowed due to a building ridge to the north, causing the storm to execute a small loop.<ref name="cphc"/> Despite the shear, Neki was initially able to continue developing thunderstorms, although cooler water temperatures resulted in further weakening.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kodama|date=2009-10-25|title=Tropical Storm Neki Discussion Twenty-Six|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-07-27|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/archive/2009/TCDCP2.CP032009.026.0910250243}}</ref> The storm resumed its northward motion after the ridge receded to the east, and on October&nbsp;26 Neki weakened to a tropical depression once the circulation decoupled from the thunderstorms. The next day it dissipated as the center became elongated ahead of an approaching cold front.<ref name="cphc"/>

As the hurricane turned northward and was seen as a threat to the Hawaiian Islands, officials in the Papahanaumokuakea requested that all personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an [[AC-130]] aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated 10 people from Tern Island while a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] vessel evacuated seven temporary residents on Laysan Island.<ref>{{cite web|author=Barbara Maxfield|publisher=Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument Press|date=2009-10-26|accessdate=2010-01-23|title=Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea Islands Mostly Spared by Tropical Storm Neki|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/news/2009/NekiNR.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=NOAA BlogSpot|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2010-01-23|title=Laysan, Tern Island, and Home Again|url=http://marinedebrisgov.blogspot.com/2009/10/laysan-tern-island-and-home-again.html}}</ref> Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.
