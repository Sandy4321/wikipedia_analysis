Both Gardner Hall (1930), originally named the Fowler Memorial Administration Building after [[Charles J. Fowler]], and the original Floyd W. Nease Library (1953), now the Bower-Grimshaw Center for Institutional Advancement, were designed by Wesley Angell. Gardner Hall was designed in the [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] mode. Gardner is brick, three stories on a high granite basement, and capped by a [[parapet]] [[balustrade]]d in the center. Corners are articulated with brick [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]. The fenestration is symmetric with double sash windows at regular intervals, trimmed in white, topped with flared brick [[lintel]]s and a white [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]]. It also features a two-story balustraded [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]] of fluted cast stone [[column]]s. The portico is the backdrop for [[commencement speech|commencement]] ceremonies. The main entrance, at the end of wide stairs, is pilastered and topped with a bracketed entablature, which frames an arched glass opening. The side elevations have projecting stair towers, which indicate the site of a central hall running the length of the building. Originally rectangular in form, the 1953 addition of the then-Nease Library in the rear bestowed upon it a T-configuration.<ref>{{cite web

There are no [[fraternities]] or [[sororities]] on campus, but there are Greek "societies". Until 2002, there were four societies based on intramural sports competition, which included the "[[Kappa]] Cougars", the "[[Sigma]] Stallions", and the "[[Zeta]] Warriors". New societies were formed in 2007 and originally numbered eight but were reduced to four again in 2008. Current membership is primarily based on residency, but includes faculty and staff.

===Residential life===
Students live in single-sex [[residence hall]]s with visitation hours throughout the week. There are three female [[dormitories]] (Spangenberg Hall, Williamson Hall, and Munro Hall) and two male dormitories (Memorial Hall and Shields Hall). Young Hall provides [[apartment]]s for staff and married students, in addition to [[suite]]s for upperclassman females and males. Each dormitory houses a common area, known as a parlor, where students of both sexes are welcome. Student use these parlors extensively for social events and study groups during the week.

The Mann Student Center houses The Commons for sit-down meals [[cafeteria]]-style, as well as The Dugout for meals in a caf<U+00E9>-type atmosphere. The latter is a popular location for social gathering, as is the adjacent "Colonel's Coffee House", which, ironically, is not a place where [[coffee]] is served.
