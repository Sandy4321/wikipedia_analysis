"'''Enough Cryin'''" is the third [[United States|U.S.]] [[single (music)|single]] from [[Mary J. Blige]]'s seventh studio album, ''[[The Breakthrough]]'' (2005). It features Brook Lynn, Blige's [[alter ego]], who provides a rap segment on the song.

==Song information==
"Enough Cryin" was recorded and mixed in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 2005 and is featured on Blige's multi-Platinum album ''The Breakthrough''. Written with and produced by Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, the song features Blige's alter ego, Brook, whom Mary created to give her lyrical freedom without the fear of damaging her own persona: "I had to separate the two because Mary is nice, you know, intelligent," she explained. "Brook is crazy and ignorant and she don't care."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524675/20060303/story.jhtml Mary J.

The song is in reference to the 1996 smash hit "[[Touch Me, Tease Me]]".

The [[music video]] for the single was shot in Los Angeles, [[California]] in March 2006 and was directed by [[Hype Williams]].

"Enough Cryin" was the third single release from ''The Breakthrough'' in [[Europe]]. The single currently was released on June 26, 2006 and was her most unsuccessful release there from the album, peaking outside the UK top 40. It is also one of her lowest-charting singles to date, mainly due to the lack of [[airplay (song)|airplay]] that the track received on UK radio.
