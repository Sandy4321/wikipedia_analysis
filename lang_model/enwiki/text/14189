'''Dick Trickle''' (born [[October 27]], [[1941]] in [[Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin]]) is an [[auto racing|auto racer]]. He raced for decades around the [[Short track motor racing|short tracks]] of [[Wisconsin]], winning many championships along the way. Trickle has competed in the [[American Speed Association|ASA]], [[ARTGO]], [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]], All Pro, [[International Motor Contest Association|IMCA]], [[NASCAR]], [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]], and [[USAR Hooters Pro Cup]]. 

In more than an estimated 2,200 races, Trickle has logged one million laps and legend has it that he has won over 1,200 features, although no one has been able to verify this win total. Trickle's career highlights include racing to 67 wins in 1972,<ref name=Grubba78>{{cite book |title=The Golden Age of Wisconsin Auto Racing |last=Grubba |first=Dale |year=2000 |publisher=Badger Books |location=[[Oregon, Wisconsin]] |isbn=1-878569-67-8 |pages=page 78 }}</ref> winning seven ARTGO Championships in nine years between 1979 to 1987, winning back to back ASA AC-Delco Challenge championships in 1984 and 1985, the 1968 USAC Stock Car rookie of the year, and winning the 1989 [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]] award in what was then called the Winston Cup (now [[Sprint Cup]]).

==Personal life==
Young Dick Trickle was playing on the [[rafters]] in a house under construction when he fell two floors to the basement and broke his hip. The recovery was slow, and one of the doctors gave up and sent him to an invalid home. Trickle later began to walk, although he still walks with a slight limp.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter>Grubba, pages 211-222</ref> While he was recovering as a nine-year-old, a friend took him to his first races at Crown Speedway in Wisconsin Rapids.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> "When I got there I was flabergasted," Trickle said. "I thought it was the neatest thing. Free shows were nothing compared to it. That race never left my mind until I was 16. I knew I was going to drive a race car when I was 16."<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter />

Trickle married his wife Darlene in 1961.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> They originally lived at his grandmother's house for a while before they bought a [[trailer home]] on someone else's property.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> 


==Racing career==
===Wisconsin short track career===
Trickle's father, Lee, had an ear infection and was hospitalized for around 20 years while Trickle was growing up.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> His family lived on [[Welfare]], so there was no money available for racing.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> Trickle spent his summers from young on working for area farmers.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He also spent a lot of time at the Randolph Blacksmith shop that his father was a partner in.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> While his father was ill, his uncle Leonard ran the shop.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> 

<blockquote>"I worked part time at the shop to earn a nickel or dime," Trickle said. "At that age, it was mostly sweeping the shop, but I started to play with the welder and soon I could make an arc and then weld. I started junking machinery. I save some things getting a head start for when I would go racing at 16. I didn't have any money, but I had this pile of stuff to build a race car with. It was a hope chest.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>When I turned 16, I let the farmer I was working for keep most the money I earned until fall. That fall I collected my money and went down Main Street wheeling and dealing. I finally bought a 1950 Ford in good condition for $100. It was going to be my street car, but the urge to race got too strong and I cut up and made a stock car out of it."</blockquote>

<blockquote>I did run the car a little bit before I cut it up and I ended up drag racing a classmate, Melvin Hunsinger, who had a 1949 Ford. He beat me. It seems kind of dumb when I already knew there was a car that could beat me. Eventually, I bought Hunsinger's 1949 Ford for $32.50 and put the motor in my car".<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /></blockquote>

Trickle started out as the slowest car in a 100 car field at [[Stratford, Wisconsin]] race.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He raced that car at the end of the 1958 season and throughout the 1959 season, after which time he built a 1956 Ford into race car using all of his knowledge that he had acquired.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> In his first time out with the new car, he finished second in the feature event at Griffith Park at Wisconsin Rapids.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> His competitors checked the rules and found out that Trickle was too young to race, even though he had already raced there for two years.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He had to race at other tracks for a year until he was old enough to race at his hometown track.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He raced for several years before deciding to race full-time.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> After working at several jobs after high school, he had worked for two years for a local telephone company. He had been uncomfortable climbing telephone poles as he was uncomfortable with heights.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He transfered to a different part of the company. Two or three years later he discussed racing full-time with his wife for he felt that he could be profitable, and they decided to make the change.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter />

Trickle's raced at over 100 events for over 15 years.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> He was racing at [[Tomah, Wisconsin|Tomah]]-[[Sparta, Wisconsin|Sparta]] Speedway when Francis Kelly noticed that Trickle was always in contention for winning the races, but he lost a lot of them because he had junky motors. One day Kelly approached Trickle and asked him what it would cost for Trickle to win. Trickle told him a new motor; Kelly asked Trickle to compile a list of parts that he needed. When Kelly asked who would assemble the motor, Trickle responded that he could but he was a junkyard mechanic. Trickle suggested that [[Alan Kulwicki]]'s father Jerry Kulwicki, who was building motors for [[Norm Nelson]]'s [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] stock cars, should build the engine.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> 

A big turning point in Trickle's career happened at the National Short Track Championship race at [[Rockford Speedway]] in 1966.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> Trickle said, "The cars in that area were fancier and looked like they were ahead of us. The didn't treat us bad, but they sort of giggled at us kids with the rat cars. After two days, they look differently at those rat cars. I won and pocketed $1,645. Before, I questioned spending the money to travel that far. But if you could win, that was a different story."<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter />

He toured on the Central Wisconsin Racing Association (CWRA) tracks in 1971. The circuit consisted of larger asphalt track racing on most nights of the week.<ref name=Grubba70>Grubba, page 70</ref> CWRA regular drivers were able to run over 100 events in a year, and most did the tour with one car and one engine.<ref name=Grubba7>Grubba, page 7</ref> Drivers wound drive on Wednesday nights at LaCrosse Speedway, Thursday nights at State Park Speedway near [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]], Friday nights at Capitol Speedway (now [[Madison International Speedway]]) near [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[LaCrosse Speedway]] near [[LaCrosse, Wisconsin]], or [[Adams, Wisconsin|Adams]]-[[Friendship, Wisconsin|Friendship]], Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells Speedway (now [[Dells Raceway Park]]), and Sunday nights at Griffith Park.<ref name=Grubba7 /> Tuesday nights were available for special events.<ref name=Grubba7 />

On Thursday nights at the quarter mile State Park Speedway, he won seven features and lowered his July 1 14.27 second track record to 14.09 seconds on the following week.<ref name=Grubba70 /> On Friday nights he raced primarily at Capitol Speedway, winning most nights that rain or his car didn't break.<ref>Grubba, page 72</ref> Trickle went to [[Adams, Wisconsin|Adams]]-[[Friendship, Wisconsin|Friendship]] on July 23 and won the feature after setting the track record.<ref name=Grubba73>Grubba, page 73</ref> He held the track record at six tracks: Adams-Friendship, Capitol, Wausau, [[Dells Raceway Park|Wisconsin Dells]], and [[LaCrosse Speedway|LaCrosse]].<ref name=Grubba73 /> He raced at the newly opened third mile Wisconsin Dells Speedway on Saturday nights. By the end of the year, Trickle had won 58 feature events.<ref>Grubba, page 75</ref>

Trickle started his 1972 season by winning at Golden Sands Speedway near Wisconsin Rapids.<ref name=Grubba78 /> Wisconsin's [[short track racing]] season starts in April. By May 13, he had twelve wins in thirteen events.<ref name=Grubba78 /> He got this fifteenth win in twenty starts on May 27.<ref name=Grubba78 /> Trickle became the winningest short track driver that year when he won his 67th race.<ref name=Grubba78 />

Trickle won numerous special events outside of Wisconsin in 1973, including a 200-lap feature at [[Rolla, Missouri]] in April, following by winning a 50-lap feature the following day at [[I-70 Speedway]] near [[Odessa, Missouri]].<ref name=Grubba101>Grubba, pages 101-102</ref> In May he won a 50-lapper at [[Springfield, Missouri]] and two more features at I-70 Speedway.<ref name=Grubba101 /> Trickle used his purple 1970 [[Ford Mustang]] to win at the Minnesota Fair and at [[Rockford Speedway]] in September.<ref name=Grubba101 /> He had a total of 57 wins in 1973.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter />

Sanctioning bodies put in a weight-per-cubic-inch rule, and Trickle's career had problems. "Fords almost broke me. I couldn't get any pieces for racing at my level. It took two years of hard labor and depleting my funds to realize I couldn't do this anymore. I told myself either I had to change my program or get out of racing."<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> So Trickle decided to use a [[General Motors]] car and engine. He bought a car for $13,000 on his word that he would pay for it by September. He won 35 or 40 races that year and paid for the car by July.<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter /> 

Of all of Trickle's victories, his best memory was winning the 1983 [[World Crown 300]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. "It took three weeks of preparation and a lot of determination," he said. "It was the biggest payday of my career up to that point ($50,000)."<ref name=GrubbaTrickleChapter />

==NASCAR career==
[[Image:DickTrickle84racecar1989.jpg|thumb|right|1989 Rookie of the Year car]]
[[Image:DickTrickleHeiligMeyersCupcar.jpg|thumb|right|Heilig Meyers car]]
In [[1989]] Trickle made his full schedule debut driving the #84 [[Miller Lite|Miller High Life]] Buick for [[Stavola Brothers Racing]]. He had raced an occasional race during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/drivers/dps/dtrickle00/cup/index.html Dick Trickle NASCAR statistics]</ref>. He was [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] in NASCAR's [[Winston Cup]] (now the [[Sprint Cup]]) at age 48 (and a grandfather), becoming the oldest driver in Winston Cup history to do so.  His best career Winston Cup finish was third (5 times). He started 299 races, with 14 Top 5 and 32 Top 10 finishes.

In [[1990 in NASCAR|1990]], he won the [[NEXTEL All-Star Challenge|Winston Open]] (now the [[NEXTEL All-Star Challenge|NEXTEL Open]]) in the #66 TropArtic [[Pontiac]]. It was a non-points All-Star event for drivers who didn't win in the previous year. He beat [[Rob Moroso]] by 8 inches, which is the smallest margin of victory at the event. He also won his only career Cup pole at [[Dover Downs International Speedway]]. In the middle of the 1991 season he went to drive the #24 Team III Racing [[Pontiac]]. He best finish was 6th at [[Dover International Speedway]]. In 1992 he teamed up once again with the Stavola Brothers, driving the #8 [[Snickers]] [[Ford]]. In 1993 he drove the #75 Carolina Pottery [[Ford]] for [[RahMoc Enterprises|Butch Mock Motorsports]] and then the #41 Manheim Auctions [[Chevrolet|Chevy]] for [[Larry Hedrick Motorsports]].

Part of his popularity stemmed from his unusual, double-entendre name. [[ESPN]]'s [[Dan Patrick]] and [[Keith Olbermann]] often made it a point to mention where he finished whenever NASCAR highlights were featured on [[Sportscenter]]. He was also widely noted for having drilled a hole in his safety helmet so that he could smoke while racing, and for installing cigarette lighters in his race cars. [http://www.tricklefan.com/bio.html] Trickle was allowed by NASCAR to smoke in the race car during yellow flag periods, and in the 1990 [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] (now the [[Aaron's 499]]), Trickle was seen on live television by the in-car camera lighting up and smoking a cigarette.

Dick also raced in the [[Busch Series]], where he won two races.  He had 158 career starts, with 24 Top 5 and 42 Top 10 finishes. He made his Busch Series debut in 1984.

Trickle continues to race in occasional events in Wisconsin, including the 2007 [[Slinger Super Speedway#Slinger Nationals|Slinger Nationals]] at [[Slinger Super Speedway]] and in the ASA Midwest Tour.
