'''SMS ''Mainz''''' was a {{sclass|Kolberg|cruiser|4}} [[light cruiser]] of the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) during the [[First World War]]. She had three sister ships, {{SMS|Kolberg}}, {{SMS|C<U+00F6>ln|1909|2}}, and {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}. She was built by the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]]; her hull was laid down in 1908 and she was launched in January 1909. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in October 1909. She was armed with a main battery of twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] and had a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn|abbr=on}}.

After her commissioning, she served with the [[II Scouting Group]], part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. She was assigned to patrols off the island of [[Heligoland]] at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914. At the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five [[battlecruiser]]s and several light cruisers. ''Mainz'' was initially stationed in support of the forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered a much stronger force of British cruisers and [[destroyer]]s. They scored several damaging hits with gunfire and a [[torpedo]] that disabled ''Mainz'' and prompted her commander to abandon ship. The British rescued 348 men from the crew before the ship rolled over and sank. Eighty-nine men were killed in the battle, including her commanding officer.

''Mainz'' was ordered under the contract name ''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Jagd||2}} and was laid down in 1907 at the [[AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]]. She was launched on 23 January 1909 and christened by the mayor of [[Mainz]], Karl Emil G<U+00F6>ttelmann, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 1 October 1909.<ref name=G1067>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref><ref name=HRS38>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr and Steinmetz, p. 38</ref> The ship was {{convert|130.5|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.58|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4915|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[AEG-Curtiss]] [[steam turbine]]s driving two {{convert|3.45|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|19000|shp|lk=in}}. These were powered by fifteen coal-fired Marine [[water-tube boiler]]s. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|26|kn}}. ''Mainz'' carried {{convert|1010|MT|abbr=on}} of coal that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|3630|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}. ''Mainz'' had a crew of eighteen officers and 349 enlisted men.<ref name=G106>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 106</ref>

The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.<ref name=C159>Gardiner & Gray, p. 159</ref> She also carried four 5.2&nbsp;cm SK L/55 anti-aircraft guns. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. She could also carry 100 [[naval mine|mines]]. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor plate.<ref name=G106/>

==Service history==
After her commissioning in 1909, ''Mainz'' served with the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 107</ref> Her first commander was {{Lang|de|''[[Fregattenkapit<U+00E4>n]]''}} (commander) Friedrich Tiesmeyer, the uncle of [[Ernst Lindemann]]; he held the command until January 1910.<ref>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr and Steinmetz, p. 37</ref> She was assigned to the [[II Scouting Group]], which screened for the [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[I Scouting Group]].<ref>Scheer, p. 14</ref> After the outbreak of [[World War I]] at the beginning of August 1914, she and several other cruisers were tasked with patrol duties in the [[Heligoland Bight]]. The cruisers were divided with the torpedo boat flotillas, and assigned to rotate through nightly patrols into the North Sea. As part of this operation, ''Mainz'' conducted a patrol on the night of 16 August with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla, without incident.<ref>Scheer, p. 42</ref>

At the same time, British [[submarine]]s began reconnoitering the German patrol lines. On 23 August, several British commanders submitted a plan to attack the patrol line with the light cruisers and [[destroyer]]s of the [[Harwich Force]], commanded by Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]. These ships would be supported by submarines and Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty's]] [[battlecruiser]]s and associated light forces. The plan was approved and set for 28 August.<ref>Halpern, pp. 30&ndash;31</ref> The British forces began to leave port on the evening of 26 August, beginning with the submarines assigned to the operation. Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which had been added to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.<ref>Staff, p. 5</ref>

[[File:Sinking of Mainz.jpg|thumb|''Mainz'', badly damaged, moments before sinking]]
On the morning of 28 August, ''Mainz'' was at anchor in the mouth of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]]; her sister {{SMS|C<U+00F6>ln|1909|2}}, the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Leberecht Maass]] was re-coaling in [[Wilhelmshaven]], {{SMS|Ariadne||2}} lay in the entrance to the [[Weser]]. These three cruisers were assigned to support the cruisers {{SMS|Stettin||2}} and {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, and the [[aviso]] {{SMS|Hela||2}}, which were stationed on the patrol line that morning.<ref>Staff, pp. 4&ndash;5</ref> At 07:57, the Harwich Force encountered the outer German torpedo boats, which fled back to the German cruisers. In the ensuing [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], ''Stettin'' engaged the British force first, and was quickly reinforced by ''Frauenlob''.<ref>Staff, pp. 6&ndash;8</ref> At 09:47, ''Mainz'' was ordered to steam out behind the British to cut off their line of retreat.<ref>Staff, p. 13</ref> She got under way by 10:00, and operated in conjunction with a [[floatplane]] used for reconnaissance.<ref>Staff, p. 15</ref>

At around 12:30, ''Mainz'' encountered the British cruiser {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|2}} and several destroyers. The ships engaged each other for the next forty-five minutes. Fifteen minutes into the engagement, three British cruisers appeared ; ''Mainz'' broke off the engagement and attempted to escape from the superior British forces. The pursuing British cruisers scored several hits, but by 12:55, ''Mainz'' had escaped under cover of a dense smoke screen. Another British cruiser, {{HMS|Fearless|1912|2}}, and six destroyers, appeared on ''Mainz''{{'}}s port side, however, and attacked the fleeing German ship. ''Mainz'' quickly scored hits on the destroyers {{HMS|Laurel|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Liberty|1913|2}} and {{HMS|Laertes|1913|2}}; ''Laurel'' was damaged and forced to withdraw and ''Laertes'' was disabled by a salvo that hit her engine room.<ref>Staff, pp. 16&ndash;17</ref> 

[[Image:SMS Mainz sinking (photo).jpg|thumb|left|''Mainz'' sinking on 28 August 1914]]
A shell from one of the British cruisers hit ''Mainz'' at around 13:00, which jammed her rudder at ten degrees to starboard. Her crew shut off the port engine in an attempt to correct the ship's course, but she continued to turn to starboard.<ref>Staff, p. 17</ref> By 13:20, the majority of the ship's guns had been disabled and the ship's [[superstructure]] had been shot to pieces. Her center and aft funnel collapsed after suffering several hits. A torpedo from the destroyer {{HMS|Lydiard|1914|2}} then hit the ship on her port side, amidships; this prompted the ship's commander to order the crew to abandon the stricken cruiser. He then left the [[conning tower]] with the navigation officer, both of whom were immediately killed by a shell hit. The ship's communication system was out of service, and so the order to abandon ship did not reach the entire crew. The ship's executive officer then reached the bridge, and reiterated the order to abandon the crippled ship at 13:35.<ref>Staff, p. 18</ref>

''Mainz'' was by now completely disabled. Her engines were stopped and her guns had ceased firing. Shortly before 14:00, {{HMS|Lurcher|1912|2}} came alongside and took off the wounded German sailors. At 14:10, ''Mainz'' rolled over to port and quickly sank at the position 53<U+00B0>58' N and 6<U+00B0>42' W;<ref name=S19>Staff, p. 19</ref><ref name=HRS38/> the survivors now in the water gave three cheers for their ship. The British rescued 348 survivors; 89 men, including the ship's commander, were killed in the battle.<ref name=S19/> Among the survivors was ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (Sub-Lieutenant) Wolfgang von Tirpitz, the son of Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the German fleet. [[Winston Churchill]], then the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], informed Tirpitz via the US embassy in Berlin that his son survived the battle.<ref name=HRS38/> In the course of the engagement, the British sank two more German cruisers: ''Mainz''{{'}}s sister ''C<U+00F6>ln'' and ''Ariadne'', with minimal losses to themselves.<ref>Staff, pp. 26&ndash;27</ref>
