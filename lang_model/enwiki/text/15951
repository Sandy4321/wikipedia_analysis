The '''Sufami Turbo''', often compared to the [[Aladdin Deck Enhancer]] was an accessory released by [[Bandai]] for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] system and was released in [[1996]].

== The System ==

During a time when software storage was costing both the games manufacturer & the consumer, [[Bandai]] created the Sufami Turbo. This device was designed to sit on top of the [[Super Famicom]], & contained 2 cartridge ports. The premise behind this idea is that games could be produced at a much cheaper rate (not having to rely on Nintendo). Unlike the [[Aladdin Deck Enhancer]] this device was officially approved by [[Nintendo]] under the proviso that Bandai handle all the hardware manufacturing themselves.

The 2 cartridge port system was designed to share data between the games. The cartridge that was placed in slot 1 was the main game that would be played, while the cartridge in slot 2 supplied additional data that could be used with the game in slot 1. Of the 13 released games only 9 make use of this system.

Games that are linkable are identified by a yellow diagram showing a Sufami with either 1 or 2 cartridges in the lower right corner of the game box. If the pic has 1 cart plugged into the Sufami it is not linkable. If it has 2 carts plugged into the Sufami then it is linkable with the games mentioned on the box.

If this worked with all games released is currently unknown. The accessory was not released widely, and is supported by (in order of emulation) [[ZSNES]] (2003), [[SNES9X]] (2003) and bsnes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://byuu.cinnamonpirate.com/bsnes/|title=bsnes Homepage|accessdate=2008-06-01}}<!-- bsnes has multiple primary and secondary sources, expert testimony and established notability in SNES emulation -- just not enough to warrant an entire article. Please discuss on the talk page. --></ref> (2007).

In Japan the Sufami Turbo was released as a standalone unit, or with a pack in game. There is a list of known pack in games below.

The advertising pamphlet that came with the Sufami Turbo featured Tetris 2 + Bombliss. This game was never released for the system, but was released as a standalone SNES/SFC game. It is also rumoured that another 2 Ultraman games & another Gundam game were in the works.

== The Games ==

The system was designed with lower development times & cheaper games in mind. Games debuted for 3980 Yen, with many offering the ability to link for added playability. Not all of the 13 released games had the ability to link however. Each game's box had a little picture in the lower left corner indicating whether linking was possible or not.

== How The Linking Works ==

Of the 13 games released, only 9 of them were designed with the ability to link up. Contrary to popular belief, you cannot link every game with every other game. Only certain combinations exist, & those combinations only exist within series of the same game.

=== SD Gundam Generations ===

SD Gundam Generations featured 6 games in the series, each game containing a certain amount of Gundam fighters that were unique to each of the 6 games. By combining 2 of the games at a time you could use Gundam fighters from the cartridge in slot 2, in the main Gundam Generations game in slot 1.

=== SD Ultra Battle ===

SD Ultra Battle is a beat em up based on the Ultraman series which would allow you to use characters the characters from whichever cart was in slot 2, in the main game in slot 1. It would link with other copies of the same game (Battle 1 would link with Battle 1) allowing both players to use the same character & saved data, or with the opposing game using characters from both games. The first game was based on [[Ultraman]], while the second was based on [[UltraSeven]]

=== Poi Poi Ninja ===

Poi Poi Ninja did not link with any other game, but rather linked with other copies of Poi Poi Ninja. The manual indicates that this was designed to share save data or character data for vs battles.
