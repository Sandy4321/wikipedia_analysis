==History==
During the first years after the Norman Conquest, when William de Malet served as the county's first High Sheriff, the village of Bolton Percy was held by Malet himself. At that time, and for some subsequent years, the village was quite well-to-do, as is manifest in the village's ancient church, one of the most elaborate in the ainsty of York. Later the lordship of the manor fell to the powerful Percy family, as was noted by Kirkby's Inquest of 1284, and the name of this Norman family became the manorial affix to Bolton.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=oq0uAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22bolton+percy%22+yorkshire&source=web&ots=FYp5XQl1PT&sig=_f7vaSX9v3s1zP-3NL_UfsOfjVQ&hl=en#PPA107,M1 Lower Wharfedale: Being a Complete Account of the History, Antiquities and Scenery of Picturesque Valley of the Wharfe, Henry Speight, 1902]</ref>

The lordship of the manor next came to the Vesci family, powerful in South Yorkshire near Roche Abbey, and in 1290 John Lord Vesci contributed towards the marriage of King Edward I's eldest daughter, as was mandated by Lord Vesci's holding of knights fees on his manor of Bolton Percy. The lordship of Bolton Percy next passed to their relatives the Beaumonts on the death of a de Vesci heir. Still later the lordship of Bolton Percy passed to the Fairfax family, who were intimately identified with the village for several centuries.
