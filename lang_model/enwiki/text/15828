==Machine vision==

Mission REACH (Relevance & Excellence in ACHieving new heights in educational institutions) programme has been launched in the year 2000, as a Technology Vision 2020 for India initiative, by Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organisation of the Department of Science & Technology. TIFAC establishes centres of relevance and excellence (COREs) in educational institutions in emerging science and technology. These COREs form a tripartite relationship between the government, industry and educational institutions to provide technically qualified manpower of international standards. REC has been selected to establish a CORE in the area of [[machine vision]]. The CORE has been launched and is active since 14 February 2009.

National MEMS Design Centre (NMDC) at REC

A National MEMS Design Centre (NMDC) at our institute has been established under National Program on Micro and Smart Systems (NPMASS) for the benefit of users from the region. REC motivates the research activity in the field of MEMS by proper utilisation of the facilities provided by NPMASS from design to fabrication of prototype MEMS products and specific field applications. REC will also facilitate external researchers from other interested institutes (academic or National Labs subject to individual software licensing conditions) to use the design tools.

NPMASS

The National Program on Micro and Smart Systems (NPMASS), has been launched after the success of National Program on Smart Materials (NPSM), which is a unique program, working towards the basic aim of creating awareness in India about MEMS and Smart Systems. The NPMASS under Government of India is wholly supported by Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) through Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), and is endorsed by the five departments DRDO, DOS, DST, CSIR and DIT.
