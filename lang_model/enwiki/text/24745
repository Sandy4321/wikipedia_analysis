== Military career ==

=== Early service ===

Mashbir joined the [[Arizona National Guard]] at a young age, and served as a bugler of Company B in 1904.<ref name=bio/> He later became the First Lieutenant and Adjutant of the University Battalion whilst studying at the University of Arizona.<ref name=WhosWhoInArizona/> In 1912, he served as a [[Lieutenant]] in Company K of the [[Arizona National Guard]] encampment, which based at [[Fort Huachuca]]. The senior instructor at the time was Captain [[Louis Joseph Van Schaick]].<ref name=bio/><ref name=WhosWhoInArizona/>

In early 1916, Mashbir received his first official intelligence assignment, when he was assigned as the Assistant Intelligence Officer of the [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]]-[[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] district of [[Arizona]] as apart of the first Arizona Infantry under General [[Frederick Funston]]. His duties included mapping roads, trails and waterholes in northern [[Sonora]]. Additionally he would scout Mexican towns with [[Tohono O'odham|Papago]] Indian scouts, reporting on the strength and equipment of Mexican garrisons and installing primitive wiretaps on Mexican communication lines. Mashbir was also responsible for investigating Japan's physical presence in Mexico at the time.<ref name=bio/>

In late 1916, Mashbir applied for a commission in the Regular Army and was accepted with General Funston's support despite the Army<U+2019>s policy that married men not be accepted.  After attending the Army Service Schools at [[Fort Leavenworth]], he joined the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]], which was stationed at [[Governors Island]], New York, but was soon detailed for counter-espionage duty and was recommended to join a new Counter Intelligence service that was being formed.<ref name=bio/>

On 10 September 1917 he was detailed as assistant to the Department Intelligence Officer at Governors Island. He enrolled in the [[Military Intelligence Division]] G-2 Reserves and become a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] (temporary rank). During this time he wrote the ''Provisional Rules for Counter Espionage, Eastern Department'', which would become a model for future counterintelligence manuals and survive until World War II<ref name=bio/> as well as a 52-page book titled ''Ten Lessons in Bayonet Fighting'' published by [[Banta Corporation|George Banta Publishing Company]] at the end of 1917.<ref>

Mashbir is also credited with investigations as a Coast Defense Intelligence Officer at [[Fort Hamilton]], which uncovered the first German spy to be apprehended in the United States, Paul Otto Kuhn.<ref name=bio/>

=== Between the wars ===

Following World War I, Mashbir held a position teaching [[Military Science|Military Science and Tactics]] at [[Syracuse University]], where he considered studying the Japanese language and culture. In August 1919, he asked the War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating that it was his intention to apply for a detail to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit.<ref name=bio/><ref>Mashbir, pp. 29-30</ref>

On July 7, 1920, Mashbir was assigned with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] as one of four Language Officers in Japan.<ref name=reg1922/> Mashbir relocated to [[Tokyo]] in August 1920 to begin a four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the [[Military Attach<U+00E9>]].<ref name=reg1922/> While in Tokyo, Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the Navy, there being so few Army colleagues, one being assistant naval attach<U+00E9> and Navy Lieutenant Commander [[Ellis M. Zacharias]], with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration.<ref name=bio/><ref name=reg1922>{{cite web

 | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/registercontaini1922unit/#page/38/mode/2up/search/Mashbir
 | accessdate = 24 October 2010
}}</ref>

In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get information out of Japan in time of war; it become known as [[M-Plan]] named after Mashbir.<ref name=z53>Zacharias, p. 53</ref> However his undisclosed activities working for the naval attach<U+00E9> did not sit well with his superiors.<ref name=z53/>

In order to establish a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his superior, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, in order to put the M-Plan in effect, under the impression felt that he could be reinstated when his work was done. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests under secret intelligence operations.<ref name=bio/> 

However the [[Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]] of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement, discovered that orders had already been cut to reinstate him, due to a reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned being no longer valid.<ref name=bio/> Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators.<ref>Mashbir, pp. 164-165</ref><ref name=bio/><ref name=z291>Zacharias, pp. 291-292</ref> He rejoined the [[Military Intelligence Division]] G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan.<ref name=bio/>

=== World War II ===

In 1937, Mashbir returned to Japan after an 11-year absence in a second attempt to launch the M-Plan on behalf of the Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, Naval attach<U+00E9> Zacharias.  This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attach<U+00E9>s in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir.  In a misunderstanding that would come so close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military attach<U+00E9> suspicions, a prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937.<ref name=bio/> 

Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was dis-enrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, it appeared that the actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure to communicate to uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged.<ref name=bio/> Mashbir<U+2019>s dismissal and the failure to implement an intelligence network such suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan is considered one of the main reasons why United States did not have more information on Japan before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.<ref name=bio/><ref>

Despite Mashbir's dismissal, the outbreak of hostilities in [[World War II]] led to him being immediately sought after by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] due to his military experience, wide technical skill and knowledge of the Japanese language. He was sworn in on active duty on 24 January 1942 and sent to [[Brisbane, Australia]], and later [[Manila, Philippines]] to co-ordinate the inter-service joint Australian/American [[Allied Translator and Interpreter Section]] (ATIS), for the [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA).<ref name=bio/> It was at this time that the suspicions which lingered about Mashbir<U+2019>s 1937 mission to Japan on behalf of Naval Intelligence were cleared up with Zacharias, now Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence, interceding with the Assistant Chief of Staff of G2.<ref name=bio/> 

The prompt accomplishments of the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir<U+2019>s executive ability resulted in Mashbir being promoted to full [[Colonel]] by [[General MacArthur]] after only one month. Mashbir then joined the forefront of General MacArthur<U+2019>s intelligence activities, Japanese surrender negotiations and remained the [[Commandant]] of ATIS until December 1945.<ref name=bio/><ref>

=== Post World War II ===

Mashbir left Japan on 8 December 1945 to serve on the management staff of the Adjutant General<U+2019>s office in Washington, later becoming the executive officer.<ref name=bio/>

== Later life ==

Mashbir retired in October 1951, having reached the statutory age of 60, and later published a 374-page memoir describing his military career in ''I Was an American Spy'' (New York: Vantage, 1953).<ref name=bio/> In Chapter 13, "The [[Nisei]]", whom Mashbir used as translators in ATIS, he pays tribute to Military Intelligence Service soldiers in these words: "The United States of America owes a debt to these men and to their families which it can never fully repay."<ref>{{cite web

Because of the highly classified and secret nature of ATIS missions, along with many of the [[Military Intelligence Service]] (MIS) soldiers, knowledge of Mashbir and his colleagues was largely missing during the war and even decades afterwards. The role and activities of the MIS was kept in secrecy for more than 30 years; the few records about MIS activities were finally made available to the public in 1972 under the Freedom of Information Act, however much still remains unknown today.<ref>{{cite web

They became "unsung heroes", unacknowledged for their contributions in wartime as well as postwar activities. An exception to this is the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]], of which Mashbir was inducted in 1988.<ref>{{cite web
