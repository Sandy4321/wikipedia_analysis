==Plot==
Nachiappan ([[Nassar]]) is a restaurateur in Los Angeles, USA. His twin sons Vishwanathan (Visu) and Ramamoorthy (Ramu) (both played by [[Prashanth Thyagarajan|Prashanth]]), are medical students, who help him out in the evenings and on weekends, alongside with the restaurant's chief cook, Juno ([[Senthil (actor)|Senthil]]). One evening, Vishwanathan goes to the airport to check on the family's supply concession and sees that some fellow Indians <U+2013> Madhumitha ([[Aishwarya Rai]]), her brother Madhesh ([[Raju Sundaram]]) and their grandmother Krishnaveny ([[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]]) <U+2013> have difficulty with an address. He pitches in to help and learns that they just flew in from India so that Krishnaveny can undergo a crucial surgery to remove her brain tumour.

The story shifts to the hospital where Vishwanathan, an intern, visits Krishnaveny's room after the operation, and notices she has been operated on the wrong side. Vishwanathan appeals aggressively to the doctors and has the error corrected by another surgery and then spearheads an angry fight for [[Damages|compensation]]. The hospital compensates $2 million avoid a messy court case.

When the grandmother realises that Vishwanathan and Madhumitha have fallen in love, she extends the family's stay in the United States and takes a liking to Vishwanathan's good nature. However, Nachiappan objects to the budding romance and wants his sons to marry identical twins because he himself has an identical twin brother, Pechiappan ([[Nassar]]). They both had married for love in their youth, but are now estranged because Pechiappan's wife Sundaramba ([[Raadhika Sarathkumar]]) showed such tyrannical behaviour towards Nachiappan's wife ([[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]]), that the latter died delivering the twin boys.

Krishnaveny tries to solve the problem by telling Nachiappan that Madhumitha has an identical twin, Vaishnavi. The story spun by Krishnaveny is that Vaishnavi has been brought up in an orthodox Brahmin household. At this point they ring in Madhumitha's alter ego, contrasting Madhumitha with a very demure, typically traditional Indian version. Ramamoorthy, falls for the act, unaware that Vaishnavi and Madhumitha are the same person. Meanwhile, Pechiappan arrives to a warm welcome by his brother, but later attempts suicide. Nachiappan then rescues him and comes to hear of his sad story and comes up with a plan. Accordingly, Nachiappan and his brother switch places. Nachiappan goes to his brother's wife and impersonate as his brother to reunite with her. He succeeds. Nachiappan's brother impersonated as Nachiappan. Ramamoorthy then meanwhile, figures out that Vaishnavi is Madhumitha and she was impersonating Vaishnavi. Vishwanathan in anger immediately leaves Madhumitha's household along with his family, but Ramamoorthy persuades his father who is not actually his father to have Madhumitha and Vishwanathan married. Though Ramamoorthy did not know it was not his father he talked about his father's brother who was right there impersonating. That made him guilty. He decided to have Vishwanathan married to Madhumitha. When Nachiappan figured out that Madhumitha doesn't have a twin,he goes and stops the wedding. There they figure out that the brothers impersonated each other as well to get along. Nachiappan's brother's wife persuades Nachiappan to have them married because Madhumitha did the same thing the brother's did. In the end, Visu and Madhu get married.

==Production==

===Development===
The entire production of the movie took about a year and a half to be completed and released. ''Jeans'', unlike the others, was his first film which was shot outside of India for major portions of the film. The producers of the film were [[Ashok Amritraj]], Michael Soloman and [[Murali Manohar]], whom all made their [[Tamil film]] debuts with ''Jeans'' respectively.<ref name="moneybudget"/> The film reunited Shankar with his award-winning technical crew from his previous film ''Indian'', whilst the cast was finalized by him after he had finalized the story. ''Genes'' was the title selected but Shankar felt it would not apply to the masses so he used the homonym, ''Jeans''.<ref name="amritraj">{{cite web|work=Indolink.com (S. Krishna)|title=A Chat with Ashok Amritraj|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/People/98/Feb/ashok.htm}}</ref>

The film's launch was held at the [[AVM Productions|AVM]] Studios in [[Vadapalani]], [[Chennai]] in December 1996. The ''Jeans'' invitation was printed, wrapped in Jeans cloth and was hand delivered by Shankar to his close colleagues and friends in Chennai, which included prominent actors in the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil filmdom]].<ref name="Jeansunlimited">{{cite web|work=Indolink.com (S.

===Casting===
The original actor considered for the dual roles of Vishwanathan and Ramamoorthy was [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], who rejected the project citing that his dates were booked for the full year of 1997. The second choice for the lead role, [[Ajith Kumar]], also opted out due to call sheet problems.<ref name="Jeansunlimited"/> The roles eventually went to [[Prashanth]] who sacrificed seven films in the process.<ref name="Jeansunlimited"/> Aishwarya Rai, a former [[Miss World]], was the original choice for the roles of Madhumitha and Vaishnavi.

Though between the time of the announcement and the finishing stages of the film, cinematographer Ashok Kumar was publicised as the official cinematographer for the film. In mid-1997, film organisation FEFSI striked and in the midst of this, the film's art director [[Thotta Tharani]], a FEFSI supporter, refused to sacrifice his position in FEFSI and stopped working in ''Jeans''.<ref name="Jeansunlimited"/> Without much choice, Shankar signed a newcomer Bala to take over the set design and art work for the film. The film's art direction is credited with both Thotta Tharani and Bala. Venki was signed up to deal with the special-effects in the film, with ''Jeans''. The film also was assisted in graphics effects created by Pentafour Company.<ref name="Jeansunlimited"/>

Shankar also filmed in [[New Jersey]] and New York at the [[World Trade Center]] when co-producer Michael Salomon and his wife, Luciana Balusia visited the sets of ''Jeans''.<ref name="moneybudget"/><ref name="Jeansunlimited"/> Shankar admitted that due to no real list being present, thought had been put into which wonders were selected.<ref name="Joke">{{cite web|work=[[Rediff]].com (Rajitha)|title=Wonder of wonders|url=http://www.indiaabroad.rediff.com/entertai/1998/apr/20sh.htm}}</ref> The team made a thirty day trip around the world stopping to can scenes at the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]], the [[Roman Colosseum]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/7E0D2A4A454A69DF65256940004B7BA2 |title=What makes baby-face Prasanth tick? <U+2013> The Indian Express |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=20 June 2004 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> During the shooting in Paris the death of [[Princess Diana]] had taken place and shooting was delayed in the France, due to her death.
