==Playing career==
===Calgary Flames===
The departure of [[Kari Eloranta]] prior to the [[1985<U+2013>86 NHL season]] created an opening on the Flames' defense.

The knee injury hampered Suter throughout much of the [[1986<U+2013>87 NHL season|1986<U+2013>87 season]]; he attempted to play through it, but ultimately missed 12 games.

His international career was marred by a trio of controversial incidents.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |page=836 |isbn=0-385-25999-9}}</ref> Suter was the target of international criticism following a vicious incident during the [[1987 Canada Cup]] in a game against the Soviet Union. Following a physical battle with [[Andrei Lomakin]], Suter was [[spearing (ice hockey)|speared]] in the neck by the Soviet player.  He retaliated with a "baseball swing" that broke his stick across Lomakin's face, causing a gash that required 20 stitches to close.  Suter was given a six-game suspension from international competition by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), while the NHL assessed a four-game ban of its own.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jacobs |first=Jeff |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qwshAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fXIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1144,1247711 |title=Gary Suter's assault on Soviet player draws international criticism |work=Schenectady Gazette |date=1987-10-05 |accessdate=2013-01-30 |page=25}}</ref>  Suter was again vilified in the [[1991 Canada Cup]] tournament after he knocked Canada's [[Wayne Gretzky]] out of the tournament with a check-from-behind in the first game of the best-of-three final.  Gretzky forgave Suter for the hit, noting that he was usually a clean player.  In the second game, he was responsible for two turnovers that led to goals, including what proved to be the championship-winning marker in a 4<U+2013>2 victory for Canada.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4aIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QCwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6809,969422 |title=Suter's longest night |work=Milwaukee Journal |date=1991-09-17 |accessdate=2013-01-30 |page=C2}}</ref> Suter was a member of the American team that won the inaugural [[World Cup of Hockey]] in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]].<ref name="SJMNRetire" />

The third incident occurred during an NHL game shortly before the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympic]] tournament while Suter was a member of the Chicago Blackhawks.  In a game against the [[Anaheim Ducks]], he [[cross-checking|cross-checked]] [[Paul Kariya]] in the head as the latter player celebrated a goal.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  The hit knocked Kariya, who was expected to represent Canada, out of the Olympic tournament. Suter was given a four-game suspension by the NHL that carried through the Olympic tournament.  However, the IIHF allowed him to play in a decision that incensed Canadian officials and resulted in Suter receiving a death threat from an angry Canadian fan.<ref>{{cite news |last=Powers |first=Tom |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3-AgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UGsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1342,1927682 |title=Suter draws ire of Canadians |work=Lewiston Sun Journal |date=1998-02-13 |accessdate=2013-01-30 |page=C4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sassone |first=Tim |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68970668.html |title=Suter receives death threat |work=Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, IL) |date=1998-04-16 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}{{subscription required}}</ref>  

At the age of 38 and in the final season of his playing career, Suter appeared in his second Olympics, playing in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 tournament]] at Salt Lake City.<ref name="SJMNRetire" /> He recorded one assist in six games for the silver-medal-winning American team.<ref name="SJMNRetire" /> The medal came 22 years after his brother Bob's gold in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pierce |first=Jesse |url=http://www.usahockeymagazine.com/article/2010-11/family-affair |title=A family affair |work=USA Hockey Magazine |date=2010<U+2013>11 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref>  In recognition of his career and achievements, Suter was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hildenbrand |first=Andrew |url=http://www.lakelandtimes.com/main.asp?SectionID=12&SubSectionID=12&ArticleID=13714 |title=Suter elected to U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame |work=Lakeland Times |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

Suter returned to Wisconsin following his playing career, settling in the rural community of [[Minocqua, Wisconsin|Minocqua]] where he and his wife Cathy raised their family.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  They have two sons, Jake and Jared,<ref name="SuterSpeech">{{cite news |url=http://www.lakelandtimes.com/main.asp?SubSectionID=12&ArticleID=14325&SectionID=12 |title=Suter's induction speaks volumes about what hockey is |work=Lakeland Times |date=2011-12-14 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref> both of whom also play hockey.
