'''Gary Moore''' (born Robert William Gary Moore, [[4 April]] [[1952]], in  [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]) is a [[guitarist]]. In a career dating back to the [[1960s]] he has played with bands/artists including [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Colosseum II]], [[Greg Lake]] and [[blues-rock]] band [[Skid Row (blues-rock band)|Skid Row]] as well as having a successful solo career.

Moore started [[performing]] at a young age, having picked up a battered [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] at the age of eight, and got his first quality guitar at the age of fourteen, learning to play the right-handed instrument in the standard way despite being left handed. His career has lasted over thirty years.

==Connection with Peter Green==
According to numerous interviews he has given to guitar magazines, he was the protege of [[British blues]] pioneer [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], whom he had always admired ever since the [[Bluesbreakers]] days. When [[Peter Green (musician)|Green]] quit [[Fleetwood Mac]] and the entire music scene, he sold his famous nasal-sounding [[1959]] [[Gibson Les Paul]] to Moore, for the same price that Moore had managed to sell his then guitar (a [[Gibson SG]]). The nasal sound of the neck pick-up on Green's guitar was not, as used to be believed, the result of the pickup having been turned backwards, but instead its two coils had been <U+2014> perhaps accidentally <U+2014> reconnected in parallel and out of phase, as per the "in between" positions of a [[Fender Stratocaster]].[Others, such as the late British guitar maker Sid Poole & Hamer Guitars, believe the pick-up's permanent magnet was reversed*]. Moore has used this guitar in the recordings of some songs of his albums ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', ''[[After Hours]]'' and ''[[Blues For Greeny]]''. Peter Green and Moore also reportedly had a disagreement regarding what guitar the former was playing in the song "Albatross". Moore insists it was the [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]], because the guitar tone was particularly warm and rich in the bass, while [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] maintains he was using a [[Stratocaster|Strat]], as the vibrato in that song was not finger vibrato, but subtle tremolo arm vibrato. Nevertheless, up to this day, Green and Moore remain good friends.

"JD: You'd put it in the middle-position and there it was ! So, I said to Gary, "Let's take this apart and let's see what the deal is." What I actually found was that the neck pickup magnet had been reversed, and sure enough, that's what it was! It was wired out-of-phase by the magnet being turned around, not by the leads at the pot reversed-wired. I can't say whether it was done by a repairman or done at the factory originally, who knows?"* <U+2014> actually Peter Green is on record as having done it accidentally himself.

==Guitars used==
Over the years Gary has used numerous guitars.
These include:
Peter Green's [[1959]] [[Gibson Les Paul]], Peter Green's [[1961]] [[Fender Stratocaster]], and the [[1950s]] Gibson Les Paul Junior. He has also used guitars from [[Charvel]], [[Ibanez]], [[Hamer Guitars|Hamer]], [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], [[Heritage Guitars|Heritage]] and [[PRS Guitars|Paul Reed Smith]]. Amplification has generally come from [[Marshall Amplifiers|Marshall]], although [[Soldano]]s and [[Fender]] have also been used, as well as transistor-driven Dean Markley units (especially in the studio). He also has used numerous effects over the years. These include; Delay units such as the Echoplex, Overdrive/Booster units such as the [[BOSS DS-1]], Ibanez Tubescreamer variants, Marshall [[Marshall ShredMaster|Shredmaster]], Bluesbreaker and Guv'nor pedals as well as [[wah-wah]] pedals such as the Vox Wah. He appears nowadays to favour [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] and Fender guitars, through Marshall amplifiers. His choices in effects have remained constant, with the exception of the Echoplex which has been replaced by a [[T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex]] Replica<ref>See [http://t-rex-engineering.com/default.asp?show=page&id=2582 newsitem] on T-Rex's official website.</ref>.

Gary Moore's contribution to music and blues in particular have been recognised in recent years by prestigous commercial endorsements.  In 2004-2006 Gary featured in full page advertisements for Marshall's range of reissued classic handwired amplifiers, including classic amplifiers from the 1960s and 1970s, such as the popularly named, "Bluesbreaker combo" <U+2014> originally made famous by Eric Clapton.  Gary was also one of the first artists recognised by Gibson Guitars with a signature model.  The Gary Moore Les Paul is not a reproduction of an existing model but a new model, with distinctive lemon sunbust maple cap, the neck is unbound (unusual for a Les Paul but easier to refret & play) as is the body, a "Gary Moore" name plate on the truss rod cover and some early model Gibson Burstbucker pick-ups, one with zebra-coils (one black & one white bobbin).

==Skid Row==
In [[1970]] he formed the group [[Skid Row (blues-rock band)|Skid Row]] with [[Noel Bridgeman]] and [[Brush Shiels|Brendan "Brush" Shiels]]. The music was eclectic, covering a wide range including [[jazz music|jazz]], rock and blues.
It was with this group that he earned himself a reputation in the music business, and his association with [[Philip Lynott]] began.

'''Albums'''
*''[[Skid Row (blues-rock album)|Skid Row]]'' ([[1970]])
*''[[34 Hours]]'' ([[1971]])

==Solo career==
In [[1973]] he released his first solo album ''[[Grinding Stone]]'' billed as the Gary Moore Band. 
In [[1979]] his solo career started again with help from Phil Lynott. The combination of Moore's blues based guitar,  and Lynott's voice, produced "[[Parisienne Walkways (single)|Parisienne Walkways]]", which reached the [[Top 10 list|Top Ten]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April [[1979 in music|1979]]; and the [[Thin Lizzy]] number 2 hit [[record album|album]], ''[[Black Rose: A Rock Legend]]''.

After a series of powerful rock records Gary returned to blues music with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', with contributions from [[B. B. King]], [[Albert King]] and [[Albert Collins]]. The album was well received by fans and a huge success.
Gary stayed with the blues format until 1997 when he decided to experiment with modern dance beats on ''[[Dark Days in Paradise]]''; this left many fans, as well as the music press confused.
''[[Back to the Blues]]'', unsurprisingly, saw Gary return to his tried and tested blues format.
