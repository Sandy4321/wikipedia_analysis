'''Cuddlr''' is a social-meeting application where strangers who live within walking distance from each other can meet up for casual, platonic [[cuddling]]. Users can send nearby prospective cuddle partners an invitation to cuddle, which the fellow users can either choose to accept or decline within 15 minutes. The application provides real-time walking directions to cuddle partners, allowing them to meet up, either in a private or public setting.  Unlike [[Tinder (application)|Tinder]], the age and gender of all users are omitted. This incites them to reach out to people to whom they are not necessarily sexually attracted. Additionally, users are rated by previous cuddle partners according to their cuddling techniques and spooning preferences, their communication skills and their ability to respect boundaries. These ratings, which act as a safety measure, are then made available to all Cuddlr users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/18/tinder_for_cuddling_this_app_will_find_you_a_random_stranger_to_spoon/|title=Tinder for cuddling: This app will find you a random stranger to spoon|author=|date=|work=salon.com|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>
