'''Astronomical chronology''', or '''astronomical dating''', is a technical method of dating events or artifacts that are associated with astronomical phenomena.  Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the [[Ancient Near East]]; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations.  

== Dating historical events ==

In the cases of unique astronomical events like eclipses, since eclipses are relatively infrequent events, they can be dated to the exact date.  When the circumstances are not exact and there are several possible eclipses, one can often use other details such as the month of the eclipse or the position of other stars and planets to identify the specific eclipse.<ref>[[F. R. Stephenson]] and J. M. Steele, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JHA....37...55S "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69.</ref> 

Babylonian [[Babylonian astronomy#Neo-Babylonian astronomy|astronomical diaries]], by providing accounts of the positions of all the visible planets, often in relation to specific stars, have been used to provide precise dates of events like the defeat of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] on 1 October 331 BCE and of Alexander's subsequent death on 11 June 323.<ref>[[Jona Lendering]], [http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries "Astronomical Diaries"]</ref>

The success of this method depends on the reliability of the written sources and the precision of their accounts of astronomical phenomena.  Attempts to date literary texts astronomically, which may use astronomical events as metaphors often lead researchers to conclusions which are not widely accepted.  Thus the attempts to date Vedic texts describing the Pleiades as rising "due East" to about 2300 BCE, which is the time when the Pleiades are "exactly" due East is complicated by the fact that poetic descriptions need not be taken as reflecting precise astronomical observations while precession is a very slow process, which makes only small changes in the azimuth of a star rising in the East.<ref>Michael Witzel, "The Pleiades and the Bears viewed from inside the Vedic texts," [http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt ''Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies''], 5 (1999), issue 2</ref>

== Dating Artifacts ==

Among the artifacts that can most readily be dated by astronomical techniques are depictions of the positions of the [[celestial bodies]] at a particular time.  Since the motions of the celestial bodies are all at different periods, it takes many centuries for all the planets plus the Sun and the Moon, to reach the same positions in the signs of the [[Zodiac]].  For a configuration accurate to <U+00B1>15<U+00B0> (that is, within a single [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|sign]]) the positions of these seven bodies will only return to the same configuration once in about 3700 years.  A particular case involved a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] which portrayed the position of these seven celestial bodies on 18 March 816; corresponding to the period when the manuscript was written. This calculation demonstrated that this illustration was not a copy of an earlier classical depiction of the position of the stars.<ref>Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the [[Leiden Aratea]] planetarium", ''Quaerendo'', 20 (1999): 248-261; see esp. <U+00A7> 6. Reliability of the Dating Method, p. 258.</ref>

A striking example of this method was an astrological portrait of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (1540-1591), which depicted the positions of the seven classical planets in the zodiac and noted the computed positions of the planets to the nearest minute of arc.  Here the largest source of error in the date was the uncertain accuracy of 16th-century astronomical calculations.  The resulting time was about noon of 12 December 1581.<ref>Arthur Beer, "Astronomical dating of works of art", ''Vistas in Astronomy'', 9 (1967): 177-223.</ref>

== Dating structures by their orientation ==

An older, but  more controversial, [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] approach has been used to date structures that are believed to have been oriented on astronomical principles by measuring their orientation and computing the date in the past when a single specified celestial body, whether the Sun or a selected star, rises or sets at the measured azimuth.  The astronomer, [[Norman Lockyer]], applied this method to [[Stonehenge]]<ref>Norman Lockyer and  F. C. Penrose, "An Attempt to Ascertain the Date of the Original Construction of Stonehenge from Its Orientation", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', 69. (1901 - 1902): 137-147.</ref> by measuring the orientation of the Stonehenge avenue and comparing it to the position of solstitial sunrise, which changes slowly due to the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]].  The archaeologist, F. C. Penrose, applied a similar method to ancient Greek Temples, attempting to establish their dates by relating their orientation to the appearance of stars on the horizon, the position of which changes slowly due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].<ref>F. C. Penrose, "On the Results of an Examination of the Orientations of a Number of Greek Temples with a View to Connect these Angles with the Amplitudes of Certain Stars at the Time the Temples were Founded, and an Endeavour to Derive therefrom the Dates of their Foundation by Consideration of the Changes Produced upon the Right Ascension and Declination of the Stars by the Precession of the Equinoxes", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', A, 184 (1893): 805-834.</ref>

The wide variance or these dates from historically accepted ones led the architect and archaeologist, [[William Bell Dinsmoor]], to mistrust dates established by the slowly changing obliquity of the ecliptic or by stellar alignments, which involve an arbitrary selection of a star that rises on the proper azimuth.  Instead he proposed a method employing what was already known from historical records concerning the dates of construction of Greek temples, the festivals associated with specific temples, and the nature of the Greek [[Lunisolar calendar]].  Since the date of a festival in the Greek lunisolar calendar only recurs on the same date in the solar calendar every eight or nineteen years, Dinsmoor identified a festival connected with a specific temple and was able to determine the exact year near the historically recorded construction date when the Sun rose in alignment with the temple.<ref>William Bell Dinsmoor, "Arch<U+00E6>ology and Astronomy", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 10 (1939): 95-173.</ref>
