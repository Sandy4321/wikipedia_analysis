'''Bosa''' (died ''[[circa|c.]]'' 705) was an Anglo-Saxon [[Bishop of York]] during the 7th and early 8th centuries. He was educated at [[Whitby Abbey]], where he became a monk. Following [[Wilfrid]]'s removal from York in 678 the [[diocese]] was divided into three, leaving a greatly reduced [[Episcopal see|see]] of York, to which Bosa was appointed bishop. He was himself removed in 687 and replaced by Wilfrid, but in 691 Wilfrid was once more ejected and Bosa returned to the see. He died in about 705, and subsequently appears as a saint in an 8th-century liturgical calendar.

==Life==

Bosa was a [[Northumbria]]n, educated at Whitby Abbey under the abbess [[Hilda of Whitby|Hilda]].<ref name=DNB>Thacker "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2926 Bosa (St Bosa) (died  706)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' {{ODNBsub}}</ref> He subsequently joined the monastery as a monk,<ref name=ASE135>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' pp. 135<U+2013>136</ref> and became one of five men educated at Whitby who went on to become bishops.<ref name=World148>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 148</ref>{{efn|The other four were [[Oftfor]], [[<U+00C6>tla]], [[John of Beverley]], and [[Wilfrid II (bishop of York)|Wilfrid II]].<ref name=World148/>}}

In 678, after [[Wilfrid]] was removed from the bishopric of York and banished from Northumbria,<ref name=DNB/> the diocese of York was divided into three.<ref name=Brooks75/> Bosa was appointed to the now greatly reduced diocese of York,<ref name=DNB/> which included the sub-kingdom of [[Deira]],<ref name=ASE135/> thanks to the support of King [[Ecgfrith]] of Northumbria and [[Theodore of Tarsus]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|Theodore initially split the diocese into two bishoprics; the newly created Bernicia was given to [[Eata of Hexham|Eata]], while Bosa became bishop of the greatly reduced diocese of York. Bernicia had two episcopal sees, one at [[Hexham]] and the other at [[Lindisfarne]]. Eata was bishop of the whole of Bernicia for three years, after which Bernicia was itself divided: the see of Hexham was assigned to [[Trumbert]], and Lindisfarne to Eata.<ref name=ASE135/>}} Bosa was consecrated in his cathedral at York in 678 by Theodore,<ref name=ASE135/><ref name=Brooks75>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> but Wilfrid declared that he was unable to work with Bosa because he did not consider him to be a member of the Catholic Church.<ref name=Kirby91>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 91</ref> Bosa's episcopate lasted nine years, but with Wilfrid back in favour, in 687 Bosa was removed just as his predecessor had been.<ref name=DNB/> He returned to York in 691,<ref name=Handbook224>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 224</ref> after Wilfrid was once again expelled.<ref name=DNB/> While bishop, Bosa introduced a communal life for the clergy of the cathedral, and set up a continuous liturgy in the cathedral.<ref name=ASE135/>
