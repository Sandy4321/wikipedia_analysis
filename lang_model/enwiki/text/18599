The '''Boston Lobsters''' were a charter franchise of [[World TeamTennis|World Team Tennis]] (WTT) founded by Dick and Ken Butera as the '''Philadelphia Freedoms'''. The [[Philadelphia Freedoms (1974)|Freedoms]] played only one season in [[Philadelphia]] before being sold on March 27, 1975, moving to [[Boston]] and changing their name to the Lobsters.<ref name=lobsterfun>{{cite web|url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/tag/boslob74-78|title=1974-1978 Boston Lobsters|work=Andy Crossley|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref> Following the 1978 season, Lobsters owner [[Robert Kraft]] announced that the franchise would fold.<ref name=fold>{{cite journal|last=Kirshenbaum|first=Jerry|title=A Question of Resolve|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=November 6, 1978}}</ref>

==Team history==

===Inaugural season===
[[File:PhiladelphiaFreedomsWTT1974logo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Philadelphia Freedoms (1974)|Philadelphia Freedoms]] logo used in 1974.]]
The [[Philadelphia Freedoms (1974)|Philadelphia Freedoms]] were founded by Dick and Ken Butera as a charter member of WTT in 1973.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tennis League Formed|newspaper=[[Odessa American]]|page=12|date=May 23, 1973}}</ref> The team began play in WTT's inaugural [[1974 World Team Tennis season|1974 season]]. The Freedoms played their home matches at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]]. The centerpiece of the team was tennis legend [[Billie Jean King]] who served as its player-coach.<ref name=king>{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Susan |year=2011 |chapter=3. Billie Jean King, Inc. |title=Game, Set, Match: Billie Jean King and the Revolution in Women's Sports |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_YWq1qr28AC |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |page=101 |asin=0807834548 |isbn=978-0-8078-3454-1 |lccn=2010032662 |accessdate=August 11, 2014 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> King became the first woman to coach a professional sports team that included male players.

Once King was signed on with the Freedoms, her good friend [[Elton John]] decided to write and record the song "[[Philadelphia Freedom (song)|Philadelphia Freedom]]" to wish her luck on her new venture with WTT and for the team to use as an anthem.<ref name=king /> John was such a big fan of the Freedoms that he attended home matches wearing the team's uniform and sat on the bench with the players.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philadelphia Freedom: The Story behind the Song|last1=King|first1=Billie Jean|last2=Jett|first2=Tyler|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-20/sports/32747948_1_elton-john-america-bench|accessdate=August 30, 2014|website=Philly.com|publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]|date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> Although recorded in the summer of 1974, the song was not released until February 24, 1975, after the Freedoms had already played their final match in [[Philadelphia]].

King's performance on the court earned her the WTT Most Valuable Player Award as she led the Freedoms to 39 wins and 5 losses, first place in the Atlantic Section and the best regular-season record in WTT.<ref name=fb>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WorldTeamTennis/info|title=World Team Tennis Life Events|work=[[World TeamTennis]]|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=extinct>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/Arena/6925/wtt.html|title=Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues: World Team Tennis (1974<U+2013>1978)|work=Steve Dimitry|date=1998|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref>

WTT playoff series in the division semifinals and division championship series in 1974, were played over two legs, one match on the home court of each team. The team with the best aggregate score over the two matches was the winner. As the higher seed, the Freedoms had the choice to play either the first or the second match at home. The Freedoms met the [[Cleveland Nets]] in the Eastern Division Semifinals and won both matches, 26<U+2013>22 in [[Cleveland]] and 23<U+2013>22 at home. The Freedoms clinched the series when [[Fred Stolle]] playing mixed doubles in the fifth set served an ace on match point in the second match.<ref>{{cite news|title=WTT Roundup|newspaper=[[Hattiesburg American]]|page=14|date=August 21, 1974}}</ref>

The victory over the Nets advanced the Freedoms to the Eastern Division Championship Series against the [[Pittsburgh Triangles]]. Again, the Freedoms chose to open on the road and won the first match, 31<U+2013>21, in [[Pittsburgh]] and then lost the second, 24<U+2013>21, at home. By an aggregate score of 52<U+2013>45, the Freedoms won the Eastern Division Championship and advanced to the WTT Finals.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct />

In the WTT Finals, the Freedoms met the [[Denver Racquets]]. The Racquets swept the best-of-three series, winning 27<U+2013>21 in [[Denver]] and 28<U+2013>24 in Philadelphia, to win the title and end the Freedoms' season.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct />

At the 1974 WTT draft, player-coach King made the selections for the Freedoms. In the seventh round, she chose [[Bobby Riggs]], against whom she had won the [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] 14 months earlier. In announcing the selection, King said, "We haven't made up our mind in which division we'll play him."<ref>{{cite news|title=Billie Jean Drafts Bobby Riggs|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&dat=19741127&id=_4EzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cTgHAAAAIBAJ&pg=2347,4342440|newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=August 30, 2014|page=18|date=November 27, 1974}}</ref> The following day, Riggs was quoted as saying, "It sounds like a great idea, but is the money right?" He added that he didn't know how King "plans to use me<U+2014>as a mixed doubles partner or as a ladies' doubles partner."<ref>{{cite news|title=Riggs Likes WTT|newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]|page=61|date=November 28, 1974}}</ref>

Following the 1974 season, WTT owners were looking to develop a plan for growth of the league. Many were of the opinion that it would be in all their interests to have a successful franchise in [[New York City|New York]]. With some encouragement from his fellow owners, Dick Butera traded King to the [[New York Sets]] in a complicated deal. Upon announcing the trade, Butera said, "It not an easy thing to let Billie Jean go. I feel like [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] giving away his oil wells."<ref name=king />

After King was traded, a group of investors that included Bob Mades, a [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] [[meat packing industry|meat-packing]] executive who lived in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], Paul Slater, a [[Newton, Massachusetts]] [[real estate broker|realtor]], Herbert S. Hoffman, a Boston [[jeans]] [[distribution (business)|distributor]] who had been a part owner of the recently contracted [[Toronto-Buffalo Royals|Hartford Royals]], [[Robert Kraft|Robert K. Kraft]], a [[forest product]]s company executive, and Harold Bayne, a Boston meat-packing executive, expressed interest in buying the [[Boston Lobsters (1974)|original Boston Lobsters]]. However, the Lobsters had already been contracted by WTT. With the Buteras far less enthusiastic about their team after trading King, the two sides struck a deal, and the group purchased the Freedoms on March 27, 1975, and moved the team to Boston. In order to claim the name of the original Lobsters, the new ownership group would be required to settle some of the debts of the former team. The new owners decided to do this and renamed the team the Boston Lobsters.<ref name=lobsterfun /><ref name=phibos>{{cite news|title=New Boston Net Team Obtains Six Backers|newspaper=[[Berkshire Eagle]]|page=18|date=March 28, 1975}}</ref>

Mades was named president of the team, and Slater was named chairman of the board.<ref name=phibos />

===First season in Boston===
In 1975, the reincarnated Lobsters presented themselves as a continuation of the original Lobsters that folded after the 1974 season in promotional materials and media guides, since they had paid for that privilege.<ref name=phibos /> The team ignored any connection with its actual history as the Freedoms. The Lobsters also adopted the team logo of the original Lobsters.<ref name=78bosmg>{{cite web|url=https://app.box.com/s/lfqrpho2xh0scaherpp2|title=1978 Boston Lobsters Media Guide|work=Boston Lobsters|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}</ref>

The Lobsters played a 46-match WTT regular-season schedule in 1975. They had 15 home matches, 15 road matches and 16 neutral-site matches. The league used neutral-site matches to cut down on travel and create events where fans could see multiple teams either with one admission or over the course of a few days. These special events were called WTT Spectaculars.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Vince|title=World Team Tennis Puts House in Order|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19750728&id=aSwNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WG0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7386,105598|accessdate=August 22, 2014|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|page=22|date=July 28, 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jares|first1=Joe|title=Patching a Tattered Image: A Crazy-Quilt Court Will Add Even More Color, and "Spectaculars" May Cut Costs as World Team Tennis Revs Up and Moves into Its Second Season|url=http://www.si.com/vault/1975/05/12/617006/patching-a-tattered-image|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 12, 1975|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}</ref> Because of these and because of scheduling challenges created when the [[Houston E-Z Riders]] suspended operations just days before the season started,<ref>{{cite news|title=Riders Withdraw for <U+2019>75|newspaper=[[San Antonio Express]]|page=32|date=May 3, 1975}}</ref> the 10 teams in the league did not play an equal number of matches. Seven of them played 44 matches, while the Lobsters, [[Hawaii Leis]] and [[San Diego Friars]] each played 46 matches. Of the Lobsters' 15 home matches, 11 were played at the [[Walter Brown Arena]] in Boston, three were played at the [[Providence Civic Center]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and one was played at the brand-new [[Hartford Civic Center]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name=78bosmg />

When the Lobsters played their 1975 home opener in Boston on May 22, against the New York Sets, they were already 0<U+2013>7, having lost three road matches and four neutral-site matches. The Lobsters were dominated, 25<U+2013>12, by the Sets who were led by Billie Jean King (whom the franchise had traded to the Sets a few months before) and fell to 0<U+2013>8. The season opener drew 2,191 fans to the Walter Brown Arena. The following day, the Lobsters played two home matches in Providence. They won the first, 27<U+2013>17, against the [[Indiana Loves]] and lost the second, 27<U+2013>21, to the Sets as WTT made its debut in Providence in front of 4,317 fans, the largest home crowd the Lobsters would draw all season. The Lobsters continued to struggle and lost their final three matches before WTT took a break for [[1975 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] to fall to 6<U+2013>18.<ref name=78bosmg />

The Lobsters won their first match after the Wimbledon break, 29<U+2013>25, over the [[Los Angeles Strings]], their first win in Boston all season. A neutral-site loss in [[Los Angeles]] to the Cleveland Nets on July 14, dropped the Lobsters' record to 7<U+2013>21. However, after that match, the Lobsters won four straight, seven of their next eight, and nine of their next 11 matches to improve their record to 16<U+2013>23. A 28<U+2013>23 victory over the Leis in Hartford in front of 2,492 fans improved the Lobsters' record to 17<U+2013>24. The Lobsters followed that victory with three more wins in their next four matches which clinched them a playoff berth. The Lobsters finished the regular season with 20 wins and 26 losses, third in the Eastern Division.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct /><ref name=78bosmg />

[[Greer Stevens]] was a key to the Lobsters' late-season success leading them to the playoffs. She was named WTT Female Rookie of the Year, and she also won the Female All-Star Match Most Valuable Player Award.<ref name=extinct />

The Lobsters met the New York Sets on the road in the Eastern Division Semifinal Match. The Lobsters had lost all six of their regular-season matches with the Sets. However, the Lobsters squeezed out an upset victory in a tightly-played match, 25<U+2013>24, to advance to the Eastern Division Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Triangles.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct /><ref name=78bosmg />

The Lobsters hosted the first match of the Eastern Division Championship Series in front of only 912 fans in Boston and lost, 25<U+2013>16. The Triangles took the second match in [[Pittsburgh]], 23<U+2013>14, to end the Lobsters' season.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct /><ref name=78bosmg />

===A last-place finish===
All WTT teams returned to a 44-match regular season schedule in 1976, with 22 home and 22 road matches. The Lobsters played 18 of their home matches at the Walter Brown Arena and four at the Hartford Civic Center. The Lobsters' August 9 road match against the New York Sets was cancelled due to [[Hurricane Belle]] and not made up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://app.box.com/s/locn0rotm5zteptpp69q|title=1978 New York Apples Media Guide|work=New York Apples|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}</ref> The Lobsters started the 1976 season with three straight losses but rebounded and stood at 5<U+2013>5 after 10 matches. From there, the Lobsters lost 11 of their next 15 matches and fell to 9<U+2013>16. They had 9 wins and 9 losses in their final 18 matches, but it wasn't enough to avoid a last-place finish in the Eastern Division with 18 wins and 25 losses.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct />

===Changes lead to success===
The Lobsters acquired 20-year-old [[Martina Navratilova]] in a trade with the [[Cleveland-Pittsburgh Nets]] for [[Wendy Turnbull]] prior to the 1977 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=He's Trojan 'Block-Buster'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19770504&id=WWEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nl0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6426,3509362|accessdate=August 14, 2014|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|page=6C|date=May 4, 1977}}</ref> They also added [[Roy Emerson]] as a player-coach.<ref name=lobsterfun /> Navratilova led WTT in game-winning percentage in women's singles and won 32 of the 39 sets she played. She also teamed with Greer Stevens to lead WTT in game-winning percentage in women's doubles. The Lobsters' [[Tony Roche]] was third in game-winning percentage in men's singles.<ref name=extinct />

The Lobsters played 16 of their 22 home matches in 1977 at the Walter Brown Arena and the other six at the Hartford Civic Center. They raced out of the blocks starting 3<U+2013>0 and extending their record to 8<U+2013>1, 14<U+2013>2, and 17<U+2013>3 after 20 matches. The Lobsters played in front of four sellout crowd of 4,103 at the Walter Brown Arena. They finished the regular season first in the Eastern Division with 35 wins and 9 losses.<ref name=78bosmg />

The Lobsters met the Cleveland-Pittsburgh Nets in the Eastern Division Semifinals. The Lobsters won the first match in Boston, 30<U+2013>26. However, the Nets took the second match in [[Cleveland]], 21<U+2013>20, to force a deciding third match in Boston. The Lobsters won the third match, 28<U+2013>21, to advance to the Eastern Division Championship Series against the defending WTT Champion [[New York Apples]].<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct /><ref name=78bosmg />

Having played the previous three consecutive days, the Lobsters opened their series with the Apples in Boston with a 29<U+2013>21 loss. Two days later, the Lobsters fell again to the Apples in New York, 29<U+2013>26, and saw their season come to an end.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct /><ref name=78bosmg />

===A division championship in the team's final season===
In 1978, the Lobsters again played 16 of their 22 home matches at the Walter Brown Arena. Four home matches were played at [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Charpentier|first=Russ|title=The Games We Played|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110830/SPECIAL38/110839953&cid=sitesearch|accessdate=August 12, 2014|newspaper=[[Cape Cod Times]]|date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> One home match was played at the Providence Civic Center, and the other was played at the George F. Kneller Athletic Center on the campus of [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Five of the Lobsters' matches were televised locally on [[WSBK-TV|WSBK-TV Channel 38]].<ref name=78bosmg />

Martina Navratilova was named WTT Female Most Valuable Player and led the Lobsters to the Eastern Division Championship with 33 wins and 11 losses, the best regular-season record in the league. It was the team's second consecutive first-place finish. The Lobsters defeated the [[New Orleans Nets]] in the WTT Quarterfinals and the [[Seattle Cascades]] in the WTT Semifinals setting up a best-of-five WTT Finals against the Los Angeles Strings.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct />

The Strings took the first two matches of the finals, 24<U+2013>21 and 30<U+2013>20, before the Lobsters won the third match, 27<U+2013>26. In the tightly-contested fourth match, [[Ilie N<U+0103>stase]] and [[Chris Evert]] of the Strings both won sets in tiebreakers against Tony Roche and Navratilova in men's and women's singles, respectively, and the Strings went on to a 28<U+2013>25 victory to win the WTT Championship.<ref name=fb /><ref name=extinct />

On October 27, 1978, Robert Kraft announced that the Lobsters were folding.<ref name=fold /> The WTT suspended operations in March 1979, and no 1979 season was played.
