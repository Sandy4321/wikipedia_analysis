'''Infidels''' were a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[funk]]-[[rock music|rock]] band in the [[1990s]].

The band formed in [[1990]] when [[Molly Johnson]] reunited with [[Norman Orenstein]], her partner in the short-lived [[1980s]] band [[Alta Moda]]. They added Washington Savage, Jeff Jones and Owen Tennyson to the lineup, and released a self-titled album in [[1991]] on [[IRS Records]].

Although the band's sound was not significantly different than that of Alta Moda, who had suffered from sounding "too [[Black Canadian|black]]" for Canadian radio, Canadian rappers such as [[Maestro (rapper)|Maestro Fresh Wes]] and black rock bands such as [[Living Colour]] had subsequently proven that Canadian radio could support black musicians, and so the Infidels benefitted from better timing. The album spawned two hit singles, the rock radio hit "100 Watt Bulb" and the pop smash "Celebrate". 

Following the album's tour, the band took a break as Johnson established the [[Kumbaya Festival]]. 

They turned in another album in [[1995]], but were faced with label difficulties. The label wanted them to change their name, due to the existence of an American band with the same name, but Johnson and Orenstein resisted since they were already too well-associated with that name in Canada. As well, the label was going through financial difficulties at the time.

As a result, Johnson decided to dissolve the band, and the 1995 album has never been released.

Johnson has since returned to her prior career as a [[jazz]] singer.
