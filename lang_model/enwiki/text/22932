'''Yohannes IV''' ({{lang-gez|<U+12EE><U+1210><U+1295><U+1235> <U+136C><U+129B> ''Y<U+014D><U+1E25><U+0101>nnis'' <U+12EE><U+1213><U+1295><U+1235>}}, {{lang-am|Y<U+014D><U+1E25><U+0101>nnis}}, also known by the English equivalent "John", 11 July 1837&nbsp;<U+2013> 10 March 1889<ref>http://rulers.org/indexy.html#yohan rulers.org</ref>), born '''Lij Kassay Mercha''' Ge'ez, was [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1872 until his death.

==Early life==

Yohannes IV was born at Mai-biha a village then with in the jurisdiction of [[Enderta Province|Enderta]] province.  He was the son of Mercha, ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Important regional offices|Shum]]'' (or "governor") of [[Tembien Province|Tembien]], and his wife ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Woizero]]'' (or "Dame") Silass Dimtsu (Amata Selassie),  who was the daughter of ''[[Dejazmach]]'' (roughly equivalent to "[[Duke]]") Dimtsu Debbab of [[Enderta province|Enderta]] the nephew of the powerful ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Wolde Selassie]] of Enderta.  Yohannes could claim [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic blood]] through the line of his paternal grandmother ''Woizero'' Workewoha KaleKristoss of Adwa, who was the granddaughter of ''Ras'' [[Mikael Sehul]], and his wife [[Aster Iyasu]], daughter of Empress [[Mentewab]] and her lover Melmal Iyasu.

Yohannes could also claim Solomonic descent more distantly through his father's Tembien family, also through a female link to the dynasty. Amata Selassie's father Dimtsu of Endarta belonged to the family which in late 18th and early 19th centuries had held overlordship of Tigray, and her mother descended from the aristocratic line of the ''Shums'' of [[Agame]].

==Rise to power==
He controlled the province of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], and he became one of the three most powerful princes in Ethiopia (the others being [[Wagshum Gobeze]] of Lasta and Wag (the future Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II), as well as King (''[[Negus]]'') Menelek of [[Shewa]] the future Emperor [[Menelek II]]). All three vied to become sole ruler, and also claimed descent from the Solomonic kings. ''Dejazmach'' Kassai's rivalry with the Wagshum was further complicated by the fact that his sister, [[Dinqinesh Mercha]], was married to Wagshum Gobeze. Only five years earlier, Wagshum Gobeze had played the decisive military role in ensuring that ''Dejazmach'' Kassai defeated his rivals as the pre-eminent figure in Tigray. Their new rivalry was therefore awkward for both of them on a personal level.
<!-- [[Image:Yohannes IV Emperor of Ethiopia in the 19th century.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A European sketch of Yohannes IV]] -->

In 1868, [[Tekle Giyorgis II|Wagshum Gobeze]] proclaimed himself Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia at [[Soqota]] in his district of [[Wag]]. Because the ''[[Abuna]]'' of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] had died shortly before, there was no one to crown the new Emperor. In an effort to get Kassai to recognize this title, Tekle Giyorgis gave his brother-in-law the title of "Re-ese Mekwanint", or "first among the nobles". ''Dejazmach'' Kassai promptly started using the title, but still did not recognize Tekle Giyorgis' claim to the throne and refused to pay homage to him.

Tekle Giyorgis, after consolidating support with [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Adal of Gojjam]] and King Menelik of Shewa through marriage ties, and in Wollo by force, crossed the [[Takazze River]] into Tigray in 1871 in a campaign against Kassai.''Dejazmach'' Kassai met the Emperor near [[Adwa]] on 11 July 1871, capturing and deposing him. Emperor Tekle Giyorgis died in captivity the next year. Following Tekle Giyorgis' death, his widow, Empress Dinkinesh Mercha, settled in Mekele at the court of her brother the new Emperor Yohannes IV, and continued to be accorded the title and dignity of an Empress throughout his reign.

Kassai had long prepared for this day, and had gathered the funds to pay the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria|Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria]] to appoint a new Archbishop over the [[Ethiopian Church]], to replace [[Abuna Salama III|Abuna Salama]] who had died in 1867. Patriarch [[Pope Cyril V of Alexandria|Cyril V]]  sent him [[Abuna Atnatewos II|Abuna Atnatewos]], who arrived June 1869.<ref>Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 146</ref>

The exact date of his crowning is not very clear and there are three different dates given by scholars, 12 February, 12 January, and 28 January 1872, in addition, in one of the Emperor's letters to the queen of England, he states that he assumed power in November, whether it was on February, or January, what is clear is that in the year 1872,  Atnatewos then crowned Kassai emperor at [[Axum]]. He took the name and title of Emperor, becoming the first emperor crowned in that historic city since [[Fasilides]] in 1632.  Adal of Gojjam soon after submitted to Yohannes and recognized him as Emperor.  Adal was rewarded with the titles of ''Ras'' and of King (''Negus'') of Gojjam.  Adal was also given the new name of [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymanot Tessemma]].

==War with Ottoman Egypt==
Throughout his reign, Yohannes was embroiled in military struggles on his northern frontiers. First was from Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Egypt]], who sought to bring the entire [[Nile River]] basin under his rule. The [[Egyptians]] flirted with encouraging Menelik of Shewa against the Emperor, but earned Menelik's enmity by marching from the port of [[Zeila]] and occupying the city-state of [[Harar]] on 11 October 1875. Both Menelik and Yohannes had regarded [[Harar]] as a renegade province of Ethiopia, and Egyptian seizure of the Emirate was not welcome to either of them. The Egyptians then marched into northern Ethiopia from their coastal possessions around the port of [[Massawa]]. Yohannes pleaded with the British to stop their Egyptian allies, and even withdrew from his own territory in order to show the Europeans that he was the wronged party and that the Khedive was the aggressor. However, Yohannes soon realized that the Europeans would not stop the Khedive of Egypt and so he gathered up his armies and marched to meet the Egyptian force.

[[Image:Yohannes.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Ethiopian portrait of Emperor Yohannes IV]]

The two armies met at [[Battle of Gundat|Gundat]] (also called Guda-gude) on the morning of 16 November 1875. The Egyptians were tricked into marching into a narrow and steep valley and were wiped out by Ethiopian gunners surrounding the valley from the surrounding mountains. Virtually the entire Egyptian force, along with its many officers of European and North American background, were killed. News of this huge defeat was suppressed in Egypt for fear that it would undermine the government of the Khedive. A new Egyptian force was assembled and sent to avenge the defeat at Gundat. The Egyptians were defeated again at the [[Battle of Gura]] (March 7 <U+2013> 9, 1876), where the Ethiopians were led again by the Emperor, and his loyal general, the capable (and future ''Ras'') [[Alula Engida]]. This victory was followed by Menelik's submission to Yohannes on 20 March 1878, and in return Yohannes recognized Menelik's hereditary right to the title of King (''Negus'') of [[Shewa]], and re-crowned him on March 26. Yohannes took this opportunity to tie the Shewan King more closely to him by arranging for Menelik's daughter [[Zewditu]] (the future Empress of Ethiopia in her own right), to be married to his own son and heir, ''Ras'' [[Araya Selassie Yohannes|Araya Selassie]].

Emperor Yohannes also convened a general council of the [[Ethiopian Church]] at [[Boru Meda]] later in 1878, which brought an end to the [[Christological disputes in Ethiopia|ongoing theological dispute]] in the local church; Christians, Muslims and pagans were given respectively two, three and five years to conform to the council's decisions. Non-Christians were forbidden from participating in the government unless they converted and were baptised; the Muslims were given three months, while the pagans had to become Christians immediately. "Having concluded that Wollo was worth a mass," as Harold Marcus wryly puts it, his retainer ''Ras'' Mohammed of Wollo became ''Ras'' (later ''Negus'') [[Mikael of Wollo]], and the Emperor stood as his godfather at his baptism. The new convert was given Menelik of Shewa's other daughter, [[Shewarega Menelik]], as his wife. Yohannes went one step further, and pressured Menelik to expel of all the Roman Catholic missionaries from Shewa.<ref>{{Ref Ethiopia|Marcus-1995|pages= pp. 57<U+2013>59}}</ref>

However this time, instead of a single Archbishop, he requested that Patriarch Cyril send four to serve the large number of Christians in Ethiopia, who arrived in 1881. They were led by ''Abuna'' [[Abuna Petros VII|Petros]] as Archbishop, ''Abuna'' [[Abuna Mattheos X|Matewos]] for [[Shewa]], ''Abuna'' Luqas for [[Gojjam]] and ''Abuna'' Markos for [[Gondar]]. ''Abuna'' Markos died shortly after arriving, so his diocese was included with that of ''Abuna'' Atnatewos. It was the first time that the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria had appointed four Bishops for Ethiopia.

==War with Sudan==
When [[Muhammad Ahmad]] proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]], and incited [[Sudan]] into a long and violent revolt, his followers successfully either drove the Egyptian garrisons out of Sudan, or isolated them at [[Suakin]] and at various posts in the south. Yohannes agreed to British requests to allow these Egyptian soldiers to evacuate through his lands, with the understanding that the [[British Empire]] would then support his claims on important ports like [[Massawa]] on the [[Red Sea]] to import weapons and ammunition, in the event that Egypt was forced to withdraw from them. This was formalized in a treaty signed with the British at Adwa known as the [[William Nathan Wrighte Hewett|Hewett treaty]]. The immediate result was that the wrath of the Mahdiyah fell upon Ethiopia: Ras Alula defeated an invading Mahdist army at the [[Battle of Kufit]] on 23 September 1885. About the same time, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] took control of the port of Massawa, frustrating Ethiopian hopes and angering Yohannes. Yohannes attempted to work out some kind of understanding with the Italians, so he could turn his attention to the more pressing problem of the Mahdists, although Ras Alula took it upon himself to attack Italian units that were on both sides of the ill-defined frontier between the two powers. Domestic problems increased when the Neguses of both Gojjam and Shewa rebelled against Yohannes, and the Emperor had to turn his attention from the encroaching Italians to deal with his rebellious vassals. Yohannes brutally crushed the Gojjame rebellion, but before he could turn his attention to Shewa news arrived that the Mahdist forces had sacked [[Gondar]] and burned its holy churches. He marched north from Gojjam to confront the armies of the Mahdi.

==Death and descendants==
Evidence suggests that Emperor Yohannes had acted rashly and had made himself vulnerable, going beyond enemy lines in range to enemy shots as victory was going to his side. Mortally wounded from a gun shot, he had been carried to his tent, where he announced that his nephew Ras Mengesha was actually his natural son, and named him his heir (his elder son Ras Araya Selassie had died a few years earlier). He died hours later. Although the Ethiopian army had almost annihilated their opponents in this battle, hearing that their ruler had been slain shattered their morale and allowed the Mahdists to counterattack, scattering the Ethiopian forces.

Yohannes' body was carried back to Tigray guarded by a small party, who were overtaken by the Mahdist troops of [[Zeki Tummal]] near the [[Atbara River]] and who captured the sovereign's body. [[Augustus B. Wylde]], who claimed to have heard the story from a priest who managed to escape the slaughter, wrote how Yohannes' uncle ''Ras'' Areya stood beside the body of his dead master with "a few of his soldiers and the bravest of the king's servants, who had lost their all, and had no more prospects to live for".
: ''Ras'' Areya was last seen standing alongside the box containing the king's body, after having expended all his ammunition, with his shield and sword in his hands, defending himself, till at last he was speared by a Dervish from behind, and died fighting gamely like the fine old warrior that he was.<ref name=Wylde-43>Augustus B. Wylde, ''Modern Abyssinia'' (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 43</ref>

According to Wylde, as he saw death come ''Ras'' Areya announced "that he was now old and done for, that his time had come, and it was useless at his age to serve another master that he knew little about, and it was better to die like a man fighting unbelievers, than like a mule in a stable."<ref name=Wylde-43/> The Mahdists brought the Emperor's body back to their capital at [[Omdurman]], where the head was put on a pike and paraded through the streets.

Although a group of Tigrean nobles led by ''Ras'' Alula attempted to promote the claim of ''Ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengesha Yohannes]] (the "natural" son of Yohannes) as Emperor, many of the dead monarch's other relatives on both the Enderta and Tembien sides of his family objected and went into open rebellion against Mengesha. Many refused to accept ''Ras'' Mengesha as the son of Yohannes, having long known him as his nephew. Tigray was torn assunder by the rebellions of various members of the Emperor's family against Mengesha and each other. Menelik of Shewa took advantage of Tigrean disorder, and after the Italians occupied [[Hamasien]], (a district Yohannes IV had bestowed upon ''Ras'' Alula) he was proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia as [[Menelik II]].  The death of Yohannes reduced the influence of Tigrayans in the Ethiopian government and opened the way for Italians to occupy more districts previously held by Tigrayan nobles.  The seizures made by the Italians at this time ultimately resulted in the creation of the colony of [[Eritrea]] and the defeat of Italy at the [[Battle of Adowa]] at the hands of Emperor Menelik II. The Tigrean nobility retained influence at the Imperial court of Menelik and his successors, although not at the level they enjoyed under Yohannes IV.  The descendants of Yohannes ruled over Tigray as hereditary Princes until the Ethiopian Revolution and the fall of the monarchy in 1974 ended their rule.

===Araya Selassie Yohannes, eastern Tigray===
There are two lines of descent from Yohannes IV, one "legitimate" and one "natural."  The legitimate line is through his elder son, ''Ras'' [[Araya Selassie Yohannes]].  Araya Selassie Yohannes was born by his wife [[Wolete Selassie]]. The son of Araya Selassie Yohannes was Ras [[Gugsa Araya Selassie]]. His son was the infamous Dejazmach [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]] who governed eastern Tigray in the 1930s and was married to Emperor Haile Selassie's daughter [[Princess Zenebework|Princess Zenebework Haile Selassie]]. However, following the death of his wife, Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa's relationship with Emperor Haile Selassie deteriorated, and in 1936, Dejazmatch Haile Selassie became the first high ranking Ethiopian nobleman to defect to the Italians when the Fascist forces invaded Ethiopia. The people of [[Mekelle]] ransacked his house when this news was revealed. He was elevated to the title of Ras by the King of Italy.  However, following the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, Haile Selassie Gugsa was placed under house arrest and regarded as a traitor.  Emperor Haile Selassie refused to acknowledge the title of Ras granted to his former son-in-law by the King of Italy, and so he reverted to the title of Dejazmatch. He was freed by the [[Derg]] regime in 1974 following the fall of the monarchy.  He died shortly thereafter.  There are other descendants of Emperor Yohannes IV in this "legitimate" line, but because of the wartime actions of Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa, this branch of the family fell into disfavor at the Imperial court and lost its position and influence.

===Mengesha Yohannes, western Tigray===
The second, "natural" line is through ''Ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengesha Yohannes]] and is the better known line. Although ''Ras'' Mengesha Yohannes ended his days under house arrest for his repeated rebelling gainst against Emperor Menelik II. Ras Mengesha's son ''Ras'' [[Seyum Mangasha|Seyoum Mengesha]] first became governor of western Tigray, and following the treason of his cousin ''Dejazmatch'' Haile Selassie Gugsa, became Governor (''Shum'') of all of Tigray in 1936.  He commanded troops against the Italians, but was forced to surrender and spent most of the Italian occupation under [[house arrest]] in Addis Ababa. Following the return of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1941, ''Ras'' Seyoum was restored to his governorate of Tigray, recognized as the hereditary Prince of that province. ''Ras'' Seyoum Mengesha was killed during the abortive coup by the [[Imperial Bodyguard]] in 1960, and was succeeded by his son ''Ras'' [[Mangasha Seyum|Mengesha Seyoum]] who served as Governor and hereditary Prince of Tigray until the 1974 Revolution toppled the Ethiopian monarchy. Ras Mengesha Seyoum is married to Princess [[Aida Desta]], a granddaughter of Emperor Haile Selassie and is the current head of the Tigrean branch of the Solomonic dynasty.  Mengesha Seyum is the last person alive today who bears the title of "Leul Ras".
