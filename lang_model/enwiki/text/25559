'''Operation Epsom''' was a [[World War II]] British offensive that took place between 26&ndash;30 June 1944, during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. The offensive was intended to outflank and seize the German occupied city of [[Caen]], which was a major Allied objective in the early stages of the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of northwest Europe]].

Preceded by attacks intended to secure the lines of advance, Operation Epsom was launched early on the 26 June, with units of the [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]] advancing behind a creeping [[Barrage (artillery)|artillery barrage]]. Additional [[bomber aircraft|bomber]] support had been expected, but poor weather led to this being cancelled; air cover would be sporadic for much of the operation. Supported by the tanks of the 31st Tank Brigade, the 15th Scottish made steady progress, and by the end of the first day had largely overrun the German outpost line, although there remained some difficulties in securing the flanks of the advance. In heavy fighting over the following two days, a foothold was secured across the [[River Odon]], and efforts were made to expand this by capturing strategic points around the salient and moving up the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. However, in response to powerful German counterattacks, by 30 June some of the British positions across the river were withdrawn, bringing the operation to a close.

Military historians have widely differed in their interpretations of the intention and conduct of Operation Epsom, but there is general agreement concerning its effect on the balance of forces in Normandy. Although the Germans had managed to contain the offensive, to do so they had been obliged to commit all their available strength, including two panzer divisions newly arrived in Normandy and earmarked for a planned offensive against British and American positions around [[Bayeux]]. Casualties were heavy on both sides, but unlike General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] was unable to withdraw units into reserve after the battle, as they were needed to hold the front line. The British retained the initiative, and were able to launch further operations over the following weeks, eventually capturing Caen towards the end of July. 

== Background ==
{{see|Invasion of Normandy|Operation Overlord}}
The historic Normandy town of [[Caen]] was a [[Invasion of Normandy|D-Day]] objective for the British [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] that landed on [[Sword Beach]] on 6 June 1944.<ref>Williams, p. 24</ref> Hampered by congestion in the beachhead that delayed the deployment of its armoured support, and forced to divert effort to attacking strongly held German positions along the {{convert|9.3|mi|km|adj=on}} route to the town, the 3rd Division was unable to assault Caen in force, and was brought to a halt short of its outskirts.<ref>Wilmot, pp. 284&ndash;286</ref> Immediate follow-up attacks were unsuccessful as German resistance solidified; abandoning the direct approach, [[Operation Perch]]&mdash;a [[pincer attack]] by [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I]] and [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]<ref>Ellis, p. 247</ref>&mdash;was launched on 7 June, with the intention of encircling Caen from the east and west.<ref name="Forty36">Forty, p. 36</ref> I Corps, striking south out of the [[6th Airborne Division#D-Day|Orne bridgehead]], was halted by the [[21st Panzer Division (Germany)|21st Panzer Division]],<ref>Ellis, p. 250</ref> and the attack by XXX Corps bogged down in front of [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]], west of Caen, in the face of stiff opposition from the [[Panzer Lehr Division]].<ref name="Forty36"/> In an effort to force Panzer Lehr to withdraw or surrender,<ref>Ellis, p. 254</ref> and to keep operations fluid, the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] pushed through a recently created gap in the German front line, and attempted to capture the town of [[Villers-Bocage, Calvados|Villers-Bocage]].<ref>Taylor, p. 10</ref> The resulting day long [[Battle of Villers-Bocage|battle]] saw the vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division withdraw from the town,<ref>Taylor, p. 76</ref> but by 17 June Panzer Lehr had themselves been forced back, and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles.<ref>Forty, p. 97</ref>

A repeated attack from the 7th Armoured Division never materialised<ref>Ellis, p. 255</ref> and further offensive operations were abandoned when, on 19 June, a severe storm descended upon the [[English Channel]]. The storm, which would last for three days, significantly delayed the Allied build-up.<ref name="Williams114" /> Most of the convoys of landing craft and ships already at sea were driven back to ports in Britain; towed barges and other loads (including {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} of floating roadways for the [[Mulberry harbour]]s) were lost; and no less than 800 craft were left stranded on the Normandy beaches until the next spring tides in July.<ref>Wilmot, p. 322</ref>  Despite this, planning for a second offensive began,<ref name="Williams113">Williams, p. 113</ref> codenamed Operation Dreadnought, to be launched out of the Orne bridgehead, by [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]], to outflank Caen from the east. Montgomery cancelled the operation after receiving negative feedback from Sir [[Richard O'Connor]], VIII Corps commanding officer, and planning for an attack towards [[<U+00C9>vrecy]] was then looked into. There is some controversy whether Montgomery or [[Miles Dempsey]], commanding officer of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], cancelled the operation; Dempsey, following the war during an interview with [[Chester Wilmot]], stated he informed Montgomery that he was going to cancel the proposed operation on 18 June.<ref name="Hart131-132">Hart, pp. 131&ndash;132</ref>

The weather from 19&ndash;22 June also grounded Allied aircraft,<ref name="Williams118">Williams, p. 118</ref> and the Germans took advantage of the respite from air attacks to improve their defensive lines, strengthening infantry positions with minefields and posting approximately seventy [[88 mm gun|88&nbsp;mm guns]] in hedgerows and woods covering the southern approaches to Caen.<ref name="Williams114">Williams, p. 114</ref>

== Planning ==
{{see|Operation Epsom order of battle}}
On 20 June Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, commanding German forces in Normandy, was ordered by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to launch a counteroffensive against the Allied lines between the towns of [[Caumont-l'<U+00C9>vent<U+00E9>|Caumont]] and [[Saint-L<U+00F4>]].  The objective was to cut a corridor between the American and British armies by recapturing the city of [[Bayeux]] (taken by the British on 7 June) and the coastline beyond.<ref name="Wilmot334">Wilmot, p. 334</ref>  Four SS Panzer Divisions and one [[Heer (1935-1945)|''Heer'']] Panzer Division were assigned this task.  Spearheading the attack would be the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th]] SS Panzer Divisions of the [[II SS Panzer Corps]], recently arrived from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Ukraine]].<ref>Reynolds, p. 13</ref> They would be supported by the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st]] and [[2nd SS Division Das Reich|2nd]] SS Panzer Divisions,<ref name="Wilmot334"/> and the [[2nd Panzer Division (Germany)|2nd Panzer Division]].<ref>Wilmot, map p. 321</ref> The vast majority of the tanks used by these formations were [[Panzer IV]]s, supplemented with [[sturmgesch<U+00FC>tz|assault guns]], [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and [[Tiger I|Tigers]]&mdash;the latter two among the most lethal and well-protected  armoured vehicles in the German inventory.<ref>Williams, p. 112</ref>

On 18 June General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of all Allied ground forces in Normandy, issued a directive to Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey to capture Caen<ref name="Clark2021">Clark, pp. 20&ndash;21</ref> by launching a new pincer attack.<ref>Ellis, p. 271</ref> The initial plan called for I and XXX Corps to attack, west of Caen, for four days before VIII Corps would launch the main attack out of the Orne bridgehead, east of Caen, on 22 June. It was soon realised that VIII Corps would not be able to assemble within the small perimeter of the Orne bridgehead and the plan was revised on 19 June.<ref name="Clark2021"/>
[[Image:Epsom map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Operation Epsom, showing the British attacks (including those planned for I Corps) and German counterattacks.]]
The new plan called for a preliminary operation to take place three days before the main assault, I Corp's [[51st (Highland) Infantry Division]] was ordered to strike south from the Orne bridgehead, pinning down elements of the 21st Panzer Division.<ref name="Clark2021"/> [[Operation Martlet]]<ref name="Clark21">Clark, p. 21</ref> (also known as Operation Dauntless)<ref name="Ellis275">Ellis, p. 275</ref> was to commence on the day before Epsom; XXX Corp's [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]], supported by the [[8th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Armoured Brigade]], was to secure VIII Corp's flank by capturing the high ground on the right of their axis of advance.<ref name="Clark21"/>

The main role in Operation Epsom was assigned to the newly arrived VIII Corps, which consisted of 60,244 men under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Richard O'Connor.<ref>Jackson, pp. 12, 22, 27</ref> VIII Corps would launch their offensive from the beachhead gained by the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]]. The operation, split into four phases, intended for the Corps to advance and capture the high ground near [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]], south of Caen.<ref name="Clark3132">Clark, pp. 31&ndash;32</ref> It would be supported by fire from 736 artillery pieces,{{#tag:ref|552 field guns, 112 medium guns, 48 heavy guns and 24 heavy AA guns. Broken down by Corps; I Corps: 216 field guns, 32 medium guns and 16 heavy guns. VIII Corps: 240 field guns, 16 medium guns, 16 heavy guns and 24 heavy AA guns. XXX Corps: 96 field guns, 64 medium guns and 16 heavy guns.<ref name="Jackson3031"/>|group=nb}} three cruisers, and the monitor [[HMS Roberts (F40)|H.M.S. Roberts]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] would additionally provide close air support and a preliminary bombardment by 250 bombers.<ref>Clark, p. 29</ref>

The [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]] would lead the assault. During Phase I, codenamed ''Gout'', they were tasked with taking the villages of Sainte Mauvieu and [[Cheux]].<ref name="Clark3132"/> Phase II, codenamed ''Hangover'', would see the division exploit forwards to capture several crossings over the [[Odon River]], and the villages of [[Mouen]] and [[Grainville-sur-Odon]].<ref name="Clark3132"/> As a tactical alternative, should resistance during the opening phase prove light, the [[11th Armoured Division]] would rush the bridges over the Odon River, seizing the crossings by ''[[coup de main]]''.<ref>Jackson, p. 29</ref>

During these opening two phases, the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]&mdash;to be reinforced on 28 June with the [[Guards Armoured Division]]'s infantry brigade<ref name="Jackson40"/>&mdash;was to remain on the start line to provide a "firm base".<ref name="Jackson3031">Jackson, pp. 30&ndash;31</ref> In Epsom's third phase, ''Impetigo'', the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish infantry north of the Odon.<ref name="Clark3132"/>  The 15th Division would then assemble across the river, expanding the bridgehead by capturing several key villages. In the operation's final phase, codenamed ''Goitre'', elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead.<ref name="Clark3132"/> In addition, the 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize.<ref name="Jackson3031" /> The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne, both to protect the Corps flank and to be a position to attack westwards or towards Caen as necessary.<ref name="Jackson3031"/> 

Depending on the success of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two supporting operations, codenamed ''Aberlour'' and ''Ottawa''.  The former would see the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], supported by a Canadian infantry brigade, attack north of Caen; the latter would be a move by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by the [[2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade]], to take the village and airfield of [[Carpiquet]].<ref name="Stacey150">Stacey, p. 150</ref>

Originally planned for 22 June,<ref name="Clark20"/> Epsom was postponed until 26 June to make up deficiencies in manpower and material.<ref>Jackson, p. 22</ref> The initial opposition to Epsom was expected to come from the already depleted [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]] ("Hitler Youth"),<ref name="Williams118" /> along with elements of both the 21st Panzer Division and Panzer Lehr.<ref>Clark, p. 24</ref>

== Preliminary attacks ==
{{main|Operation Martlet}}
[[Image:Martlet25June.jpg|thumb|right|A knocked out German [[7.5 cm PaK 40|75mm anti-tank gun]], and disabled Panther tank, in Fontenay-le-Pesnel during Operation Martlet. A knocked out Sherman is partially visable to the left of the Panther.]]
As planned, on 23 June elements of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division's [[152nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|152nd (Highland) Infantry Brigade]] launched a preliminary attack.{{#tag:ref|5th Battalion, [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]]; 5th Battalion, [[Seaforth Highlanders]]; [[13th/18th Hussars]], with artillery and engineer support.<ref name="Ellis274-275">Ellis, pp. 274&ndash;275</ref>|group=nb}} Before daybreak and without an initial artillery bombardment, the Highland infantry advanced in silence towards the village of Sainte-Honorine-la-Chardronette. They took the German garrison by surprise and had complete control of the village before sunrise. During the morning the Highlanders were counterattacked by elements of the 21st Panzer Division's [[Kampfgruppe]] [[Hans von Luck|von Luck]]; fighting lasted all morning, but by midday the village was firmly in British hands.<ref name="Ellis275"/> This success diverted German attention and resources away from VIII Corps front, as the corps prepared for further attacks out of the Orne bridgehead.<ref>Clark, p. 37</ref>

At 0415 on 25 June, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, supported by the 8th Armoured Brigade and 250 artillery pieces, launched Operation Martlet against elements of the Panzer Lehr and 12th SS Panzer divisions.<ref name="Williams114" /> The operation's first objective, the village of [[Fontenay-le-Pesnel]], was fought over all day, but stubborn German resistance prevented its capture. One infantry battalion, supported by tanks, advanced around the village to the west and took the Tessel Wood, but was subjected to a series of German counterattacks. These were blunted by British artillery fire and close air support, but by the end of the day the 49th Division had failed to achieve their ultimate goal of the village of Rauray,<ref>Clark, p. 39</ref> leaving the terrain dominating the right flank of VIII Corps' intended advance still in German hands.<ref>Williams, pp. 115&ndash;116</ref> Operation Martlet did however force I SS Panzer Corps to commit the remaining tanks of 12th SS Panzer to XXX Corps' front, for a planned counterattack the following day.<ref name="Meyer244">Meyer, p. 244</ref> During the night, the Germans in Fontenay-le-Pesnel withdrew to straighten the front line, and infantry from the 49th Division secured the village before dawn.<ref>Clark, p. 40</ref>

== Main attack ==
=== 26 June ===
Poor weather hampered the start of Operation Epsom on 26 June&mdash;both over the battlefield itself, where rain had made the ground boggy and there was a heavy mist,<ref name="Clark45">Clark, p. 45</ref> and over the United Kingdom during the early hours of the morning, resulting in aircraft being grounded and the planned bombing missions being called off.<ref name="Ellis277">Ellis, p. 277</ref> However, [[No. 83 Group RAF]], already based in Normandy, were able to provide air support throughout the operation.{{#tag:ref|No. 83 Group RAF flew over 500 sorties in support of Operation Epsom, despite reduced effectiveness due to the weather.<ref name="Ellis277" />|group=nb}} 

The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division resumed Operation Martlet at 0650, although without significant artillery support as this was diverted to the main operation.<ref>Clark, p. 42</ref> The Germans were able to slow the British advance, and then launched an armoured riposte.<ref>Clark, pp. 42&ndash;43</ref> This initially gained ground, but was halted when British armour moved up, and a tank battle was fought in the confined terrain.<ref name="Meyer244"/> However, informed during the afternoon that a major British offensive was underway further east, SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Kurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)|Kurt Meyer]] of 12th SS Panzer called off the counterattack, and ordered his tank companies to return to their initial positions south of Rauray.<ref>Clark, p. 43</ref> During the rest of the day the 49th Division was able to make progress, halting just north of Rauray.<ref name="Clark45"/>

[[Image:Epsom26 June.jpg|thumb|left|Infantry of the [[Seaforth Highlanders|7th Seaforth Highlanders]], 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, waiting at their start line on 26 June 1944 for the signal to advance.]]
At 0730 the [[44th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade]] and the [[46th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade]] of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, supported by the 31st Tank Brigade,<ref name="Jackson32">Jackson, p. 32</ref> moved off their start lines behind a creeping barrage fired from 344 guns.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 19&ndash;20</ref> The 46th Brigade initially advanced without armoured support, as in bypassing the mine and booby trap-ridden village of [[Le Mesnil-Patry]], its tanks were forced to negotiate minefields flanking the village. The infantry advance had mixed results; one battalion{{#tag:ref|2nd Battalion, [[Glasgow Highlanders]]<ref name="Jackson3233">Jackson, pp. 32&ndash;33</ref>|group=nb}} faced only light resistance while the other{{#tag:ref|9th Battalion, [[The Cameronians]]<ref name="Jackson3233"/>|group=nb}} ran into the grenadiers of the Hitler Youth Division, who had allowed the barrage to pass over their positions before opening fire.<ref>Reynolds, p. 20</ref> Reuniting with their tanks at around 1000, by midday the two battalions were fighting for control of their initial objectives; Cheux and Le Haut du Bosq.<ref name="Jackson3233"/>

The 44th Brigade, not facing the same problems as the 46th and advancing with their tank support, encountered little opposition until coming under machine gun fire at a small stream, following which German resistance was much heavier. Between 0830 and 0930, the two leading battalions{{#tag:ref|6th Battalion, [[The Royal Scots Fusiliers]] and the 8th Battalion, [[The Royal Scots]]<ref name="Jackson, p. 33"/>|group=nb}} reached their initial objectives; Sainte Mauvieu and La Gaule. After much hand to hand fighting, they believed the villages to be completely in their hands just after midday, although subsequently it was discovered that some German remnants were still holding out.<ref name="Jackson, p. 33">Jackson, p. 33</ref> Tanks and infantry from the 12th SS and the 21st Panzer launched two counterattacks in an attempt to regain Sainte Mauvieu, but both were beaten off with the aid of intensive artillery fire.<ref name="Ellis278">Ellis, p. 278</ref> The main German opposition in this section of their outpost line had been from elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division's 1st Battalion 26th Panzergrenadier Regiment, which had been mostly overrun, and the pioneer battalion. The Germans within Rauray, which had not been captured as planned the previous day, were able to subject the British brigades to observed artillery and indirect tank fire,<ref>Clark, pp. 46&ndash;47</ref> causing considerable casualties and destruction, especially within the village of Cheux.<ref name="Ellis278"/>

At 1250 one squadron from the 11th Armoured Division's reconnaissance regiment, deployed north of Cheux, was ordered to advance towards the Odon<ref name="Jackson3435">Jackson, p. 34&ndash;35</ref> as the precursor to an attempt by the division's armoured brigade to rush the bridges.<ref name="Williams118" /> Owing to minefields near the village, debris blocking its streets, and German holdouts attacking the tanks, it was not until 1400 that the regiment was finally able to make progress. By 1430 the squadron arrived on a ridge south of Cheux, where it was engaged<ref name="Jackson3435"/> by twenty Panzer IVs (diverted by the 12th SS Panzer Division from the Rauray area), Tiger tanks from the 3rd Battalion 101st Heavy SS Panzer Battalion, and additional armour from the 21st Panzer Division.<ref>Clark, p. 51</ref> More tanks from the 11th Armoured Division arrived, but determined German resistance halted any further advance;<ref name="Jackson3435">Jackson, p. 34&ndash;35</ref> by the end of the day the division had lost twenty-one tanks.<ref name="Fortin15">Fortin, p. 15</ref> At 1800 the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division's third infantry brigade, the 227th (Highland), was committed to the battle.<ref name="Ellis278"/> However, the Highlanders became bogged down with fighting in support of the rest of the division, and only two companies from the 1st Battalion [[Gordon Highlanders]] made much progress. They entered the northern outskirts of Colleville by 2100, but soon found themselves cut off by German counterattacks. After heavy and confused fighting one company was able to break out and rejoin the battalion.<ref name="Jackson3435"/>

To stop the British offensive, during the evening Field Marshal Rommel ordered assistance from all available units of II SS Panzer Corps.<ref>Wilmot, p. 343</ref>

=== 27 June ===
[[Image:Epsom27June.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Universal Carrier]] of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division during Operation Epsom, being used to evacuate wounded.]]
With no further attacks forthcoming during the night, the German command believed that the British offensive had been successfully halted, so during the early hours of 27 June, II SS Panzer Corps was ordered to resume preparations for its counter strike towards Bayeux.<ref name="Wilmot343344">Wilmot, pp. 343&ndash;344</ref>

On the right of the British advance, a counterattack employing 80 tanks was launched by the I SS Panzer Corps;<ref name="Wilmot343344"/> this was first disorganised by artillery fire before foundering on the anti-tank guns of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division,<ref name="Wilmot344"/> who then resumed their attempt to secure VIII Corps flank. The village of Rauray was finally taken at 1600 on 27 June, after further heavy fighting against the 12th SS Panzer Division's [[panzergrenadiers]]. German forces had been diverted from opposing VIII Corps advance,<ref>Clark, p. 65</ref> and the fall of Rauray denied the Germans an important observation point, although they remained in control of an area of high ground to the south.<ref>Clark, pp. 65&ndash;67</ref>

Epsom was resumed at 0445 by the 10th Battalion Highland Light Infantry of the 227 (Highland) Infantry Brigade. With support from [[Churchill tanks]], the battalion intended to make a bid for the Odon crossing at [[Gavrus]]. However, the Highlanders immediately ran into stiff opposition from elements of 12th SS Panzer, and despite heavy artillery support were unable to advance all day. Casualties were heavy on both sides.<ref name="Clark68">Clark, p. 68</ref>

At 0730 the [[2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], also of the 227 (Highland) Infantry Brigade, launched an attack aimed at capturing the Odon crossing at Tourmauville, northwest of the village of Baron.<ref>Clark, p. 67</ref>  With the available German forces already engaged by the Highland Light Infantry, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, supported by the [[23rd Hussars]], were able to advance as far as Colleville with relative ease. However, the small German garrison there, supported by 88mm guns, inflicted heavy casualties upon the British and denied them the village until the afternoon.<ref name="Clark68"/> With this last obstacle dealt with, the battalion seized the bridge at Tourmauville at around 1700, and a bridgehead was established.<ref name="Jackson39">Jackson, p. 39</ref> By 1900, two depleted squadrons of the 23rd Hussars, and a company of the 8th [[The Rifle Brigade|Rifle Brigade]], had crossed the Odon into the bridgehead.<ref>Saunders, p. 20</ref>

The remainder of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was positioned around Cheux and Sainte Mauvieu, and was in the process of being relieved by the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. One battalion of the 43rd,{{#tag:ref|5th Battalion [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]]<ref name="Jackson39">Jackson, p. 39</ref>|group=nb}} on moving into the outskirts of Cheux, found the Scottish infantry had already moved on and the vacated position had been reoccupied by grenadiers of 12th SS Panzer.

During the early hours of 28 June, a battle group of the 1st SS Panzer Division&ndash;Kampfgruppe Frey&mdash;arrived at the front and was placed under the command of the 12th SS Panzer Division.

At 0530 elements of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, with tank support, launched a new assault to capture the village of Grainville-sur-Odon. After shelling and close quarter street fighting, the village was secured by 1300 hours; German counterattacks followed but were repulsed.<ref>Clark, p. 74</ref> At 0600 the Germans began two strong flanking attacks, with the intention of pinching out the British salient. Kampfgruppe Frey, on the salient's eastern flank, launched an attack north of the Odon supported by Panzer IVs of the 21st Panzer Division. This reached the villages of Mouen and Tourville, but the British counterattacked from the direction of Cheux, resulting in confused and heavy fighting throughout the day.<ref name="Reynolds23"/> Frey's battle group managed to gain control of Mouen;<ref>Clark, p. 79</ref> British counterattacks supported by tanks halted any further advance, but were unable to retake the village.<ref name="Clark80">Clark, p. 80</ref> Meanwhile British patrols had found Marcelet partially abandoned, the German front line having been pulled back towards Carpiquet.<ref name="Jackson42">Jackson, p. 42</ref>

South of the Odon, at 0900 the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders advanced out of the bridgehead with the aim of capturing a bridge north of the village of Gavrus. Heavy fighting took place into the afternoon before both village and bridge were in Scottish hands.<ref name="Jackson42"/> Meanwhile infantry from the 11th Armoured Division expanded the bridgehead itself, by taking the village of Baron,<ref name="Fortin15"/> and the 23rd Hussars with infantry support advanced on Hill 112. Having secured its northern slope and dislodged the defenders from its crest, they were unable to advance further due to stiff resistance from forces dug in on the hill's reverse slope.<ref name="Jackson41">Jackson, p. 41</ref> Several unsuccessful counterattacks were launched by 12th SS Panzer,<ref>Saunders, pp. 27&ndash;30</ref> and the battered hussars were relieved at 1500 by the [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]], but neither side was able to take complete control of the hill.<ref name="Jackson41"/> The 11th Armoured Division had lost nearly 40 tanks on its slopes by the end of the day, and was surrounded on three sides, but support troops had managed to reach and reinforce the position.<ref>Saunders, p. 32</ref>

=== 29 June ===

With the weather improving over the United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his counter stroke came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, resulting in the start time being pushed back to the afternoon.<ref name="Wilmot345"/> From the number of German reinforcements arriving in VIII Corps' sector,<ref name="Jackson44">Jackson, p. 44</ref> and aerial reconnaissance,<ref name="Reynolds23"/> VIII Corps commander Lieutenant-General [[Richard O<U+2019>Connor]] suspected that a major offensive was being organised.<ref name="Jackson44"/> XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving VIII Corps' right flank vulnerable, so the planned attacks by I Corps were postponed and O'Connor ordered VIII Corps to adopt a defensive posture.<ref name="Jackson44"/> Lieutenant-General [[Miles Dempsey]], commanding the Second Army and privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German signal traffic, knew of the planned counter attack and approved O'Connor's precautions.<ref name="Reynolds23"/>

Having moved to the defensive, VIII Corps began to reorganise in order to meet the attack when it came.<ref name="Jackson45">Jackson, p. 45</ref> Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Evrecy&ndash;[[Noyers-Bocage]]&ndash;Villers-Bocage area, and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.<ref name="Jackson45"/> VIII Corps also launched spoiling moves. At 0800 a battalion{{#tag:ref|1st Battalion [[Worcestershire Regiment]]<ref name="Clark, p. 87">Clark, p. 87</ref>|group=nb}} of the 43rd Division assaulted Mouen. Without armour, but supported by an artillery barrage, by 1100 the battalion had evicted the 1st SS Panzer Division's panzergrenadiers, following which a second battalion{{#tag:ref|7th Battalion The [[Somerset Light Infantry]]<ref name="Clark, p. 88"/>|group=nb}} moved up and dug in on the Caen&ndash;Villers-Bocage road.<ref>Clark, pp. 87&ndash;88</ref> The 43rd Division's 129th Brigade swept the woods and orchards around Tourville-sur-Odon, before crossing the river north of Baron and proceeding to clear the southern bank.<ref name="Clark, p. 88">Clark, p. 88</ref> Other initiatives were less successful. An attempt by the 15th Division's 44th Brigade to advance towards the Odon and link up with the force holding the Gavrus bridges failed, leaving this position isolated,<ref name="Clark, p. 89">Clark, p. 89</ref> and in the salient the 44th Battalion Royal Tank Regiment failed to capture Hill 113, north of Evrecy,<ref name="Clark90">Clark, p. 90</ref> after clashing with 10th SS Panzer and losing 6 tanks.<ref name="Jackson49">Jackson, p. 49</ref> Endeavouring to strengthen their position, elements of the 11th Armoured Division launched a failed attack to take Esquay-Notre-Dame, west of Hill 112,<ref name="Clark90"/> but a combined infantry and tank attack{{#tag:ref|Elements of the 8th Battalion [[The Rifle Brigade]] and the [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment|3rd Battalion, The Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref name="Jackson49"/>|group=nb}} on the southern slope of the hill was more successful, driving the Germans from the position.<ref name="Jackson49"/>

[[Image:Jupiterpanzergrenadiers.jpg|thumb|right|German SS-Panzergrenadiers dug in near Hill 112.]]
Hausser intended for his II SS Panzer Corps' 9th SS Panzer Division&mdash;with Kampfgruppe Weidinger protecting its left flank&mdash;to cut right across the British salient north of the Odon, while the 10th SS Panzer Division was to retake Gavrus and Hill 112 south of the river.<ref name="Clark92">Clark, p. 92</ref> 9th SS Panzer's attack began at 1400, heavily supported by artillery. Two regiments{{#tag:ref|19th and 20th SS Panzergrenadier Regiments.<ref name="Reynolds25"/> A German regiment is the equivalent of a British brigade.|group=nb}} of the division, supported by Panthers, Panzer IV's and assault guns, attacked Grainville, le Haut du Bosq, and le Valtru, aiming for Cheux as their final objective.<ref name="Reynolds25">Reynolds, p. 25</ref> A British company was overrun and tanks and infantry penetrated into le Valtru, but anti-tank guns knocked out four German tanks within the village and artillery fire forced their supporting infantry to withdraw. Heavy and confused fighting, at times coming down to hand-to-hand combat, took place outside Grainville. Panzergrenadiers captured a tactically key wood, but were forced back after a British counter attack. The panzergrenadiers claimed they also captured Grainville, but no British sources support this, and by nightfall British infantry were in firm control of the village.<ref name="Reynolds25"/>

At around 1600<ref name="Jackson50">Jackson, p. 50</ref> an officer of the 9th SS Panzer Division was captured<ref name="Wilmot345">Wilmot, p. 345</ref> while conducting a reconnaissance mission.<ref name="Jackson50"/> He was found to be carrying a map and notebook containing details of upcoming attacks.{{#tag:ref|Wilmot claims that this officer was carrying a copy of the entire II SS Panzer Corps plan of attack.<ref name="Wilmot345"/> Ellis states this officer was carrying the plans of the counter attack for which he was reconnoitring.<ref>Ellis, p. 283</ref> Jackson states these captured documents were in fact only the plans of the captured officer's brigade (regiment).<ref name="Jackson50"/>|group=nb}} Nevertheless, at around 1830 the Germans launched renewed strikes against the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division's right flank.<ref name="Williams121">Williams, p. 121</ref> One unit was in the process of relieving another, and in the confusion German tanks and infantry slipped through the British defences,<ref name="Reynolds25"/> with some units advancing {{convert|2|mi|km}}<ref>Williams, p. 122</ref> before running into heavy resistance.<ref name="Reynolds25"/> By 2300, 9th SS Panzer had been stopped.<ref name="Reynolds27">Reynolds, p. 27</ref> Additional supporting attacks against the British eastern flank had been planned, but the German tank concentrations assembling in the Carpiquet area had been so severely disrupted by RAF fighter-bombers during the afternoon that the attacks never materialised.<ref name="Jackson51"/>

The 10th SS Panzer Division launched its attack, behind schedule, at 1430. Following clashes earlier in the day the British were ready and waiting, but after five hours of intense combat the Scottish infantry defending Gavrus had been pushed back into a pocket around the bridge north of the village.<ref name="Clark92"/> An artillery bombardment caused the Germans to withdraw, but the British did not reoccupy the village.<ref name="Reynolds27"/> Moving towards Hill 113, elements of 10th SS Panzer ran into British tanks and infantry within Evrecy,{{#tag:ref|[[44th Royal Tank Regiment|44th Battalion The Royal Tank Regiment]] and 2nd Battalion [[The King's Royal Rifle Corps]]; 2nd Grenadier Battalion Panzergrenadier Regiment 21 and 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 10<ref>Reynolds, pp. 27, 28, 32</ref>|group=nb}} thwarting their attempt to occupy the hill. Dealing with this obstacle took the remainder of the day, so the division's planned attack on Hill 112 was postponed.<ref>Clark, p. 93</ref> The Germans claimed the destruction of 28 tanks, while the British record the loss of only 12.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 27&ndash;28</ref> 

Believing the aggressive German actions throughout 29 June indicated further major counterattacks for the following day, Dempsey reinforced the Odon bridgehead with a brigade of the 43rd division and pulled in its perimeter. The 159th Infantry Brigade, of the 11th Armoured Division, was placed under the command of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division,<ref name="Ellis284285">Ellis, pp. 284&ndash;285</ref> and acceding to O<U+2019>Connor<U+2019>s wishes for additional infantry, Dempsey attached the newly arrived [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] to VIII Corps; the lead brigade arrived near the Epsom start line during the night.<ref>Jackson, p. 52</ref> In order to retain possession of Hill 112, Dempsey recognised that he would also need to hold Evrecy and Hill 113; a task that, for the moment, he did not have the resources for.<ref>Hart, pp. 140&ndash;141</ref> He therefore ordered the 29th Armoured Brigade to abandon the hill.<ref name="Ellis284285"/> Convinced that the key position to retain was between Rauray and the Odon,<ref>Hart, p. 141</ref> after dark Dempsey withdrew the 29th Armoured Brigade north, across the river, <ref name="Jackson51">Jackson, p. 51</ref> to be in a position to meet the expected renewed German offensive.<ref>Ellis, p. 285</ref>

=== 30 June ===

The failure of II SS Panzer Corps to significantly reduce the British salient was of great concern to Willi Bittrich, and he ordered a resumption of the offensive during the night of 29&ndash;30 June, hoping to negate Allied air support. The 19th and 20th Regiments of the 9th SS Panzer Division renewed their attacks against Grainville-sur-Odon and le Valtru during the hours of darkness, but little progress was made in the face of opposition from the tanks of the 11th Armoured Division&mdash;now in position north of the Odon&mdash;and heavy artillery bombardments.<ref name="Clark95">Clark, p. 95</ref> At 0120 the 10th SS Panzer Division started to move towards Hill 112 and at dawn, covered by a heavy artillery barrage, they assaulted the vacated British positions. Unaware that the British had pulled back, panzergrenadiers and tanks of the 10th SS Panzer advanced on the hill from the south and south-west, while infantry from 12th SS Panzer attacked from the east and south-east. Meeting no opposition, by noon the Germans had firmly installed themselves on the hill,<ref>Reynolds, p. 28</ref> but a follow-up attack towards Baron was broken up by  a British counterattack and artillery fire.<ref name="Clark95"/>

With only limited results achieved thus far, Bittrich called off further offensive action against VIII Corps.<ref name="Clark96">Clark, p. 96</ref> In the evening Hausser, now commanding the Seventh Army, informed Rommel's headquarters that his counterattacks had been temporarily suspended due to "tenacious enemy resistance" and intensive Allied artillery and naval gunfire.<ref>Wilmot, pp. 345&ndash;346</ref> Unaware of this, and believing that more German attacks would follow, Dempsey closed down Operation Epsom.<ref name="Clark96"/> The front gradually settled down save for minor and inconclusive skirmishing, although both sides spent the remainder of the day heavily shelling one another.<ref>Clark, p. 95&ndash;98</ref> The battleship [[HMS Rodney (29)|H.M.S.

==Aftermath==
=== 1 July ===
[[Image:German 80mm Mortar.jpg|thumb|right|A Waffen SS Soldier reloads a German [[8 cm sGrW 34|80mm mortar]]. German forces used mortars extensively and they allegedly accounted for 70% of British casualties in Normandy.<ref name="Reynolds32"/>]]
The II SS Panzer Corps resumed its counter offensive on 1 July, after spending most of the preceding 24 hours regrouping. Unaware that the British operation had come to an end, and with overcast weather interfering with Allied air support,<ref name="Jackson57">Jackson, p. 57</ref> Bittrich believed he had an opportunity to prevent the 11th Armoured Division continuing its advance across the Orne.<ref name="Clark101">Clark, p. 101</ref>

Before dawn the 10th SS Panzer Division moved off, supported by heavy mortar and artillery fire.<ref name="Reynolds30">Reynolds, p. 30</ref> The village of Baron was quickly taken, but a counterattack by the 31st Tank Brigade won it back by noon.<ref name="Clark101"/> Other attacks by 10th SS Panzer from Hill 112 were broken up by heavy shelling;<ref name="Jackson58">Jackson, p. 58</ref> British patrols later found an estimated 300&ndash;400 dead panzergrenadiers on the northern slope of the hill.<ref name="Reynolds30"/>

The 9th SS Panzer Division spent the day attempting to force the British lines between Rauray and the Odon. Supplemented by panzergrenadiers of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and following a preliminary bombardment, tanks and infantry of 9th SS Panzer advanced behind a smoke screen and succeeded in breaking through the outer British defences. However, the assault was halted by secondary positions in front of Rauray and on high ground to the south-east,<ref name="Reynolds30"/> although some elements penetrated as far as Haut du Bosq.<ref name="Jackson58"/> Further German attacks throughout the day were met with intense artillery fire and made no progress, and in the early evening a British counterattack, utilising [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] and flame-throwing [[Churchill Crocodile]] tanks, restored the front line to that at the start of the day. Casualties were heavy on both sides.<ref name="Reynolds30"/> Thirty German tanks were claimed destroyed, mostly by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division; elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division had been repulsed during the morning, and attacks from other formations were halted by artillery fire.<ref name="Jackson58"/>

=== Overall ===

Having been obliged to commit his last available strategic reserves to bring the British offensive to a halt, on 29 June Rommel requested permission from Hitler to allow the Seventh Army to begin a fighting withdrawal towards the River [[Seine]]; a move which would be mirrored by German forces in southern France to form a new front line along the Seine towards the Swiss border. This was partially endorsed by Hausser, who on 30 June proposed pulling back from Caen. However, encouraged by the outcome of the fighting in the Odon valley, Hitler stated that "we must not allow mobile warfare to develop",<ref>Wilmot, p. 346</ref> committing his troops in Normandy to "a policy of aggressive and unyielding defence".<ref name="Wilmot347">Wilmot, p. 347</ref> On 2 July, Scottish patrols produced the first evidence of this, reporting that south of the Odon the Germans were digging in. Aerial photographs taken two days later provided confirmation, showing large numbers of newly-dug weapon positions, and by 8 July the German forces facing VIII Corps had fully entrenched themselves.<ref name="Jackson59"/> Some local adjustments occurred as both sides sought to improve their tactical positions, with the 12th SS Panzer Division launching a successful attack to capture [[Fontaine-<U+00C9>toupefour]] on 2 July.<ref>Clark, pp. 101&ndash;102</ref>
[[Image:Battleforceanmapenglish.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map showing operations close to Caen.]]

The serious losses sustained in maintaining an increasingly costly static defence led to fractures in the German high command. On the evening of 1 July, in a conversation with [[Wilhelm Keitel]], von Rundstedt advised; "Make peace, you fools."<ref name="Wilmot347"/> Shortly afterwards, he was replaced as Commander in Chief West by [[G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge]], and due to disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted, von Schweppenburg was replaced as commander of Panzer Group West by [[Heinrich Eberbach]].<ref name="Ellis320322"/>

During the lull in fighting both sides made several changes to the disposition of their forces. The 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division relieved the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division in the west of the British salient,<ref>Clark, p. 102</ref> while the infantry of the 11th Armoured Division, still holding the Odon bridgehead, were relieved by the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division.<ref name="Jackson60">Jackson, p. 60</ref> The Germans moved up the 277th Infantry Division, which began to relieve the 9th SS Panzer Division<ref>Jackson, pp. 60&ndash;61</ref> and the battle group of the 2nd SS Panzer Division.<ref>Reynolds, p. 35</ref>

A few days later the British Second Army launched a new offensive, codenamed [[Operation Charnwood]], to gain possession of Caen.<ref name="Williams131"/> This incorporated the postponed attack on Carpiquet, originally planned for Epsom as Operation Ottawa<ref name="Stacey150"/> but now codenamed Operation Windsor.<ref name="Jackson60"/> In a frontal assault the northern half of the city was captured,<ref name="Williams131">Williams, p. 131</ref> with the remaining portions being taken during Operations [[Operation Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Operation Goodwood|Goodwood]] in the third week of July.<ref>Trew, p. 48</ref> The fighting in the Odon Valley would continue; on 10 July [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|Operation Jupiter]] was launched<ref>Clark, p. 103</ref> by VIII Corps to push back the German forces near the village of Baron, retake Hill 112, and advance to the River Orne.<ref>Jackson, p. 61</ref>

VIII Corps, in battle for the first time, had broken through strongly entrenched German positions and advanced nearly six miles.<ref name="Jackson57"/> The Germans however, throwing in their last available reserves,<ref name="Hart108">Hart, p. 108</ref> had been able to achieve a defensive success at the operational level, containing the British offensive. Just over 4,000 casualties had been inflicted upon the British Army<ref name="Jackson">Jackson, pp. 37, 40, 44, 53, 55 & 59</ref> but the German forces took more than 3,000 casualties themselves.<ref name="Clark107-109"/> The German commanders had been forced to commit their armoured reserves piecemeal to meet threats as they developed, and to counterattack at a disadvantage.<ref name="Williams123">Williams, p. 123</ref> As a result, over 120 German tanks were destroyed,<ref name="Jackson59"/> the organisation of their forces was significantly disrupted, and their combat ability degraded.<ref name="Williams123" /> Furthermore, as there were few infantry divisions available to relieve them, the panzer divisions had to assume a defensive role, being forced to remain in the front line rather than pulling back into reserve.<ref name="Williams124">Williams, p. 124</ref>

Operation Epsom has been analysed to varying degrees by many prominent military historians and commentators. As described by Stephen Ashley Hart, these analyses have passed through a number of stages. The post-war publication of memoirs by the leading Allied generals led to rifts along partisan lines during the 1950s and 1960s, with American historians generally critical of Montgomery and the actions of the Anglo-Canadian forces, while "pro-Montgomery" historians set out to reject these criticisms. Also published during this period were the national official campaign histories, which although thoroughly-researched, for the most part avoided detailed critical analysis of the 1944&ndash;45 north-west European campaign's most controversial issues. During the 1980s, historical literature underwent a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] phase concentrating on the deficiencies of the Allied performance, and from the late 1990s to the present, historians of the campaign have entered a post revisionist stage with two schools of thought: those attempting to expand on the revisionist work by providing a more detailed campaign analysis and those who have attempted to demonstrate that the techniques employed by the Anglo-Canadian forces were appropriate to conditions in Normandy.<ref>Hart, pp. 16&mdash;17</ref>

According to Carlo D<U+2019>Este, the most logical point for the British to have launched an attack at this stage of the campaign would have been out of the Orne bridgehead on the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lodgement.<ref>D<U+2019>Este, p. 233</ref> However, an attack in this area had been considered&mdash;and vetoed&mdash;by Montgomery, Dempsey and O<U+2019>Connor as being unrealistic; instead, Second Army turned its attention west of Caen.<ref name="Hart131-132"/> One of the more contentious points amongst historians is the question of what Operation Epsom was intended to achieve. Some claim that the aim was simply to gain ground, while others have suggested that the operation had wider objectives. Andrew Williams argues that due to ULTRA intercepts, Montgomery was aware of Rommel's planned attack towards Bayeux, and Epsom was launched to pre-empt this offensive.<ref name="Williams113"/> Chester Wilmot states that the operation was intended to draw the I SS Panzer Corps and the newly arrived II SS Panzer Corps into battle around Caen,<ref>Wilmot, p. 342</ref> and Hart notes that Montgomery wanted to retain the initiative at the operational and strategic level, to prevent German armoured forces either being redeployed to face the Americans or being relieved and passed into reserve. The arrival of the II SS Panzer Corps acted as powerful incentive to launch Epsom, thus retaining the initiative by forcing the German command to commit the II SS Panzer Corps to battle rather than use it for their own planned attack.<ref name="Hart108"/> These views are completely dismissed by Max Hastings, who claims that "no sane commander" would mount an attack on the scale of Epsom without "every hope of breaking through the German defences, or at least of causing the enemy to make substantial withdrawals".<ref>Hastings, p. 171</ref> D<U+2019>Este supports this view, stating "No amount of pretence can conceal that the real object had been a short pincer movement to outflank Caen".<ref name="D'Este245">D'Este, p. 245</ref>

Lloyd Clark writes: "On the battlefield, Epsom ended, rather ignominiously, in a sort of draw."<ref name="Clark100"/> However, the overall result of the offensive has also seen several varying conclusions. Clark notes that examining Operation Epsom's results is difficult when there is no agreement about its intentions; although Montgomery's written orders&mdash;to advance across the Orne River and capture the high ground south of Caen&mdash;were not achieved, he argues that there were also un-stated objectives that had strategic implications, which far outweighed the simple capture of ground.<ref>Clark, p. 104</ref> Stephen Ambrose sees Operation Epsom as veering off-course from its original plan,<ref>Ambrose, p. 428</ref> while D'Este goes so far as to say that Epsom was "an operation of immense intentions which were not attained",<ref name="D'Este245"/> calling it a "dismal failure".<ref name="D'Este245"/> However, Simon Trew notes that this 'failure' "took most of six Panzer Divisions to stop Epsom short of its final objectives",<ref>Trew, p. 28</ref> with Michael Reynolds adding that, without the commitment of these six divisions, it was highly likely that the British offensive would have achieved its goals.<ref>Reynolds, p. 31</ref> Ian Daglish claims that, while the original concept of Epsom had failed, the British had nevertheless won a strategic victory.<ref>Daglish, pp. 218-219</ref> By withdrawing the 11th Armoured Division back across the Odon and then into reserve, the 21st Army Group had re-created the threat of a major offensive in the Caen sector,<ref>Wilmot, p. 348</ref> and by the end of June all German armoured forces in Normandy were concentrated on the Second Army's front.<ref>Gill, p. 30</ref><ref>Jackson, p. 53</ref> Milton Shulman states that, with the defeat of its second armoured counterattack during June, the German command had thrown away its most effective troops,<ref>Shulman, pp. 132-133</ref> and Reynolds concedes that while the operation was costly for the British, it also "caused grievous losses" to the German force.<ref>Reynolds, p. 33</ref> VIII Corps, in its final analysis, concluded that Epsom failed in its stated goal, but "when seen as part of Montgomery's series of rapid and consecutive blows against the German Army in Normandy, the importance of Epsom becomes more apparent and there is little doubt that it did play a significant part in the Allies' eventual success in the region."<ref>Jackson, p. 114</ref> D'Este however dismisses any idea of wider strategic implications, claiming that the losses inflicted on the German army were "purely in terms of men and material".<ref name="D'Este245"/>

Terry Copp has tried to explain the varying interpretations of Epsom by suggesting that too much emphasis has been given to analysing the offensive from a win-lose perspective, whereas a cost-benefit approach provides more useful conclusions.<ref name=copp18>Buckley (Editor), p. 18. Chapter 1 by Terry Copp</ref> Describing the standard German practice of launching local counterattacks when driven from a position, and thereby incurring avoidable losses that could not be readily replaced, he writes: "One such counter-attack on 22 July resulted in 10SS regaining control of the Bon Repas[sic]-Evrecy road, a clear victory in a win-lose narrative but a typical German defeat in any cost<U+2013>benefit analysis."<ref name=copp18 />
