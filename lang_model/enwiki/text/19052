'''Awadhi''' ([[Devanagari]]: <U+0905><U+0935><U+0927><U+0940>, [[Arabic script|Perso-Arabic]]: {{nastaliq|<U+0627><U+0648><U+062F><U+0647><U+064A>}}), aka ''Kosali'' or ''Baiswari'', is an [[Eastern Hindi language]], a [[dialect]] of the [[Hindi language (generic)|Hindi]] [[dialect continuum]]. It is spoken chiefly in the [[Awadh]] (Oudh) region of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Nepal]] although its speakers are also found in [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Delhi]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NP&seq=30 Detailed language map of western Nepal, see disjunct enclaves of language #2 in southwest]</ref> A mixture of Awadhi, [[Brij Bhasha]] and [[Bundeli]] is also spoken in the Vatsa country (Lower [[Doab]]) south of Awadh region which includes [[Kanpur]] and [[Allahabad]]. It is also spoken in most of the Caribbean countries where the people of [[Uttar Pradesh]] were taken as indentured workers by the British India government. According to the 2001 census, it ranks 29th in the [[List of languages by number of native speakers]] in World.

Awadhi is also known by alternate names of Abadhi, Abadi, Abohi, Ambodhi, Avadhi, Baiswari, Lakhanawi, Kojali, Kosali and Dehati.

==Name of the language==
Awadhi is the main dialect of the Eastern Hindi branch of the Indo-Aryan group of languages spoken in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and its diaspora spread all over world. The term Awadhi appears to denote the language of Awadh (Oudh) but as matter of fact it is not confined to [[Awadh]] ([[Oudh]]) but also spoken outside Awadh e.g. [[Kanpur]], [[Allahabad]] and some parts of [[Nepal]], [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Suriname]], [[Trinidad]], [[Malaysia]], [[Bhutan]], [[Guyana]]. It is also spoken in some parts of [[maharastra]], [[haryana]], [[bihar]], [[jharkhand]], [[uttrakhand]], [[madhya pradesh]]. Many people claim it as being the language of  sultan(emperors). Awadhi is spoken by roughly 45 million people.

==Geographical distribution==
Awadhi is mainly spoken in the major part of [[Uttar Pradesh]] or Central Uttar Pradesh, [[Uttarakhand]] & [[Bihar]], the adjoining [[Madhesh]] area of [[Nepal]], the lower stretch of the [[Ganges]]<U+2013>[[Yamuna]] [[Doab]], and Caribbean countries.A distribution of the geographical area can be found in volume 9 of '[[Linguistic Survey of India]]' by [[George A. Grierson]].

Awadhi is a language spoken by more than 45 million people. The language is ranked 29th out of the most spoken languages in the world and is mainly heard in India, Nepal, Fiji, Guyana, Malaysia and Mauritius. Most speakers of the language speak it as a first, not second, language. Awadhi belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. The writing system used for Awadhi is usually [[Devanagari]] or [[Kaithi]], although some people use a mixture of both, and [[Muslims]] use the [[Persian alphabet|Persian script]].

===India===
The 2001 census identified Awadhi as a language/dialect having more than one and a half million speakers speaking it as their mother tongue.

==In literary traditions==
At present there is little literary endeavour in Awadhi, since most speakers have adopted western Hindi or [[Urdu]]. Although today it is only considered a [[dialect]] of [[Hindi]], before the standardization of Hindi, it was one of the two most important literary dialect of Hindustani (the other being [[Braj Bhasha]]). Awadhi was one of the earliest Indo-Aryan languages to be cultivated for literature. The oldest specimen of Awadhi is found in ''Ukti-vyakti-prakarana'' by Damodara Pandita, who flourished during the first half of the 12th century. He wrote this book to teach Awadhi through his mother tongue which was a kind of old Awadhi. The [[Sufi]] tradition which became established in India in the 14th century found a series of writers, mostly Muslim, who took a number of poems of medieval Hindu inspiration and wove them into poems in Awadhi. Maulana Daud was probably the first of them. The manuscripts of these poems are mostly Persian in character due to the Muslim influence existing at that point of time.<ref name="Nayyar">[http://www.esamskriti.com/essays/docfile/14_395.doc History of Hindi language], Compiled by Sanjeev Nayyar, March 2002</ref>

The Awadhi dialect of Hindi was enriched by a number of Sufi writers who wove some romantic tales of the folklore type into beautiful allegorical plays by way of elucidating the characteristics of Sufi doctrines. Maulana Daud is the author of the oldest work of this type, ''Chandayan''. But the greatest writer of this school was [[Malik Muhammad Jayasi]], whose poem ''[[Padmavat]]'', composed between 1520 and 1540, is a detailed Sufi allegorical treatment of the famous story of [[Rani Padmini]] of [[Chittorgarh|Chittor]].<ref name="Nayyar" />

The greatest Awadhi writer during this period was Gosvami [[Tulsidas]], born in Uttar Pradesh in 1523. He wrote his masterpiece ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' in 1574. It narrates the story of Rama and through it propounds the story of the [[Bhakti movement]]. Tulsidas wrote many other devotional works, of which ''Vinaya-Patrika (Letters of Prayer)'' is the most well-known.<ref name="Nayyar" />

Important works in Awadhi include the ''Chandayan'' by Maulana Daud, the ''Padmavat'' by Malik Mohammad Jaisi (1540 A.D.), the ''Ramcharitmanas'' by Tulsidas (1575 A.D.), and ''Indravati'' by Nur Muhammad (1757 A.D.). Many important works of the North-Indian Hindu devotional literature, including Chalisas such as Hanuman Chalisha, are written in Awadhi.<ref name="Baburam">[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WfkWvgqk5c4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Evolution of Awadhi (a branch of Hindi)] By Baburam Saksena</ref>

==In popular culture==
Before 1990, most of the Indian movies were influenced by Awadhi language such as [[Ganga Jumna]].<ref>[http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/dilip-kumar-is-my-idol-amitabh-bachchan-3040.html.htm]</ref> Awadhi had also been used in various Hindi movies like [[Lagaan]], [[Peepli Live]], [[Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge]], [[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]], [[Haasil]] and [[Billu]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/language/awa?ref_=tt_dt_dt</ref>

[[Amitabh Bachhan]] has used Awadhi in his many movies and songs like ''Holi Khere Raghuvira Awadh Ma'' from [[Baghban]] and ''Ek Rahe Eer Ek Rahe Beer'' from [[Bhootnath]]. Recently in a serial [[Yudh (TV series)]] aired on [[Sony Entertainment Television (India)]], he delivered few dialogues in Awadhi which was very well appreciated by the Media. According to Hindustan Times, "''We simply loved Amitabh Bachchan speaking Awadhi on TV! Only an actor of his calibre could transform himself from a high-class English speaking businessman to rattle off the dialogues in Awadhi, his mother tongue. He has done it in the past for a few Bollywood and regional films, but not as regularly as one would have liked him to show off grasp over the language. It was great to see him speak in fluent Awadhi in Wednesday's episode.''"<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/yudh-review-amitabh-bachchan-s-show-limps-back-to-sluggish-pace/article1-1241418.aspx</ref>

==Geographical Boundary==

Awadhi can roughly claim to be the language of the tract lying between Bareilly to Allahabad, north of the Yamuna river and south of Mahabharat range in Nepal, cornered by [[Etawah]] in south-east and [[Khalilabad, India|Khalilabad]] of Basti Janpad in northeast. This makes Awadhi as the singly the most widely spoken dialect of Hindi.

Note that the above table is mostly based on talking to a male who is older or of the same age. At other times, "tumar" tends to be "tohaar" and "tor" (for a younger person).
While talking to someone, people often use the word "falane" or "falana" to refer to someone unnamed or unknown, like, "Falana ke bappa hinya aye rahain" which means, His (which is unnamed or he who can not be named) father has come here.
