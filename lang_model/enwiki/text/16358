'''Cullen Andrew Battle''' (1829-1905)

Cullen Battle was a native of Georgia and worked as a lawyer in [[Alabama]]. He was extremely active in politics and held a position as lieutenent-colonel of the local militia before the war. When the war began in he was appointed as major in the 3rd Alabama Infantry on [[April 28]], [[1861 ]]and was sent with the regiment to Norfolk, [[Virginia]]. On July 31, he was promoted to lieutenent-colonel of the regiment. He fought at the Battle of Seven Pines and was promoted to colonel on [[May 31]], [[1862]]. He missed the Seven Days Battles but returned to the army in time for the Maryland Campaign, in September 1862, fighting at South Mountain and Antietam. He was injured after falling from his horse just before the Chancellorsville Campaign and was forced to relinquish command. He re-assumed command a day later but his injuries were aggravated when his horse jumped a ditch, forcing him to relinquish command again.

Battle returned to the regiment for the Gettysburg Campaign. The 3rd Alabama was one of the brigades in Edward O'Neal's Brigade, fighting on Oak Ridge on July 1. After O'Neal's Brigade had been terribly disorganized by the first day of battle, Colonel Battle attached his regiment to Stephen D. Ramseur's Brigade for the remainder of the battle. General Robert E. Lee became displeased with the performance of O'Neal and relieved him of command puting Battle in his place. He led the brigade through the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor. 

Battle's Brigade became a member of General Jubal A. Early's Army of the Valley and participated in the Battle of Monocacy in Maryland and the Battle of Fort Stevens on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. Back in the Shenandoah Valley, he fought at the Third Battle of Winchester, Fisher's Hill, and was wounded at Cedar Creek. His wound did not permit him to return to duty before the close of hostilities. 

After the war he returned to law. Battle was denied a seat in Congress and instead became mayor of New Bern, North Carolina where he also became a newspaper editor.<ref>Sifakis, Who Was Who in the Confederacy</ref>
