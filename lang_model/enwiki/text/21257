The '''Red Panda''', also called the '''Firefox''' or '''Lesser Panda''' (taxonomic name: '''''Ailurus fulgens''''', "shining cat"), is a small [[arboreal]] [[mammal]] and the only species of the genus ''[[Ailurus]]''. It has been previously classified in the families [[Procyonidae]] ([[raccoon]]) And [[Ursidae]] ([[bears]]), but recent research has placed it in its own family [[Ailuridae]].<ref name="Flynn_2000"/> Two subspecies are recognised.

[[endemism|Endemic]] to the temperate forests of the [[Himalaya]]s, the Red Panda ranges from [[Nepal]] in the west to [[China]] in the east. It is also found in northern [[India]], [[Bhutan]] and northern [[Burma|Myanmar]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Stone |first = David |title = Raccoons and their relatives |publisher = International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Species Survival Commission |isbn = 2831700515}}</ref> Slightly larger than a domestic cat, it has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs. The Red Panda eats mainly bamboo, but is omnivorous and may also consume eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals. It is a solitary animal, mainly active at dusk and dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.

Classified as Vulnerable on the [[IUCN red list]] (2009.01), the Red Panda is listed in [[CITES]] appendix I. Accurate population figures are difficult to find, with estimates of wild populations ranging from 11,000 to 20,000 worldwide. Although it is protected by law in all countries where it lives, its numbers continue to decline mainly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression.<ref name="iucn"/>

The Red Panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. As of 2006 the international studbook shows more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world.

==Etymology==

[[File:Red panda ocean park hk.jpg|thumb |left | Red panda]]<!--Still looking for a really good "Firefox" illustration (backlit by sun?). Denver Zoo has one but it's probably not public domain-->
English soldier and naturalist [[Thomas Hardwicke]] introduced this animal as the "Red Panda" to Europeans in 1821. The Western word "Panda" has no conclusive source. The names ''nigalya ponya'' and ''nyala ponga'' are often mentioned, and are said to mean "eater of bamboo" in Nepali. However, none of these words appear in Nepali-English dictionaries.<ref>Kr<U+00E4>mer, Karl-Heinz. {{cite web|url=http://www.nepalresearch.org/dictionaries/nep_eng/nep_eng.pdf |title=Nepli-English Dictionary |accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite Web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/turner/ |title=A Comparative and Etymological Dictionary or the Nepali Language (online version) |accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref> The Red Panda is also known as the ''Wah'' because of its distinctive cry, and has been called a Cat Bear because it was thought to be related to a small bear and washes itself like a cat by licking its entire body. Other names include Lesser Panda, Bear Cat, Bright Panda, Common Panda, Fire Fox, Red Fox, Fox Bear, Himalayan Raccoon, Cokoloaca Pigara, Gambawarella, Nigalya Ponya, Panda Chico, Panda <U+00C9>clatant, Petit Panda, Poonya, Crimson Ngo, Red Cat, Sankam, Small Panda, Thokya, Wokdonka, Woker and Ye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailufulg.htm|title=Animal Info - Red Panda|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>

==Phylogenetics ==
{{Main|Ailuridae}}
The [[taxonomic]] classification of the Red Panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Cuvier]] initially described the Red Panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the [[Raccoon]] ([[Procyonidae]]), even though he gave it the genus name ''Ailurus'' "cat" based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The specific epithet is the [[Latin]] adjective ''fulgens'' "shining".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> At various times it has been placed in [[Procyonidae]], [[Ursidae]], with ''Ailuropoda'' in [[Ailuridae]], and in its own family, [[Ailuridae]]. This uncertainty comes from difficulty determining whether certain characteristics of ''Ailurus'' are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman">{{cite journal| last = Roberts |first=M. S. |last2=Gittleman |first2=J.

Evidence based on the [[fossil record]], [[serology]], [[karyology]], [[behavior]], [[anatomy]], and [[reproduction]] reflect closer affinities with [[Procyonidae]] than [[Ursidae]]. However, ecological and [[foraging]] specializations and distinct geographical distribution in relation to modern [[Procyonids]] support classification in a separate family ([[Ailuridae]]).<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman"/><ref name="woz_2005">{{cite book|last=Wozencraft|first=W.

Recent [[molecular]]-[[systematic]] [[DNA]] research also places the Red Panda into its own family [[Ailuridae]], which is in turn part of the broad superfamily ''[[Musteloidea]]'' that also includes the [[Mephitidae]] (skunks), [[Procyonidae]] (raccoons), and [[Mustelidae]] (weasels) families.<ref name="Flynn_1998">{{cite journal|last=Flynn |first=J.

===Subspecies===

There are two [[Extant taxon|extant]] subspecies of Red Panda. The Western Red Panda (''Ailurus fulgens fulgens'' <small>F. G. Cuvier, 1825</small>) lives in the western part of its range ([[Nepal]], [[Assam]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]]), and the somewhat larger Styan's Red Panda (''Ailurus fulgens refulgens'' <small>Milne-Edwards, 1874</small> or ''Ailurus fulgens styani'' <small>Thomas, 1902</small>) lives in the east-northeastern part of its range (southern [[China]] and northern [[Myanmar]]).<ref name="woz_2005"/> As of 2009, there is still some confusion about the subspecies names. Some sources including the studbook <ref name="studbook/styani">[[#studbook_styani|Glatston 2007b]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|title=NCBI Database|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> show the name of the Eastern subspecies as "styani" while other sources show it as "refulgens."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/|title=Mammal Species of the World, 3rd edition (MSW3)|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=621846|title=Ailurus fulgens (Taxonomical Serial No.: 621846)|publisher=ITIS (USDA Intgrated Taxonomic Information System|accessdate=2009-10-24}}

===Evolutionary history===

The Red Panda is only distantly related to the [[Giant Panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''); the [[common ancestor]] can be traced back to the Early [[Tertiary]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across [[Eurasia]]. [[Fossil]]s of the Red Panda have been unearthed from China in the east to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (''Parailurus anglicus'') in the west (Hu, 1990,Ro), and most recently a handful of [[fossil]]s (''Pristinailurus bristoli'', [[Miocene]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lioncrusher.com/animal.asp?animal=83|title=Red Panda|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsu.edu/grayfossilsite/Red_Panda|title=Second record of the Red Panda in North America|accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> considered to be a new genus and species of the Red Panda)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.org/expeditions/rrc/wang/documents/WallaceandWang2004Nature_000.pdf|title=Two new carnivores from an unusual late Tertiary forest biota in eastern North America|accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> have also been discovered in [[North America]].

== Distribution and habitat == 
[[Image:Ailurus fulgens red panda.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Panda sleeping in a tree.]] 

The Red Panda is found mainly in [[temperate forest]]s in the Himalayas, especially in the foothills of western [[Nepal]], southern [[Tibet]], [[Sikkim]], [[Assam]] and [[Bhutan]], in the northern mountains of [[Myanmar]], and in southern China in the provinces of [[Sichuan]] (Hengduan Mountains) and [[Yunnan]] (Gongshan Mountains). It may also live in southwest Tibet and northern [[Arunachal Pradesh]], but this has not been documented.<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman"/> The Red Panda has become extinct in the Chinese provinces of [[Guizhou]], [[Gansu]], [[Shaanxi]] and [[Qinghai]].<ref name="Wei">{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=F.|last2=Feng|first2=Z.|last3=Wang|first3=Z.|last4=Hu|first4=J.|title=Current distribution, status and conservation of wild red pandas Ailurus fulgens in China|journal=Biological Conservation|issue=89|pages=285<U+2013>291|date=1999}} [http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/portal/p_detail.php?recordid=11586 Abstract retrieved on 2009-09-26]</ref>

The effective population size of the [[Sichuan]] population is larger and more stable than that of the [[Yunnan]] population, implying a southward expansion from Sichuan to Yunnan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/18/6/1070|title=Genetic Diversity and Population History of the Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens) as Inferred from Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variations|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> Locations with the highest density of Red Pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been a refuge for a variety of endemic species in the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman"/> 

Distribution of the Red Panda is disjointed. The [[Brahmaputra]] river, where it makes a curve around the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], is often considered the natural division between the two subspecies, although some authors suggest that ''A. f fulgens'' extends farther eastward, into China. 

The Red Panda lives between {{convert|2200|and|4800|m|ft|sp=us}} altitude, inhabiting areas of moderate temperature (between {{convert|10|and|25|C|F|disp=s}}) with little annual change. It prefers mountainous mixed [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]] forests, especially with old trees and dense understories of [[bamboo]].<ref name="glatston_1994_20">[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:20]]</ref>

==Biology and behaviour ==

[[Image:RedPanda.jpg|thumb|left|Red Panda in a tree]]
===Physical characteristics===
The Red Panda is {{convert|79|to|120|cm|abbr=on}} long, including the tail length of {{convert|30|to|60|cm|abbr=on}}. Males weigh {{convert|4.5|to|6.2|kg|0|abbr=on}}; females {{convert|3|to|4.5|kg|0|abbr=on}}. It has long, soft reddish-brown fur on its upper parts, blackish fur on its lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and [[robust]] [[cranium|cranial]]-[[teeth|dental]] features. The light face has white badges similar to those of a raccoon, but each individual can have distinctive markings. Its roundish head has medium-sized upright ears, a black nose, and very dark eyes: almost pitch black. Its long bushy tail with six alternating yellowish red transverse [[ochre]] rings provides balance and excellent camouflage against its habitat of moss- and lichen-covered trees. The legs are black, short with thick fur on the soles of the paws hiding scent glands and serving as thermal insulation on snow-covered or ice surfaces.

The Red Panda is specialized as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping of narrow tree branches, leaves and fruit. Like the Giant Panda, it has a <U+201C>false thumb<U+201D> that is an extension of the wrist bone.

[[Image:Tiergarten Schoenbrunn Kleiner Panda 2.jpg|thumb|right|Red Panda sleeping]]
=== Behaviour ===
[[File:Red panda twittering.ogg|thumb | right | Sounds of Red Panda chirping]]
The Red Pandas is [[crepuscular]] (most active at dawn and dusk), sleeping on tree branches or in tree hollows during the day and increasing its activity only in the late afternoon and early evening hours. It is very heat sensitive, with an optimal <U+201C>well-being<U+201D> temperature between {{convert|17|and|25|C|F}}, and cannot tolerate temperatures over {{C to F|25}}.

[[File:Lesser panda standing.jpg|thumb|left|Red Panda standing]]
The Red Panda lives predominantly in trees.  It lives in territories, frequently alone, and only rarely in pairs or family groups. It is genreally quiet except for some [[List of animal sounds|twittering]] and whistling communication sounds. It searches for food at night, running along the ground or through the trees and, after finding food, uses its front paws to place the food into its mouth. The Red Panda drinks by plunging its paw into the water and then licking the paw. Predators of the Red Panda include the [[snow leopard]] (''Uncia uncia''), [[marten]]s ([[Mustelidae]]) and people.

The Red Panda starts its day by cleaning its fur like a cat, licking its front paws and then rubbing its back, stomach and sides. It also rubs its back and belly along the sides of trees or rocks. Then it patrols its territory, marking it with a weak musk-smelling secretion from its anal gland and with its urine.

If a Red Panda feels threatened or senses danger, it will often try to climb into an inaccessible rock column or tree. If it can no longer flee, it stands on its hind legs, which makes it appear larger and lets it use the claws on its front paws, which can inflict substantial damage, to protect itself.

[[Image:Chengdu-firefox-d03.jpg|thumb|Red Pandas eating bamboo]]

=== Diet ===
The Red Panda eats mostly [[bamboo]]. Like the Giant Panda, it cannot digest [[cellulose]], so it must consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Its diet consists of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat berries, fruit, mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichen, grasses, and they are known to supplement their diet with young birds, fish, eggs, small rodents, and insects on occasion. In captivity they will readily eat meat. Red Pandas are excellent climbers and forage largely in trees. The Red Panda does little more than eat and sleep due to its low-calorie diet.

[[File:red panda gnawing.jpg|thumb|left|Red Panda gnawing on an exfoliated bamboo bush]]
Bamboo shoots are more easily digested than leaves and exhibit the highest digestibility in the summer and autumn, intermediate in the spring, and low in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. The Red Panda poorly processes bamboo, especially the cellulose and cell wall components. This implies that microbial digestion plays only a minor role in its digestive strategy. In order to survive on this poor-quality diet, the Red Panda has to select high-quality sections of the bamboo plant such as the tender leaves and shoots in large quantities (over {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|disp=s}} of fresh leaves and {{convert|4|kg|lb|disp=s}} of fresh shoots daily). This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (~2<U+2013>4 hours) so as to maximize nutrient intake.<ref name="wei_1999">{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Fuwen|last2=Feng|first2=Zuojian|last3=Wang|first3=Zuwang|last4=Zhou|first4=Ang|last5=Hu|first5=Jinchu|date=1999|title=Use of the nutrients in bamboo by the red panda Ailurus fulgens|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=248|pages=535-541}} [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=7C61826E7240EC726B1FA89821284A54.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=41543 Abstract] retrieved on 2009-10-25</ref>

Studies in 2008 showed that the Red Panda can taste artificial sweeteners such as [[aspartame]], the only known non-primate to be able to do so.<ref>{{cite web|first=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8002978.stm|title=Pandas opt for low-cal sweeteners|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>

[[File:Red pandas playing.jpg|thumb|right|Red Panda cubs playing]]

=== Reproduction ===
Red panda adults rarely interact in the wild except to mate. Both sexes may mate with more than one partner during the mating season, which is between mid-January and early March.<ref name="Nowak">{{cite book|last=R. M.|first=Nowak|title=Walker<U+2019>s Mammals of the World|publisher=John Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|date=1999|edition=sixth|volume=2|pages=695-696|isbn=0-8018-5789-9|url=http://books.google.com/books/jhu?q=ailurus+fulgens&hl=en&vid=9780801857898&btnG=Go#v=snippet&q=ailurus%20fulgens&f=false|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> After a gestation period of 112 to 158 days, the female gives birth between mid-June and late July, to between one and four blind cubs weighing {{convert|110|to|130|g|oz}} each. A few days before the birth the female begins to collect material, such as brushwood, grass and leaves, to use for the nest. The nest is normally located in a hollow tree or a rock crevice.<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman"/>

After the birth, the mother cleans the cubs and can then recognize each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% of her time with the cubs. After one week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. The young are moved frequently between several nests, all of which the female keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes when they are about 18 days old, and by about 90 days have achieved full adult fur and coloring. They remain in the nest for twelve weeks, after which they will venture out and start eating solid foods. After they leave the nest they will remain with their mother, weaning at around 6<U+2013>8 months of age.<ref name="Roberts/Gittleman"/>

The cubs will stay with their mother until the next litter is born the following summer. The males only very rarely help with the raising of young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups. The Red Panda is able to reproduce from around 18 months of age, and is fully mature at 2<U+2013>3 years. The average lifespan is 8<U+2013>10 years, but individuals have been known to reach 15 years.

== Threats ==
The primary threats to Red Pandas are direct harvest from the wild (live or dead), competition from domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and [[deforestation]] resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The relative importance of these factors is different in each region, and is not well understood.<ref name="glatston_1994_20"/>
For instance, in India the biggest threat seems to be habitat loss followed by poaching, while in China the biggest threat seems to be hunting and poaching.<ref name="iucn"/> A 40% decrease in Red Panda populations has been reported in China over the last 50 years,
and populations in western/Himalayan areas are considered to be lower.<ref name="Wei"/>

[[Deforestation]] can inhibit the spread of Red Pandas and exacerbate the natural population subdivision by [[topography]] and [[ecology]], leading to severe fragmentation of the remaining wild population. For example, less than 40 animals in 4 separate groups share resources of a preserve in Nepal with humans (only 6% of its 1710&nbsp;km<U+00B2> is preferred Red Panda habitat). Although direct competition for food with domestic livestock is not significant, [[livestock]] can depress bamboo growth by trampling.<ref name="Yonzon">{{cite journal|last=Yonzon|first=P. B.|last2=Hunter Jr.|first2=M. L.|title=Conservation of the red panda Ailurus fulgens|journal=Biological Conservation|issue=57|date=1991}} [http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/portal/p_detail.php?recordid=12109 Abstract] retrieved 2009-09-26</ref>
Small groups of animals with little opportunity for exchange between them face the risk of inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clearcutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.<ref name="glatston_1994_20"/>

In southwest [[China]], Red Pandas are hunted for their [[fur]], especially for the highly-valued bushy [[tail]]s from which [[hats]] are produced. In these areas, the fur is often used for local cultural [[ceremonies]], and in [[wedding]]s the [[bridegroom]] traditionally carries the hide. The "good-luck charm" Red Panda-tail hats are also used by Chinese newlyweds.<ref name="Wei"/>

Until recently, Red Pandas were captured and sold to [[zoo]]s. Glatston reports that "in ''International Zoo News'', Munro (1969) reported he personally had handled 350 Red Pandas in seventeen years."<ref name="glatston_1994_11">[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:11]]</ref>
Thanks to [[CITES]] this number has decreased substantially in recent years, but poaching continues and Red Pandas are often sold to private collectors at exorbitant prices. In some parts of Nepal and India, the Red Panda is kept as a pet.<ref>{{Cite Web

The Red Panda has a naturally low birth rate (usually single or twin births per year), and a high death rate in the wild.

== Conservation ==

[[Image:Panda rouge.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Red Panda has been confused with other animals]]
The Red Panda is classified as vulnerable in the [[IUCN Red List]] (2009.01),<ref name="iucn"/> and is included in [[CITES]] Appendix I.<ref>[http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml CITES Appendix I, II, and III]</ref>
Reliable population numbers are hard to find, partly because other animals have been mistaken for the the Red Panda. For instance, one report from Myanmar stated that Red Pandas were still fairly common in some areas, and was accompanied by a photograph of a <U+201C>Red Panda<U+201D> as proof. The photograph in question depicted a species of civet.<ref>[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:viii]]</ref>

The Red Panda is protected in all countries where it lives, and hunting it is illegal.<ref name="iucn"/>
Beyond this, conservation efforts are highly variable between countries:
* [[Nepal]] has one of the highest rates of deforestation in [[Asia]]. This country has several protected areas ([[Langtang National Park]], the Dhorpan Game Reserve, [[Sagarmatha National Park]], Makulu National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, and the Rara National Park). However, some of these areas suffer from human pressure. 
* [[Bhutan]] is probably one of the most unspoilt countries in Asia. It still retains large areas of forest. As of 2009, there are nine protected areas (Jigme Dorji National Park, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Royal Manas National Park, Thrumshingla National Park, Bomdeling Wildlife Sanctuary and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary),<ref>{{cite web

The Red Panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. In 1992 there were more than 300 individuals distributed in 85 zoos.<ref>{{cite Web

In 2001 there were 182 individuals in North America alone,<ref>{{cite Web

|last=ARKive
|date=2008
|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>
and by 2006 there were 511 individuals of subspecies ''fulgens'' in 173 institutions,<ref name="studbook/fulgens">[[#studbook_fulgens|Glatston 2007a]]</ref> and 306 of subspecies ''refulgens'' (=''styani'') in 81 institutions.<ref name="studbook/styani">[[#studbook_styani|Glatston 2007b]]</ref>

There are several regional [[captive breeding]] programs ([[Species Survival Plan|SSP]] in North America, [[European Endangered Species Programme|EEP]] in [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[India]],<ref name="india/studbook"/> [[Japan]] and [[China]]), all of which are coordinated through the International Studbook (currently managed at the Rotterdam Zoo), and the ''International Red Panda Management Group''.<ref name="studbook/styani"/>
In 2009, Sarah Glass, curator of Red Pandas and special exhibits at the [[Knoxville Zoo]], was named the coordinator for the North American Red Panda [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP). The Knoxville zoo has the largest number of captive Red Panda births in the Western Hemisphere (93 as of September 2009). Only the [[Rotterdam Zoo]] in the [[Netherlands]] has had more captive births.<ref name="studbook/fulgens"/><ref name="studbook/styani"/>

Recent successes in Red Panda [[captive breeding]] include:

* Triplets in September 2009 at the [[Cleveland Metroparks Zoo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woio.com/global/story.asp?s=11112684|title=Newborns: Red Panda Bear Triplets Born at Cleveland MetroParks Zoo|date=Sep 11, 2009|publisher=19ActionNews.com|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>
* Twins in 2008 and triplets on June 11, 2009 at the [[Red River Zoo]], in [[Fargo, North Dakota]].<ref>[http://redriverzooredpandas.blogspot.com Triplets at the Red River Zoo]</ref>

* The [[Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park]] at Darjeeling successfully released four captive bred Red Pandas to the wild in 2003 (two in August and two in November).<ref name="india/studbook">[http://www.cza.nic.in/redpandastudbook.pdf India Studbook 2009]</ref> Plans to reintroduce two more Red Pandas to the wild in the spring of 2008<ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/rjeeling-zoo-to-release-endangered-red-pandas-in-the-wild_1008269.html More red panda releases?]</ref> were evidently canceled or delayed, as the releases are not recorded in the studbook as of May 2009.
