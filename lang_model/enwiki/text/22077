'''Kaavya Viswanathan''' (born [[January 16]], [[1987]]) is an [[Indian-American]] undergraduate student at [[Harvard College]]. She came to public attention when her debut novel,  ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life'', was revealed to have been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from multiple sources.

She was born in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and raised in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], and later in [[Millburn, New Jersey]] and [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]], [[United States]].<ref>[http://in.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/27ajp.htm "Kaavya Viswanathan takes a break from Harvard"], Arthur J. Pais, Rediff, April 27, 2006.</ref>

==Book deal==
Viswanathan began writing ''Opal Mehta'' while attending [[Bergen County Academies]], a public [[magnet school|magnet]] [[high school]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/ent/arts/articles/0428novel.html "Once-touted novel has uncertain future"], ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', [[April 28]], [[2006]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]]. "Weems, who taught literature to Viswanathan when she was a junior at Bergen County Academies in New Jersey, remembered her as a gifted student and as the winner of a number of writing contests."</ref> After receiving an [[early action|early acceptance]] to Harvard, she showed her work to Katherine Cohen of [[IvyWise]] (a private college admissions consultancy), whom Kaavya's parents had hired to help with admission. Cohen contacted the [[William Morris Agency]], which suggested that Viswanathan work with a division of [[Alloy Entertainment]]. Alloy is a media firm responsible for packaging the ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' book series and [[Ann Brashares]]' ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]].'' Viswanathan eventually signed a two-book deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]] for an advance originally reported to be $500,000. Michael Pietsch, the senior vice president and publisher of Little, Brown, told the New York Times that the advance was less than the reported sum, and was split between Kaavya and Alloy Entertainment. She sold the movie rights of the book to [[DreamWorks SKG]].

==The Novel==
The novel deals with an academically oriented Indian-American girl who, after being told by a Harvard admissions person that she isn't well rounded, doggedly works to become a typical American teen<U+2014>ultrasocial, shopping- and boy-driven, carelessly hip.  

''Opal Mehta'' garnered mixed reviews,<ref>"Overshooting the mark; her fictional character is aiming for normal.

==Plagiarism accusations==
===Megan McCafferty===
On [[April 23]], [[2006]], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' reported that several portions of ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got A Life'' appeared to have been plagiarized from ''Sloppy Firsts'' and ''Second Helpings'', both written by [[Megan McCafferty]].<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948 "Student<U+2019>s Novel Faces Plagiarism Controversy"], David Zhou,, ''The Harvard Crimson'', [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> 

McCafferty has stated that she learned about Viswanathan's plagiarism through a fan's e-mail on April 11th, the same day "Charmed Thirds" was released, and roughly two weeks before the Crimson broke the story. According to McCafferty: "[The email's subject] read: "'Flattery or a case for litigation.' I thought, oh my God, somebody's suing me." McCafferty looked into the suspect passages at the fan's prompting. She said that reading Viswanathan's book was like "recognizing your own child's face. My own words were just leaping out at me page after page after page." <ref>[http://bulletin.gmnews.com/news/2006/0518/Front_Page/006.html "Author McCafferty talks shop with Brick's Lit Chicks"], Colleen Lutolf, ''Brick Township Bulletin'', [[May 18]], 2006.</ref>

Much earlier, in an interview given to ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' of [[Newark, New Jersey]], when asked about her influences Viswanathan had responded that "nothing" she had read gave her the inspiration to write her book.<ref>Hyman, Vicki. [http://www.nj.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-6/1145943324186730.xml?starledger?ntop&coll=1 "For new author, a difficult opening chapter"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', [[April 25]], [[2006]].</ref>

However, days later, Little, Brown issued a statement in which Viswanathan "admitted" that she "accidentally" borrowed some passages from Megan McCafferty's novels. She said:

:''"When I was in high school, I read and loved two wonderful novels by Megan McCafferty,'' Sloppy Firsts '' and '' Second Helpings, '' which spoke to me in a way few other books did. Recently, I was very surprised and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel ... and passages in these books.''

:''While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasn't aware of how much I may have internalized Ms. McCafferty's words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious. My publisher and I plan to revise my novel for future printings to eliminate any inappropriate similarities.''

:''I sincerely apologize to Megan McCafferty and to any who feel they have been misled by these unintentional errors on my part."''

In response, [[Random House]], publisher of ''Sloppy Firsts'' and ''Second Helpings,'' issued a statement:

:''"We find both the responses of Little Brown and their author Kaayva'' [sic] ''Viswanathan deeply troubling and disingenuous. Ms. Viswanathan's claim that similarities in her phrasing were 'unconscious' or 'unintentional' is suspect. We have documented more than forty passages from Kaavya Viswanathan's recent publication 'How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life' that contain identical language and/or common scene or dialogue structure from Megan McCafferty's first two books, 'Sloppy Firsts' and 'Second Helpings.' This extensive taking from Ms. McCafferty's books is nothing less than an act of literary identity theft.''

:''Based on the scope and character of the similarities, it is inconceivable that this was a display of youthful innocence or an unconscious or unintentional act."''

===TV interview===
On [[April 26]], [[2006]], Viswanathan appeared on ''[[The Today Show]]'' with [[Katie Couric]]. In the interview with Couric, she maintained her innocence, saying that any and all similarities were "completely unintentional" and that she must have "internalized" those details without realizing it.

She also claimed to have attempted to contact author McCafferty (of whom she admitted to being "a big fan") after the scandal.  McCafferty later denied this in an interview with ''[[People Magazine]]'', saying, "To my knowledge, this is not the case."

===Additional accusations===
On May 1, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a story giving national prominence to claims on the [[Sepia Mutiny]] blog that Viswanathan may have lifted text from [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories]].''<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/business/media/01link.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&OP=3911ec72Q2F(qPX(2xLn9xxQ5Eb(bQ25Q25Y(Q253(Q25Q5D(XQ7EnSQ3EPnn(-P2SD(Q25Q5DQ22SQ3EfimQ5E-Q22 "In Internet Age, Writers Face Frontier Justice"], Tom Zeller Jr., ''New York Times'', May 1, 2006.</ref>

*:On page 35 of Rushdie's novel, one of the warnings reads: "If from speed you get your thrill / take precaution<U+2014>make your will."

*:On page 118 of Viswanathan's novel, one of the posters reads: "If from drink you get your thrill, take precaution<U+2014>write your will."

*:On page 31 of Rushdie's novel, another warning reads: "All the dangerous overtakers / end up safe as undertaker's."

*:On page 119 of Viswanathan's novel, another poster reads: "All the dangerous drug abusers end up safe as total losers." 

May 2 brought two additional charges. ''[[The New York Times]]'' alleged "striking similarities" between passages in ''Opal Mehta'' and those in a "chick-lit" novel called ''[[Can You Keep a Secret? (novel)|Can You Keep a Secret?]]'' by [[Sophie Kinsella]]. 

*From Can You Keep a Secret?:

:<U+201C>And we<U+2019>ll tell everyone you got your Donna Karan coat from a discount warehouse shop.<U+201D>

:Jemima gasps. <U+201C>I didn<U+2019>t!<U+201D> she says, color suffusing her cheeks.

:<U+201C>You did! I saw the carrier bag,<U+201D> I chime in. <U+201C>And we<U+2019>ll make it public that your pearls are cultured, not real<U+2026><U+201D>

:Jemima claps a hand over her mouth<U+2026>
:<U+201C>OK!<U+201D> says Jemima, practically in tears. <U+201C>OK! I promise I<U+2019>ll forget all about it. I promise! Just please don<U+2019>t mention the discount warehouse shop. Please.<U+201D>

*From Viswanathan's Book:

:<U+201C>And I<U+2019>ll tell everyone that in eighth grade you used to wear a <U+2018>My Little Pony<U+2019> sweatshirt to school every day,<U+201D> I continued.

:Priscilla gasped. <U+201C>I didn<U+2019>t!<U+201D> she said, her face purpling again.

:<U+201C>You did! I even have pictures,<U+201D> I said. <U+201C>And I<U+2019>ll make it public that you named your dog Pythagoras<U+2026><U+201D>

:Priscilla opened her mouth and gave a few soundless gulps<U+2026>
:<U+201C>Okay, fine!<U+201D> she said in complete consternation. <U+201C>Fine! I promise I<U+2019>ll do whatever you want. I<U+2019>ll talk to the club manager. Just please don<U+2019>t mention the sweatshirt. Please.<U+201D>

Viswanathan and her publisher declined to comment on these allegations.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/books/02auth.html&OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hpQ26exQ3D1146542400Q26enQ3D98fa1c6ed2e3db16Q26eiQ3D5094Q26partnerQ3Dhomepage&OP=44869541Q2F-0KE-Q5EQ2AUJpQ2AQ2AQ7CQ5D-Q5D88Q5B-8D-8Q5D-EQ2AQ2A.J-8Q5DQ3CQ27Q7CTQ22TQ7CeY "A Second Ripple in Plagiarism Scandal"], Dinitia Smith and Moto Rich, ''[[New York Times]],'' [[May 2]], [[2006]]</ref> In addition, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' alleged that Viswanathan appeared to have borrowed passages from [[Meg Cabot]]'s 2000 novel ''[[The Princess Diaries]].''<ref name="crimson20060502">[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513213 "<U+2018>Opal<U+2019> Similar to More Books"], Paras D. Bhayani and David Zhou, ''The Harvard Crimson,'' May 2, 2006</ref>

*Page 12 of ''The Princess Diaries'' reads: "There isn<U+2019>t a single inch of me that hasn<U+2019>t been pinched, cut, filed, painted, sloughed, blown dry, or moisturized. [...] Because I don<U+2019>t look a thing like Mia Thermopolis. Mia Thermopolis never had fingernails. Mia Thermopolis never had blond highlights. Mia Thermopolis never wore makeup or [[Gucci]] shoes or [[Chanel]] skirts or [[Christian Dior]] bras, which by the way don<U+2019>t even come in 32A, which is my size. I don<U+2019>t even know who I am anymore. It certainly isn't Mia Thermopolis. ''She<U+2019>s turning me into someone else.''"

*Page 59 of Viswanathan<U+2019>s novel reads: "Every inch of me had been cut, filed, steamed, exfoliated, polished, painted, or moisturized. I didn<U+2019>t look a thing like Opal Mehta. Opal Mehta didn<U+2019>t own five pairs of shoes so expensive they could have been traded in for a small sailboat. She didn<U+2019>t wear makeup or [[Manolo Blahnik]]s or Chanel sunglasses or [[Habitual]] jeans or [[La Perla (clothing)|La Perla]] bras. She never owned enough cashmere to make her concerned for the future of the [[Kazakhstan]]i mountain goat population. I was turning into someone else."

*Page 126 of ''The Princess Diaries'' reads: "And it is sort of hard when all these beautiful, fashionable people are telling you how good you'd look in this and how much that would bring out your cheekbones. . . . And I kept telling myself, She's only doing this because she loves you. . . .".

*Page 58 of Viswanathan's novel reads:  ''In my defense, it was hard to be uptight and prickly while surrounded by beautiful, fashionable people all telling me how good I'd look in that shade and what this color would do to enhance my cheekbones."

*Page 127 of ''The Princess Diaries'' reads: "Meanwhile, Paulo was picking up chunks of my hair and making this face and going, all sadly, ''It must go. It must all go. And it went. All of it. Well, almost all of it. I still have some like bangs and a little fringe in back."

*Opal Mehta, page 57 reads: "The whole time, Frederic (I wondered if anyone dared call him Freddie) kept picking up long strands of my hair and making sad faces. ''It must go," he said. ''It must all go. And it went. Not all of it, because after four inches vanished, I started making panicked, whimpering sounds that touched even Frederic's heart . . ."

Viswanathan again declined to comment.<ref name="crimson20060502"/>

On May 3, the ''Harvard Independent'' noted passages in ''Opal Mehta'' similar to ''Born Confused'' by [[Tanuja Desai Hidier]], another young adult novel about an Indian-American teenager.  They cite "uncanny resemblance in imagery, sentence structure, and paragraph organization" between the two books.<ref>[http://harvardindependent.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleID=9964 "Yet More Suspicious Passages Found in Kaavya<U+2019>s Opal Mehta"], Jon Liu, ''Harvard Independent,'' May 3, 2006</ref>

*From page 13 of ''Born Confused'':

:"India. I had few memories of the place, but the ones I held were dream clear: Bathing in a bucket as a little girl. The unnerving richness of buffalo milk drunk from a pewter cup. My Dadaji pouring tea into a saucer so it would cool faster, sipping from the edge of the thin dish, never spilling a drop. A whole host of kitchen gods (looking so at home in the undishwashed unmicrowaved room). Meera Maasi crouching on the floor to sift the stones from rice. Cows huddled in the middle of the vegetable market, sparrows nesting on their backs. Hibiscus so brilliant they look like they<U+2019>d caught fire. Children with red hair living in tires. A perpetual squint against sun and dust. The most delicious orange soda I<U+2019>ve ever drunk <U+2014> the cap-split hiss, and then the bubbling jetstream down a parched throat."

*From pages 230-1 of ''Opal Mehta'':

:"I had only a few memories of India; the last time my family visited was six years ago, when I was in the sixth grade<U+2026>.Some impressions stood out sharply in my mind, still as clear as freshly developed Polaroids. I remembered the cold, creamy taste of fresh buffalo milk, Babaji pouring [[Ovaltine]] from one tin cup to another until froth bubbled thickly on the surface and it was cool enough to drink. I remembered shooting rockets made of coconut leaves off the rooftop terrace, and watching the beady-eyed green-and-yellow lizards that scuttled over the putty-colored walls after a hard rain. I remembered cold baths from a bucket with a plastic dipper, and sweet, oily badam halva from the nearby Chola hotel. Sometimes I still read the old [[Enid Blyton]] books, which were only available in countries of the former British empire. Most of all, I could close my eyes and return to the smells of sun and dust and refuse, mixed with sharp chilis, my grandmother<U+2019>s soft rose talcum powder, and the heady, sweet scent of blossoming hibiscus."

*From pages 92-3 of ''Born Confused'':

:<U+201C>All day the house had smelled of spices, and now before our eyes lay the resulting combustion of all that kitchen chemistry. The feast my mother had conjured up was extravagant, and I realized how hungry I was; I wasn<U+2019>t a big fan of Indian food, at least not on a daily basis, but today the sight of it was pure poetry.

:"Brown sugar roti and cloud-puff puris just itching to be popped. Coconut rice fluffed up over the silver pot like a sweet-smelling pillow. Samosas transparent, peas bundling just below the surface. Spinach with nymph-finger cloves of garlic that sank like butter on the tongue. A vat of cucumber raita, the two-percent yogurt thickened with sour cream (which my mom added when we had guests, though she denied it when asked; I<U+2019>d seen the empty carton, not a kitten lick left). And the centerpiece: a deep serving dish of lamb curry, the pieces melting tenderly off the bone."

*From page 130 of ''Opal Mehta'':

:"This year, fortunately, there wasn<U+2019>t an egg in sight. Instead, the house had smelled of spices all day, and when we sat down at the dining room table, I nearly combusted at the sight of the extravagant feast my mom had conjured up. Usually I wasn<U+2019>t a big fan of Indian food, but today I was suddenly starving. The table creaked with the weight of crisp, brown rotis and feather-light, puffy puris. A basket of my favorite kheema naan sat beside the clouds of cashew and sultana-studded coconut rice in an enormous pot. There was plump okra fried in oil and garlic till it melted like butter on the tongue, aloo curry studded with peppercorns and glistening chopped chilis, and a crock of raita, a cool, delicious mixture of yogurt and sour cream, bursting with finely chopped onions and cucumbers. The centerpiece was a deep dish of mutton curry, the meat (my mom only used halal bought from an Arab butcher in Edison) already falling off the bone."

*From page 85 of ''Born Confused'':

:"Finally, I tore open the package they made me save for last. Inside, padded carefully between layers of tissue, was an unbelievably resounding salvar khamees, one of those Indian outfits consisting of loose-fitting pants with a long top and scarf, or dupatta. The deep crimson fabric screamed sanguinely open. A river of nearly neon gold dye wound noisily through its length. The salvar was ornately embroidered with gold and silver and garnet beads and little bells that made a racket even as I lifted it out of the box. All in all it was, in fact, so loud I could hear it. Heavy, too <U+2014> funny how all those little driblets could add up."

*From pages 125-6 of ''Opal Mehta'':

:"I looked at the multicolored swirl-patterned box hesitantly. In my past experience, gifts from Edison rarely boded well. And when I tore apart the layers of carefully packed tissue paper, I found an elaborate salwar kameez <U+2014> loose pants, a long tunic-style top, and a trailing scarf, or dupatta. The salwar was a startling peacock-green, and embroidered so ornately with gold and silver threads and glittering beads that it made my eyes hurt. When I lifted it up, the room resounded to the tinkle of thousands of tiny golden bells. It was surprisingly heavy <U+2014> all that jigna really added up <U+2014> and it was the last thing in the world I ever wanted to wear."

As the ''Crimson'' noted, it is not clear the extent to which the similarity between Viswanathan's text and that in other books should be deemed plagiarism, and to what degree it can be explained by her use of tropes common to the "chick lit" genre.<ref name="crimson20060502"/>

Some earlier writing by Viswanathan has come under scrutiny as well; she worked as an intern for ''The Record'' of [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], in 2003 and 2004, and the paper has announced that it will hire a service to review all her writing for them to look for potential plagiarism.<ref>[http://www.wfsb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4849382 "Harvard author faces further allegations of borrowing"], [[Associated Press]], May 2, 2006</ref>

Little, Brown had initially stood behind Viswanathan, but after the new allegations came to light, it recalled all copies of the novel and canceled Viswanathan's UK publicity tour.  The publishing house initially indicated plans to release a revised version of the novel <U+201C>to eliminate any inappropriate similarities.<U+201D> <ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513231 "'Opal Mehta' Gone for Good; Contract Cancelled"], ''Harvard Crimson'', May 2, 2006.</ref> However, on [[May 2]], [[2006]],  Little, Brown released a statement from senior vice president Michael Pietsch saying "Little, Brown and Company will not be publishing a revised edition of ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life'' by Kaavya Viswanathan, nor will we publish the second book under contract."<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060502/ap_on_en_ot/young_author;_ylt=AshpSq10Mqn_m5TAvj02gIJI2ocA;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA-- "Publisher Cancels Deal With Young Author"], Hillel Italie, Associated Press, May 2, 2006.</ref> Earlier, Dreamworks stopped development of the movie.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/3828527.html "Opal Mehta movie version canned"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 28, 2006.</ref>

Kaavya was allowed to remain at Harvard as her plagiarized work was not directly affiliated with her University studies, nor performed during her tenure there.  She is now a senior at the college during the 2007-8 academic year.

==Involvement of Alloy, a book-packaging company==
''The New York Times'' reported that Viswanathan shares a copyright with 17th Street Productions, now called Alloy, a [[book-packaging]] company. Book-packaging companies are hired by publishers to write or co-write novels on the basis of concepts given to them by their clients. In many cases, only the barest outline and character sketches are needed. The book-packaging company, with a staff of in-house writers, does the rest.<ref>[http://www.absolutewrite.com/specialty_writing/juvenile_market.htm "Breaking Into the Juvenile Market as a Writer for Hire"], Rachel Plummer, Absolute Write.</ref>

Viswanathan has asserted that she is indeed the writer of the book, and any plagiarism she conducted was unconscious. Alloy has indicated that despite holding [[copyright]], they were not involved in the writing of the manuscript.{{fact|date=November 2007}}
