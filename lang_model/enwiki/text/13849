The '''Nicole<U+00F1>o''' were a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe living on [[San Nicolas Island]] in [[California]]. [[Juana Maria]], the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas," was the last surviving Nicole<U+00F1>o when she died in 1853.

==History==
Archeological evidence suggests San Nicolas, like the other [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], has been populated for at least 10,000 years, though perhaps not continuously. It is thought the Nicole<U+00F1>o were closely related to the peoples of [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina]] and [[San Clemente Island]]s; these were members of the Takic branch of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] peoples and were related to the [[Tongva]] of modern-day [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. The name "Nicole<U+00F1>o" has been conventional since its use by [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in ''Handbook of Indians of California''; the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] called them the "Niminocotch", and called San Nicolas "Ghalas-at". Their name for themselves is unknown.

The first Old Worlder to contact the Nicole<U+00F1>o was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Juan Rodr<U+00ED>guez Cabrillo]], sailing for [[Spain]]. He landed on San Nicolas in [[December 6]], [[1603]] and reported that the island was densely populated. Little is known of the Nicole<U+00F1>o through the historical record between that date and the early 19th century, but the population seems to have declined significantly, likely due in part to Spanish missionary recruitment efforts, known to have relocated people from the other Channel Islands to the mainland.

In 1811 a party of [[Aleut]]s from [[Russian Alaska]] landed on San Nicolas in search of [[sea otter]] and [[pinniped|seal]]. They fought with the Nicole<U+00F1>o men, probably over hunting rights and women, and many died as a result. The tribe was decimated, and by the 1830s only around twenty remained; some sources put the number at seven, six women and a man named Black Hawk. Hearing of this, the [[Mission Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara Mission]] on the mainland sponsored a rescue mission, and in late 1835 Captain Charles Hubbard sailed out to the Channel Islands aboard the schooner ''Peor es Nada''. Most of the tribe boarded the ship, but one, the woman later known as Juana Maria, did not arrive before a storm rose and the ship had to return to port. Hubbard was unable to return for Juana Maria at the time as he had received orders to take a shipment of lumber to [[Monterey, California]], and before he could return to Santa Barbara the ''Peor es Nada'' hit a heavy board in the mouth of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and sank. A lack of other available ships is usually cited as preventing further rescue attempts.

Many of the surviving Nicole<U+00F1>o chose to live at the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc<U+00E1>ngel]], however, they had no immunity to the diseases they encountered there. Black Hawk became blind shortly after arriving, and died when he fell off a steep bank into the water and drowned. The others had also apparently died by the time Juana Maria was rescued. After several other attempts at locating her failed, she was found by Captain [[George Nidever]], who took her to the mainland. None of the local Indians could decipher her language, and she was taken in by Nidever and his wife. However, she contracted dysentery and died only seven weeks after her return to civilization.

==Culture==
Most information about the Nicole<U+00F1>o comes through Juana Maria. When Nidever located her, she was living in a round brush enclosure, about 6 feet in diameter and 5 feet high, with a narrow opening on one side. She cooked her food over a fire inside her home. Several similar enclosures were still standing at the time, and another type of structure, made of brush walls supported by [[whale]] ribs, was also found. Around some of the structures Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of 4 to 8 foot poles, or from ropes stretched between them. Like other California natives, the Nicole<U+00F1>o were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes in the literature about her. When found she was wearing a dress made of green [[cormorant]] skins, decorated with feathers, and had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone.

The first archaeological visit to San Nicolas was by Paul Schumacher for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1875. They uncovered numerous artifacts from surface sites, assumed to be from a later period of Nicole<U+00F1>o culture, as the island's climate is not well suited for preservation. Artifacts collected by these early visitors include grass matting and clothing fragments, bone knives and fishhooks, and [[soapstone]] fish and bird effigies. Nicole<U+00F1>o culture was entirely dependent on the ocean for sustenance, as the island was home to only four types of land animals, none of which were valuable for food. The island is home to a large abundance of fish and sea mammals, as well as birds, which the Nicole<U+00F1>o were skilled at catching.

==Language==
The Nicole<U+00F1>o language is now extinct, and there is very little evidence for it. Kroeber assigned it to the [[Shoshonean languages|Shoshonean stock]], and it is generally accepted it was closely related to the [[Tongva language]] spoken on nearby Santa Catalina Island and in what is now Los Angeles County.  However, a study by [[University of California, Los Angeles]] linguist [[Pamela Munro]] focusing on four words and two songs spoken and sung by Juana Maria suggests Nicole<U+00F1>o was most similar to the [[Luise<U+00F1>o language|related languages]] spoke by the [[Luise<U+00F1>o]]s of Northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] and of the [[Juane<U+00F1>o]]s near [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]]. Others have questioned whether Juana Maria was actually a Nicole<U+00F1>o at all, suggesting she came to the island later, perhaps with the Aleuts after the massacre. In this case her songs would not have been Nicole<U+00F1>o songs at all.
