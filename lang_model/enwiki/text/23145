'''''Wish You Were Here''''' is the seventh [[studio album]] by English [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]], released in September 1975.  Inspired by material they had composed while performing across Europe, it was recorded over numerous sessions at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]]. The album explores themes of absence, the music business, and former band-mate [[Syd Barrett]]'s mental decline.  Initial recording sessions were a difficult and arduous process but it was [[Roger Waters]]' idea to split the centrepiece track "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" in two, and join each half with three new compositions.  "Shine On" was a tribute to Barrett, who, in an ironic twist, made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. The band failed initially to recognise Barrett, who had gained weight and changed his appearance.

As in their previous work, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', the band made use of studio effects and synthesizers.  [[Roy Harper]] was a guest vocalist on "[[Have a Cigar]]".  The album packaging, again designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]], featured an opaque black sleeve inside which was hidden the album artwork.  ''Wish You Were Here'' premi<U+00E8>red at [[Knebworth]] in July 1975, and was released several months later in September.  It was an instant success; record company [[EMI]] was unable to print enough copies to satisfy the demand. Initially receiving mixed reviews, the album has since been voted to the 209th place on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. Band members [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] and [[David Gilmour]] have both declared ''Wish You Were Here'' their favourite Pink Floyd album.

==Background==
During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three new compositions; "Raving and Drooling", "Gotta Be Crazy", and "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]",{{#tag:ref|The first two would later be renamed "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", and "[[Dogs (Pink Floyd song)|Dogs]]", and re-appear on ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]''|group="nb"}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=178}}</ref> and had performed them at a series of concerts in France and England, their first tour since 1973's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.  The band had never employed a publicist, and distanced themselves from the press.  Their relationship with the media soured, and following a deeply cynical critique of the band's new material from Nick Kent (a devotee of [[Syd Barrett]]) and Pete Erskine of the music paper ''[[NME]]'', they returned to the studio in the first week of 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=178&ndash;184}}</ref>

==Concept==
''Wish You Were Here'' is the second Pink Floyd album to use a conceptual theme written entirely by Waters, and echoes his feeling at the time that the camaraderie that had served the band previously, was largely absent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=204}}</ref>  The album begins with an eight minute thirty seconds instrumental preamble, before segueing into the lyrics for "Shine On You Crazy Diamond".  "Shine On" is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett, whose drug-induced breakdown had forced him to leave the band several years before.<ref name="Barrettstory">{{Citation | title = The Pink Floyd And Syd Barrett Story | format = DVD | publisher = [[BBC]] | year = 2003}}</ref>  Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as "Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun" and "You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon".<ref>{{Harvnb|Di Perna|2002|p=23}}</ref>

The album is also a critique of the music business; "Shine On" fades seamlessly into "Welcome to the Machine", which begins with the opening of a door<U+2014>described by Waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success.  The song ends with sounds from a party, epitomising "the lack of contact and real feelings between people".  Similarly, "Have a Cigar" scorns record industry "fatcats", its lyrics containing well-used clich<U+00E9>s such as "can hardly count", "they call it riding the gravy train", and "by the way, which one's Pink?"<U+2014>a question actually asked of the band on at least one occasion.<ref name="Schaffnerp187">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=187}}</ref>  "Wish You Were Here" contains lyrics which relate not only to Barrett's condition, but also to the dichotomy of Waters' character, as an idealist, and a domineering personality.<ref name="Schaffnerp188">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=188}}</ref>  The album closes with a reprise of "Shine On", and further instrumental excursions.

[[Alan Parsons]] was the EMI staff engineer for Pink Floyd's previous studio album ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', but following its release he declined their offer to continue working with them (instead becoming successful in his own right with [[The Alan Parsons Project]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=177}}</ref>  The group had worked with Brian Humphries on ''[[Soundtrack from the Film More|More]]''<U+2014>recorded at Pye Studios<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p.&nbsp;134, p.&nbsp;200}}</ref><U+2014>and again in 1974, where he replaced a somewhat inexperienced concert engineer hired at short notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=200}}</ref>  He was therefore the natural choice to work on the band's new material, although as a stranger to EMI's Abbey Road set-up he encountered some early difficulties, including one instance where he was inadvertently responsible for spoiling the backing tracks of "Shine On"<U+2014>a piece that Waters and Mason had spent many hours perfecting.  The entire piece, corrupted with [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]], had to be re-recorded.<ref name="Schaffnerp187"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=202<U+2013>203}}</ref><ref name="Redbeard1992"/>

Working from Studio Three,<ref name="Masonp208">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=208}}</ref> the group found it difficult at first to devise any new material, especially as the success of ''Dark Side of the Moon'' had left all four physically and emotionally drained.  Richard Wright has since described these early sessions as "falling within a difficult period", and Roger Waters found them "torturous".<ref name="Schaffnerpp184185">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=184&ndash;185}}</ref>  Drummer [[Nick Mason]] found the process of multi-track recording drawn out and tedious,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=202}}</ref> and [[David Gilmour]] was more interested in improving the band's existing material.  He was also becoming increasingly frustrated with Mason, whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.<ref name="Schaffnerpp184185"/>  Mason has since admitted that Nick Kent's unrestrained diatribe in ''NME'' may have had some influence however in keeping the band together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=201}}</ref><ref name="Blakep224">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=224}}</ref>

{{Quote|It was a very difficult period I have to say.  All your childhood dreams had been sort of realized and we had the biggest selling records in the world and all the things you got into it for.

<!-- quote from Mason about marriage if available -->

However, after several weeks Waters began to visualise another concept.<ref name="Schaffnerpp184185"/>  The three new compositions from 1974's tour were at least a starting point for a new album, and ''Shine On You Crazy Diamond'' seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work.  Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to ''[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]'', the opening four note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett.<ref name="Schaffnerp184">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=184}}</ref>  Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response.<ref name="WatkinsonAndersonp119">{{Harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=119}}</ref>  Waters wanted to split "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves.

One of the more notable events during the recording of ''Wish You Were Here'' occurred on 5&nbsp;June 1975.  Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger, and it was also the eve of Pink Floyd's second tour of the US that year.{{#tag:ref|There seems to be some confusion about the date that Barrett turned up, and Gilmour's wedding.

He presumed that the man was a friend of Waters' and asked him, but soon realised that it was Syd Barrett.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=189}}</ref>  Gilmour presumed he was an EMI staff member,<ref name="WatkinsonAndersonp119"/> and Mason also failed to recognise him; he was "horrified" when Gilmour told him.  In ''Inside Out'' (2005) Mason recalled Barrett's conversation as 'desultory and not entirely sensible'.<ref name="Masonpp206208">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=206&ndash;208}}</ref>  Storm Thorgerson later reflected on Barrett's presence: "Two or three people cried.  He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn't really there."<ref>{{Harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=120}}</ref>

Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the sight of his former band-mate, who was asked by fellow visitor Andrew King how he had managed to gain so much weight.  Barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen, and that he had been eating lots of pork chops.  He also mentioned that he was ready to avail the band of his services, but on listening to the mix of "Shine On" showed no sign of understanding its relevance to his plight.  He joined the guests at Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but later left without saying goodbye.  None of the band members saw him from that day to his death in 2006.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=189&ndash;190}}</ref>  Although the lyrics had already been created, Barrett's presence on that day may have influenced the final version of the song<U+2014>performed by Wright, a subtle refrain from ''[[See Emily Play]]'' is clearly audible toward the end of the album.<ref name="Masonpp206208"/>

{{Quote|I'm very sad about Syd.  Of course he was important and the band would never have fucking started without him because he was writing all the material.  It couldn't have happened without him but on the other hand it couldn't have gone on with him.  "Shine On" is not really about Syd<U+2014>he's just a symbol for all the extremes of absence some people have to indulge in because it's the only way they can cope with how fucking sad it is, modern life, to withdraw completely.

As in ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', the band used synthesizers such as the VC3 (on "Welcome to the Machine"), but softened with Gilmour's acoustic guitar and percussion from Mason.<ref name="Schaffnerp187"/>  The start of "Shine On" contains a remnant from previous but incomplete studio recordings by the band, known as [[Household Objects]].  Wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid, and a recording was made of a finger circling the edge of each glass.  These recordings were multi-tracked into chords,<ref name="Masonp204"/> and used on the opening of "Shine On".

Jazz violinist [[Stephane Grappelli]] and classical violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]] were performing in another studio in the building, and were invited to record a piece for the new album.  Menuhin watched as Grappelli played, however the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and recorded over it.<ref name="Masonp206">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=206}}</ref>  Although Grappelli was not credited for his contribution (the band presumed that he might feel insulted), he was paid <U+00A3>300 for his contribution (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|300|1975|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=188<U+2013>189}}</ref>  Dick Parry again played saxophone, on "Shine On You Crazy Diamond".<ref name="Blakep224"/>  The opening bars of "Wish You Were Here" were recorded from Gilmour's car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Fourth Symphony]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=230}}</ref>

===Vocals===
Recording sessions had twice been interrupted by US tours (one in April and the other in June 1975),<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=186&ndash;187}}</ref> and the final sessions, which occurred after the album's premi<U+00E8>re at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], proved particularly troublesome for Waters.<ref name="Poveyp190"/>  He struggled to record the lyrics for "Have a Cigar", requiring several takes to perform an acceptable version.  His problems stemmed in part from his limited vocal range, but also from the stresses placed upon his voice while recording the lead vocal of "Shine On".  Gilmour was asked to sing in his place,<ref name="Masonp206"/> but declined, and eventually colleague and friend [[Roy Harper]] was asked to stand in.  Harper was recording his own album in another of Abbey Road's studios, and Gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him.  Waters later regretted the decision, believing he should have performed the song.<ref name="Schaffnerpp187188">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=187&ndash;188}}</ref>  [[The Blackberries]] recorded backing vocals for ''Shine On''.<ref name="Blakep224"/>

''Wish You Were Here'' was sold in one of the more elaborate packages to accompany a Pink Floyd album.  [[Storm Thorgerson]] had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour, and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics, eventually deciding that the songs were, in general, concerned with "unfulfilled presence", rather than Barrett's illness.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=190}}</ref>
This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band.  Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's ''[[Country Life (album)|Country Life]]'' was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve<U+2014>censoring the cover image<U+2014>and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for ''Wish You Were Here'' in a dark-coloured shrink-wrap (making the album art "absent").  The concept behind "Welcome to the Machine" and "Have a Cigar" suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve.  The album's cover image was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire.  "Getting burned" was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments.  Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by a business suit.  His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig.  The photograph was taken at the [[Warner Bros.]] studios in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="Schaffnerpp190192">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=190&ndash;192}}</ref><ref name="PoveyNA">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=N/A}}</ref><!-- PoveyNA ref in Discography section of book, page numbers not legible -->  Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache.

The album's back cover depicts a faceless "Floyd salesman", in Thorgerson's words "selling his soul" in the desert (shot in the [[Yuma Desert]] in [[California]]).  The absence of wrists and ankles signifies his presence as an "empty suit".

==Reception==
Much of ''Wish You Were Here'' was premi<U+00E8>red on 5 July 1975 at an open-air music festival at [[Knebworth]].  Singer Roy Harper was performing at the same event, and upon discovering that his stage costume was missing proceeded to destroy one of Pink Floyd's vans (injuring himself in the process).  Unfortunately this contributed to a delay in the setup of the band's sound system; a pair of World War II [[Spitfire]] aircraft were due to fly over the crowd during their entrance, and the performance could not be delayed.  A power supply problem pushed Wright's keyboards completely out of tune, and the band's performance suffered badly.  It transpired that each time the master volume was turned up, Wright's keyboards went out of tune.  At one point Wright left the stage, but they continued with a less sensitive keyboard, a piano, and a simpler light show.  After a brief intermission they returned to perform ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged the performance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=192&ndash;193}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=211&ndash;212}}</ref>

The album was released on 12 September 1975 in the UK, and on the following day in the US.<ref name="Poveyp197">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=197}}</ref>  In Britain, with 250,000&nbsp;advance sales it went straight to #1, and demand was such that EMI informed retailers that only 50% of their orders would be fulfilled.<ref name="Schaffnerp193"/>  With 900,000&nbsp;advance orders (the largest for any Columbia release)<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=235}}</ref> it reached #1 on the US ''Billboard'' chart in its second week.

{{Quote|''Shine on You Crazy Diamond'' is initially credible because it purports to confront the subject of Syd Barrett, the long and probably forever lost guiding light of the original Floyd.  But the potential of the idea goes unrealized; they give such a matter-of-fact reading of the goddamn thing that they might as well be singing about Roger Waters's brother-in-law getting a parking ticket.  This lackadaisical demeanor forces, among other things, a reevaluation of their relationship to all the space cadet orchestras they unconsciously sired.  The one thing those bands have going for them, in their cacophonously inept way, is a sincere passion for their "art."

[[Robert Christgau]] was more positive, writing "... the music is not only simple and attractive, with the synthesizer used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously."<ref name="Christgau"/>  ''[[Melody Maker]]'' however was disparaging: "From whichever direction one approaches ''Wish You Were Here'', it still sounds unconvincing in its ponderous sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments."<ref name="Poveyp197"/>  Despite this, in 2003 the album was ranked number 209 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{Citation | title = 209) Wish You Were Here | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598909/209_wish_you_were_here | publisher = rollingstone.com | date = 2003-11-01 | accessdate = 2009-08-14}}</ref>  In 1998 [[Q (magazine)|''Q'']] readers voted ''Wish You Were Here'' the 34th greatest album of all time.<ref>{{Citation | title = Q Readers All Time Top 100 Albums | publisher = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' | year = 1998 | edition = Q137 | date = 1998-02}}</ref>  In 2000 the same magazine placed it at number&nbsp;43 in its list of the 100&nbsp;Greatest British Albums Ever.<ref>{{Citation | title = The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever | publisher = ''Q'' | edition = Q165 | date = 2000-06}}</ref>  In 2007, one of Germany's largest public radio stations, [[WDR 2]], asked its listeners to vote for the 200 best albums of all time.

===Sales===
Pink Floyd and their manager [[Steve O'Rourke]] had been dissatisfied with the efforts of EMI's US label [[Capitol Records]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=158&ndash;161}}</ref> and ''Wish You Were Here'' was Pink Floyd's first album with America's [[Columbia Records]]<U+2014>an affiliate of [[CBS]].  The band did however remain with [[EMI]]'s [[Harvest Records]] in Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=173.}}</ref>  As a result in the label switch, this gave the band ownership of their recordings from that point forward<U+2014>every album from ''Wish You Were Here'' onward has been copyrighted to either "Pink Floyd Music Limited" or (for after Waters' departure) "Pink Floyd (1987) Ltd.", instead of the corresponding record label.
