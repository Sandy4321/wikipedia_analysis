The '''sliding filament hypothesis''' (or '''sliding filament theory''') is a [[scientific hypothesis]] that explains the process of [[muscle contraction]]. It was independently introduced in 1954 by two research teams, one comprising of [[Andrew Huxley|Andrew F. Huxley]] and [[Rolf Niedergerke]] from the [[University of Cambridge]], and the other comprising of [[Hugh Huxley]] and [[Jean Hanson]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name=hugh2004>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Hugh E.|title=Fifty years of muscle and the sliding filament hypothesis|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|year=2004|volume=271|issue=8|pages=1403-1415|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04044.x|pmid=15066167}}</ref><ref name=andersen>{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=O.

According to this hypothesis, the [[actin]] (thin) filaments of muscle fibres slide past the [[myosin]] (thick) filaments during muscle contraction, while the two groups of filaments remain at relatively constant length. Before the 1950s there were several competing theories introduced to explain muscle contraction, including electrical attraction, protein folding, and protein modification.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4939-2006-8|pages=21-23|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gz8BBQAAQBAJ&pg|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2007-5}}</ref> The novel hypothesis directly introduced a new concept called cross-bridge theory (classically swinging cross-bridge, now mostly referred to as cross-bridge cycle) which explains the molecular mechanism of sliding filament. Cross-bridge theory states that actin and myosin form a protein complex (classically called actomyosin) by attachment of myosin head on the actin filament, thereby forming a sort of cross-bridge between the two filaments. The two complimentary hypotheses turned out to be the correct description, and became a universally accepted explanation of the mechanism of muscle movement.<ref name=wood>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=A.W.|title=Physiology, Biophysics, and Biomedical Engineering|year=2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-46-655279-1|pages=158-162|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=V0fSBQAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref>

==Development==

===Early works===
The first muscle protein discovered was myosin by a German scientist [[Willy Kuhne|Willy K<U+00FC>hne]],  who extracted and named it in 1864.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=M. A.|last2=Spudich|first2=J.

A.|last2=Ljubimowa|first2=M. N.|title=Myosine and Adenosinetriphosphatase|journal=Nature|year=1939|volume=144|issue=3650|pages=668<U+2013>669|doi=10.1038/144668b0}}</ref> [[Albert Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi]], a Hungarian physiologist, turned his focus on muscle physiology after winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1937 for his works on [[vitamin C]] and [[fumaric acid]]. He demonstrated in 1942 that ATP was the source of energy for muscle contraction. He actually observed that muscle fibres containing myosin B shortened in the presence of ATP, but not with myosin A, the experience which he later described as "perhaps the most thrilling moment of my life."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi|first1=Albert|title=Lost in the twentieth century|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=1963|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>15|doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.000245|pmid=14140702}}</ref> With Bruno Straub, he soon found that myosin B was associated with another protein, which they called actin, while myosin A was not. Straub purified actin in 1942, and Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi purified myosin A in 1943. It became apparent that myosin B was a combination of myosin A and actin, so that myosin A retained the original name, whereas they renamed myosin B as actomyosin. By the end of the 1940s Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi's team had postulated with evidences that contraction of actomyosin was equivalent to muscle contraction as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Gyorgyi|first1=A.

===Origin of the hypothesis===
[[File:Sarcomere.gif|300px|thumb|right| Structure of muscle fibre (sarcomere) under electron microscope with schematic explanation]]
By the time [[Hugh Huxley]] earned his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1952 on his research on the structure of muscle, Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi had turned his career into cancer research.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|page= 23}}</ref> Huxley went to [[Francis O. Schmitt]]'s laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with a post-doctoral fellowship in September 1952, where he was joined by another English post-docoral fellow [[Jean Hanson]] in January 1953. Hanson had a PhD in muscle structure from [[King's College London|King's College, London]] in 1951. Huxley had used [[X-ray diffraction]] to speculate that muscle proteins, particularly myosin, form structured filaments giving rise to [[sarcomere]] (a segment of muscle fibre). Their main aim use to use [[electron microscopy]] to study the details of those filaments as never done before. They soon discovered and confirmed the filament nature of muscle proteins. Myosin and actin form overlapping filaments, myosin filaments mainly constituting the A band (the dark region of a sarcomere), while actin filaments traverse both the A and I (light region) bands.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Jean|last2=Huxley|first2=Hugh E.|title=Structural basis of the cross-striations in muscle|journal=Nature|year=1953|volume=172|issue=4377|pages=530<U+2013>532|doi=10.1038/172530b0|pmid=13099257}}</ref> Huxley was the first to write on a hypothesis on sliding filament in 1953, stating

{{quote|text="<U+2026> [I]f it is postulated that stretching of the muscle takes place, not by an extension of the fi laments, but by a process in which the two sets of ''filaments slide'' [emphasis added] past each other; extensibility will then be inhibited if the myosin and actin are linked together."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=HE|title=Electron microscope studies of the organisation of the filaments in striated muscle|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|year=1953|volume=12|issue=3|pages=387-394|pmid=13115446}}</ref>}}

Huxley later in 1996 regretted that he should have included Hanson in his hypothesis-making as it was simply based on their collaborative work.<ref name=huxley96>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=H.

[[Andrew Huxley]], whom [[Alan Hodgkin]] described as "wizard with scientific apparatus", had just discovered the mechanism of the nerve impulse ([[action potential]]) transmission (for which he and Hodgkin later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963) in 1949 using his own design of [[voltage clamp]], and was looking for an associate who could properly dissect out muscle fibres.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Yale E.|author2=Franzini-Armstrong, Clara |author3=Armstrong, Clay M. |title=Andrew Fielding Huxley (1917<U+2013>2012)|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume=486|issue=7404|pages=474<U+2013>474|doi=10.1038/486474a|bibcode = 2012Natur.486..474G }}</ref> Upon recommendation of a close friend Robert St<U+00E4>mpfli, a German physician [[Rolf Niedergerke]] joined him at the University of Cambridge in 1952. By then he realised that the conventionally used [[phase contrast microscope]] was not suitable for fine structures of muscle fibres, and thus developed his own interference miscroscope. Between March 1953 and January 1954 they executed their research.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|page=30<U+2013>33, 41}}</ref> Huxley recollected that at the time the only person who ever thought of sliding filements before 1953 was [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] (later winner of the 1964  [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=AF|title=Discoveries on muscle: observation, theory, and experiment|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1986|volume=293|issue=6539|pages=115-117|pmid=3089413|pmc=1340847}}</ref> He spent the summer of 1953 at [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at Woods Hole, Massachusette, to use electron microscope there. There he met Hugh Huxley and Hanson with whom he shared data and information on their works. They parted with an agreement that they would keep in touch, and when their aim is achieved, they would publish together, if they ever "reached similar conclusions".<ref name=hugh2004/>

==The hypothesis==
[[Image:Sarcomere.svg|300px|thumb|right|Diagrammatic explanation of sliding filament hypothesis]]
The sliding filament hypothesis was born from two consecutive papers published in the 22 May 1954 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' under the common theme "Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction". Though their conclusions were fundamentally similar, their underlying experimental data and propositions were different.

===Huxley-Niedergerke hypothesis===

The first paper, written by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke, is titled "Interference microscopy of living muscle fibres". It was based on their study of frog muscle using interference microscope, which Andrew Huxley developed for the purpose. According to them:<ref name=andrew54/>
#the I bands are composed of actin filaments, and the A bands principally of myosin filaments; and
#during contraction, the actin filaments move into the A bands between the myosin filaments.

===Huxley-Hanson hypothesis===

The second paper, by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson, is titled "Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation". It is more elaborate and was based on their study of rabbit muscle using phase contrast and electron miscroscopes. According to them:<ref name=huxley54>{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=H.|author2=Hanson, J. |title=Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation|journal=Nature|year=1954|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=973<U+2013>976|pmid=13165698|doi=10.1038/173973a0}}</ref>
#the backbone of a muscle fibre is actin filaments which extend from Z line up to one end of H zone, where they are attached to an elastic component which they named S filament;
#myosin filaments extend from one end of the A band through the H zone up to the other end of the A band;
#myosin filaments remain in relatively constant length during muscle stretch or contraction;
#if myosin filaments contract beyond the length of A band, their ends fold up to form contraction bands;
#myosin and actin filamens lie side-by-side in the A band and in the absence of ATP they do not form cross-linkages;
#during stretching, only the I bands and H zone increase in length, while A bands remain the same;
#during contraction, actin filaments move into the A bands and the H zone is filled up, the I bands shorten, the Z line comes in contact with the A bands; and
#the possible driving force of contraction is the actin-myosin linkages which depend on [[ATP hydrolysis]] by the myosin.

==Reception and consequences==

In spite of strong evidences, the sliding filament hypothesis did not gain any support for several years to come.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=J.|title=Memories of Hugh E. Huxley (1924-2013)|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2013|volume=24|issue=18|pages=2769<U+2013>2771|doi=10.1091/mbc.E13-08-0454|pmid=24030511|pmc=3771940}}</ref> Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi himself refused to believe that myosin filaments were confined to the thick filament (A band).<ref name=huxley96/> F.O.

It was only with the new electron microscope that Hugh Huxley confirmed the overlapping nature of the filaments in 1957.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=HE|title=The double array of filaments in cross-striated muscle|journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology|year=1957|volume=3|issue=5|pages=631-648|pmid=13475381|pmc=2224118}}</ref> It was also from this publication that the existence of actin-myosin linkage (now called cross-bridge) was clearly shown.

===Cross-bridge mechanism===

With substantial evidence, Hugh Huxley formally proposed the mechanism for sliding filament and is variously called swinging cross-bridge model, cross-bridge theory or cross-bridge model.<ref name=andersen/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duke|first1=T. A. J.|title=Molecular model of muscle contraction|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1999|volume=96|issue=6|pages=2770<U+2013>2775|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.6.2770|pmid=10077586|pmc=15844}}</ref> (He himself preferred the name "swinging crossbridge model", because, as he recalled, "it [the discovery] was, after all, the 1960s".<ref name=hugh2004/>) He published his hypothesis in 20 June 1969 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' under the title "The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=H. E.|title=The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|journal=Science|year=1969|volume=164|issue=3886|pages=1356<U+2013>1366|doi=10.1126/science.164.3886.1356|pmid=4181952}}</ref>  According to his hypothesis, filament sliding occurs by cyclic attachement and detachment of myosin on actin filaments. Contraction occurs when the myosin pulls the actin filament towards the centre of the A band, detaches from actin and creates a force (stroke) to bind to the next actin molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=James A.|title=The myosin swinging cross-bridge model|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|year=2001|volume=2|issue=5|pages=387<U+2013>392|doi=10.1038/35073086|pmid=11331913}}</ref> This idea was subsequently proven in detail, and is more appropriately known as cross-bridge cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fitts|first1=R.
