There are 24 named '''waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park''' in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]], ranging in height from 9&nbsp;to 94&nbsp;feet (2.7&nbsp;to 29&nbsp;m), along [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]] as it flows in three steep, narrow valleys, or [[glen]]s. [[Ricketts Glen State Park]] is named for [[R. Bruce Ricketts]], a colonel in the [[American Civil War]] who owned over 80,000&nbsp;acres (32,000&nbsp;ha) in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but spared the [[old growth forest]]s in the glens from [[clearcutting]]. The park, which opened in 1944, is administered by the [[Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks|Bureau of State Parks]] of the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR). Nearly all of the waterfalls are visible from the Falls Trail, which Ricketts had built from 1889 to 1893 and which the state park rebuilt in the 1940s and late 1990s. The Falls Trail has been called "the most magnificent hike in the state" and one of "the top hikes in the East".<ref name = "young 66">Young, p. 66.</ref>

The waterfalls are on the section of Kitchen Creek that flows down the [[Allegheny Front]], a steep [[escarpment]] between the [[Allegheny Plateau]] to the north and the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the [[Huntley Mountain Formation|Huntley Mountain]] and [[Catskill Formation]]s that formed up to 370&nbsp;million years ago in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its [[drainage basin]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|last Ice Age]]. 

Ricketts named 21 of the waterfalls, mostly for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and places, and his family and friends. There are ten named falls in Ganoga Glen, eight named falls in Glen Leigh, and between four and six named waterfalls in Ricketts Glen. The DCNR names 22 falls, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) names 23 falls, and Scott E. Brown's 2004 book ''Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers'' names 24. The falls are described in order going upstream along the creek for each of the three glens.

The waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park are on the [[Allegheny Front]], which is the boundary between the [[Allegheny Plateau]] to the north and the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] to the south. The [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] of [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]] are on the [[dissected plateau]], from which the stream drops approximately 1,000&nbsp;feet (300&nbsp;m) in 2.25&nbsp;miles (3.62&nbsp;km) as it flows down the steep [[escarpment]] of the Allegheny Front. Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek, which come together at Waters Meet.<ref name="rggeology"/>{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} The branch in Glen Leigh has eight named waterfalls and lies north of the [[confluence]], while the branch in Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls and lies to the northwest. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet; here the terrain becomes less steep, and there are fewer named waterfalls. The DCNR names only four in Ricketts Glen, all on Kitchen Creek;<ref name ="dcnr map"/> the USGS GNIS names these and one more on the creek,<ref name = "kcf"/> and Brown's book on Pennsylvania waterfalls adds a sixth named falls on a [[tributary]].<ref name = "brown 50">Brown, pp. 50<U+2013>52.</ref>

The rocks exposed in the park were formed between 370&nbsp;and 340&nbsp;million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of [[sediment]] made up primarily of [[clay]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek [[drainage basin]]: [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[siltstone]], and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]].<ref name="rggeology"/>

Lush green vegetation surrounds the falls, with dappled sunlight at top.|Erie Falls cascades 47&nbsp;feet (14&nbsp;m) over many layers of sedimentary rock in Ganoga Glen.]]
About 300&nbsp;to 250&nbsp;million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]. This happened long after the [[sedimentary rock]]s in the park were deposited, when the part of [[Gondwana]] that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming [[Pangaea]]. In the years since, up to 5,000&nbsp;feet (1,500&nbsp;m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.<ref name = "rggeology"/><ref name = "roadside"/><ref name = "geology book">Shultz, pp. 372<U+2013>374, 391, 399, 818.</ref>

The effects of glaciation have made Kitchen Creek "unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front", as it is the only one with an "almost continuous series of waterfalls".<ref name="rggeology">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/parkguides/pg13.pdf | title = Pennsylvania Trail of Geology, Ricketts Glen State Park, Luzerne, Sullivan and Columbia Counties, The Rocks, the Glens and the Falls (Park Guide 13) |author = Braun, Duane D.; Inners, Jon D.|accessdate = November 29, 2009 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources |format= PDF}}</ref>  Prior to the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], Kitchen Creek and Phillips Creek to the east had drainage basins of similar area and slope, and both watersheds were confined to the Allegheny Front. This changed when receding [[glacier]]s formed temporary dams on two of Kitchen Creek's neighboring streams on the Allegheny Plateau, [[Bowman Creek|South Branch Bowman Creek]] to the northeast and Big Run, a tributary of [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]] to the northwest. The headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek were very close to those for the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek, and the headwaters for Big Run were very close to those for the Ganoga Glen branch.<ref name="rggeology"/> 

As the glaciers retreated to the northeast about 20,000 years ago, [[glacial lake]]s formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;feet (6.1&nbsp;to 9.1&nbsp;m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from [[Ganoga Lake]] and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7&nbsp;square miles (18&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50&nbsp;percent to 20.1&nbsp;square miles (52&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).<ref name ="rggeology"/><ref>{{cite book  | last = Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection  | coauthors = Bureau of Watershed Management, Division of Water Use Planning  | others = Prepared in Cooperation with the United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey| title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams | format = PDF  | url = http://www.lycoming.edu/biologydept/petokas/pa%20gazzetter%20of%20streams.pdf | accessdate = December 5, 2009 | year = 2001}}</ref> 

The result was increased water flow in Kitchen Creek, which has been cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become similar to those of other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could take so long that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.<ref name="rggeology"/>

===Formations and falls===
[[File:Plunge pool.png|thumb|alt= A diagram shows light blue water flowing  from right to left over a grey ledge labeled "Sandstone (Caprock)". The falling water has worn out a roughly circular pit, labeled "Plunge Pool", in the red rock below, labeled "Shale".|Water going over the falls carries sand and pebbles that scour a [[plunge pool]] at its base.]]
The park's waterfalls expose two distinct rock formations from the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods. The more recent and higher of these is the [[Huntley Mountain Formation]], from the late Devonian and early [[Mississippian]]. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The lower and older layer is the [[Catskill Formation]], which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370&nbsp;million years old. The harder Huntley Mountain Formation caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation to the south. The portions of the Allegheny Front within the park are named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along [[Pennsylvania Route 487]].<ref name="rggeology"/><ref name = "roadside">Van Diver, pp. 31<U+2013>35, 153<U+2013>155.</ref><ref name="map 61">{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/map61/redrock.pdf | title = Atlas of Preliminary Geologic Quadrangle Maps of Pennsylvania: Red Rock | accessdate = June 8, 2009 | author = Berg, T.

Geologists classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend in a series of small steps, forming waterfalls that are said to resemble a [[wedding cake]]. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In [[veil|bridal-veil]] falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a [[plunge pool]] in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder [[caprock]] which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is grey sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.<ref name="rggeology"/> 

While the official Ricketts Glen State Park web page also classifies waterfalls as either the bridal-veil or wedding-cake type,<ref name="rgsp">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/rickettsglen.aspx | title = Ricketts Glen State Park | accessdate = November 23, 2009| publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}</ref> Brown's ''Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers'' uses four types for classification: falls, cascade, slide, and chute. The first, falls, is the same as the DCNR's bridal-veil type, with water that falls freely from a ledge. Brown divides the wedding-cake class into three types: cascade, where water falls down a "vertical to nearly vertical" surface that has terraces; slide, where water falls down a "near vertical to less than vertical" wide surface that is smoother than a cascade; and chute, where the water is confined by rock as it falls down "a narrow slide or cataractlike feature".<ref name= "brown xiv">Brown, p. xiv</ref>

Ricketts Glen State Park is in the [[Susquehanna River]] drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Susquehannock]]s. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]], and by 1675&nbsp;they had died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape]] (or Delaware).<ref>Richter, pp. 3<U+2013>46.</ref> 

On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park.<ref>Wallace, p. 159.</ref> After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.<ref>Wallace, pp. 136<U+2013>141.</ref> Luzerne County was formed in 1786 from part of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]], and [[Fairmount Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Fairmount Township]], where the waterfalls are, was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Luzerne.pdf |title = Luzerne County 3rd class |accessdate = December 7, 2009 | format = PDF | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]}}</ref> About 1890 a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] pot, decorated in the style of "the peoples of the Susquehanna region", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.<ref>Wren, p. 56, Plate No. 7.</ref>  

The Ricketts family began acquiring land in and around what became the park in 1851, when Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000&nbsp;acres (2,000&nbsp;ha) on North Mountain around what is now known as Ganoga Lake. By 1852 they had built a [[Clemuel Ricketts Mansion|stone house]] on the lake shore, which they ran "as a lodge and tavern".<ref name="HABS">{{cite web | url = http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=hhdatapage&fileName=pa/pa1200/pa1250/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=0&itemLink=r?ammem/hh:@FIELD(DOCID+@BAND(@lit(PA1250))) | title = William R.

After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and began purchasing the land around the lake from his father in 1869; eventually he controlled or owned more than 80,000&nbsp;acres (32,000&nbsp;ha), including the glens and waterfalls.<ref name ="rgsp"/><ref name = "petrillo 41"/>

Ricketts and the other settlers living in the area were not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two of the Ricketts' guests who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek. In 1872 Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition to the stone house; this opened as the North Mountain House hotel in 1873, and was run by Ricketts' brother Frank until 1898.<ref name="HABS"/><ref name ="petrillo 42"/>

In 1942 the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] bought 1,261&nbsp;acres (510&nbsp;ha), including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought a total of 16,000&nbsp;acres (6,500&nbsp;ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000&nbsp;acres (4,000&nbsp;ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000&nbsp;acres (1,200&nbsp;ha) acquired from others.<ref name = "rgsp"/><ref name = "petrillo 69"/> A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000&nbsp;visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added.

==Overview==
[[File:Kitchen Creek in Ricketts Glen State Park panorama.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Kitchen Creek has formed the glens and waterfalls.|alt=A panoramic view of a rocky creek with a small waterfall at left in a deciduous forest during the summer.]]
Kitchen Creek flows through the park's three glens, which the descriptions of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen. The falls are listed in order going upstream along Kitchen Creek, starting with the southernmost and ending at the northernmost in each glen. This is also the order in which a hiker would encounter the falls while traveling north along the creek on the Falls Trail.<ref name = "dcnr map"/>

The Falls Trail is a 7.1-mile (11.4&nbsp;km) loop hike. Starting at PA 118, it is 1.8&nbsp;miles (2.9&nbsp;km) north along the creek through Ricketts Glen to Waters Meet, where the trail divides. Following the Glen Leigh branch, it is 1.2&nbsp;miles (1.9&nbsp;km) north through the glen to the Highland Trail, then 1.0&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west along the Highland Trail to Ganoga Glen. Turning southeast, it is 1.3&nbsp;miles (2.1&nbsp;km) through Ganoga Glen back to Waters Meet, then the 1.8&nbsp;miles (2.9&nbsp;km) through Ricketts Glen is retraced, but heading south back to PA 118.<ref name = "young 70"/>

The description of each waterfall starts with the name. While the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) Bureau of State Parks names 22 waterfalls in [[Ricketts Glen State Park]] (all but Kitchen Creek and Shingle Cabin),<ref name = "dcnr map"/> the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) names 23 (all but Shingle Cabin),<ref name = "gnis"/> and Scott E. Brown's 2004 book ''Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers'' names 24.<ref name = "brown 50"/> There are also several unnamed waterfalls in the park, with the total number of falls given as 33 or 34.<ref>Bonta, p. 20.</ref><ref>{{cite book | title =  Seeing Pennsylvania | last = Faris | first = John T. | year = 1919 | publisher = J.

==Ricketts Glen==

The cracked tree trunk is visible on the opposite bank, and a tributary with cascading falls enters the main stream to the right.]]
Ricketts Glen is the name given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and downstream of Waters Meet.<ref name = "brown 50"/><ref name ="rgsp"/><ref>Mitchell, p. 41.</ref> It is 1.8&nbsp;miles (2.9&nbsp;km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters Meet on the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5&nbsp;miles (0.80&nbsp;km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike from the bottom of Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of [[old growth forest]], chiefly hemlocks.<ref name = "hike pa"/> Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.<ref name = "rggeology"/>

Ricketts Glen is the only glen where sources differ on the number of named waterfalls. Only Brown's book names Shingle Cabin Falls, which is the sole named falls in the park on a tributary of Kitchen Creek.<ref name = "hike pa"/> The names of the waterfalls at the southern end of Ricketts Glen, under and just south of PA 118, are the most disputed. The USGS GNIS names Kitchen Creek Falls (with coordinates very near the PA 118 bridge) and Adams Falls (with coordinates further south of PA 118).<ref name = "kcf"/><ref name = "adams"/> Brown's book also names both as separate falls and gives the height of Kitchen Creek Falls as 9&nbsp;feet (2.7&nbsp;m).<ref name = "brown 50"/> A 1947 newspaper article on the new state park notes the unnamed falls under the highway bridge and refers to "Adam's Falls a short distance away".<ref name = "sun"/> The official park map only names Adams Falls, shows it a short distance south of the bridge, and notes it is 36&nbsp;feet (11&nbsp;m) tall.<ref name = "dcnr map"/> However, the DCNR ''Pennsylvania Trail of Geology'' guide to the park says Kitchen Creek Falls is just another name for Adams Falls, and notes that "At the bridge on Pa. Route 118, Kitchen Creek plunges over three picturesque cascades (18, 25 and 10 feet high)" (5.5, 7.6, and 3.0&nbsp;m high).<ref name = "rggeology"/>

Marcia Bonta in ''Outbound Journeys in Pennsylvania: A Guide to Natural Places for Individual and Group Outings'' calls this "the loveliest part of the entire trail<U+2014>rugged, steep Glen Leigh". Bonta goes on to note that Glen Leigh "resembles a remote wilderness, hemmed in on one side by rock and on the other by surging water, and it has some of the most spectacular waterfalls in the park".<ref>Bonta, p. 19.</ref> 
 
Glen Leigh was named for Lake Leigh, which R. B. Ricketts named for his second daughter Frances Leigh (1881<U+2013>1970). She married William S. McLean, Jr., a judge, in 1921.<ref name = "petrillo 69"/><ref name = "benton news"/><ref name=tomasak/> Leigh was also the middle name of R.B.

Ricketts built a dam upstream of the waterfalls on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek, hoping to use the resulting Lake Leigh for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power generation.

By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall on Kitchen Creek Ganoga Falls,<ref>Bachelder, pp. 186<U+2013>189.</ref> and in 1881, he renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator [[Charles R. Buckalew]] suggested the name ''Ganoga'', an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] word which he said meant "water on the mountain" in the [[Seneca language]].<ref>Petrillo, p. 42.</ref> Donehoo's ''A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in  Pennsylvania'' identifies it as a [[Cayuga language]] word meaning "place of floating oil" and the name of a [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] village in New York.<ref>Donehoo, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Whatever the meaning, Ganoga Lake is the source of the branch of Kitchen Creek that flows through Ganoga Glen, which has the tallest waterfall.<ref name = "dcnr map"/>
 
A dam was built upstream of the waterfalls on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek in 1842. Ricketts strengthened the dam ''circa'' 1905 as part of a hydroelectric power generation scheme, and renamed the body of water Lake Rose (Rose is a Ricketts family name). However, both the Lake Rose and Lake Leigh dams were "poorly constructed" and could not be used to generate power; both dams were condemned by the state and Lake Rose was drained in 1969.<ref name ="petrillo 68">Petrillo, pp. 40, 68.</ref><ref name = "iba"/> Ganoga Glen is not as steep as Glen Leigh; both glens are almost entirely in the Huntley Mountain Formation, with a small region at the southern end, including Waters Meet, in the Catskill Formation.<ref name = "rggeology"/>
&nbsp;
Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1&nbsp;miles (1.8&nbsp;km). It is 1.8&nbsp;miles (2.9&nbsp;km) from PA 118 in the south to Waters Meet and the southern end of Ganoga Glen. From the north, it is 0.3&nbsp;miles (0.48&nbsp;km) from the Lake Rose trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Mohawk, the northernmost waterfall. There is also the 2.8-mile (4.5&nbsp;km) Ganoga View Trail, which leads from Pennsylvania Route 487 in the west to Ganoga Falls. The Highland Trail, which meets the Falls Trail a short distance north of Mohawk Falls, is the 1.2-mile (1.9&nbsp;km) connector between the northern ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh.<ref name = "dcnr map"/><ref name = "brown"/> 

Jeff Mitchell writes in ''Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeast Pennsylvania'' that Ganoga Glen has his "favorite place" in the park: "Here the trail wraps around ledges and underneath overhanging rocks, right next to the waterfalls. The roar of the falls reverberates against their rocky confines. The state park trail map says that Seneca, Delaware, and Mohican Falls are here, but it is hard to discern which falls are which because they explode from everywhere and are continuous."<ref>Mitchell, pp. 45<U+2013>46.</ref>
