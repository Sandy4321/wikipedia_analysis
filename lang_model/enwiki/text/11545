==Politics==
Curb was encouraged to enter politics in part by [[Ronald Reagan]]. Curb ran for [[lieutenant governor]] of [[California]], and was elected in November 1978, even though the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial nominee, [[Evelle J. Younger]], lost to the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor, [[Jerry Brown]]. For much of 1979 and the first half of 1980, Brown was out of state, seeking the Democratic nomination for [[President of the United States]] against the embattled [[incumbent]], [[Jimmy Carter]]. For approximately one year, Curb served in Brown's absence to take on the role of [[acting governor]], sometimes [[veto]]ing legislation or issuing [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, yielding results that were at odds with Brown's [[American liberalism|liberal]] politics. Curb's actions resulted in litigation, but his legal right to act when Brown was out of state was upheld by the [[Supreme Court]],<ref>''In re the Petition of the Commission on the Governorship of California (Brown v. Curb)'', 26 Cal. 3d 110.</ref> setting an important precedent for future lieutenant governors.

Despite being seen briefly as one of the GOP's rising stars and being promised a bright political future by some national Republican leaders, Curb narrowly lost the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1982 to attorney general [[George Deukmejian]].

While three Republicans <U+2014> Deukmejian, [[Pete Wilson]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] <U+2014> have served as governor of California since Curb left office, no Republican has been elected lieutenant governor since his single term.

==Later career in music==

He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1994, where his company records for artists such as [[Wynonna Judd]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Hank III]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Kimberley Locke]], [[Sawyer Brown]], [[Rodney Atkins]], [[Heidi Newfield]] and others. Curb is an equity partner in the [[gospel music]] company [[Word Records|Word Label Group]], in cooperation with [[Warner Music Group]].

==Involvement in car racing==
A [[motorsport]] enthusiast, Curb is a co-owner of the [[CURB/Agajanian/3G Racing]], a team in [[NASCAR]]'s [[Busch Series]] until 2006. Curb's sponsorship and ownership have included three of NASCAR's most celebrated drivers:  he previously owned [[Richard Petty]]'s famed #43 in 1984 and 1985, including the 199th and 200th career wins for Petty. Curb was also a sponsor for [[Dale Earnhardt]] during his 1980 [[Winston Cup]] championship winning season, and sponsored [[Darrell Waltrip]]'s #12 Toyota Tundra in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]], driven by [[Joey Miller]] in 2006. Curb-Agajanian also run cars for many years in the [[Indianapolis 500]] with drivers including [[Billy Boat]] and [[Jaques Lazier]].

In November 2007, Curb purchased the remaining interest in Brewco Motorsports from Clarence Brewer of [[Central City, Kentucky]], making him co-owner with Gary Baker. Forming Baker-Curb Motorsports competing in the NASCAR Nationwide Series in 2008 in the #27 and #37 cars. Operations have been moved to Nashville, TN.

==Public honors==
In [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Curb has become a civic leader and benefactor of [[Belmont University]], where his donation toward the construction of a new arena resulted in it being named the [[Curb Event Center]]. The University also runs "The Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business." He also endowed the Curb Center and the Curb Creative Campus program at [[Vanderbilt University]] and the Mike Curb Institute of Music at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

In August 2006<ref>[http://www.csun.edu/pubrels/press_releases/fall06/curb.html California State University, Northridge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Curb pledged $10 million to [[California State University, Northridge]] (in [[Los Angeles]]) to endow his alma mater's arts college and provide a lead gift for the university's planned regional performing arts center that will serve as a "learning laboratory" for students. Of the $10 million gift, $5 million will support CSUN's College of Arts, Media, and Communication, one of the university's largest colleges that offers degree and certificate programs for more than 4,400 students.  Four million of that will go into a general endowment for the college, and $1 million will endow a faculty chair specializing in music industry studies. As a result, the college was named in his honor.

In 2003, Curb was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall Of Fame.

In 2001, Curb was inducted into the [[Junior Achievement]] U.S. Business Hall of Fame.

On June 29, 2007, Curb was honored with the 2,341st star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Mogul Mike Curb Honored with 2,341st Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/walkoffame_ceremonies.asp#MikeCurb|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref>
