'''HMS ''Belette''''' (or '''''Bellette''''') was an 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|''Cruizer''-class brig-sloop]], built by King at Dover and launched on 21 March 1806.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.292.</ref> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] she served with some success in the Baltic and the Caribbean. ''Belette'' was lost in the [[Kattegat]] in 1812 when she hit a rock off [[L<U+00E6>s<U+00F8>]].

==Baltic==
''Belette'' was commissioned in April 1806 under Commander Richard Piercy for the North Sea.<ref name=Winfield/> Commander [[John Phillimore]] took command in September and sailed ''Belette'' in the English Channel and [[the Downs]], taking part in [[Edward Owen (Royal Navy officer)|Commodore Edward Owen's]] attack on [[Boulogne]].<ref name="Tracy292">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=292}}</ref><ref name="GM652"/><ref name="DNB183"/> 

The ''Belette'' was occupied in early 1807 with conveying supplies to the besieged town of [[Ko<U+0142>obrzeg|Kolberg]]. In June 1807 ''Belette'' was off Suffolk when she tried to land a M. Bedezee, a Prussian envoy carrying some important despatches. The boat overturned a few hundred meters off shore and Bedezee drowned, as did a midshipman and three crewmen. A master's mate and a crewman were saved, but the despatches were lost.<ref>Burke, Edmund (1807) ''The Annual register of world events: a review of the year''. (London: Longmans), Volume 49, p.447.</ref>

Next, she was attached to Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier's]] fleet which returned to the Baltic to [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|attack Copenhagen again in 1807]].<ref name="Tracy292"/><ref name="GM652">{{cite book |title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]] |page=652}}</ref><ref name="DNB183">{{cite book | chapter=Phillimore, Sir John (1781-1840) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1892|page=183}}</ref> Phillimore distinguished himself during the battle, particularly in an engagement at the end of August, when ''Belette'' became becalmed off the Danish coast.  Sixteen Danish [[gunboat]]s attacked ''Belette'', which sank three of them before boats from other British ships arrived and towed her clear.<ref name="Tracy292"/><ref name="DNB183"/> Gambier rewarded Phillimore for his courage by giving him the honour of carrying Gambier's despatches to the [[Admiralty]]. As a result, Phillimore received a promotion to [[post-captain]] on 13 October; however he remained with ''Belette''.<ref name="Tracy292"/><ref name="DNB183"/> 

The expedition to Copenhagen resulted in prize money for ''Bellette'' both for warships and merchant vessels. ''Belette'' was one of seven British warships sharing in the proceeds of the capture on 28 August of the Danish merchant vessel ''Sally''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=812 |issue=16598|date=28 April 1812}}</ref> Then ''Belette'' is listed among the vessels sharing in the prize money for the ships and provisions that the British captured at Copenhagen.<ref name=LG16275>{{London Gazette|startpage=1103 |issue=16275|date=11 July 1809}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The prize money for an ordinary seaman was [[<U+00A3>sd|<U+00A3>]]3 8[[shilling|s]] 0[[pence|d]].<ref name=LG16275/>|group=Note}} ''Bellette'' also shared with {{HMS|Gallant|1804|2}} and a number of other warships in the captures of several merchant vessels: the ''Aurora'' (30 August), ''Paulina'' (30 August), ''Ceres'' (31 August), ''Odiford'' (4 September), and ''Benedicta'' (12 September).<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=924 |issue=16728|date=11 May 1813}}</ref> On 19 November ''Belette'', with the gun-vessels [[HMS Tigress(1804)|''Tigress'']] and [[HMS Safeguard (1804)|''Safeguard'']] in company, recaptured the ship ''Lively''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16166|date=26 July 1808|startpage=1037}}</ref>

''Belette'' brought the British ambassador, [[John Hely-Hutchinson, 2nd Earl of Donoughmore|Lord Hutchinson]] back to Britain in February 1808.<ref name="DNB183"/> While sailing to [[Gothenburg]] he encountered a Danish Navy two-decker, but was able to escape by sailing into shallower waters.<ref name="Tracy292"/>

==Caribbean==
In February 1808 command passed to George Sanders who sailed her on the North Sea station.<ref group=Note>Sanders had commanded [[HMS Falcon (1802)|HMS Falcon]] in the Baltic the previous year</ref> He then took her to the [[Leeward Islands]], sailing on 3 May 1808.<ref name="NMM-WH-380764">{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_v.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 380764|work=Warship Histories, vol v|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>

''Belette'' captured a privateer on 2 July after a pursuit of 12 hours that ended some 70 miles SE of Barbados. The privateer was the ''Jalouse'', which was armed with four 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 75 men. Sanders described her as sailing remarkably fast and as having done "much Mischief to the Trade." Before running afoul of ''Belette'', ''Jalouse'' had captured the ''Mary'' and the ''Lark'', both of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], and the ''General Green'', of Surinam, which last some other British warship had since recaptured.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16175|startpage=1156|date=23 August 1808}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth <U+00A3>36 3s 11d; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 15s 6<U+00BE>d.<ref name=LG16967>{{London Gazette|issue=16967|startpage=2490|date=20 December 1814}}</ref>|group=Note}}

In August ''Belette'' captured the French privateer [[HMS Morne Fortunee (1808)|''Jos<U+00E9>phine'']], which the Royal Navy took into service as ''Morne Fortunee''.<ref>Winfield (2008), p.349.</ref> In British service she was armed with eight 18-pounder [[carronade]]s and two 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 55 men.<ref group=Note>A number of accounts, such as Colledge (2006; p.233), give the privateer's name as ''Morne Fortunee'', and report that she originally carried 14 guns.</ref>

Admiral Lord [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]] received intelligence that the French corvette ''Rapide'' was on her way from Bayonne with dispatches and he asked Admiral Lord [[Alexander Cochrane]] to attempt to intercept her. On 8 August ''Belette'' captured the ''Rapide'' and took her into Barbados, but ''Rapide{{'}}''s captain had managed to throw the dispatches overboard before ''Belette'' captured her.<ref>Southey (1827), Vol. 3, p.413.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth <U+00A3>13 9s 0d; a sixth-class share was worth 5s 6<U+00BE>d.<ref name=LG16967/>|group=Note}} On 23 July duplicates of the dispatches and much besides were found concealed aboard the cartel ''Phoenix'', which had sailed from Cayenne and had stopped in Barbados. She had aroused suspicion, leading Cochrane to having her searched. Because carrying these documents was a violation of the cartel (truce) flag, the British seized the ''Phoenix'' and sent the seized documents in {{HMS|Subtle|1807|2}}.<ref>''National Register'', (11 September 1808), p.584.</ref>

On 23 August ''Belette'' captured the French privateer schooner ''Confiance'', of seven guns (though pierced for 16) and 70 men. She was three days out from [[Cayenne]].<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=46 |issue=16217|date=10 January 1809}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth <U+00A3>38 7s 6<U+00BE>d; a sixth-class share was worth 15s 10<U+00BD>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1945 |issue=17531|date=2 November 1819}}</ref>|group=Note}}

On 5 December 1808 ''Belette'' captured the French [[letter of marque]] brig ''Revanche'', of six 12-pounder guns and 44 men. ''Revanche'' was taking provisions from Bordeaux to Guadeloupe when she encountered ''Belette''. Sanders described her as having been "a very successful Privateer all this War, and was intended for a Cruizer in those Seas."<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=147 |issue=16217|date=31 January 1809}}</ref> 

In February 1809, ''Belette'' participated in the combined naval and military assault and capture of the French-held island of [[Martinique]].<ref name=Winfield/> This qualified those of her crew still alive in 1847 for the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp "Martinique". ''Belette'' was among the 42 warships that shared in the proceeds for the capture of Martinique.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2454 |issue=16678|date=5 December 1812}}</ref> She then participated in the capture of Guadeloupe (January - February 1810), which earned for her crew the clasp "Guadaloupe" to the NGSM, as well as further prize money, which she shared with 49 other vessels.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2122 |issue=16794|date= 26 October 1813}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth <U+00A3>113 9s 1<U+00BE>d; a sixth-class share, was worth <U+00A3>1 9s 5<U+00BD>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1924 |issue=16938|date=24 September 1814}}</ref>|group=Note}} The medal data indicates that David Sloane took command after Martinique and before Guadeloupe. He may, in fact, have sailed her back to the Leeward Islands from Britain.

==North Sea & Baltic==
In 1811 Sloane took ''Belette'' back to home waters. Danish records suggest that in the summer of 1811 she was in the North Sea. 

Unknown to the British, Danish Captain [[Hans Peter Holm (1772 - 1812)|Hans Peter Holm]] had returned to [[Egersund]] (SW Norway) with ''[[HDMS Lolland (1810)|Lolland]]'' and four other brigs.<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.599.</ref><ref>Wandell (1915), p.368.</ref> On 1 May 1811,<ref>O'Bryne (1849), p.274.</ref> the British sent four boats from ''Belette'', {{HMS|Cherokee|1808|2}} and {{HMS|Clio|1806|2}},<ref>Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.14.</ref> into the western end of the sound, expecting to capture some shipping or do other mischief. The circumstances of locality and wind did not permit the Danish brigs to enter the sound from the further end, but Holm sent the Danish ships<U+2019> boats under Lieutenant Niels Gerhardt Langemach <ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 2, p.68.</ref> up the sound to oppose the British. Some of the  Danes landed to set an ambush from the cliff tops, whilst the armed boats were hidden behind a [[skerry]]. As the British rowed boldly in, they met unexpected fire from howitzers and muskets; they immediately withdrew, with the Danish boats in pursuit. The Danes captured one of the British boats and her crew of an officer and 17 men, who had come from ''Belette'', and would have captured more but for the confusion that an explosion of a powder keg on one of the Danish boats caused. This enabled the remaining British boats to reach the protection of their squadron.

By 1812 ''Belette'' was in the Baltic.<ref name=Winfield/> On 24 May, ''Belette'' and {{HMS|Helder|1808|2}} captured the Danish sloop ''St. Jorgen''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2274 |issue=16807|date= 16 November 1813}}</ref>

After the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], the British navy seized a number of American ships in British ports or that had otherwise not received the news. ''Belette'' was among the vessels sharing in the capture, on 12 August, of the ''Cuba'', ''Caliban'', ''Edward'', ''Galen'', ''Halcyon'', and ''Cygnet''.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth <U+00A3>360 2s 3d; a sixth-class share was worth <U+00A3>3 11s 7d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2209|issue=17076|date= November 1815}}</ref>|group=Note}}

On 30 October, ''Belette'' was protecting the rear of a convoy when her acting master, Mr. James Turnbull, took her yawl and off [[Roms<U+00F8>]] captured a Danish rowboat armed with two 2-pounder guns and small arms. The Danes put up a short but spirited resistance before surrendering. Five men of the Danish crew of a lieutenant and 15 men were severely wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2420|issue=16676|date=1 December 1812}}</ref><ref group=Note>The letter in the ''London Gazette'' gives the name of ''Belette{{'}}''s captain as Swan. This is probably a mistake, or Swan was temporary.</ref>

==Loss==
On 24 November 1812 ''Belette'', under Sloane, was in the Kattegat leading Russian ships through the south-west passage of [[Anholt (Denmark)|Anholt]] towards [[Gothenburg]] when she went aground on a sunken rock called [[Johns Rock|"John"]] (or "Fannot") off [[L<U+00E6>s<U+00F8>]].<ref>Gossett (1986), p.86.</ref> She sank and broke in two. Her crew took to the rigging but during the night many died of exposure or fell into the sea when they lost their grip. Only six of her entire crew of 120 or so men and boys escaped death from exposure or drowning.<ref>Hepper (1994), p.143.</ref>
