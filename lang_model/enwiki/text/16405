==History==

''John Webb's Mill'' or ''Lowe's Mill'' was built in 1804 for John Webb, a local farmer and landowner.<ref name=Book2>{{cite book | first = Kenneth| last = Farries| year = 1982| month = | title = Essex Windmills, Millers and Millwrights - Volume Two <U+2013> A Technical Review| location = London & Edinburgh| isbn = 0-284-98637-2 | pages = 75<U+2013>78 | unused_data = |publisher = Charles Skilton}}</ref> The windmill was constructed to satisfy the increasing demand for flour both locally and in [[London]].<ref name=Thaxted>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaxted.co.uk/?History_of_Thaxted:Thaxted_Windmill|title=Thaxted Windmill |publisher=Thaxted.co.uk |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> It was constructed using local materials, with timber from two local farms and the bricks were made at a nearby location in the [[River Chelmer|Chelmer Valley]] also owned by John Webb.<ref name=Book2/>

The mill was always worked by millers named Lowe or John Webb, thus gaining its names. The mill was last worked commercially in 1910. The mill was disused for over twenty years until the Thaxted Civic Trust carried out essential repairs and made the structure waterproof. The lower floors were used as a [[Boy Scout|scout hut]]. The mill passed into the ownership of Thaxted Parish Council in the 1950s. The Thaxted Society, formed in 1964, has been instrumental in the restoration of the mill to full working order.<ref name=Book5>{{cite book | first = Kenneth| last = Farries| year = 1988| month = | title = Essex Windmills, Millers and Millwrights - Volume Five - A Review by Parishes, S-Z| location = Edinburgh| isbn = 0-284-98821-9 | pages = 50<U+2013>51 | unused_data = |publisher = Charles Skilton}}</ref>

In 2004, the cap and sails were removed to enable repairs to the brickwork at the top of the tower.<ref name=Repair>{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillworld.com/news/archive12.htm#299 |title=Work progressing on Thaxted windmill |publisher=Windmill World|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> The repairs were completed by the end of the year.<ref name=Finish>{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillworld.com/news/archive12.htm#413|title=Thaxted windmill back in action once again |publisher=Windmill World|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> The mill was officially reopened on 8 April 2005 by [[John Petre, 18th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]].<ref name=Open>{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillworld.com/news/archive12.htm#466|title=Thaxted windmill officially reopened by Lord Petre |publisher=Windmill World|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> On 5 April 2010, the stock of one pair of sails broke, and the sail crashed to the ground, damaging the stage as it fell.

==Description==
{{for|an explanation of the various pieces of machinery|Mill machinery}}

''John Webb<U+2019>s Mill'' is a five storey tower mill with a domed cap with a gallery. The cap is winded by an eight blade [[windmill fantail|fantail]]. There is a stage at first floor level. The tower is {{convert|24|ft|m|2}} diameter at base level and {{convert|15|ft|m|2}} diameter at curb level. The tower is {{convert|48|ft|6|in|m|2}} high, having been raised by some {{convert|4|ft|m|2}} at some time.<ref name=Book2/> The mill is {{convert|54|ft|m|2}} high to the top of the cap.<ref name=Book5 /> The brickwork is {{convert|4|ft|m|2}} thick at ground level and {{convert|18|in|mm}} thick at curb level.<ref name=Book2/>

The [[cast iron]] windshaft carries a clasp arm brake wheel with 88 cogs. It drives a wooden wallower with 50 cogs carried on a cast iron upright shaft. The {{convert|8|ft|10|in|m|2}} clasp arm great spur wheel has 122 cogs and drives three stone nuts <U+2013> two with 19 cogs and the third with 20 cogs. The [[millstone]]s are {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}, {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}} and {{convert|4|ft|3|in|m}} diameter.<ref name=Book2/>

As built, ''John Webb<U+2019>s Mill'' had a wooden windshaft some {{convert|18|in|mm}} longer than the present one, carrying four Common sails. It drove two pairs of millstones, the third pair being added at a later date. In 1890, the mill was carrying four double Patent sails<ref name=Book2/> and by the early 1900s  was working on two double Patent sails and two single Patent sails.<ref name=Book5 />
