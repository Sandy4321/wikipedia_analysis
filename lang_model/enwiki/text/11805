'''''American Communications Association v. Douds''''', 339 U.S. 382 (1950), is a 5-to-1 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] which held that the [[Taft<U+2013>Hartley Act]]'s imposition of an anti-[[Communism|communist]] oath on [[trade union|labor union]] leaders does not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], is not an ''[[ex post facto]]'' law or [[bill of attainder]] in violation of [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article One, Section 10]] of the [[United States Constitution]], and is not a "test oath" in violation of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution#Oaths|Article Six]] of the Constitution.

==Background==
The [[American Communications Association]] (ACA) was founded in 1931 as the American Radio Telegraphists Association (ARTA) by Mervyn Rathbone.<ref>Lowitt, ''Interpreting Twentieth-Century America: A Reader,'' 1973, p. 452.</ref><ref>The ARTA should not be confused with the United Radio Telegraphists Association, a similar union in the U.S. founded in 1917 but which had disbanded by 1922. See: May-Stewart, ''Handbook of American Trade-Unions: 1936 Edition,'' 1936, p. 278.</ref> The union represented [[Electrical telegraph|telegraphists]] and [[radio]] operators (on land and at sea) in the United States. The union had previously been involved in a Supreme Court case regarding the use of [[strikebreaker]]s in [[strike action|strikes]] (''[[NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 333 (1938)), which it had lost. In 1937, the union changed its name to the American Communications Association and affiliated with the newly-formed [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]].<ref>Downey, "Telegraph Messenger Strikes and Their Impact on Telegraph Unionization," in ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History,'' 2009, p. 516.</ref> A majority of the union's members were strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and most the the union's leaders were members of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA)<U+2014>with the union effectively under the control of the CPUSA.<ref>Stark, "Some Unions Will Sign Anti-Communist Papers," ''New York Times,'' August 31, 1947; Busky, ''Communism in History and Theory: Asia, Africa, and the Americas,'' 2002, p. 155; Starobin, ''American Communism in Crisis, 1943-1957,'' 1975, p. 143; Rabinowitz, ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir,'' 1996, p. 31.</ref>

The [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) on June 27, 1935, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed it into law on July 5.<ref>"Both Houses Clear Wagner Labor Bill," ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', June 28, 1935; "Roosevelt Signs the Wagner Bill as 'Just to Labor'," ''New York Times,'' July 6, 1935.</ref> In 1947, Congress amended the NLRA by enacting the [[Taft-Hartley Act|Labor<U+2013>Management Relations Act]] (better known as the Taft-Hartley Act) on June 23, 1947, overriding President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto.<ref>Stark, "Industry, Labor Sharply Divided," ''New York Times,'' June 21, 1947; White, "Truman Plea Fails," ''New York Times,'' June 24, 1947.</ref> Section 9(h) of the Taft-Hartley Act required leaders of labor unions to file an affidavit with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] affirming that they were not members of the Communist Party USA and did not advocate the violent overthrow of the United States federal government.<ref name="Abernathy260">Abernathy and Perry, ''Civil Liberties Under the Constitution,'' 1993, p. 260.</ref> If a union had an elected leader who did not file such an affidavit, that union would lose the protection of the NLRA.<ref name="Abernathy260" />

ACA leaders categorically refused to sign the anti-communist affidavits on the grounds that the oaths violated their First Amendment rights.  On October 29, 1947, Charles T. Douds, regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in [[New York]], barred the American Communications Association from appearing on an NLRB-supervised union organizing election (its very first action under the new Taft-Hartley anti-communist oath provisions).<ref>Stark, "NLRB Blocks Union Bargaining Right," ''New York Times,'' October 30, 1947.</ref><ref name="WillRule">"High Court Will Rule on Two Cases Involving Taft Act Oath and Eisler," ''New York Times,'' November 9, 1948.</ref> The ACA sued to have the provision declared unconstitutional as a violation of its leaders' First Amendment rights.<ref name="LoftusDelays">Loftus, "High Court Delays Red Clause Ruling," ''New York Times,'' January 14, 1949.</ref>

On June 29, 1948, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held, in a 2-to-1 decision written by Judge [[Thomas Swan]], that Section 9(h) did not impermissibly impose on union members' First Amendment rights.<ref name="Final">"Final Court Test on Taft Bill Seen," ''New York Times,'' June 30, 1948.</ref> Attorney [[Victor Rabinowitz]] appealed the case to the Supreme Court.<ref name="Final" /> The U.S. Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] on November 8, 1949.<ref name="WillRule" /> Although the Court was due to hear oral argument on January 13, 1949, it delayed this in order to take on another case (''United Steelworkers of America v. National Labor Relations Board'') with almost identical issues.<ref name="LoftusDelays" /> Argument was rescheduled for February 28, 1949,<ref name="LoftusDelays" /> but did not occur until October 11 so that both cases could be heard together.

Three of the Court's most liberal justices did not participate in the decision.<ref>Rabinowitz, ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir,'' 1996, p. 54.</ref><ref name="Wicek547">Wicek, ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States...,'' 2006, p. 547.</ref> Justice [[William O. Douglas]] did not participate because he had nearly been killed in a horseback-riding accident earlier in the year, and was still convalescing at his home in [[Arizona]].<ref>Christopher, ''Chances of a Lifetime: A Memoir,'' 2001, p. 20; Douglas, ''The Court Years, 1939-1975: The Autobiography of William O. Douglas,'' 1981, p. 95.</ref> Associate Justice Tom Clark had been President Truman's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], and had overseen the prosecution of the ACA.<ref>Frankel, ''History in Dispute: The Red Scare After 1945,'' 2000, p. 151; Wicek, ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States...'', 2006, p. 546.</ref> Although he joined the Court on August 24, 1949,<ref>"Truman Sees Clark Sworn In By Vinson at the White House," ''New York Times,'' August 25, 1949.</ref> Clark had [[recusal|recused]] himself to his prior involvement in the case.  Associate Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]], a staunch liberal and strong advocate for civil rights,<ref>Newman, ''The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law,'' 2009, p. 473.</ref> had died unexpectedly of a [[stroke]] on September 10, 1949, at the age of 55.<ref>"Justice Wiley Rutledge Dies of Brain Hemorrhage at 55," ''New York Times,'' September 11, 1949.</ref> His successor, 59-year-old [[Sherman Minton]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Indiana]] and a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], was nominated as his replacement on September 16, 1949, but was not sworn in until October 12.<ref>Wood,  "Minton Named to High Court," ''New York Times,'' September 16, 1949; "Minton Is Confirmed For Court, 48 to 16," ''Associated Press,'' October 5, 1949; "Minton Sworn In As Supreme Court Justice," ''New York Times,'' October 13, 1949.</ref> His arrival on the Court came two days after oral argument, and he was not able to participate in the decision.<ref>As it turned out, Minton was one of the Court's more conservative members.

==Decision==
===Majority ruling===
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]] wrote the plurality decision for the majority, joined by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justices]] [[Stanley Forman Reed]] and [[Harold Hitz Burton]]. Associate Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] joined in all but Part VII of the majority opinion.

In Part I of the decision, Vinson first reviewed the relevant language in the Taft-Hartley Act, as well as that language which provided for processing of affidavits and imposition of penalities in the event no affidavits were filed in the time permitted.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 385.</ref> He also reviewed the justification for upholding the constitutionality of the NLRA, which was to remove obstructions to interstate commerce.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 387.</ref> He also reviewed Congress' justification for passing the Taft-Hartley Act, which also attempted to remove impediments to interstate commerce<U+2014>including the so-called "political strike," in which "legitimate trade union objectives" were subordinated by the Communist Party to political objectives.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 387-389.</ref>

In Part II, Vinson posed what a plurality of the court believed was the key question:<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 390.</ref>
:We are, therefore, neither free to treat <U+00A7> 9(h) as if it merely withdraws a privilege gratuitously granted by the Government, nor able to consider it a licensing statute prohibiting those persons who do not sign the affidavit from holding union office. The practicalities of the situation place the proscriptions of <U+00A7> 9(h) somewhere between those two extremes. The difficult question that emerges is whether, consistently with the First Amendment, Congress, by statute, may exert these pressures upon labor unions to deny positions of leadership to certain persons who are identified by particular beliefs and political affiliations.

Part III of the decision addressed Congress' power to prevent political strikes through the [[Commerce Clause]], whether the remedy designed was reasonable, and whether the threat posed by the Communist Party was so unique in its use of political strikes and in advocacy of violence that Congress could single it out. Vinson answered all questions affirmatively.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 390-391.</ref> Citing ''[[In re Summers]]'', 325 U.S. 561 (1945); ''[[Clarke v. Deckebach]]'', 274 U.S. 392 (1927); and ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 320 U.S. 81 (1943), among others, Vinson noted that the Constitution often permitted otherwise irrelevant beliefs, personal traits, or employment status to be infringed upon in certain, limited circumstances.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 391-392.</ref>

The question addressed in Part IV of the decision was whether the Communist Party presented such circumstances.  The unions had argued that a "[[clear and present danger]]" test be applied to the legislation, as this was a First Amendment issue, but could not agree on how to do so.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 393.</ref> Vinson rejected this test as mechanical.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 394-395.</ref> But Congress had not concluded in eacting the Taft-Hartley Act that expressing communist beliefs was a danger; rather, Congress had wished to eliminate impediments to interstate commerce.<ref name="Douds396">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 396.</ref> The problem with political strikes, Vinson asserted, was that rather than allowing speech to combat speech in the "[[marketplace of ideas]]", strikes constitute force and coercion which Congress has every authority to regulate.<ref name="Douds396" /> One of the unions had argued that political strikes did not constitute such an imminent danger as to pass constitutional scrutiny, but Vinson rejected this once more as a mechanical application of an inapt test.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 397-398.</ref>  Rather, Vinson argued, the Constitution permits infringement of constitutionally-protected rights when a sound truck invades the privacy of the home (''[[Kovacs v. Cooper]]'', 336 U.S. 77 (1949)), unauthorized parades disrupt traffic (''[[Cox v. New Hampshire]]'', 312 U.S. 569, (1941)), the health of children is at stake (''[[Prince v. Massachusetts]]'', 321 U.S. 158 (1944)), or the provision of public services is affected (''[[United Public Workers v. Mitchell]]'', 330 U.S. 75 (1947)).<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 398-399.</ref> Advocating a balancing of interests and citing ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', 98 U. S. 145 (1878) (an individual's religious beliefs cannot be accepted as proof of a felony act without evidence of commission of the crime), Vinson instead proposed a balancing test.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 399-400.</ref>

Part V of the decision discussed whether political strikes posed such a significant issue as to permissibly infringe on freedom of speech. Vinson refused to substitute the Court's judgment for the congressional determination that this was the case.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 400-401.</ref> In accepting the authority of government to promote strong unions, Vinson observed, the Court had repeatedly also accepted the authority of government to infringe in sometimes substantial ways upon individual liberties.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 401-402.</ref> The Taft-Hartley Act's penalties, Vinson held, were not direct infringements on the freedom to speak and thus not as onerous as infringements the Court had approved in the past.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 402-405.</ref> Vinson rejected the suggestion that the statute had not been narrowly drawn. Although legislation could have been enacted which made political strikes themselves unlawful (rather than require anti-communist affidavits), Vinson asserted that:<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 406.</ref>
:...the legislative judgment that interstate commerce must be protected from a continuing threat of such strikes is a permissible one in this case. The fact that the injury to interstate commerce would be an accomplished fact before any sanctions could be applied, the possibility that a large number of such strikes might be called at a time of external or internal crisis, and the practical difficulties which would be encountered in detecting illegal activities of this kind are factors which are persuasive that Congress should not be powerless to remove the threat, not limited to punishing the act. 

Part VI of the decision discussed whether the statute impermissibly targeted the Communist Party as the sole political party seeking the violent overthrow of the United States government. If the statute had penalized anyone who advocated violent overthrow of the government, Vinson held, there were be new constitutional doubts raised.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 406-407.</ref> But it was the Court's long-held tenet that statutes should be construed constitutionally wherever possible.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 407.</ref> Subsequently, Vinson interpreted Section 9(h) narrowly as barring from union office those who actually advocated overthrow of the government and not those who (for example) believed it would happen without their assistance.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 407-408.</ref> Vinson reiterated that the balancing of interests in Part V had found the infringement on free speech pemissible.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 408-412.</ref> But how did this reconcile with ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''?  Because, Vinson said, "Insofar as a distinction between beliefs and political affiliations is based upon absence of any 'overt act' ... the act of joining the Party is crucial. ... courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent<U+2014>the state of men's minds<U+2014>having before them no more than evidence of their words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition may be inferred."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 410-411.</ref>

In Part VII, Vinson address whether Section 9(h) was unconstitutionally vague and/or was a bill of attainder or ''ex post facto'' law. Vinson admitted that, hypothetically, the language of the Act might be construed as vague. But in accordance with the Court's long-held rule, he construed the Act narrowly and asserted that there was no vagueness.<ref name="Douds413">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 413.</ref> Although the unions had held the Act was a bill of attainder under ''[[United States v. Lovett]]'', 328 U.S. 303 (1946); ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1867); and ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867), Vinson observed that these cases punished past actions whereas Section 9(h) punished only future conduct.<ref name="Douds413" /> Nor did the Act run afoul of Article VI of the Constitution: "...the mere fact that <U+00A7> 9(h) is in oath form hardly rises to the stature of a constitutional objection. All that was forbidden was a 'religious Test.' We do not think that the oath here involved can rightly be taken as falling within that category."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 414-415.</ref>

The judgment of the district court was affirmed.<ref name="Douds415">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 415.</ref>

===Concurrence===
Associate Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] concurred with the majority opinion except as to Part VII.<ref name="Douds415" />

Frankfurter argued that constitutional questions should be decided as narrowly as possible.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 416.</ref> He asserted that "it would make undue inroads upon the policymaking power of Congress" to deny the government the right to prevent political strikes and disruptions to interstate commerce so long as it does not do so in an arbitrary way or infringes on unrelated rights.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 417-418, quoted at 417.</ref>

However, despite his agreement with nearly all of the majority's reasoning in Parts I-VI, Frankfurter held that portions of Section 9(h) over impermissibly overbroad.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 419.</ref> Section 9(h) "<nowiki>ask[s]</nowiki> assurances from men regarding matters that open the door too wide to mere speculation or uncertainty. It is asking more than rightfully may be asked of ordinary men to take oath that a method is not 'unconstitutional' or 'illegal' when constitutionality or legality is frequently determined by this Court by the chance of a single vote."<ref name="Douds420">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 420.</ref> The safeguards of the judicial system, Frankfurter asserted, were "too tenuous to neutralize the danger" to First Amendment freedoms.<ref name="Douds420" />

Section 9(h) simply goes too far, he said, in demanding that an oath taken today<U+2014>even if well-considered, sincere, and seriously undertaken<U+2014>is predictive of all future behavior and belief.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 420-421.</ref> "I cannot deem it within the rightful authority of Congress to probe into opinions that involve only an argumentative demonstration of some coincidental parallelism of belief with some of the beliefs of those who direct the policy of the Communist Party, though without any allegiance to it. To require oaths as to matters that open up such possibilities invades the inner life of men..."<ref name="Douds422">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 422.</ref> 

Frankfurter acknowledged, however, that only these parts of Section 9(h) were invalid, and he would have remanded the case back to the district court with instructions for the union officers to obey only those constitutionally sound provisions.<ref name="Douds422" />

===Concurrence/Dissent===
Associate Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] concurred in part and dissented in part.

Jackson held that the critical distinction was the nature of the Communist Party:  "If the statute before us required labor union officers to forswear membership in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party, I suppose all agree that it would be unconstitutional. But why, if it is valid as to the Communist Party?"<ref name="Douds422" /> But "the Communist Party is something different, in fact, from any other substantial party we have known, and hence may constitutionally be treated as something different in law."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 423.</ref> Jackson reviewed at length the reasons why the Communist Party was unique:  It constituted a minority which advocated the seizing of power through non-majoritarian means, it was a political party controlled by a foreign government, it was dedicated to violence as the means of seizing power (including "occasional terroristic and threatening methods, such as picketing courts and juries, political strikes and sabotage"), it sought to achieve its violent ends by controlling the labor movement (control it must conceal in order to be effective), and it considers all its members "agents" of the party (unlike loosely-knit "native" parties).<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 425-433, quoted at 429-430.</ref>

Jackson equated the power of Congress to protect a union from domination by the Communist Party equal to the power Congress had to prevent a union from being dominated by an employer.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 433.</ref> The Taft-Hartley Act did not prevent unions from governing themselves or union members from electing Communists as its officers, but rather ensured transparency in governance and elections (thereby ensuring self-governance as well).<ref name="Douds434">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 434.</ref>

Jackson agreed with the majority that the Act did not infringe free speech, but rather merely withdrew the protection of the NLRA from unions which exercised their transparent choice to elect Communists as leaders.<ref name="Douds434" /> Jackson saw the chilling effect on free speech to be incidental:<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 434-435.</ref>
:I suppose no one likes to be compelled to exonerate himself from connections he has never acquired. I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.
However, did Congress have the "power to proscribe any opinion or belief which has not manifested itself in any overt act"?<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 436.</ref> That raised much more serious constitutional questions, Jackson said. He agreed that "The law sometimes does inquire as to mental state, but only, so far as I recall, when it is incidental to, and determines the quality of, some overt act in question."<ref name="Douds437">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 437.</ref> Citing ''[[Cramer v. United States]]'', 325 U.S. 1 (1945), Jackson observed that the Constitution barred punishment even of the very serious crime of treason unless there was so overt act.<ref name="Douds437" /> But under the majority's decision, Jackson said, "since Congress has never outlawed the political strike itself, the Court must be holding that Congress may root out mere ideas which, even if acted upon, would not result in crime."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 438.</ref> That was anathema to the Constitution.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 437.</ref> Agreeing that the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought. "I think that, under our system, it is time enough for the law to lay hold of the citizen when he acts illegally, or in some rare circumstances when his thoughts are given illegal utterance. I think we must let his mind alone."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 444.</ref>

Jackson would have upheld the power of Congress to require disclosure of past acts or membership in the Communist Party, but overturned any parts of the Act that called for a disclosure of belief.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 445.</ref>

===Dissent===
Associate Justice [[Hugo Black]] dissented.

The First Amendment does not allow the government to regulate beliefs, Black asserted, and yet the majority admitted that this is exactly what Section 9(h) does.<ref name="Douds446">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 446.</ref> Despite the majority's lengthy citation of cases, Black said, "No case cited by the Court provides the least vestige of support for thus holding that the Commerce Clause restricts the right to think."<ref name="Douds446" />

Black found that Section 9(h) did indeed impose a "test oath" on union leaders, and the Constitution explicitly barred such oaths.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 4446-449.</ref> He rejected the majority's claim that the First Amendment was not offended since only a small number of people were affected. The very nature of "the First Amendment is its protection of each member of the smallest and most unorthodox minority."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 448.</ref>

Furthermore, Black said, the majority's decision does not prevent the government from "barring Communists and their suspected sympathizers from election to political office, mere membership in unions, and, in fact, from getting or holding any jobs whereby they could earn a living."<ref name="Douds449">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 449.</ref> He also found offensive the majority's belief that the Supreme Court exists to protect individual liberty. That claim "springs from the assumption that individual mental freedom can be constitutionally abridged whenever any majority of this Court finds a satisfactory legislative reason. Never before has this Court held that the Government could for any reason attaint persons for their political beliefs or affiliations. It does so today."<ref name="Douds449" /> That Congress had concluded from testimony that the Communist Party was a threat to national security was irrelevant, he said, for Democrats could testify the same thing about Republicans and thus ban Republicans from union office just as effectively.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 449-450.</ref> Such reasoning was offensive to the idea of constitutionally protected liberties, Black said:<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 450.</ref>
:Under today's opinion, Congress could validly bar all members of these parties from officership in unions or industrial corporations; the only showing required would be testimony that some members in such positions had, by attempts to further their party's purposes, unjustifiably fostered industrial strife which hampered interstate commerce.
Nor was Justice Jackson's claim that the Communist Party was foreign-controlled a valid reason for imposing test oaths. Test oaths were imposed in 16th century England because Protestant rulers feared papal control of their Roman Catholic subjects, Black noted.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 450-451.</ref> Even [[Thomas Jefferson]] was once accused of having more loyalty to [[France]] than the United States.<ref name="Douds451">''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 451.</ref> The Constitution expressly barred test oaths because of injustices such as these, Black said.<ref name="Douds451" />

Black also held that "Guilt should not be imputed solely from association or affiliation with political parties or any other organization, however much we abhor the ideas which they advocate."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 452.</ref> Addressing the majority's "suicide pact" idea, Black asserted that the First Amendment's tolerance of anti-democratic ideas was what protected the nation from disaster: "...the postulate of the First Amendment is that our free institutions can be maintained without proscribing or penalizing political belief, speech, press, assembly, or party affiliation. This is a far bolder philosophy than despotic rulers can afford to follow. It is the heart of the system on which our freedom depends."<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 452-453.</ref> Citing ''[[DeJonge v. Oregon]]'', 299 U.S. 353 (1937), Black noted that a unanimous Court had already struck down laws which banned citizens from attending Communist Party meetings.<ref>''American Communications Association v. Douds'', 339 U.S. 382, 447.</ref> It should strike down the relevant portions of the Taft-Hartley Act as well, he concluded.

==Assessment==
The penalties imposed on the ACA by Section 9(h) crippled the union. In May 1949, the Congress of Industrial Organizations ordered its member unions to have their leaders sign the anti-communist oaths or risk expulsion.<ref>Loftus, "CIO Tells Leftists to Obey or Resign," ''New York Times,'' May 20, 1949.</ref> At its annual convention in early November 1949, the CIO found the ACA "guilty" of not filing the required oaths and ordered it expelled.<ref>Stark, "C.I.O. Starts Purge of Leftist Officers," ''New York Times,'' November 5, 1949; Stark, "Ouster of Leftists Is Pressed By C.I.O.," ''New York Times,'' November 6, 1949.</ref> Expulsion occurred in June 1950.<ref>"Two More Unions Expelled by C.I.O.," ''New York Times,'' June 16, 1950.</ref> But lacking the protection of the NLRA and constantly fending off raids from affiliates of the CIO and the [[American Federation of Labor]] (affiliates whose leaders were eager to sign the oath), the ACA shrank rapidly.<ref name="Estey34">Estey, ''The Unions: Structure, Development, and Management,'' 1981, p. p. 34.</ref> Several of its divisions (including the old ARTA department) had disaffiliated and the union had fewer then 2,000 members.<ref name="Estey34" /> It merged with the [[Teamsters]] in 1966.<ref name="Estey34" />

''American Communications Association v. Douds'' was the first important test of loyalty oaths in the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref name="Walker189">Walker, ''In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU,'' 1999, p. 189.</ref><ref name="Wicek547" /> The Court relied heavily on the oath-as-predictor-of-future-action rationale in upholding a local government loyalty test in ''[[Garner v. Board of Public Works]]'', 341 U.S. 716 (1951).<ref name="Walker189" /> The divided court in ''Douds'' anticipated the difficulty the Supreme Court would have in the coming years, during which time it usually upheld loyalty oaths but found no clear test or rule for doing so.<ref name="Wicek547" />

The reasoning by the majority in ''American Communications Association v. Douds'' has not been well-received by legal scholars. One historian characterized the decision as combining "guilt by association" with the discredited "[[bad tendency]] test".<ref name="Walker189" /> One legal scholar has called Vinson's heavy reliance on the Commerce Clause as "implausible".<ref name="Wicek547" /> The political strikes Vinson relied on for examples in the case were not Communist-led but rather routine labor conflicts.<ref name="Wicek548">Wicek, ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States...,'' 2006, p. 548.</ref> The majority (unwittingly or not) had bought into Cold War hysteria about the Communist Party and its ability to bring the nation to its knees through the use of political strikes.<ref name="Wicek548" /> Furthermore, Vinson's balancing test had a decidedly pro-government bias, and the decision appeared to undermine a decade's worth of First Amendment decisions.<ref>Wicek, ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States...,'' 2006, p. 548-549.</ref> Vinson's claim that the Taft-Hartley Act did not proscribe belief was "sophistry."<ref>Wicek, ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States...,'' 2006, p. 549.</ref>

In 1965, in ''[[United States v. Brown]]'', 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court overturned ''Douds'' by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder.<ref>Rabinowitz, ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir,'' 1996, p. 56.</ref>
