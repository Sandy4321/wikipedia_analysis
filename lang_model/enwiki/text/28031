==Biography==
Stein was born in [[Philadelphia]] but grew up in [[New England]], moving with his family to [[Maine]] in 1954.  After attending school in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], he moved to [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], where he graduated from high school in 1962.  Following high school, he attended [[Boston University]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in American History.  Stein then attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for a [[master's degree]] in China Studies.  He entered the [[U.S. Army]] in 1968 and served with [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|U.S. Army Intelligence]] as a case officer from 1968 to 1969.<ref name=CQ>{{cite web| url=http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/spytalk/about.html |title= [[CQ Politics]] about Jeff Stein}}</ref>  While stationed in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], he was awarded a [[Bronze Star]].

Stein began his journalism career at a suburban [[Washington, D.C.]] weekly.  He reported for [[NPR]], during its early years, while freelancing for major newspapers and magazines.  In 1981, he briefly edited the ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' before founding his own paper, ''The Washington Weekly'', which folded in 1984, after a year of publication.  He then joined [[UPI]], rising to deputy foreign editor.<ref name=HuffPo />  During this period he also wrote his first book, ''The Vietnam Factbook'', published in 1987.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.amazon.com/Vietnam-Fact-Book-Jeff-Stein/dp/0440193362 |title= Amazon.com listing for book}}</ref>  In 1992, Stein followed up with ''A Murder in Wartime'', a book which detailed a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] [[Project_GAMMA#Green_Beret_Affair|murder case]] that occurred during the Vietnam War.<ref name=HuffPo />  ''[[Time Magazine]]'' lauded the book, calling it "...the best military morality tale since [[The Caine Mutiny]]... an exhaustively researched and heavily documented history of the Green Beret murder case."<ref name=HuffPo />

In the 1990s, Stein began writing for ''[[Salon.com]]'' eventually becoming a national security correspondent and breaking one of its biggest stories, an expose of secret ties between the [[Kenneth Feld|Ringling Bros. Circus]] and a former [[CIA]] official, [[Clair George]].  In 2000, Stein teamed with [[Khidhir Hamza]], a scientist who worked on [[Saddam Hussein]]'s nuclear program before defecting in 1994, to write ''Saddam's Bombmaker''.  The book garnered widespread and enthusiastic reviews, including one from former chief of the [[National Security Agency]], Gen. [[William E. Odom]], who, in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called it, "Not only stranger but frequently bloodier than fiction. The book should attract a wide range of readers, from foreign policy and security specialists to bored airplane passengers looking for a thriller."<ref name=CQ />  In 2002, [[Congressional Quarterly]] hired Stein to launch and edit CQ/Homeland Security which was nominated for an award in its first year of existence.<ref name=CQ />

In 2005, Stein began writing a weekly column for CQ, entitled "SpyTalk", which evolved into a daily [[blog]] featuring original reporting and regular exclusives.  In October 2006, Stein sparked an uproar when he reported in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that many top counter-terrorism officials and members of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]] did not know the difference between [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and [[Shia Islam|Shiites]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/opinion/17stein.html?_r=1 |title= ''New York Times Article''}}</ref>  Two months later in his column, Stein got the new  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to reveal the he knew little about [[Al Qaeda]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://public.cq.com/public/20061211_homeland.html |title= ''CQ interview with Chair of House Intelligence Committee''}}</ref>  In April 2009, Stein, writing for [[CQ Politics]], broke the story that [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jane Harman]] had been wiretapped discussing aid for [[Jane_Harman#AIPAC_controversy|AIPAC]] defendants.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://antiwar.com/radio/2009/04/21/jeff-stein/ |title= Jeff Stein discusses the Harman case}}</ref>  The scandal brought additional attention to the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]] and implicated a number of other figures.

In addition to his work for CQ, Stein continues to write Op-Ed pieces and book reviews for the ''The New York Times'' and ''Washington Post''.  Through the years, he has also written for a wide range of other publications, including [[Esquire]], [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], [[GQ]], [[Playboy]], [[The New Republic]], [[The Nation]], and the [[Christian Science Monitor]].<ref name=Cap>{{cite web| url=http://www.thecapitol.net/Faculty/facultybior.html |title= Jeff Stein Biography}}</ref>  He also appears on [[CBS]], [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[NPR]], and [[BBC]], among others, to comment on U.S. national security issues.<ref name=Cap />
