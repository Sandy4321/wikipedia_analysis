'''''Trembling Before G-d''''' is an [[2001 in film|2001]] American [[documentary film]] about [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] trying to reconcile their sexuality with their faith. It was directed by [[Sandi Simcha DuBowski]], an American who wanted to compare [[Homosexuality and Judaism#Orthodox Jewish views|orthodox attitudes]] to [[Religion and homosexuality|homosexuality]] with his own upbringing as a gay [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jew]]. The film won several awards, including the [[Teddy Award]] for Best Documentary Film at the 2001 [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]], as well as Best Documentary at the 2001 [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and the 2003 [[GLAAD Media Awards]].

''Trembling Before G-d'' was filmed with compact, inconspicuous consumer video equipment and eventually digitally transferred to [[35 mm film]]. The footage was a mix of interviews shot in the subjects' homes and offices, sequences in the [[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]]<ref name="cinema verite">Newyorkerfilms.com, [http://www.newyorkerfilms.com/nyf/t_elements/trembling/trembling_pk%20.pdf Trembling Before G-d: A Film by Sandi Simcha DuBowski].

The film is mostly in English, but also has some subtitled [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and includes interviews with [[rabbi]]s and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities.<ref name="NYT"/> Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces [[pixelization|pixelized]].<ref name="Rechtshaffen" /> The majority of the participants are American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured.

Traditionally, Orthodox Judaism has prohibited homosexual conduct, as it was forbidden by the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]] (see [[Homosexuality and Judaism]]). In the last couple of decades, according to the documentary, positions on homosexuality have become more sympathetic.<ref name="cinema verite" /> However, Haredi Judaism, the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism, still views homosexuality as a perversion. As a result of the positive responses received from homosexual Orthodox Jews, however, the creators of the film have set up several organizations to teach Orthodox educators and rabbis about homosexuality.<ref name="USA" />

== Background ==
{{Main|Homosexuality and Judaism}}
While a variety of views regarding homosexuality exist within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including male-male [[anal sex]], in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor'', "die rather than transgress" <U+2013> the small category of [[The Bible and homosexuality|Biblically prohibited]] acts (including apostasy, murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law|Jewish laws on self-sacrifice]] to die rather than commit.<ref>Dorff, Elliot; Nevins, Daniel and  Reisner, Avram (December 6, 2006), [http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Homosexuality, Human Dignity, and Halakha], The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.

Familiarity with [[sociology|sociological]] and [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological]] studies, as well as personal contact with Jewish homosexuals, has brought some Orthodox leaders to a more sympathetic viewpoint, which views homosexuals as mentally ill rather than rebellious and advocates treatment rather than ostracism or jail. In the 1974 yearbook of the ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], a leader in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], urged sympathy and treatment: "Judaism allows for no compromise in its abhorrence of sodomy, but encourages both compassion and efforts at rehabilitation."  Lamm compared homosexuals to those who attempt [[suicide]] (also a sin in Jewish law), arguing that in both cases it would be irresponsible to shun or jail the sinner, but equally wrong for society to give "open or even tacit approval".<ref>Lamm, Norman, [http://www.jonahweb.org/sections.php?secId=90 Judaism and the Modern Attitude to Homosexuality], Jonahweb.org. Retrieved March 9, 2007.</ref>

When Orthodox rabbi [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]] publicly announced that he was homosexual, Rabbi [[Moshe David Tendler|Moshe Tendler]], a leading rabbi at the Modern Orthodox [[Yeshiva University]] where Greenberg was [[Semicha|ordained as rabbi]], stated "It is very sad that an individual who attended our [[yeshiva]] sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society," giving his opinion that Rabbi Greenberg's announcement is "the exact same as if he said, 'I'm an Orthodox Rabbi and I eat [[Unclean animals#Judaism|ham sandwiches]] on [[Yom Kippur]].'

== Synopsis ==
''Trembling Before G-d'' interviews and follows several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews, many only seen in silhouette, and also interviews several rabbis and psychologists regarding their views on homosexuality in Orthodox Judaism. The film repeatedly returns to several characters:

David is an observant Orthodox Jewish doctor from Los Angeles who has spent a decade trying to reconcile his homosexuality with Judaism. He has tried numerous forms of "treatment", from eating figs and praying to wearing a rubber band on his wrist [[aversion therapy#Aversion therapy and homosexuality|to flick]] whenever he thinks of men, but to no avail.<ref name="Rechtshaffen">Rechtshaffen, Michael (February 25, 2002), [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1353371 Trembling before G-d], Hollywoodreporter.com.

Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker who decided he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, and turned his back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to try to cure him. Now a [[tour guide]] around the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his [[life partner]], to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.<ref name="LA Times">Thomas, Kevin (February 20, 2002), [http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie000013084feb20,0,2776571.story 'Trembling Before G-d': A documentary by Sandi Simcha DuBowski looks at the conflict between honoring one's religion and sexual orientation.], ''Los Angeles Times''.

Michelle is another New Yorker, in her forties, who believed she was the only [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] lesbian in the world and as a consequence allowed herself to be pressured into marriage. However, she got divorced and was subsequently ostracized by her family and community when they discovered she was homosexual.

Mark is the English son of a Haredi rabbi.

He visits several yeshivas and other religious sites throughout the film.<ref>French, Philip (June 1, 2003), [http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,967976,00.html Trembling Before G-d], ''The Observer''.

They speak frankly about their lives in the film and discuss their fears that they may not [[Jewish eschatology#"The World to Come"|end up in heaven]] together.

Sandi Simcha DuBowski was making videos about the [[Christian right|Christian religious right]] when he began to examine his own upbringing as a gay [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jew]], and began making a personal video diary of his search for homosexuality among the Orthodox Jewish community.<ref name="Barry">Pearlman, Barry (Fall 2001),  "Interview with Sandi Dubowski", Filmmaker Magazine.</ref> On the making of the film, DuBowski said, "I don't think it was until I met people who were kicked out of their families and their Yeshivas, in marriages betraying their spouses, that it became clear why I was doing this film.

There is no narration, and the film may be considered to be an example of [[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]]. The film is also interspersed with silhouetted tableaus of Jewish religious practices, for example [[Shabbat]].<ref name="Barry" /> The language is predominantly English, with passages in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] that are [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]]. Also subtitled are passages with significant amounts of "[[Yeshivish (dialect)|Yeshivish]]", Yiddish-influenced technical terms in [[Judaism]]; for example, ''[[posek]]'' is translated as "judge on Jewish law", and ''[[Jewish services|daven]]'' is translated as "pray".

The title is an allusion to the word ''Haredi'' ({{lang-he|<U+05D7><U+05B2><U+05E8><U+05B5><U+05D3><U+05B4><U+05D9>}}), which can be interpreted as "one who trembles" in awe of God.<ref>Monserrate, Carey (March 22, 2004), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-118880771.html Trembling Playground: two young directors discuss film, faith, and the challenges of documenting religion.], ''CrossCurrents'' magazine.

No Haredi Orthodox group spoke out in favor of ''Trembling Before G-d''. Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], the spokesperson for [[Agudath Israel of America]], one of the largest Haredi organizations, criticized the film with an article titled "Dissembling Before G-d". In his response, he holds that gay people can be cured through therapy, and that the movie is meant to promote homosexuality:

{{quotation|<p>Unfortunately, though, "Trembling" seems to have other intents as well. While it never baldly advocates the case for broader societal acceptance of homosexuality or for the abandonment of elements of the Jewish religious tradition, those causes are subtly evident in the stark, simplistic picture the film presents of sincere, conflicted and victimized men and women confronted by a largely stern and stubborn cadre of rabbis.</p>
<p>That picture is both incomplete and distorted.
