'''''ReBoot''''' is a [[video game]] based on the [[ReBoot|television show of the same name]].

==Plot==
Megabyte has found a way to use the power of energy tears to reach the core of the principle office thanks to Hexadecimal's mirrors and is determined to take over Mainframe. You play as the lead character Bob, mending tears and destroying deadly adversaries in the six sectors of Mainframe: Baudway, Cit E (also known as Wall Street), Beverly Hills, Kits, Floating Point Park and G-Prime along with the island of Lost Angles.

==Items in the Game==
 
As you explored through each level you could find an item to power up your weapon, replenish your health or even give you invincibility. Some were hidden, while others appeared after defeating an enemy.

===Recharges/Helpful Items===
 
* '''Guardian Icon:''' Gave you an extra life 
* '''Health Diamond:''' Fully restored your health 
* '''Glitch Diamond:''' Fully restored your Weapon and Glitch tool energy 
* '''Health Icon:''' Restored your health 10% 
* '''Glitch Battery Icon:''' Restored your Weapon and Glitch tool energy 10% 
* '''Guardian Shield:''' Gave you temporary invincibility 
* '''Megabyte Key:''' Appeared in all the levels except the Boss stages. These gave you access to a vidwindow to finish the game. The amount to find varied on which level you were on, with the highest amount being four.
 
===Weapons===
 
Bob starts the game with an ordinary pistol, but as you progressed through the game you could obtain more powerful weapons:
 
* '''Pistol Triangle:''' This upgraded your original pistol from a slow shooter to a rapid fire gun.
* '''Blaster Triangle:''' Shot a deadly electrical charge, the more you collected, the bigger the charge.
* '''Rocket Triangle:''' Best used on long range targets, the more you collected the more rockets you could fire.
 
===Glitch===
 
This was Bob's variety of keytools to either mend a tear of defeat an enemy 

* '''Tear Mender:''' Your default tool used to mend tears scattered around Mainframe. It had unlimited energy.
* '''Box Gun:''' Froze your opponents for a limited time. 
* '''Mortar:''' Fired explosive grenades.
* '''Vampire:''' A boomerang like weapon used to steal health from enemies and replenish yours
* '''Anti Virus:''' Scrambled the wires of Megabyte's basic weapon, the turret, and turns it against your enemies.
* '''Grapple:''' Used automatically if Bob fell into a void, it consumed one third of your weapon energy, if you didn't have enough to use it, Bob fell to his death.
