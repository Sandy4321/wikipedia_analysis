'''''The X-Files''''' (also known as '''''The X-Files: Fight the Future''''') is a 1998 American [[science fiction film|science-fiction]], [[horror film|horror]] and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film written by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[Frank Spotnitz]], and directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]]. It is the first feature film based on ''[[The X-Files]]'' series created by Carter that revolves around a fictional FBI paranormal investigation unit called the [[X-File]]s. Three main characters from the television series appear in the film: [[David Duchovny]], [[Gillian Anderson]] and [[Mitch Pileggi]] reprise their respective roles as FBI agents [[Fox Mulder]], [[Dana Scully]] and Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]]. The film's tagline and sub-title is ''Fight the Future''.

The story follows agents Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson), removed from their usual jobs on the [[X-File]]s, and investigating the bombing of a building and the destruction of criminal evidence. They uncover what appears to be a [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|government conspiracy]] attempting to hide the truth about an [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien colonization of Earth]]. In addition to dealing with mysterious adversaries and unhelpful bosses, the agents face the end of their professional partnership. When Scully is abducted, Mulder goes to Antarctica to rescue her and finds a huge underground laboratory with cocooned aliens. When the lab is destroyed, he witnesses an alien spacecraft flying off into the distance. At the end of the film, the X-Files unit is reopened. Viewed in the context of [[The X-Files#Plot and mythology|''The X-Files'' chronology]], the film's story takes place between seasons five and six of the television series, and is based upon the series' [[Mythology of The X-Files|extraterrestrial mythology]].

Chris Carter decided to make a feature film to explore the show's mythology on a wider scale, as well as appealing to non-fans. He wrote the script with Frank Spotnitz at the end of 1996 and, with a budget from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], filming began in 1997, following the end of the show's fourth series. Carter assembled cast and crew from the show, as well as some other, well-known actors such as [[Blythe Danner]] and [[Martin Landau]], to begin production on what they termed "Project Blackwood". [[Mark Snow]] continued his role as ''X-Files'' composer to create the film's score.

The film premiered on June 19, 1998 in the United States, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although some enjoyed the style and effects of the film, others found the plot confusing and viewed it as little more than an extended episode of the series. A sequel, ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', was released ten years later.

==Plot==
The film opens in [[North Texas]], 35,000&nbsp;BC. Entering a cave, a [[Neanderthal]] man stumbles upon what appears to be a large [[extraterrestrial life]]form. They fight and the caveman wins, stabbing the creature to death, but is infected by black oil. In 1998 small-town Texas, a young boy ([[Lucas Black]]) falls down a hole and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground and slithers up his body until it reaches his head, causing his eyes to turn black. Firefighters descend into the hole to rescue him but are not seen again. A team of biohazard-suited men arrive on the scene.

Meanwhile, [[FBI]] Special Agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) have been assigned to other projects since the [[The End (The X-Files)|closure of the X-Files]]. They are helping to investigate a [[bomb threat]] against a federal building in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Mulder scouts out a building across the street from the believed target and discovers the bomb in a vending machine. Special Agent in Charge Michaud stays behind to disarm the bomb as Mulder and Scully evacuate the building. Unknown to the agents, Michaud makes no effort to disarm the bomb, which ultimately detonates.

Returning to [[Washington, D.C.]], Mulder and Scully are chastised because four people were still in the building when it exploded. They are scheduled separate hearings at which their job performances will be evaluated. That evening, Mulder encounters a paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil ([[Martin Landau]]), who explains that the four victims were already dead, and that the bomb was allowed to detonate to destroy the evidence of how they died.

Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas. On the way they follow a convoy of tanker trucks to a large cornfield surrounding two bright, glowing domes. When they enter the domes, they find them empty, but grates in the floor open up and a thick swarm of bees forces the agents out onto the cornfield. Soon [[black helicopter]]s appear overhead, chasing them, and the two escape back to Washington.

Upon their return, Mulder unsuccessfully tries to seek help from Kurtzweil, while Scully attends her performance hearing and learns that she is to be transferred to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Mulder is devastated to lose Scully as a partner. The two share a tender moment, when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar. She quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls for emergency aid but when an ambulance arrives, the driver shoots Mulder in the head and whisks Scully away. Awaking in hospital, Mulder is informed that the bullet only grazed his temple, and leaves with the assistance of the [[Lone Gunmen]]. He is accosted by a former adversary, the [[Well-Manicured Man]] ([[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]]), who gives him Scully's location in [[Antarctica]] along with a [[vaccine]] to combat the virus that has infected her. The Well-Manicured Man then commits suicide before his betrayal of [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|The Syndicate]] (a shadow government group working against Mulder and Scully) is discovered.

Mulder travels to Antarctica to save Scully, and discovers a secret underground laboratory run by their enemy the [[The Smoking Man|Cigarette Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]). Mulder uses the vaccine to revive Scully, disrupting the stable environment of the lab and reviving the [[Colonist (The X-Files)|cocooned aliens]]. The lab is destroyed just after Mulder and Scully escape to the surface, when an alien vessel lying dormant beneath it leaves its underground port and launches into the sky. Mulder watches the ship fly directly overhead and disappear into the distance, as Scully regains consciousness.

Some time later, Mulder and Scully attend a hearing where their testimony is ignored, and the evidence covered up. The only remaining proof of their ordeal is the bee that stung Scully, collected by the Lone Gunmen. She hands it over, noting that the FBI does currently has no investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence at hand. Later, appalled by the media's cover-up of the incident, Mulder tries to persuade Scully to leave his crusade. She refuses, saying, "If I quit now, they win."

At another crop outpost in [[Tunisia]], the Cigarette Smoking Man hands Strughold a telegram revealing that the [[X-File]]s unit has been re-opened.

|style="text-align: left;"|"We wanted it to be true to the TV show, for one thing. We didn't want ''[[The X-Files]]'' to become something else in the movie, just because we had a bigger budget to work with. Yet, we were also mindful that it had to be a culmination of something for the people who had been watching the show for five years, as well as an introduction of these characters and this story to people who hadn't."

After five successful seasons, Chris Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story for which the viewer would not need to be familiar with the show's setting and the various [[Mythology of The X-Files|story arcs]].<ref name="Makingthefilm">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]], [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Bowman, Rob]], [[David Duchovny|Duchovny, David]], [[Gillian Anderson|Anderson, Gillian]], [[Mitch Pileggi|Pileggi, Mitch]], [[Daniel Sackheim|Sackheim, Daniel]], Paris, David, Lombardi, Paul, Epstein, John, McLaglen, Josh, Beck, Mat, Wash, John and [[Mark Snow|Snow, Mark]]|date=1998 |title=The Making of The X-Files Movie |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Carter and [[Frank Spotnitz]] wrote major parts of the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and sketching out scenes for the series on [[3x5 card|3x5 index cards]]. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote about half of the 124-page screenplay for the film.<ref name="four">Duncan 1998, pp. 4-5.</ref>

Carter gave 90 pages of the screenplay to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] who received it well. While not officially [[greenlight]]ed, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when and where it would be filmed. Carter then enlisted [[Daniel Sackheim]] to produce the film. Sackheim had previously produced the [[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot episode of ''The X-Files'']] and directed several episodes in the first two seasons. ''The X-Files'' marked the his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.<ref>Duncan 1998, pp. 5-6.</ref>

During production, the filmmakers went to great lengths to preserve secrecy, including printing the script on red paper to prevent photocopying, and leaking disinformation to the media and giving the film the codename "Project Blackwood". The code was cracked by fans who speculated on the meaning behind it. According to Spotnitz, "Blackwood" held no particular significance.<ref>Duncan 1998, pp. 10-11.</ref>

At the beginning of the [[pre-production]] phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with [[Steven Spielberg]] for his 1993 film, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the [[Ten Thirteen Productions]] staff members<U+2014>but not take it away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as [[production designer]], Ward Russell as [[director of photography]] and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began.<ref>Duncan 1998, p 11.</ref>

===Writing and casting===
[[File:MartinLandau2008TIFF.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Martin Landau]] was one of the film's well-known stars]]
Both Carter and Spotnitz wanted to make the film "bigger" than the series, so they decided to start and end the film at an "extreme place" and explain aspects of the [[Mythology of The X-Files|story arc]] that the show had not. While gathering research materials, they learned that the Earth was once covered with ice and decided to open the film in [[Texas]] in 35,000&nbsp;BC with a [[Neanderthal]] as the first character to appear.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] and [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Bowman, Rob]] |date=1998 |title=Audio commentary for The X-Files |medium= DVD |publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>

The film included known actors from the show such as [[David Duchovny]] as [[Fox Mulder]], [[Gillian Anderson]] as [[Dana Scully]], [[Mitch Pileggi]] as [[Walter Skinner]] and [[William B. Davis]] as the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], as well as new actors and characters to the franchise. These included [[Martin Landau]] and [[Blythe Danner]]. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for ''[[The X-Files]]''. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable; "As soon as you put in an actor whose face is very recognizable, you've got a situation that works against the reality of the show."<ref name=eighteen>Duncan 1998, p. 18.</ref> He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered [[Glenne Headly]] the small role of a barmaid. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically.<ref name=eighteen />

===Set design===
Chris Nowak was hired as [[production designer]] for the film by [[Daniel Sackheim]]. Nowak was a former [[architect]] who had worked as a professional theater set designer for eight years, before moving towards the film business as an [[art director]]. Nowak had previously worked with Sackheim on a television production, which led to Sackheim contacting him to do an interview for the selection of a production designer. According to Sackheim, Nowak was hired because he was the only one able to create a "focused vision" for the film.<ref name="seven">Duncan 1998, p. 7.</ref>

Nowak wanted to start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers so that he could formulate "a sense of the atmosphere" which they wanted to create for the film. He wanted to create a "dark, scary and oppressive environment" for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation for his role in the production. Explaining this decision, he said, "I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. Of course, there were some elements from the show that had to be retained."<ref name="seven"/>

The design department found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by input from the filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts and sent them to Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork.<ref name="seven"/>

Once the set concepts were approved by Carter, Bowman, Sackheim and Ryan, they were sent to the blueprint stage so that construction of the sets could begin under the supervision of construction coordinator Bill Liams. All the major sets were constructed "simultaneously" because of the schedule. However, this proved to be a challenge for the production team, because it meant they had to pay the rent on all the stages at the same time. The set construction started seven weeks before filming.<ref name="seven"/>

|style="text-align: left"|Not only could I not have directed the movie as well as Rob Bowman [...] I didn't have the time to even attempt to direct the movie as well as Rob Bowman. Rob is a very collaborative person; and I thought that working with him collaboratively was a much wiser way to approach this than to try to do it myself."

[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] wanted to film in as many different locations as possible to give the film a "grander" feel than what had usually been achievable for the television episodes.<ref name="Makingthefilm"/><ref name="Commentary"/> Principal photography for the film started on June 16, 1997.<ref name="six"/>

''The X-Files'' was filmed in the [[Recess (break)|hiatus]] between the show's [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth]] and [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth seasons]] and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season. Due to the demands of the film shoot on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season did not revolve around both Mulder and Scully but just one of the two lead stars.<ref name="TheTruthBehind">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Vince Gilligan|Gilligan, Vince]], Shiban, John, [[Dean Haglund|Haglund, Dean]], [[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]], [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Bowman, Rob]], [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]], [[Veronica Cartwright|Cartwright, Veronica]], Rabwin, Paul, [[Mimi Rogers|Rogers, Mimi]] and [[R.W.

===Music===
{{main|The X-Files: Original Motion Picture Score|The X-Files: The Album}}
[[Mark Snow]], who had worked on the television series as a composer, was hired to score the film. [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] wanted a "very minimal approach" to the music. He did not want much "melody" and wanted to replace it with plain "ambient atmosphere" and "sound design". Snow mixed electronic music with an 85-member orchestra to give the film a "great sense of scope and grandeur."<ref name="Makingthefilm"/>

When creating the music for the film, Snow had a couple of months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked the first time in the history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used [[MIDI]] files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.<ref name="Music">{{citation|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=19 |last=Goldwasser|first=Dan|title=The S Files |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC|newspaper=</i>[[SoundtrackNet|Soundtrack.net]]<i> |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref>
