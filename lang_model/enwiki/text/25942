In [[2007]], the drug trade is booming. The [[Malaysian]] [[Intelligence]] and Anti-Narcotic Department are called upon for assistance by their [[Indian]] counterparts. There are rumours that a drug gang has recently moved their headquarters to [[Kuala Lumpur]].

Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]) is the leader of an underworld gang until the police commissioner tracks him down and kills him. Then police commissioner tracks down a lookalike of Billa who impersonates Billa to take down the rest of Billa's gang while the police commissioner promises him that he will give a proper [[education]] to the children that he is looking after. But in an unexpected turn of events the [[police commissioner]] dies. 

The police commissioner is the only one who knows the truth about our impersonator who now finds himself in a life-threatening situation - hunted by both the cops and the real Billa's henchmen and to make matters worse, he then finds out that Interpol Officer is a crook and has taken the place of the real person. He is the one responsible for the police commissioner's murder. It's now a race to retrieve a the police commissioner's diary in which the police commissioner has documented his substitution of the real Billa.

== Trivia == 

*[[Don (film)|Don]], the [[Bollywood]] blockbuster of the [[1980s]], was remade with contemporary idioms recently in Bollywood.

*The original [[Don]] was remade in [[Tamil]] in the [[1980s]] as [[Billa (1980 film)|Billa]].

*Billa is now being remade and reinvented in Tamil.

*Getting into the act will be [[Ajith Kumar]]. And directing it will be [[Vishnuvardhan]], the modern Tamil director.

*[[L. Suresh Balaji]] of Ananda Pictures will produce this film. [[Nirav Shah]] will handle the camera. [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]] will score the music.

*[[Shahrukh Khan]]<U+2019>s [[Don (2006 film)|Don]] is a big hit. In fact, such remakes are now the norm in [[Bollywood]].

*To make a [[Rajini]] movie as a remake takes guts and strength of character. And [[Ajith]] has shown that he has it in him.

*[[Ajith Kumar]] has also got the go-ahead from [[Rajini]].

*The film will begin rolling in [[March]] [[2007]].

*[[Vishnuvardhan]], sources claim, had been toying with this idea for long.
