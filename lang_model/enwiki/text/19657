'''LPG''' (an acronym for "Long Pretty Girls") is a manufactured girl group inspired by the success of "semi-trot" singer [[Jang Yoon Jung]].  Their name showcases the fact that all four members of this group were pageant participants, with two of them even making it into the Miss Korea pageant.  Their first album, '''Long Pretty Girls''', was released in fall of [[2005]].  Although most of the record consists of dance tracks, their first (and only) single was called '''<U+CE89><U+CE89> (Can Can)''', being (obviously) a [[Can-can]] song.  The novelty of the song brought them a lot of attention from the press, but neither the song nor the album were commercially popular.  However, it has been referenced and parodied by many Korean variety shows, including [[SBS]]'s ''X-Man'' and [[KBS]]'s ''Star Golden Bell''.

As of [[August 2006]], they are attempting to break into China.<ref>http://soompi.com/?q=node/704</ref>
