'''Isambard Kingdom Brunel''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] 
(9 April 1806 &ndash; 15 September 1859) ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+026A>z<U+0259>mb<U+0251>rd <U+02C8>k<U+026A><U+014B>d<U+0259>m br<U+028A><U+02C8>n<U+025B>l}}), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[engineer]]. He is best known for the creation of the [[Great Western Railway]], a series of famous [[steamship]]s, including the first with a propeller, and numerous important [[bridge]]s and [[tunnel]]s. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern day engineering.

Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained [[innovative]] solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his short career, Brunel achieved many engineering "firsts", including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a [[navigable river]] and development of [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']], the first [[propeller]]-driven ocean-going iron ship, which was at the time also the largest ship ever built.<ref>[[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']] ([http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/history/brunel/]) '''Isambard Kingdom Brunel''' Retrieved 29 March 2006.</ref> His steamship the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern]]''  laid the first lasting [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|telegraph cable]] across the Atlantic Ocean.

Brunel suffered several years of ill health, with [[kidney]] problems, before succumbing to a [[stroke]] at the age of 53 years. Brunel was said to smoke up to 40 cigars a day and to sleep as little as four hours each night.

In 2006, the [[bicentenary]] of his birth, a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name ''Brunel 200''.<ref>Brunel 200 ([http://www.brunel200.com]) Brunel 200 website Retrieved February 21, 2006.</ref>

==Early life==
The son of engineer Sir [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] (the name Brunel is  a derivation from the French name Brun, cognate with Brown)<ref>{{cite book |last= Hanks|first= Patrick|coauthors= Hodges, Flavia|others= David L. Gold|title= A Dictionary of Surnames|origyear= 1988|edition= 1st (with corrections)|year= 1996|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location= [[Oxford]]|isbn= 0192115928|pages= 78<U+2013>79}}</ref>, an exiled [[Frenchman]], and [[Sophia Kingdom|Sophia]] ([[Married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Kingdom) Brunel (d. 1854), Isambard Kingdom Brunel was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], on 9 April 1806.<ref>Brunel University (see [http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/history/ikb]) ''History: Isambard Kingdom Brunel'' Retrieved February 20, 2006.</ref> His father was working there on block-making machinery for the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]].

At the age of 14 years Brunel was sent to [[France]] to be educated at the [[Lyc<U+00E9>e Henri-Quatre]] in [[Paris]] and the [[University of Caen]] in [[Normandy]].<ref name=3ships>Dumpleton. ''Brunel's Three Ships'', Intellect Books, 2002. (ISBN 1-84150-800-4)</ref> When Brunel was 15 years of age, his father, [[Marc Brunel]], was sent to a debtors prison for debts of over <U+00A3>5000. These were mostly paid by the government to prevent this eminent engineer defecting to Russia. Isambard was therefore able to continue his studies in France.
   
Brunel rose to prominence when, aged 20, he was appointed chief assistant engineer of his father's greatest achievement, the [[Thames Tunnel]], which runs beneath the river between [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]]. 

The first major sub-river tunnel, it succeeded where other attempts had failed, thanks to Marc Brunel's ingenious [[tunnelling shield]] &mdash; the human-powered forerunner of today's mighty [[Tunnel boring machine|tunnelling machine]]s &mdash; which protected workers from cave-in by placing them within a protective casing. Marc Brunel had been inspired to create the shield after observing the habits and anatomy of the [[shipworm]], ''[[Teredo navalis]]''.

Most modern tunnels are cut in this way, notably the [[Channel Tunnel]] between southern England and France.<ref>West, Graham. ''Innovation and the Rise of the Tunnelling Industry'', Cambridge University Press, 1988. (ISBN 0-521-33512-4)</ref>

Brunel established his design offices at 17<U+2013>18 Duke Street, London, and he lived with his family in the rooms above.<ref>Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Felix; Mendelssohn, Cecille; Ward, Jones. ''The 1837 Diary of Felix and Cecille Mendelssohn Bartholdy'', Oxford University Press, 1997. (ISBN 0-19-816597-8)</ref> 

On 5 July 1836, Brunel married Mary Elizabeth Horsley (b. 1813), the eldest daughter of composer and organist [[William Horsley]], who came from an accomplished musical and artistic family.

[[R.P. Brereton]], who became his chief assistant in 1845, was in charge of the office in Brunel's absence, and also took direct responsibility for major projects such as the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] as Brunel's health declined.

==Thames Tunnel==
[[Image:ThamesTunnelFromWapping.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] in 2005, then part of the [[London Underground]] [[East London Line]] between [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]].]]
{{main|Thames Tunnel}}

Brunel worked for nearly two years to create a tunnel under London's [[River Thames]], with tunnellers driving a horizontal shaft from one side of the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer, and the project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company. The composition of the Thames river bed at [[Rotherhithe]] was often little more than waterlogged sediment and loose gravel, and although the extreme conditions proved the ingenuity of Brunel's tunnelling machine, the work was hard and hazardous.<ref>Aaseng, Nathan. '''Construction: Building The Impossible''', The Oliver Press, Inc., 1999. (ISBN 1-881508-59-5)</ref>

For the workers the building of the tunnel was particularly unpleasant because the Thames at that time was still little better than an open sewer, so the tunnel was usually awash with foul-smelling, contaminated water. The tunnel was often in imminent danger of collapse due to the instability of the river bed, yet the management decided to allow spectators to be lowered down to observe the diggings at a [[shilling]] a time. Two severe incidents of flooding halted work for long periods, killing several workers and badly injuring the younger Brunel. 

The later incident, in 1828, killed the two most senior miners, Collins and Ball, and Brunel himself narrowly escaped death; a water break-in hurled him from a tunnelling platform, knocking him unconscious, and he was washed up to the other end of the tunnel by the surge. As the water rose, by luck he was carried up a service stairway, where he was plucked from almost certain death by an assistant moments before the surge receded. Brunel was seriously hurt (and never fully recovered from his injuries), and the event ended work on the tunnel for several years.<ref name = 3ships/>

Originally designed for pedestrians, the tunnel was converted to accommodate the ''East London Railway'' in 1869 and became part of the [[London Underground]] [[East London Line]] between [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]] in 1933.<ref>UK Government - Transport for London ([http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/company/history/early-years.asp]) '''London Underground History - The Early Years''' Retrieved February 18, 2006.</ref> It was closed in December 2007 to be converted for use by the [[London Overground]] system and is due to reopen in 2010.  The building that contained the pumps to keep the Thames Tunnel dry was saved from demolition in the 1970s by volunteers and made a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and grade two listed building. It now houses the [[Brunel Engine House|Brunel Museum]], which documents not just the Thames Tunnel but also Marc and Isambard's many other achievements.
The Thames tunnel is open to the public during September each year as part of the [[Open House London]] Weekend. Free-of-charge tube trains, travelling at creep speed, journey through the tunnel, and guides point out the remnants of the world's first shopping mall. Vendors used to trade in the arches built along its length.

==Bridges==

[[Image:Clifton.bridge.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] spans the [[Avon Gorge]], linking [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in [[Bristol]] to [[Leigh Woods]] in North [[Somerset]].]]
[[Image:Saltashrab.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Albert Bridge]], seen from [[Saltash railway station]].]]

Brunel's solo engineering feats started with bridges &mdash; the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] spanning the [[River Tamar]] at [[Saltash]] near [[Plymouth]], and an unusual timber-framed bridge near [[Bridgwater]].<ref>Billington, David P. '''Tower and the Bridge''', Princeton University Press, 1985. (ISBN 0-691-02393-X)</ref>

Brunel's oldest [[wrought iron]] bridge is the [[Windsor Railway Bridge]], which was opened in 1849.

Built in 1838, the [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge]] over the Thames in [[Berkshire]] was the flattest, widest brick arch bridge in the world and is still carrying main line trains to the west. There are two arches, with each span totalling 128&nbsp;ft (39&nbsp;m), having a rise of only 24&nbsp;ft (7&nbsp;m), and a width that carries four tracks. The rather flat arches reduce the difficulty railway engines have with steep gradients (especially on hump-back bridges) and today's trains are about 10 times as heavy as Brunel ever imagined.<ref>Gordon J E (1978) '''Structures: or why things don't fall down''', Penguin, London, 395pp. (ISBN 0-14-013628-2)</ref>

In 1845 [[Hungerford Bridge]], a [[suspension bridge|suspension footbridge]] across the [[River Thames]], near [[Charing Cross Station]] in [[London]], was opened only to be replaced by a new railway bridge in 1859.

Throughout his  railway building, but particularly on the [[South Devon Railway|South Devon]] and [[Cornwall Railway]]s where economy was needed and there were many valleys to cross, Brunel made extensive use of wood for the construction of substantial viaducts;<ref>Lewis, Brian. '''Brunel's timber bridges and viaducts''', Ian Allan, Hersham, 2007. (ISBN 978-07110-3218-7)</ref> these have had to be replaced over the years.

The Royal Albert Bridge was designed in 1855 for the [[Cornwall Railway]] Company, after [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] rejected his original plan for a train [[ferry]] across the [[Hamoaze]] &mdash; the estuary of the tidal [[River Tamar|Tamar]], [[River Tavy|Tavy]] and [[River Lynher|Lynher]]. The bridge (of ''bowstring girder'' or ''tied arch'' construction) consists of two main spans of 455&nbsp;ft (139&nbsp;m), 100&nbsp;ft (30&nbsp;m) above mean high [[spring tide]], plus 17 much shorter approach spans. Opened by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] on 2 May 1859, it was completed in the year of Brunel's death.

However, Brunel is perhaps best remembered for the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] in [[Bristol]]. Spanning over 700&nbsp;ft (213&nbsp;m), and nominally 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) above the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]], it had the longest span of any bridge in the world at the time of construction. Brunel submitted four designs to a committee headed by [[Thomas Telford]] and gained approval to commence with the project. Afterwards, Brunel wrote to his brother-in-law, the politician [[Benjamin Hawes]]: "Of all the wonderful feats I have performed, since I have been in this part of the world, I think yesterday I performed the most wonderful. I produced unanimity among 15 men who were all quarrelling about that most ticklish subject &mdash; taste". He did not live to see it built, although his colleagues and admirers at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] felt the bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds and to amend the design. Work started in 1862 and was complete in 1864, five years after Brunel's death.<ref>BBC History (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/brunel_isambard_01.shtml]) '''Brunel: The Practical Prophet of Technological Innovation''' by Professor G. Ross Peters Retrieved November 21, 2006.</ref>

In 2006, there is the possibility that several of Brunel's bridges over the Great Western Railway might be demolished because the line is planned to be electrified, and there is inadequate clearance for the overhead wires. [[Buckinghamshire]] County Council is petitioning to have further options pursued, in order that all nine of the historic remaining bridges on the line can remain.<ref>Bucks CC (see [http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/archaeology/brunel_bridges_news.htm])

==Great Western Railway==
[[Image:Paddington Station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paddington Station]], still a mainline station, was the [[London]] [[Terminal station|terminus]] of the [[Great Western Railway]].]]
{{main|Great Western Railway}}

In the early part of Brunel's life, the use of railways began to take off as a major means of transport for goods. This influenced Brunel's involvement in railway engineering, including railway bridge engineering.  

In 1833, before the Thames Tunnel was complete, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the [[Great Western Railway]], one of the wonders of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain, running from London to [[Bristol]] and later [[Exeter]].<ref>Garrison, Ervan G. '''A History of Engineering and Technology''', CRC Press, 1998. (ISBN 0-8493-9810-X)</ref>  The Company was founded at a public meeting in [[Bristol]] in 1833, and was incorporated by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1835.
It was Brunel's vision that passengers would be able to purchase one ticket at London Paddington and travel from London to New York, changing from the Great Western Railway to The Great Eastern Steamship at the Terminus in [[Neyland]], South Wales. 

Brunel made two controversial decisions: to use a [[broad gauge]] of {{RailGauge|84}} for the track, which he believed would offer superior running at high speeds; and to take a route that passed north of the [[Marlborough Downs]], an area with no significant towns, though it offered potential connections to [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] and [[Gloucester, England|Gloucester]] and then to follow the Thames Valley into London.  His decision to use broad gauge for the line was controversial in that almost all British railways to date had used [[standard gauge]]. Brunel said that this was nothing more than a carry-over from the mine railways that [[George Stephenson]] had worked on prior to making the world's first passenger railway. Brunel worked out through mathematics and a series of trials that his broader gauge was the optimum railway size for providing stability and a comfortable ride to passengers, in addition to allowing for bigger [[railroad car|carriages]] and more [[freight]] capacity.<ref>Oliivier, J. '''The Broad Gauge the Bane of the Great Western Railway Company''', 1846</ref> He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself.

Drawing on his experience with the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western contained a series of impressive achievements &mdash; soaring [[viaduct]]s, specially designed stations, and vast tunnels including the famous [[Box Tunnel]], which was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time.<ref name = 3ships/>[[Image:Brunel 2.JPG|thumb|right|Isambard Kingdom Brunel - [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum|Steam Museum]], [[Swindon]].]]There is an anecdote that Box Tunnel is so oriented that the sun shines all the way through it on Brunel's birthday. For more information, see [[Box Tunnel]].<ref>Williams, Archibald. '''The Romance of Modern Locomotion''', C. A. Pearson Ltd., 1904.</ref>

The initial group of locomotives ordered by Brunel to his own specifications proved unsatisfactory, apart from the [[GWR Star Class|North Star locomotive]], and 20-year-old [[Daniel Gooch]] (later Sir Daniel) was appointed as Superintendent of [[Locomotive]]s. Brunel and Gooch chose to locate their [[Swindon railway works|locomotive works]] at the village of [[Swindon]], at the point where the gradual ascent from London turned into the steeper descent to the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] valley at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

Brunel's achievements ignited the imagination of the technically minded Britons of the age, and he soon became one of the most famous men in the country on the back of this interest.

After Brunel's death the decision was taken that standard gauge should be used for all railways in the country. Despite the Great Western's claim of proof that its broad gauge was the better (disputed by at least one Brunel historian), the decision was made to use Stephenson's standard gauge, mainly because this had already covered a far greater amount of the country.  However, by May 1892 when the broad gauge was abolished the Great Western had already been re-laid as [[dual gauge]] (both broad and standard) and so the transition was a relatively painless one.<ref name = 3ships/> At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at [[Neyland]], sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and a number of information boards here depict various aspects of his life. There is also a larger than life bronze statue of him holding a steamship in one hand and a locomotive in the other.

The present [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]] was designed by Brunel and opened in 1854. Examples of his designs for smaller stations on the Great Western and associated lines which survive in good condition include [[Mortimer railway station|Mortimer]], [[Charlbury railway station|Charlbury]] and [[Bridgend railway station|Bridgend]] (all [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]]) and [[Culham railway station|Culham]] ([[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudorbethan]]). Surviving examples of wooden [[train shed]]s in his style are at 
[[Frome railway station|Frome]] and [[Kingswear railway station|Kingswear]].

The great achievement that was the [[Great Western Railway]] has been immortalised in the [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum]].

==Brunel's "atmospheric caper"==
[[Image:Brunel's Atmospheric Railway.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of Brunel's atmospheric railway, using a segment of the original piping at [[Didcot Railway Centre]]]]
[[Image:Brunel's Atmospheric Railway section of pipe.jpg|thumb|right|A section of pipe in the [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum]]]]

Though ultimately unsuccessful, another of Brunel's interesting use of technical innovations was the [[atmospheric railway]], the extension of the GWR southward from Exeter towards [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]], technically the [[South Devon Railway Company|South Devon Railway]] (SDR), though supported by the GWR. Instead of using [[locomotive]]s, the trains were moved by Clegg and Samuda's patented system of atmospheric ([[vacuum]]) traction, whereby stationary pumps sucked air from the tunnel.

The section from Exeter to Newton (now [[Newton Abbot]]) was completed on this principle, with pumping stations with distinctive square chimneys spaced every two miles, and trains ran at approximately 20&nbsp;[[miles per hour]] (30&nbsp;[[km/h]]).<ref name = 3ships/> Fifteen-inch (381&nbsp;mm) pipes were used on the level portions, and 22-inch (559&nbsp;mm) pipes were intended for the steeper gradients.

The technology required the use of leather flaps to seal the vacuum pipes. The leather had to be kept supple by the use of [[tallow]], and tallow is attractive to [[rat]]s. The result was inevitable &mdash; the flaps were eaten, and vacuum operation lasted less than a year, from 1847 (experimental services began in September; operationally from February 1848) to 10 September 1848.<ref>Parkin, Jim. '''Engineering Judgement and Risk''', Thomas Telford (publishers), 2000. (ISBN 0-7277-2873-3)</ref> 

The accounts of the SDR for 1848 suggest that atmospheric traction cost 3s 1d (three shillings and one penny) per mile compared to 1s 4d/mile for conventional steam power. A number of [[South Devon Railway engine houses]] still stand, including that at [[Totnes]] (scheduled as a grade II listed monument in 2007 to prevent its imminent demolition, even as Brunel's bicentenary celebrations were continuing) and at [[Starcross]], on the estuary of the [[River Exe]], which is a striking landmark, and a reminder of the atmospheric railway, also commemorated as the name of the village [[pub]].

A section of the pipe, without the leather covers, is preserved at the [[Didcot Railway Centre]].

==Transatlantic shipping==

[[Image:Brunel-Launch-Leviathon.jpg|right|frame|Brunel at the Launching of The Great Eastern with John Scott Russell & Lord Derby]]

Even before the Great Western Railway was opened, Brunel was moving on to his next project: [[transatlantic]] shipping. He used his prestige to convince his railway company employers to build the ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]'', at the time by far the largest steamship in the world. Great Western first sailed in 1837.

She was 236&nbsp;ft (72&nbsp;m) long, built of wood, and powered by sail and paddle wheels. Her first return trip to [[New York City]] took just 29&nbsp;days, compared to two months for an average sailing ship. In total, 74&nbsp;crossings to New York were made. 

The ''[[SS Great Britain|Great Britain]]'' followed in 1843; much larger at 322&nbsp;ft (98&nbsp;m) long, she is considered the first modern ship, in that she was built of metal rather than wood, was powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel. She was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lienhard, John H. '''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''', Oxford University Press US, 2003. (ISBN 0-19-516731-7)</ref>

Brunel was a strong proponent of propellers for ships, and the Royal Navy commissioned him to prepare a test for proof of the propeller's superior propulsion method compared with the paddle wheels of that time.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} Brunel fitted two identical tugs of the same engine and power, one with paddle wheels and the other with a propeller, and staged a "tug of war" with two tugs pulling a rope on the Thames river in England.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The propeller driven [[HMS Rattler (1843)|HMS Rattler]] was further challenged by having to pull the rival tug boat upstream,{{Fact|date=May 2008}} yet the propeller driven tug boat won and the Royal Navy was convinced propellers were more efficient.<ref>http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=137 History of HMS Rattler</ref>

In 1852 Brunel turned to a third ocean-going ship, even larger than both of her predecessors, and intended for voyages to [[India]] and [[Australia]]. The ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]'' (originally dubbed ''Leviathan'') was cutting-edge technology for her time: almost 700 ft (213 m) long, fitted out with the most luxurious appointments and capable of carrying over 4,000 passengers.

She was designed to be able to cruise under her own power non-stop from London to Sydney and back since engineers of the time were under the misapprehension that Australia had no coal reserves, and she remained the largest ship built until the turn of the century. Like many of Brunel's ambitious projects, the ship soon ran over budget and behind schedule in the face of a series of momentous technical problems.<ref name=3ships>Dumpleton. '''Brunel's Three Ships''', Intellect Books, 2002. (ISBN 1-84150-800-4)</ref>

The ship has been portrayed as a [[white elephant]], but it can be argued that in this case Brunel's failure was principally one of economics &mdash; his ships were simply years ahead of their time. His vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, screw-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

''Great Eastern'' was built at [[John Scott Russell]]'s Napier Yard in London, and after two trial trips in 1859, set forth on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on 17 June 1860.<ref>'''Zerah Colburn: The Spirit of Darkness''', Arima Publishing, 2005. (ISBN 1-84549-024-X)</ref>

Though a failure at her original purpose of passenger travel, she eventually found a role as an oceanic [[telegraph]] cable-layer, and the ''Great Eastern'' remains one of the most important vessels in the history of shipbuilding &mdash; the [[Trans-Atlantic cable]] had been laid, which meant that [[Europe]] and [[North America|America]] now had a [[telecommunications]] link.<ref name=3ships>Dumpleton. '''Brunel's Three Ships''', Intellect Books, 2002. ISBN 1-84150-800-4</ref>

==Crimean War==

During 1854, Britain entered into the [[Crimean War]], and an old Turkish Barrack building became the British Army Hospital in [[Scutari]] (modern-day [[<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar]] in [[Istanbul]]). With injured men suffering from a variety of illnesses including [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid]] and [[malaria]] purely from hospital conditions,<ref>Report on Medical Care (see [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/battles/crimea/popup/medical.htm]) British National Archives (WO 33/1 ff.119, 124, 146-7 (23 February 1855))</ref> [[Florence Nightingale]] sent a plea to [[The Times]] for the government to produce a solution.

Brunel was already working on building the [[SS Great Eastern]] amongst other projects, but accepted the task in February 1855 of designing and building the [[War Office]] requirement of a temporary, [[Prefabrication|pre-fabricated]] hospital that could be shipped to the [[Crimea]] and erected.
In 5 months he had designed, built and shipped the pre-fabricated wood and canvas buildings<ref>Renkioi Hospital Buildings image (see [http://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/cms/images/stories/exhibitions/renkioi_hospital.jpg]) The Florence Nightingale Museum, retrieved January 12, 2009</ref> that were erected near Scutari Hospital where Nightingale was based, in the malaria-free area of Renkioi.<ref name = renkioi/>

His designs incorporated the necessity of [[hygiene]], providing access to [[sanitation]], ventilation, drainage and even rudimentary temperature controls. They were feted as a great success, some sources stating that of the 1,300 (approximate) patients treated in the Renkioi temporary hospital, there were only 50 deaths.<ref>Palmerston, Brunel and Florence Nightingale<U+2019>s Field Hospital (see [http://www.hmswarrior.org/brunel/resources/palmerston_and_politics.pdf]) Palmerston and Politics, HMSwarrior.org retrieved November 30, 2006</ref> In the Scutari hospital it replaced, deaths were said to be as many as 10 times this number. Nightingale herself referred to them as "those magnificent huts."<ref>Public Health (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/britainsmodernbrunels.shtml]) Britain's Modern Brunels, BBC Radio 4, retrieved November 30, 2006</ref> 
Brunel not only designed the buildings but gave advice as to the location of placing.<ref>Prefabricated wooden hospitals (see [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/battles/crimea/popup/prefab.htm]) Isambard Kingdom Brunel, British National Archives (WO 43/991 ff.76-7 (7 September 1855))</ref>

The art of using pre-fabricated modules to build hospitals has been carried forward into the present day,<ref name=renkioi>Hospital Development Magazine (see [http://www.hdmagazine.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=2032207]) Lessons from Renkioi, November 10, 2005</ref> with hospitals such as the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] being created in this manner.

==Illnesses and death of Brunel==
In 1843, while performing a [[magic trick|conjuring trick]] for the amusement of his children, Brunel accidentally inhaled a [[British half sovereign coin|half-sovereign]] coin, which became lodged in his windpipe. A special pair of [[forceps]] failed to remove it, as did a machine devised by Brunel himself to shake it loose.

Eventually, at the suggestion of Sir Marc, Brunel was strapped to a board and turned upside-down, and the coin was jerked free.<ref>Dyer, T.F. Thiselton. '''Strange Pages from Family Papers 1900''', Kessinger Publishing, 2003. (ISBN 0-7661-5346-0)</ref> He convalesced by visiting [[Teignmouth]] and enjoyed the area so much that he purchased an estate at Watcombe in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. Here he designed [[Brunel Manor]] and its gardens to be his retirement home. Unfortunately he never saw the house or gardens finished, as he died before it was completed.

Brunel suffered a [[stroke]] in 1859, just before the ''Great Eastern'' made her first voyage to [[New York]].<ref> Deborah Cadbury. '''Seven Wonders of the Industrial World''' 2003, Fourth Estate, (ISBN 0-00-716304-5)</ref> He died ten days later at the age of 53 and was buried, like his father, in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London.<ref>Skempton, A; Rennison, Robert William; CoxHumphreys, Rob. '''Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland v. 1 1500-1830''', Thomas Telford (publishers), 2002. (ISBN 0-7277-2939-X)</ref> 

He left behind his wife Mary and three children: Isambard Brunel Junior (1837<U+2013>1902), [[Henri Marc Brunel]] (1842<U+2013>1903) and Florence Mary Brunel (1847<U+2013>1876).<ref>[http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/03021207.html Brunel Collection: Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859) papers]</ref> Henri Marc enjoyed some success as a [[civil engineer]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Isambard Kingdom Brunel - Bronze - Temple - London.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze statue of Brunel at [[Temple tube station|Temple]] in London.]]
As a celebrated engineer in his own time, Brunel is much revered to this day, emphasised by the numerous monuments to him. There are statues in London at [[Temple tube station|Temple]] (pictured) and [[Brunel University]], Bristol, Saltash, Swindon, Milford Haven, [[Neyland]] and [[Paddington station]]. The flagpole of the Great Eastern is at the entrance to [[Liverpool FC]], and a section of the ship's funnel is at Sutton Poyntz, near Weymouth. Brunel was placed second in the heavily publicised "[[100 Greatest Britons]]" TV poll conducted by the [[BBC]] and voted for by the public. In the second round of voting, which concluded on 24 November 2002, Brunel was placed second, behind [[Winston Churchill]]. The building of the Great Eastern was dramatised in an episode of the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Seven Wonders of the Industrial World]]'' (2003).

Brunel is also often claimed to be the inventor of the [[Bar (counter)]] as an item of furniture for quickly serving large numbers of customers in cafes, refreshment rooms, hotels and public houses. Both the Great Western Hotel at [[Paddington Station]] and the [[Swindon railway station]] refreshment rooms claim to have had the world's first bar. This device continues to remain popular all over the world.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

Contemporary locations bear Brunel's name, such as [[Brunel University]] in London, and a collection of streets in Exeter: Isambard Terrace, Kingdom Mews, and Brunel Close. A road, car park and school in his home town of Portsmouth are also named in his honour, along with the town's largest pub. Although not of any real architectural merit, the Brunel shopping centre in [[Bletchley, Milton Keynes]] is named after him.

Many of Brunel's bridges are still in use; these designs have stood the test of time. Brunel's first engineering project the Thames Tunnel is to become part of the East London Overground Railway System and the [[Brunel Engine House]] at Rotherhithe that once housed the steam engines that powered the tunnel pumps still stands as a museum dedicated to the work and lives of Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Many of Brunel's original papers and designs are now held in the Brunel collection at the [[University of Bristol]].<ref>[http://www.bris.ac.uk/is/services/specialcollections/brunel.html].</ref>

Brunel is credited with turning the town of [[Swindon]] into one of the largest growing towns in Europe during the 1800s.<ref>Swindon Advertiser (see [http://thisisswindon.co.uk/search/display.var.675915.0.how_town_was_put_on_the_map_by_brunel.php]) '''How Town was put on the map by Brunel''' by Stephanie Tye January 20, 2006</ref> The siting of the Great Western Railway locomotive sheds there and the need for housing for the workers, gave Brunel the impetus to build hospitals, churches and housing estates in what was termed 'New Swindon' (subsequently swallowed by the rest of the expanding, mainly agricultural, town). This area is known today as the 'Railway Village'. Brunel's addition of a Mechanics Institute for recreation and hospitals and clinics for his workers gave [[Aneurin Bevan]] the basis for the creation of the [[National Health Service]] according to some sources.<ref>BBC Legacies (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/wiltshire/article_4.shtml] '''A model for the NHS''' Retrieved November 30, 2006</ref> The current hospital in Swindon was named the [[Great Western Hospital]] in commemoration, which also contains the 'Brunel Treatment Centre'.

In 2006, the [[Royal Mint]] struck a [[British two pound coin|<U+00A3>2]] coin to "celebrate the 200th anniversary of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his achievements".<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/PackedSets/UKIBSP.asp].</ref> The coin depicts a section of the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] at [[Saltash]], along with a portrait of Brunel. The Post Office issued a set of commemorative stamps.
