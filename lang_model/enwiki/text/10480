'''Christian apologetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>, "speaking in defense") is a field of [[Christian theology]] that aims to present a [[reason|rational]] basis for the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], defend the faith against objections, and expose the perceived flaws of other [[world view]]s.<ref>{{cite_book |author=John M. Frame |title=Apologetics to the Glory of God |location=Phillipsburg |publisher=Presbyterian & Reformed |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-87552-243-2}}</ref> Christian [[apologetics]] has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with [[Paul the Apostle]], including writers such as [[Origen]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]], and continuing currently with the modern Christian community through the efforts of many authors in various Christian traditions such as [[G.K.Chesterton]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]. Apologists have based their defense of Christianity on historical [[evidence]], philosophical [[argument]]s, scientific investigation, and arguments from other disciplines. "Christian [[polemic]]" is a term used for apologetics which primarily criticizes or attacks other belief systems.<ref>Maijastina Kahlos, ''Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures c. 360-430'' (Ashgate, 2007), pp. 7<U+2013>9 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=k3NH7dv1OfUC&dq=apologetics+%22christian+polemic%22&q=%22christian+polemic%22#v=snippet&q=%22christian%20polemic%22&f=false et passim]''; Ernestine van der Wall, "Ways of Polemicizing: The Power of Tradition in Christian Polemics," in ''Religious Polemics in Context.

==Biblical motivation==
Several biblical passages have historically motivated Christian apologetics.

R.C. Sproul, quoting the [[First Epistle of Peter]] ({{bibleverse-nb|1|Pet|3:15|ESV}}), writes that "The defense of the faith is not a luxury or intellectual vanity. It is a task appointed by God that you should be able to give a reason for the hope that is in you as you bear witness before the world."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sproul|first=Robert C.|title=Defending Your Faith: An Introduction to Apologetics|year=2003|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton IL|isbn=978-1-4335-0315-3|pages=9}}</ref> The verse quoted here reads in full: "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." 

Another passage sometimes used as a Biblical basis for Christian apologetics is God's entreaty in the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Come now, let us reason together" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|1:18|ESV}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Geisler|first=Norman L. |title=Christian Apologetics|year=1988|publisher=Baker Academic |isbn=0-8010-3822-7|pages=11<U+2013>12}}</ref><ref name="GroothuisCA"/>

Other scriptural passages which have been taken as a basis for Christian apologetics include {{bibleverse||Psalm|19|ESV}}, which begins "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands," and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Rom|1:20|ESV}}, which reads "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities<U+2014>his eternal power and divine nature<U+2014>have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."<ref>Owen Anderson, ''Reason and Worldviews: Warfield, Kuyper, Van Til and Plantinga on the Clarity of General Revelation and Function of Apologetics'', University Press of America, 2008, ISBN 0-7618-4038-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LlrkFv4uvREC&pg=PA2 p. 2.]</ref>

==History==
Early Christian apologists include [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and the author of the [[Epistle to Diognetus]].<ref>[[Avery Dulles|Avery Cardinal Dulles]], ''A History of Apologetics'', Ignatius Press, 2nd ed., 2005, ISBN 0-89870-933-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA31 pp. 31<U+2013>42.]</ref> [[Augustine of Hippo]] was a particularly significant apologist of the [[Patristics|Patristic]] era.<ref>Dulles, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA73 p. 73 ff.]</ref>

[[Thomas Aquinas]], an influential Catholic philosopher, presented five arguments for God's existence in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), "The Five Ways"| publisher =Texas A&M University Department of Philosophy| url =http://www-phil.tamu.edu/~gary/intro/paper.aquinas.html| accessdate =2007-11-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023014109/http://www-phil.tamu.edu/~gary/intro/paper.aquinas.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}</ref> while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.<ref>Dulles, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA120 p. 120.]</ref><ref>L.

[[Blaise Pascal]] outlined an approach to apologetics in his [[Pens<U+00E9>es]]: "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true."<ref>[[Blaise Pascal]], ''Pens<U+00E9>es'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.iv.html 187].</ref><ref name="GroothuisCA">[[Douglas Groothuis]], ''Christian Apologetics: A Comprehensive Case for Biblical Faith'', InterVarsity Press, 2011, ISBN 0-8308-3935-6, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rQ_SdH1PWyMC&pg=PA25 pp. 25<U+2013>31.]</ref>

===Current landscape===
Christian apologetics continues to the current day in a wide variety of forms. The Roman Catholics [[G. K. Chesterton]],<ref name="everMan">{{cite book|last=Chesterton|first=G.K.|title=The Everlasting Man|year=2008|publisher=Wilder Publications|isbn=1-60459-246-X|pages=180|url=http://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Man-Gilbert-K-Chesterton/dp/160459246X/ref=pd_sim_b_2}}</ref> [[Ronald Knox]], [[Karl Keating]] and [[Scott Hahn|Dr. Scott Hahn]], the Anglican [[C. S. Lewis]] (who popularised the argument now widely known as [[Lewis's trilemma]]),<ref>Lewis, C.S., ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', London: Collins, 1952, p54-56. (In all editions, this is Bk. II, Ch. 3, "The Shocking Alternative.") Note: G. K. Chesterton used a similar argument about someone else in his ''The Napoleon of Notting Hill'' (1904): "He may be God. He may be the Devil. But we think it more likely as a matter of human probability that he is mad." See Cecil Chesterton, ''G. K. Chesterton: A Criticism'' (Seattle: Inklng, 2007), 26.</ref> the evangelical [[Norman Geisler]], the Lutheran [[John Warwick Montgomery]], and the Presbyterian [[Francis Schaeffer]] were among the most prolific Christian apologists in the 20th century, while [[Gordon Clark]] and [[Cornelius Van Til]] started a new school of philosophical apologetics called [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalism]], which is popular in [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] circles. Others include [[Josh McDowell]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Hugo Anthony Meynell]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Peter Kreeft]].

==Varieties==
There is a variety of Christian apologetic styles and schools of thought. The major types of Christian apologetics include: historical and legal evidentialist apologetics, presuppositional apologetics, philosophical apologetics, prophetic apologetics, doctrinal apologetics, biblical apologetics, moral apologetics, and scientific apologetics. The general information and arguments contained in the following overview are by no means exhaustive.

===Historical and legal evidentialism===
Various arguments have been put forth by legal scholars such as [[Simon Greenleaf]] and [[John Warwick Montgomery]] and others claiming that Western legal standards argue for the historicity of the resurrection of Christ.<ref>{{cite web| title =Testimony of the Evangelists| author =Simon Greenleaf (1783-1853)| publisher =BibleTeacher.org| url =http://www.bibleteacher.org/sgtestimony.htm| accessdate =2007-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =The Jury Returns: A Juridical Defense of Christianity| publisher =Issues, Etc.

Christian scholar [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]] and others argue against the pagan myth hypothesis for the origin of Christianity.<ref>{{cite web| title =Easter: Myth, Hallucination, or History?| publisher =LeadershipU.com| author =Edwin M. Yamauchi| url =http://www.leaderu.com/everystudent/easter/articles/yama.html| accessdate =2007-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Refuting the myth that Jesus never existed| publisher =Bede's Library by James Hannam| url =http://www.bede.org.uk/jesusmyth.htm| accessdate =2007-11-21}}</ref>
Sherwin-White stated:

<blockquote>For Acts, the confirmation of historicity is overwhelming. Yet Acts is, in simple terms and judged externally, no less of a propaganda narrative than the Gospels, liable to similar distortions. But any attempt to reject its basic historicity, even in matters of detail, must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted.... The agnostic type of form-criticism would be much more credible if the compilation of the Gospels were much later in time.... Herodotus enables us to test the tempo of myth-making, [showing that] even two generations are too short a span to allow the mythical tendency to prevail over the hard historic core.<ref>''Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament''. Oxford: Clarendon Press (1963), pp. 189-190</ref></blockquote>

===Prophetic fulfillment===
{{see also|Postdiction}}
In his book ''Science Speaks'', [[Peter Stoner]] argues that only God knows the future and that Biblical prophecies of a compelling nature have been fulfilled.<ref>[http://www.sciencespeaks.net/Prophetic_Accuracy.html Chapter 2], ''Science Speaks'',  [[Peter Stoner]]</ref>

Apologist [[Josh McDowell]] documents the Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ, relating to his ancestral line, birthplace, virgin birth, miracles, manner of death, and resurrection.<ref>{{cite book  | last = McDowell  | first = Josh  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict | publisher =  | date =  | location =    | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  | nopp = true| page = chapter 8 }}</ref>

Apologist [[Blaise Pascal]] believed that the prophecies are the strongest evidence for Christianity.   He notes that Jesus not only foretold, but was foretold, unlike in other religions, and that these prophecies came from a succession of people over a span of four thousand years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pascal|first=Blaise|title=Pens<U+00E9>es|year=1966|publisher=Penguin Group|location=England|pages=x,xii,xiii}}</ref>

===Biblical apologetics===
Biblical apologetics include issues concerned with the authorship and date of biblical books, [[biblical canon]], and [[biblical inerrancy]]. In addition, Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include [[Robert Dick Wilson]], [[Gleason Archer]], [[Norman Geisler]], and [[R. C. Sproul]]. Also, there are several resources that Christians offer defending inerrancy in regard to specific verses.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Authors defending the reliability of the Gospels include Craig Blomberg in ''The Historical Reliability of the Gospels''<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloomberg|first=Craig|title=The Historical Reliabilty of the Gospels|year=1987|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|location=Downeres Grove|isbn=0-87784-992-7}}</ref> and  Mark D. Roberts in ''Can We Trust the Gospels?''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Mark D.|title=Can We Trust The Gospels|year=2007|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-58134-866-8}}</ref>

===Philosophical apologetics===
Philosophical apologetics concerns itself primarily with [[arguments for the existence of God]], although they do not exclusively dwell on this area. As such, they do not argue for the veracity of Christianity over other religions but merely for the existence of any [[Creator god|Creator]] [[deity]]. Omnipotence and omniscience are inferred in these arguments to greater or lesser degrees: some argue for an interventionist god, some are equally relevant to a [[Deism|Deist]] conception of god. They do not support [[hard polytheism]], but could be used to describe the first god who created many other gods; however, the arguments are only relevant when applied to the first god (the [[Primum movens|First Cause]], [[Actus purus|Pure Act]] and [[Unmoved Mover]]; it is a contradiction ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' to suppose a plurality of "Pure Acts" or "First Causes" or "Unmoved Movers").

These arguments can be grouped into several categories:
#[[Cosmological argument]] - Argues that the existence of the universe demonstrates that God exists. Various primary arguments from cosmology and the nature of causation are often offered to support the cosmological argument.<ref>[http://godevidences.net/space/lawsofscience.php Evidences for God from Space<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2329 Apologetics Press - "So Long, Eternal Universe; Hello Beginning, Hello End!<U+201D><!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/wanser.asp Keith H. Wanser, physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
#[[Teleological argument]] (argument from design) - Argues that there is a purposeful design in the world around us, and a design requires a designer. [[Cicero]], [[William Paley]], and [[Michael Behe]] employed this argument as well as others.<ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v22/i2/design.asp A brief history of design<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
#[[Ontological argument]] - Argues that the very concept of God demands that there is an actual existent God.
#[[Argument from morality|Moral Argument]] - Argues that if there are any real objectively valid moral values, then there must be an absolute from which they are derived.<ref>[http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/god-ethi.html Morality Apart From God: Is It Possible?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
#[[Transcendental argument for the existence of God|Transcendental Argument]] - Argues that all our abilities to think and reason require the existence of God.
#[[Presuppositional apologetics|Presuppositional Arguments]] - Arguments that show basic beliefs of theists and nontheists require God as a necessary precondition.

Other philosophical arguments include:
*[[Alvin Plantinga]]'s argument that belief in God is properly basic.<ref>[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Intellectual Sophistication and Basic Belief in God<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*[[Pascal's wager]],<ref>[http://www.apologetics.com/default.jsp?bodycontent=/articles/theistic_apologetics/morris-wager.html Apologetics.com: Challenging Believers to Think and Thinkers to Believe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> an argument that, given neither theism nor atheism has an evidential advantage, theism is the wiser position.

====Presuppositional apologetics====
{{Main|Presuppositional apologetics}}
Presuppositional apologetics claims that [[presupposition (philosophy)|presuppositions]] are essential to any philosophical position, and that there are no "neutral" assumptions from which a Christian can reason with a non-Christian.<ref name="Presup">{{cite_encyclopedia |author=John M. Frame |url=http://www.frame-poythress.org//frame_articles/2005Presuppositional.htm| title=Presuppositional Apologetics |encyclopedia=New Dictionary of Christian Apologetics |editor=W. C. Campbell-Jack, Gavin J. McGrath, and C. Stephen Evans |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8308-2451-9  |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> There are two main schools of presuppositional apologetics, that of [[Cornelius Van Til]] (and his students [[Greg Bahnsen]] and [[John Frame (philosopher)|John Frame]]) and that of [[Gordon Haddon Clark]].

Van Til drew upon, but did not always agree with, the work of Dutch [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] philosophers and theologians such as [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], [[Hendrik G. Stoker]], [[Herman Bavinck]], and [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Bahnsen describes Van Til's approach to Christian apologetics as pointing out the difference in ultimate principles between Christians and non-Christians, and then showing that the non-Christian principles reduce to absurdity.<ref>Greg Bahnsen, ''Van Til's Apologetic'', P&R Publishing, 1998, ISBN 0-87552-098-7, pp. 275-77.</ref> In practice this school utilizes what has come to be known as the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].

Clark held that the Scriptures constituted the [[axiom]]s of Christian thought, which could not be questioned, though their consistency could be discussed.<ref name="Presup"/> A consequence of this position is that God's existence can never be demonstrated, either by empirical means or by philosophical argument. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the Calvinist theologian [[Robert L. Reymond]] argues that believers should not even attempt such proofs.

===Moral apologetics===
{{see also|Biblical law in Christianity}}
Moral apologetics states that real moral obligation is a fact. In the words of Catholic apologist [[Peter Kreeft]], "We are really, truly, objectively obligated to do good and avoid evil."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|title=Handbook of Christian Apologetics|year=1994|publisher=Intervarsity Press|location=Downers Grove|isbn=0-8308-1774-3|pages=72}}</ref>
In moral apologetics, the arguments for man's sinfulness and man's need for redemption are stressed. Examples of this type of apologetic would be [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]'s sermon "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]".<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/e/edwards/sermons/sinners.html Select Sermons | Christian Classics Ethereal Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Four Spiritual Laws religious tract (Campus Crusade for Christ) would be another example.<ref>[http://www.greatcom.org/laws/ The Four Spiritual Laws - English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Scientific apologetics===
Many Christians contend that science and the Bible do not contradict each other, and indeed that scientific fact supports Christian apologetics.<ref>Jitse M. van der Meer and Scott Mandelbrote, ''Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: Up to 1700'', BRILL, 2009, ISBN 90-04-17191-6, [http://books.google.com/books?id=I--WJ5X-LqYC&pg=PA295 p. 295.]</ref><ref>Kenneth Boa and Robert M.

These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator."<ref name="CCC287">''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 2nd ed. #287.</ref> The theologian and mathematician [[Marin Mersenne]], for example, used celestial mechanics as evidence in his apologetic work,<ref>Avery Cardinal Dulles, ''A History of Apologetics'', 2nd ed., Ignatius Press, 2005, ISBN 0-89870-933-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA159 p. 159.]</ref> while [[Matteo Ricci]] engaged in scientific apologetics in China.<ref>Jean Lacouture (tr.

Several Christian apologists have sought to reconcile Christianity and science in regard to the question of origins. [[Theistic Evolution]] asserts that classical religious teachings about God are compatible with the modern scientific understanding about biological evolution and that the Creator God uses evolution to bring about his plan. [[Denis Lamoureux]], in ''Evolutionary Creation: A Christian Approach to Evolution'' states that "This view of origins fully embraces both the religious beliefs of biblical Christianity and the scientific theories of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution. It contends that the Creator established and maintains the laws of nature, including the mechanisms of a teleological evolution."<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/evolutionary_creation.pdf Evolutionary creation], [[Denis Lamoureux]]</ref> 

The most radical example of a Christian-evolutionary synthesis is the work of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], which was intended as apologetics to the world of science,<ref>Dulles, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA297 p. 297 ff.]</ref> but which was later condemned by the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/dechardin.txt  ''Warning Considering the Writings of Father Teilhard de Chardin''], Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, June 30, 1962.</ref>

===Creationist apologetics===
{{main|Creationism}}
{{see also|Objections to evolution|Flood geology}}

[[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] understand the Bible to teach that the earth is less than 10,000 years old, and that the scientific establishment has not proven that the world is much older. Young Earth creationists have also engaged in points of Biblical apologetics (see above) with regard to various parts of the primordial history in Genesis 1-11 &ndash; for instance, the long life spans of people such as [[Methuselah]].<ref>[http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/805 Living for 900 years - Creation Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH311.html CH311: Vapor canopy's effect on lifespan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the [[Great Flood (Biblical)|Flood]],<ref>[http://www.icr.org/article/570/ Why Does Nearly Every Culture Have a Tradition of a Global Flood?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/flood.asp Get Answers: Noah's Flood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the [[Tower of Babel]],<ref>[http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a021.html Is there archaeological evidence of the Tower of Babel? - ChristianAnswers.Net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/confusionoflanguages.html CONFUSION OF LANGUAGES - Is there any reference in early Mesopotamian literature to what happened at the Tower of Babel?]</ref><ref>[http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/140-the-tower-of-babel-legend-or-history The Tower of Babel<U+2014>Legend or History?]</ref>

[[Old Earth creationists]], on the other hand, believe it is possible to harmonize the Bible's six-day account of creation with the scientific consensus that the universe is billions of years old, using basic reasoning. According to Psalms 90:4 and 2 Peter 3:8, time, as it pertains to God is  "a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as a day". If  the number 1,000 is interpreted as an arbitrarily large number, as the context would imply, then the actual number  of years  the earth has existed becomes a scientific matter, not a religious debate.  However, this is not  the only valid interpretation and Old Earth creationists such as astrophysicist, [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] see each of the six days of creation as being a long, but finite period of time, based on the multiple meanings of the Hebrew word "yom" (day light hours/24 hours/age of time) and other Biblical creation passages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reasons.org/interpreting-genesis/other-creation-passages/response-genesis-and-big-bang  |author=Ross, Hugh |coauthors=Endara, Miguel  |title=Response to Genesis and the Big Bang by Gerald Schroeder |publisher=Reasons To Believe |date=31 Dec. 1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christian-knowledge.com/forums/genesis-chapter1/day-genesis-t8.html |author=Russell, Ryan |title=Day 1 (Genesis 1:1-5) |publisher=Christian Knowledge |work=Genesis: verse-by-verse Bible Study |accessdate=3 Dec. 2010 }}</ref>

===Experiential apologetics===
Experiential apologetics is a reference to an appeal <U+201C>primarily, if not exclusively, to experience as evidence for Christian faith<U+201D>.<ref>{{Citation |author=Geisler, Normal L. |title=Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics. |place=Grand Rapids: Baker Academic |year=1999. }}</ref> Also, <U+201C>they spurn rational arguments or factual evidence in favor of what they believe to be a self-verifying experience<U+201D> . As a strength, this view stresses experience that other apologists have not made as explicit, and in the end the notion that the Holy Spirit convinces the heart of truth becomes the central theme of the apologetic argument.<ref>{{Citation |author=Lewis, Gordon R. |title=Testing Christianity's Truth Claims: Approaches to Christian Apologetics. |place=Lanham, MD: University Press of America Inc. |year=1990 }}</ref>
