'''Manuel Acu<U+00F1>a Roxas''' ([[January 1]], [[1892]] &ndash; [[April 15]], [[1948]]) was the first president of the independent [[Republic of the Philippines]]. He served as president from the granting of independence in [[1946]] until his abrupt death in [[1948]].

==Early life and career==
Roxas was born on [[January 1]], [[1892]] in [[Roxas City|Capiz]], [[Capiz]], a city that was renamed in his honor, to Rosario Acu<U+00F1>a.  His father, Gerardo Roxas, Sr., died before he was born.

Roxas studied college in [[University of Manila]], and law at the [[University of the Philippines]] and was the Bar topnotcher. He was a career politician who started as a provincial fiscal. In [[1921]], he was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives and in the following year he became speaker.

After the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was established ([[1935]]), Roxas became a member of the unicameral National Assembly, and served ([[1938]]-[[1941]]) as the Secretary of Finance in President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]'s cabinet. After the amendments to the 1935 Philippine Constitution were approved in 1941, he was elected ([[1941]]) to the Philippine Senate, but was unable to serve until 1945 because of the outbreak of [[World War II]].

Having enrolled prior to World War II as an officer in the reserves, he was made liaison officer between the Commonwealth government and the United States Army Forces in the Far East headquarters of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. He accompanied President Quezon to [[Corregidor]] where he supervised the destruction of Philippine currency to prevent its capture by the Japanese. When Quezon left Corregidor, Roxas went to Mindanao to direct the resistance there. It was prior to Quezon's departure that he was made Executive Secretary and designated as successor to the presidency in case Quezon or Vice-President [[Sergio Osme<U+00F1>a]] were captured or killed. Roxas was captured ([[1942]]) by the [[Japan]]ese invasion forces. After a period of imprisonment, he was brought to [[Manila]] and eventually signed the Constitution promulgated by the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic. He was made responsible for economic policy under the government of [[Jose P. Laurel]]. During this time he also served as an intelligence agent for the underground Philippine guerrilla forces. In [[1944]] he unsuccessfully tried to escape to Allied territory. The returning [[United States|American]] forces arrested him a Japanese collaborator. After the war, Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]] cleared him and reinstated his commission as an officer of the US armed forces. This resuscitated his political career.

When the Congress of the Philippines was convened in 1945, the legislators elected in 1941 chose Roxas as Senate President. In the Philippine national elections of [[1946]], Roxas ran for president as the nominee of the liberal wing of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista Party]]. He had the staunch support of General MacArthur. His opponent was [[Sergio Osme<U+00F1>a]], who refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew his reputation. However, in the [[April 23]], [[1946]] election, Roxas won 54 percent of the vote, and the Liberal Party won a majority in the legislature. When Philippine independence was recognized by the United States on [[July 4]], [[1946]], he became the first president of the new republic.

In [[1948]], Roxas declared amnesty for those arrested for collaborating with the Japanese during World War II, except for those who had committed violent crimes.

Manuel Roxas was married to Do<U+00F1>a [[Trinidad Roxas|Trinidad de Leon]] and had two children Ruby and Gerardo "Gerry" Roxas, Jr. who became congressman and a leader of Liberal Party. He died on [[April 15]], [[1948]] at the age of 56, after suffering a fatal heart attack after delivering a speech at [[Clark Air Base]] in Angeles, pampanga. He was succeeded by his vice president, [[Elpidio Quirino]].
