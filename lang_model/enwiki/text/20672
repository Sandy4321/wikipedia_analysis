In the [[Warsaw ghetto uprising]] of April-May [[1943]], Edelman became one of its leaders following the death of ZOB commander [[Mordechai Anielewicz]]. Edelman survived the uprising's suppression and the ghetto's liquidation, and managed to escape aided by underground activists of the [[Armia Ludowa]] (People's Army). He joined the Polish underground [[Armia Krajowa]] (Home Army), and in the summer of [[1944]] participated in the [[Warsaw Uprising]].

During the period of [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in [[1981]], he was interned. He took part in the [[Round Table Talks]] and served as a member of the [[Sejm|Sejm (Polish parliament)]] from [[1989]] until [[1993]].
