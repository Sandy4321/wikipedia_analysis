Together with [[Philip King (musician)|Philip King]] and [[Sonny Condell]] in 1974 he formed a popular [[folk-rock]]/[[Jazz fusion]] group that started out as an occasional band called The Sunday Night Band. The following year, 1975, after White had left the band, it morphed into [[Scullion (group)|Scullion]]. In 1977 he formed 'The Fake' and the following year he formed The Freddie White Band.<ref name=oy>{{cite book|last=Wallis|first= Geoff |year=1991|title=The Rough Guide to Irish Music|location=London|publisher= Rough Guides Ltd|ISBN = 1-85828-642-5}}</ref>

His first album, ''Recorded Live On Tour 1978'', was recorded by [[Clannad]] producer [[Nicky Ryan]] while White was opening gigs for Clannad around Ireland during 1978. 

In 1992, White emigrated to [[Boston]], [[USA]] where he remained for twelve years - returning to Ireland in 2004. After seven years back home in Ireland, White relocated to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in March 2011, where he currently resides with his partner, Trish Hickey. 

White has been touring internationally since the 1980s, solo as well as with fellow musicians. He performs interpretations of work of some of his favorite performers, such as [[Randy Newman]] (nine covers recorded), [[John Hiatt]], (nine covers recorded) [[Tom Waits]] and [[Guy Clark]].<ref name=exa>{{Cite web |

as well as some jazz standards and his own compositions.
