==Career==
Jenkins was born in [[Watford]] and began a two year academy scholarship with Watford in summer 2007. During the [[2007<U+2013>08 in English football|2007&ndash;08]] season he played regularly in the club's under-18 side, as well as appearing for the reserves. After appearing frequently for Watford's first team during the 2008 pre-season, on 12 August 2008 he made his competitive debut whilst still an academy scholar. Part of a weakened side, Jenkins played the entire game as Watford beat [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] 1&ndash;0 in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. Jenkins remained part of the side for the League Cup, with full games against [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea]] before Watford bowed out to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the quarter-final.

Jenkins made his league debut in the defeat at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 15 November 2008 under the management of [[Malky Mackay]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:UbMANduho2YJ:www.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/3853927.Jenkins___Players_devastated_after_defeat_to_Barnsley_/|title=Ross Jenkins says Watford 'shouldn't have lost' at Oakwell|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|work=Watford Observer|author=Frank Smith|accessdate=20 November 2009|date=17 November 2008}}</ref> and retained his place in the team thereafter, scoring his first league goal in the 3&ndash;2 defeat at promotion contenders [[Birmingham City]] on 6 December. In 2009 Jenkins formed a midfield partnership with [[Jack Cork]], and the team climbed to 13th place in the league by the end of the season. He made his 50th appearance for Watford on 20 October 2009 against [[Ipswich Town]].
