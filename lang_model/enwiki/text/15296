The '''Podgorica<U+2013>Shkod<U+00EB>r railway''' is a [[Rail transport|railway]] connecting [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]], used primarily for freight-purposes only. It is Albania's only international rail link. Although initially built between 1984<U+2013>1985, it fell into disuse in 1991 and later fully reopened in 2003. The railway is operated by [[Railways of Montenegro]] between [[Podgorica]] and [[Bajz<U+00EB>]], and by [[Hekurudha Shqiptare|Albanian Railways]] between Bajz<U+00EB> and [[Shkod<U+00EB>r]].

The line connects to the famous [[Belgrade<U+2013>Bar railway]] and [[Nik<U+0161>i<U+0107>-Podgorica railway]] in Podgorica, and the [[Shkod<U+00EB>r<U+2013>Vor<U+00EB> railway]] in Shkod<U+00EB>r.

== Overview ==
Podgorica<U+2013>Shkod<U+00EB>r is a {{convert|63.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[standard gauge]] railway, of which {{convert|34|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} runs through Albania and the remaining {{convert|29.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} through Montenegro. Like other railways throughout Albania, the railway is not electrified.

== History ==
Built between 1984 and 1985, the Podgorica<U+2013>Shkod<U+00EB>r freight line was the first international railway of Albania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t669.net/hekurudha_shqiptare.html |title=Hekurudha Shqiptare |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |language=Albanian |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> It began operations on 11 January 1985 with regular traffic beginning 6 August 1986. The line fell into disuse in 1991 due to trade sanctions in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The Bajz<U+00EB>-Shkod<U+00EB>r line (with the exception of [[Hani i Hotit]]) was reopened for use in February 1996. A reopening of the [[Hani i Hotit]]-[[Bajz<U+00EB>]] line was scheduled for 15 November 1996 but was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ak/hekurudha/hshopen.html |title=Opening Dates of HSH Standard Gauge Lines |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> The track was later badly damaged due to [[1997 rebellion in Albania|civil unrest in 1997]].

In April 2002, reconstruction of the line between the Montenegrin [[Border crossings of Albania|border]] at [[Hani i Hotit]] and Bajz<U+00EB> were completed. By March 2003, the line between Bajz<U+00EB> and Shkod<U+00EB>r was completed with 365 million [[Albanian lek|lek]] funded by the [[Government of Albania|Albanian government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shkoder.net/en/news.htm |title=Shkoder-Bajze railway ready to operate for transportation of commodities |author=M. Malja |date=13 February 2003 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> A ceremony held on 6 March 2003 officially marked the opening of the Bajz<U+00EB><U+2013>Shkod<U+00EB>r. As a sign of mutual cooperation, then-Albanian [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] [[Fatos Nano]] and a then-Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister travelled to [[Tuzi]] in Montenegro on a special train operating on this line.

== Future Plans ==
Long-term plans currently exist for the establishment and operation of passenger service on this railway.

There are other plans involving the construction of a new high-speed rail line between Podgorica and Shkod<U+00EB>r.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infrastruct.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/high-speed-rail-line-shkoder-podgorica/ |title=High-speed rail line Shkod<U+00EB>r <U+2013> Podgorica |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>
