'''Ely''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] '''Trelai''' ''tref'' town + ''Elai'' [[River Ely]]) is a [[suburb]] primarily dominated by [[council housing]] in [[Cardiff West|western]] [[Cardiff]], capital of [[Wales]]. 

==History==

In Roman times, Ely was the site of a [[Ely Roman Villa|Roman villa]]. There is also thought to have been a [[Roman road]] near the site linking to [[Cardiff Roman Fort]] and eastwards to [[Newport]].<ref>[http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/map_counties_roads_towns_cardiff.htm] Romans in Britain: Roman roads near Cardiff</ref>

In 1855, the first horse race took place at [[Ely Racecourse]], which took over from the Great Heath racecourse.<ref>http://www.cardiffians.co.uk/timeline.html Cardiffians.co.uk Cardiff Timeline</ref>

The [[Ordnance Survey]] map from the early 1880s shows just how isolated the ancient Ely village was from the rest of Cardiff. Reports about travelling along the main road over Ely common to Cardiff talk of pot holes and no shelter and a terrible journey on foot.

The 'Ely Industrial School' was home to [[orphan]]ed children originally from Cardiff. The school was demolished some years later and an [[infectious disease]]s isolation unit was built on the same site.

Most of Ely was still farmland feeding Cardiff's population. A [[railway station]] had only recently been constructed, and gave the surrounding area further potential for mass housing development. 

On the maps you can see the Ely Industrial school marked on the Cowbridge Rd ([[Cowbridge Road East]]). It had been set up to accommodate "[[pauper]] children" from 1863. It was very much a product of the [[Victorian Age]], and [[Workhouse]] mentality, increased social awareness and responsibility saw it closing in 1903 and converted to additional workhouse accommodation for adults (though never used for that purpose), known as Ely Lodge. The children lived in what became as Ely Homes.<ref>[http://194.168.45.30/centenary.htm#educationbefore]. Millbank Primary History.</ref>

The map also shows [[Ely Racecourse]], who's grandstand was destroyed in a fire in 1937 and was then closed in 1939.

The land was once owned by the [[Earl of Plymouth]], who dictated that [[alcohol]] may not be sold on the land. As a result, like other plots of land with similar conditions (including the [[Manselton]] area of [[Swansea]]), the boundaries of the old estate can be approximated by the locations of [[public house]]s around the area. 

To attract business from nearby areas, establishments would be built as close to it as possible without actually being in Ely (local establishments are actually in [[Caerau]] and [[Fairwater]]).

Ely's rapid expansion of housing began in the 1920s to provide 'homes fit for heroes' after [[World War I]]. This came with the construction of council houses to rehouse people from Cardiff's inner-city [[slum]]s. 

The area is widely considered to be one of Cardiff's worst areas in terms of crime and standard of living. But the residents of Ely are keen to dispel this reputation, citing the fact it is a very large, close knit community.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/cardiff_elfordroad/]. BBC Website.</ref>

The area was scarred by [[riot]]ing and petrol bombing during 1991 when shops and houses were burned down by angry mobs. See [[Ely Petrol Riots]].

==Transport==

Cowbridge Road West (the [[A48 road|A48]]) is the predominant road running through Ely as it runs on to [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] and [[Cardiff city centre]] to the east, and to [[Culverhouse Cross]] interchange to the west. The parallel Grand Avenue links Cowbridge Road West to the northern estates of Ely. Ely features several shopping parades, notably on Wilson Road as well as Grand Avenue.

Ely is served by [[Cardiff Bus]]' ''Capital City Red Route'' [[bus]] services 17 and 18 using [[articulated bus]]es which operate every 10 minutes from [[Cardiff central bus station|Central Station]] via [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] and [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]]. North Ely is also served by services 12 and 13 which terminate westbound at [[Culverhouse Cross]] and eastbound in [[Tremorfa]].

The nearest station, which is accessible via Birdies Lane or Cowbridge Road, is [[Waun-Gron Park railway station|Waun-Gron Park]] in Fairwater.

==Public Houses==
There are several [[Public House|pubs]] in the Ely area, such as The Bridge Inn, on Ely Bridge, Cowbridge Road. And there are numerous social clubs, such as Ely Social and Sports Club (near Ely bridge), the Ely Royal Air Force Association (on Riverside Terrace in Lower Ely), and Cardiff West End Social Club (near the bottom of Wilson road.)

==Electoral ward==
The [[ward (politics)|electoral ward]] of Ely falls within the parliamentary constituency of [[Cardiff West (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff West]].  It is bounded by [[Fairwater, Cardiff|Fairwater]] and [[Gabalfa]] to the northwest; [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]] to the south (although some of Lower Ely is technically in the electoral ward of Caerau, as is Trelai (Ely) Park); [[Culverhouse Cross]] to the west; and the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] to the southwest.

==Ely/Caerau confusion==
The Ely electoral ward consists of the area north of Cowbridge Road West, while the Caerau elecoral ward consists of the area south of Cowbridge Road West. However, a misconception is Caerau being a subsection of the Ely area.
