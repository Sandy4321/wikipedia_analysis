'''William Aramony''' (July 27, 1927 <U+2013> November 11, 2011) was CEO of [[United Way of America]] for more than twenty years and helped build the organization into the largest charity in the United States.<ref>Barrett, William P.: [http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1206/investment-guide-charity-americares-united-way-ymca-biggest-charities.html "America's Biggest Charities,"] Forbes Magazine, December 6, 2010.</ref> He retired in 1992 amid allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement, for which he was subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison.<ref name=NPT3 />

==Early years==
William J. Aramony was born in [[Jewett City, Connecticut]]. His parents, Russell & Nazley Farrah Aramony, immigrated to the United States from [[Lebanon]], and he was the youngest of their five children. He grew up in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], graduated from [[Clark University]] in 1949 and matriculated at the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], where in 1951 he earned a Master's degree.<ref name=NYT>Cushman, Jr., John H.:[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD91730F93BA15751C0A964958260 "Charity Leader's Success Was Also His Undoing"] New York Times, February 28, 1992</ref><ref name=UWX /> Aramony married the former Bebe Ann Nojeim, and the union produced three children, William, Susan and Robert.<ref name=OBIT />
Son Robert was at one time president of Sales Service/America Inc., a for-profit subsidiary of UWA.<ref name=TIME />

Aramony served in the [[Medical Service Corps (U.S. Army)|Medical Service Corps]] of the [[United States Army]], treating soldiers returning from the [[Korean War]] with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]]. He was assigned to a Texas military hospital from 1951 to 1953 as a lieutenant.<ref name=OBIT />

==United Way career==
Aramony began in 1954 as a staff planner for the [[South Bend, Indiana]] [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]]. Four years later, he was hired as a local executive in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], then [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=OBIT /> He was hired as CEO of the national governing body, the ''United Community Funds and Council of America'' (UCFCA)<ref name=UNIV /> in 1970.<ref name=UWX /> He began an organizational makeover and the group was renamed, [[United Way of America]] (UWA), and moved from [[New York City]] to [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in 1971. A common stated purpose and standard name (United Way of ...) was established for local affiliates.

Next, he formed a partnership with the [[National Football League]] in 1973, whereby "players and coaches made public service announcements about their involvement with United Way chapters"<ref name=funding>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/United-Way-of-America-Company-History.html United Way of America: company history] Funding Universe. Accessed 2009-02-02.</ref> which were broadcast during NFL games at no charge. "[T]hese associations brought widespread attention" to the United Way and in 1975, helped push donations above $1 billion for the first time.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=funding/>

Aramony helped develop a core strategy, which emphasizes an annual community-wide campaign in the Fall. United Way provides assistance to employers, who provide a payroll deduction option to encourage workers to contribute to United Way. Agencies that receive United Way funding agree not to solicit donations during the UW campaign.<ref name=NYT /> 

He also created the ''minority roundtable'' and helped develop numerous United Way leaders.<ref name=NPT />

However, some of Aramony's proteges also had problems distinguishing between personal and United Way assets including Ralph Dickerson Jr., at United Way of New York City; [[Oral Suer]] and Norman O. Taylor from United Way of the National Capital Area.<ref>Strom, Stephanie:[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/14/nyregion/14united.html "United Way Says Ex-Leader Took Assets"] New York Times, April 14, 2006</ref> 

During his tenure, United Way receipts rose from $787 million in 1970 to more than $3.1 billion in 1990.<ref name=NYT /><ref name=TIME>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101920309-159170,00.html Time Magazine: June 24, 2001-Resignation Charity Begins At Home by Michael Duffy]</ref>

==Scandal begins==
Aramony and his wife were separated in 1988.<ref name=OBIT /> In 1990, there were UWA office rumors about Aramony's liaisons with a teenage girlfriend on vacations in Paris, London and Cairo. An anonymous note on UWA letterhead was sent in late 1990 to UWA's chairman, [[Edward A. Brennan]], who is the chairman of [[Sears, Roebuck & Company]]. The letter alleged that the charity was being looted by its president, who was romancing a young woman.

When Aramony was questioned about the allegations, he denied any wrongdoing. His divorce became final in 1991.<ref name=OBIT /> Late that year, a source at the national office revealed that Aramony flew first class, sometimes on the [[Concorde]], used [[chauffeur]]-driven [[town car]]s and alleged that he had lavished expensive gifts on friends.<ref name=NPT /> After receiving multiple requests for information from the media, the United Way of America's board of governors hired outside investigators in December, 1991. The auditors were instructed to review the books and examine accounting procedures within the agency. According to ''The Washington Post'', their investigation "found sloppy record-keeping, inattention to detail, and accounting problems," but no direct "evidence that Aramony had enriched himself."<ref name=POST>Shepard, Charles E.: [http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N9/united-way.09w.html "United Way Head Resigns Over Spending Habits"] Washington Post, February 28, 1992</ref> In fact, all of Aramony's travel expenses were reviewed and approved by the United Way's board of directors, whose chairman was Robert E. Allen, then the CEO of AT&T [Washington Monthly, May 1992: "Board Stiffs: United Way of America's Board of Governors"by David Shenk.]. Their biggest criticism was that documentation was lacking to distinguish business expenditures from personal charges. The outrage from local United Way organizations across the country was overwhelming. Scores of offices disaffiliated themselves and/or discontinued their 1% "contribution" of dues to the national office.<ref name=NPT /><ref name=NPT2 />

During a teleconference on February 27, 1992, Aramony announced his retirement with full pension benefits as soon as a successor was chosen. Until then, he would continue to receive his $390,000 salary and $73,000 in other compensation. When Jay R. Smith, publisher of the [[Atlanta Journal and Constitution]] and an active volunteer at United Way of Atlanta asked Aramony if he felt that they were not owed an apology, Aramony said: 
<blockquote>
Well, Jay, you absolutely are. I do apologize for any problems that my lack of sensitivity to perceptions has caused this movement. I do it happily and gladly to you and everyone else. I would never do anything at all that hurt local United Ways, the mission or the people we serve.<ref name=POST />
</blockquote>

The following day, after an avalanche of calls from local chapters demanding his ouster, Senior vice president Alan S. Cooper was named acting president.<ref name=TIME />

==Indictment==
Later that year, Aramony was charged, along with CFO Thomas J. Merlo and Partnership Umbrella President Stephen J. Paulachak,<ref name=UWX>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDD1738F937A35757C0A964958260&scp=22&sq=William%20Aramony&st=cse New York Times: April 4, 1992-United Way's Ex-Leaders]</ref> in a 53-count Federal indictment charging that they had defrauded their organization of $1.2 million.<ref name=NPT />

===Other issues===
A secondary issue that was not litigated was the alleged [[sexual harassment]] committed by William Aramony. He was accused of pressuring numerous office workers to have sex with him, though no such accusations were ever formally filed.  According to the indictment, he propositioned female employees and offered the women "financial benefits if they had sex with him and transferred" or suppressed the careers of "those who rebuffed him."<ref name=NYDN>[http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-03-10/news/17966688_1_lori-villasor-william-aramony-charity-dollars New York Daily News: March 10th 1995- EX-CHARITY CHIEF WOOED HER KID SIS By Laurie C. Merrill]</ref>
Aramony was never charged with, or convicted of, sexual harassment or misconduct.

Rina Duncan, Aramony's former secretary, testified that she had had an affair with Mr. Aramony beginning shortly after she was hired in 1982 and lasting until 1985.  
During trial, the court admitted testimony from several UWA female employees who testified that they had sexual relationships with Aramony and two UWA employees who rejected Aramony<U+2019>s sexual advances in 1985.

==Villasor sisters==
When Lisa Villasor Thomas was 22, she met William Aramony on an airplane. He got her a job at UWA and their affair began in July, 1986. They traveled together to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[New York City]] and other locations for business. Everything was fine until he "met someone he liked even more: her kid sister."<ref name=NYDN/>

Lori Villasor graduated from high school in [[Macclenny, Florida]] in 1986.<ref name=PEOP>Sanz, Cynthia: [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105534,00.html "A Little Help for His Friends"] People magazine, April 17, 1995</ref> She was unsure what to do with her life, so she accepted her older sister<U+2019>s invitation to move to Alexandria, Virginia and share an apartment. Soon after meeting the 17-year old Lori, the 59-year old Aramony began pursuing her. Lisa Thomas, outraged, told Aramony that she "didn't want him contacting me or Lori at all".<ref name=NYDN /> But Aramony arranged to purchase an expensive New York City condominium and furnished it lavishly with ''Partnership Umbrella'' dollars<ref name=NYDN /> for romantic trysts.<ref name=PEOP /> Aramony siphoned hundreds of thousands of charity dollars through ''Partnership Umbrella'' to spend on fancy meals, trips and gifts, to keep Villasor as his mistress.<ref name=TIME2/> 

Lori Villasor testified that she had received from Aramony for two consecutive years $27,500 compensation as an employee of United Way for working on a real estate deal which actually required only "an hour or so" total of her time.<ref name=WARN>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D81F3FF936A25750C0A963958260 New York Times: March 15, 1995- Charity Leader Had Warning On Misconduct]</ref> Aramony also flew Villasor and her younger sister LuAnn to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] as a graduation gift for LuAnn.<ref name=TIME2/>

Rina Duncan, Aramony's assistant, stated that after Aramony began dating Villasor, "he would run up big bills for airplane flights and entertainment."<ref name=WARN /> Ms. Duncan admitted that she had altered Aramony's expense accounts for seven years by substituting the names of clients for Ms. Villasor's name and charging UWA for personal luxury items given to Ms. Villasor.<ref name=WARN />
 
At one point, Villasor threatened to leave Aramony if Duncan continued to work for him. ''Time'' magazine notes that Aramony found a position "for Duncan at Partnership Umbrella, the U.W.A. spin-off company that he would use to fund his affair with Villasor."<ref name=TIME2/>

According to court documents, Aramony was also seeing another UWA employee, Anita Terranova, between 1987 and 1991. Aramony purchased half ownership of a race horse, ''Stylish Affair,'' in Terranova<U+2019>s name<ref name=NYDN /> and was alleged to have spent $125,576.92 to purchase a Florida condominium for Terranova's use until her retirement in May 1991. He also allegedly gave $10,000 to Terranova to furnish the condominium.<ref>[http://www.nycourts.gov/comdiv/Law%20Report%20Files/October%201998/vaccov.htm New York Courts website: State of New York against WILLIAM A. ARAMONY, and THOMAS J. MERLO]</ref>

==Prosecution==
On April 3, 1995, after a three week trial, Mr. Aramony was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on 23 counts including conspiracy to defraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, transportation of fraudulently acquired property, engaging in monetary transactions in unlawful activity, filing false tax returns and aiding in the filing of false tax returns.<ref name=NPT3>[http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/old-battles-and-new-challenges-1431 "Old Battles and New Challenges"] Non-Profit Times, April 1, 2002</ref> Money laundering charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 84 months in prison, fined $300,000, and served the time at the Federal Prison Camp at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]], near [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]].<ref name=NPT>Sinclair, Matthew: [http://www.nptimes.com/Mar02/npt2.html "William Aramony is Back on the Streets"] NonProfit Times, March 1, 2002</ref> 

Upon appeal, the $300,000 fine was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit based on Aramony's inability to pay.<ref>[http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1435879.html "UNITED STATES v. ARAMONY"] Findlaw website</ref> He was released from prison on September 28, 2001<ref>[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=William&Middle=&LastName=Aramony&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=56&y=9 Federal Bureau of Prisons: Inmate Locator-William Aramony]</ref> and was on probation for three years.

==Unbowed==
Aramony consistently denied any wrongdoing. He appealed his convictions and sentences; nearly all of his appeals were denied. "Aramony's lawyer says his client's judgment was impaired because of brain atrophy" and noted "that Aramony had a cancer that led to surgical castration" while he was seeing Lori Villasor.<ref name=NYDN /> Lori Villasor ended her affair with Aramony in 1992.<ref name=TIME2>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981527,00.html Time Magazine: October 3, 1994-Charitable Seductions]</ref>

While still incarcerated in 1996, Aramony filed a $5 million lawsuit against UWA, claiming he was denied earnings and retirement benefits that were due him.<ref name=UNIV>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/United-Way-of-America-Company-History.html Funding Universe: Company Histories-United Way of America]</ref> UWA counter-sued and a United States district court issued a split decision which both parties appealed. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a portion of the lower court's decision: United Way of America owed Aramony $2.4 million in pension benefits, less UWF's $2.02 million award against Aramony. After subtracting the amount Aramony owed UWA from the New York state attorney general's judgement against him, applicable income tax withholdings and attorney's fees, Aramony received $7,871.<ref name=NPT2>[http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/non-profit-businesses/816752-1.html Non-Profit Times: July 1, 2001-United Way Finally Beats Convict Aramony by Matthew Sinclair]</ref>

==Later Life and Death==
Aramony married again in 2002 to Gail Manza. He died in late 2011 at his son's Arlington, Virginia home. The cause of Aramony's death was bone cancer, which developed following prostate cancer in the early 1990s.<ref name=OBIT>McFadden, Robert D.: [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/business/william-aramony-disgraced-leader-of-united-way-dies-at-84.html?_r=1&amp=&pagewanted=all "William Aramony, United Way Leader Who Was Jailed for Fraud, Dies at 84"] New York Times, November 13, 2011</ref>
