'''Solomon Eliot Asch '''(September 14, 1907 <U+2013> February 20, 1996) was an American [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] and pioneer in [[social psychology]]. He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology.  His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated, <U+201C>Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function<U+201D> (Asch, 1952, p.&nbsp;61).<ref>Asch, Solomon E. Social Psychology. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1952.</ref> He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions.

==Early life==
Asch was born in [[Warsaw]], Poland on September, 14 1907 to a Jewish family. He grew up in a small town, [[Lowicz|Lowicz, Poland]]. Asch and his family emigrated to the United States in 1920. They lived on the Lower East Side of New York, where many immigrants lived, including Jews, Italians, and Irish people. His friends called him Shlaym.<ref name="Legacy">Rock, Irvin. The legacy of Solomon Asch: Essays in cognition and social psychology. Lawrence Erlbaum, 1990.</ref>

==Education==
Asch was shy when he moved to the United States and did not speak English fluently. He went to the neighborhood public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading [[Charles Dickens]]. Asch later attended [[Townsend Harris High School]], a very selective high school attached to the [[City College of New York]]. After high school, he attended the [[City College of New York]], majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of [[William James]] and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.<ref name="Legacy" />

Asch went on to pursue his graduate degree at [[Columbia University]]. He initially was not very interested in social psychology, but he was interested in anthropology. With the help of [[Gardner]], [[Lois Murphy]], [[Boas]], and Bendict, he investigated how children became members of their culture through a summer fellowship. His master thesis was a statistical analysis of the test scores of 200 children under the supervision of [[Woodworth]]. Asch received his Master<U+2019>s degree in 1930.  His doctoral dissertation examined whether all learning curves have the same form; H.E. Garrett assigned the topic to him. He received his PhD in 1932. <ref name="Legacy" />

Asch was exposed to Gestalt psychology through [[Gardner Murphy]], a young faculty member at Columbia at the time. He became much more interested in Gestalt Psychology after he met and worked closely with his advisor at Columbia [[Max Wertheimer]], one of the founders of Gestalt Psychology. He later became close friends with Wertheimer. <ref name="Legacy" /> <ref>Eidelson, Ben. "About Solomon Asch." About Solomon Asch.

==Family life==
Asch met Florence Miller in a library on East Broadway on the lower East Side in New York City. He married her in 1930. Their relationship was reported as being "easy, good-humored" (Rock, pg. 5). <ref name="Legacy" /> Asch remained married to Florence his entire life. They had their first and only son, Peter, in 1937. Peter Asch was a Professor of Economics at Rutgers University and had two sons, Eric and David, with his wife Rita Zindler. Peter died of heart failure at age 52,(predeceasing both of his parents and his wife.)<ref>{{cite news||title=Obituaries: Peter Ash, Professor, 52 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/10/obituaries/peter-asch-professor-52.html|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 November 1990}}</ref>

==Career==
Asch began his teaching career at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 1947, he moved to [[Swarthmore College]], where he stayed for 19 years (1947-1966). Swarthmore was the major home of Gestalt psychology at that time in America. [[Wolfgang Kohler]], Prentice, and Wallach were faculty members at that time as well. In 1966, he left to found the Institute for Cognitive Studies at Rutgers University (1966-1972). In 1972, Asch moved to the University of Pennsylvania and stayed there as a professor of psychology until he retired 1979 and was Emeritus until 1996. Asch also had visiting posts at Harvard and MIT. <ref name="Legacy" />

===Impression formation===

Asch was interested in how humans form impressions of other human beings.  He was intrigued how we are able to easily form impressions of humans even though we have such complex structures. He specifically was interested in how impressions of other people were established and if there were any principles that regulated these impressions. Asch concluded <U+201C>to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure.<U+201D> He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression is 1) an organized process, 2) that the characteristics are perceived differently in relation to other characteristics, 3) that central qualities are discovered, causing a distinction between them and peripheral qualities, 4) and that relations of harmony and contradiction are observed. <ref name="Impressions">Asch, Solomon E. "Forming impressions of personality." The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology 41.3 (1946): 258.</ref>

Asch conducted many experiments in which he asked participants to form an impression of a hypothetical person based on several characteristics said to belong to them. <ref name="Impressions" />

'''Central characteristics on impression formation'''

In one experiment, two groups, A and B, were exposed to a list of exactly the same characteristics except one, cold vs. warm. The list of characteristics given to each group are listed below<ref name="Impressions" />:

Group A: intelligent-skillful-industrious-''warm''-determined-practical-cautious

Group B: intelligent-skillful-industrious-''cold''-determined-practical-cautious

One group of people were told that the person was ''warm'' and another group of people were told the person is "cold." Participants then were asked to write a brief description of the impression they formed after hearing these characteristics. The experimenters also produced a check list consisting of pairs of opposite traits, such as generous/ungenerous, shrewd/wise, etc. These words were related to the first list of characteristics they heard. Participants were asked to indicate which of these traits matched with the hypothetical person that had just been described to them.<ref name="Impressions" />

Asch found that very different impressions were found based on this one characteristic in the list. In general, the "A" impressions were for more positive than the "B" impressions. Based on the results of the written descriptions of the hypothetical person, the meaning of the other characteristics in the list seemed to change based on if the hypothetical person was described as a "warm" or "cold" person. <ref name="Impressions" />

Not all qualities were changed by this word. Words, such as <U+201C>honest,<U+201D> <U+201C>strong<U+201D>, <U+201C>serious,<U+201D> and <U+201C>reliable<U+201D> were not affected. The words <U+201C>warm<U+201D> and <U+201C>cold<U+201D> were also shown to be of more importance in forming participant<U+2019>s impressions than other characteristics. They were considered to be basic to understanding the person, whereas other characteristics would be considered secondary. Thus, if another characteristic in this list was changed between two subjects, such as manipulating the words "polite" and "blunt" instead of the words "warm" and "cold", it would not affect the impression of the person as much as "warm" and "cold."  Asch called "warm" and "cold" "central" characteristics and "polite" and "blunt" peripheral characteristics. <ref name="Impressions" />

'''Order effects on impression formation'''

In another experiment, Asch found that the order that he presented the traits of a hypothetical person drastically influenced the impression that participants formed. For example, participants were read one of the following lists below<ref name="Impressions" />:

A. intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious

B. envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent

The only difference between these sets of words is that the adjectives "intelligent" and "industrious" are placed in different positions in the list. Series A starts with desirable qualities and ends with undesirable qualities while the reverse is true for Series B. As a result of this slight difference, people perceive person A as someone who is an "able person who possesses certain shortcomings which, do not, however overshadow his merits." However, people perceive person B is viewed as a "'problem, whose abilities are hampered by his serious difficulties." The meaning of the other words in this list also change in the majority of subjects between list A and list B. Words such as "impulsive" and "critical" take on a positive meaning with A but a negative meaning with B. <ref name="Impressions" />

'''Similarity and difference of impression'''

In another central experiment, Asch presented participants with four groups of characteristics. Each participant was exposed to the group of words listed below. <ref name="Impressions" />

Set 1: Quick, Skillful, Helpful

Set 2: Quick, Clumsy, Helpful

Set 3: Slow, Skillful, Helpful

Set 4: Slow, Clumsy, Helpful

Notice that only one characteristic, "helpful,<U+201D>  is the same throughout all of the four sets.  Participants were asked 1) which of the other three sets most resemble Set I, and 2) which of the other sets most resembles Set 2. In 87 percent of the cases, Set 1 was seen most similar with Set 3. In only 13 percent of the cases, people reported Set 1 to be similar to Set 2. Also, Set 2 was said to resemble Set 4 in 85 percent of the cases and only 9 percent of the cases was it said to resemble Set I was the closest. <ref name="Impressions" />

However, there are more <U+201C>identical elements<U+201D> in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. Notice that two of the three words are the same in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. Therefore, the similarity in sets can not be based on the number of shared elements in the set. Participants also reported that the word <U+201C>quick<U+201D> of set 1 was most similar in meaning to <U+201C>slow<U+201D> of set 3. Similarly, <U+201C>quick<U+201D> of set 2 was perceived to be most similar in meaning to <U+201C>slow<U+201D> of set 4. <ref name="Impressions" />

Asch made the following conclusions based on this experiment:

1)	The meaning of a characteristic changes based on a change in the <U+201C>environment<U+201D> it<U+2019>s in. Therefore, the meaning of the words <U+201C>quick<U+201D> and <U+201C>slow<U+2019> change based on what other words it is presented with or associated with in real life. The meaning of the word <U+201C>quick<U+201D> in set 1 is associated more with <U+201C>one of assurance, of smoothness of movement<U+201D> while in set 2 the word is associated with <U+201C>forced quickness, in an effort to be helpful.<U+201D> In every day life, we perceive a quick, skillful person to be very different than a quick, clumsy person.  However, we perceive someone who is "quick and skillful" and "slow and skillful" as being similar and sharing the same quality of being more of an expert. <ref name="Impressions" />

2)	The change in the meaning of the characteristic is determined by its relationship with other characteristics. <U+201C>[Set] I is quick because he is skillful; [Set] 2 is clumsy because he is fast<U+201D>
<U+201C>In [Set] 3 slowness indicates care, prides in work well-done. Slowness in [Set] 4 indicates sluggishness, poor motor coordinate, some physical retardation<U+201D> We perceive our overall impression by integrating the relationships of the different qualities of a person. Therefore, we form very different impressions when one of these qualities differ.<ref name="Impressions" />

3)	<U+201C>Dynamic consequences are grasped in the interaction of qualities,<U+201D> (Asch, pg. 280). Participants considered <U+201C>quick<U+201D> and <U+201C>skillful<U+201D> and <U+201C>slow<U+201D> and <U+201C>skillful<U+201D> as characteristics that cooperate together, but they think of <U+201C>quick<U+201D> and <U+201C>clumsy<U+201D> as characteristics that cancel one another. <ref name="Impressions" />

===Prestige suggestion===
As a result of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were interested in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to believe what you want them to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? <ref name="Legacy" />

In every day life, psychologists noticed that people are persuaded by messages differently based on who is the author of the message. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them.  Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response as a result of the change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author. <ref name="Prestige">Asch S. E. ( 1948). "The doctrine of suggestion, prestige, and imitation in social psychology". Psychological Review, 55, 250-276. </ref>

Asch called into question the present theory for the underlying psychological process concerning the effect of group forces on the formation and change of opinions and attitudes. 
Asch critiques the experimental approach of many different psychologists, including Zillig, Moore, Marple, Sherif, [[Thorndike]], and Lorge, in their investigations of evaluation change. Lorge<U+2019>s and Sherif<U+2019>s investigation of the effects of "prestige" on the evaluation of statements were investigated in detail in one of Asch's articles.  <ref name="Prestige" />

The same basic procedure was used by all of the above mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment in the same direction as the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant<U+2019>s judgment. <ref name="Prestige" />

'''Lorge critique'''

Lorge<U+2019>s main finding was that <U+2018>prestige<U+2019> can alter evaluations of statements of serious political and economic questions.<ref name="Lorge" />

In his experiment, subjects rated a set of 50 quotations on a 5-point scale of <U+2018>agreement<U+2019> or <U+2018>disagreement<U+2019> with the statement. The quotes were followed by the names of two public people. Subjects were informed that one of the names was the author of the true source and were asked to select the true author. After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their <U+2018>respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals.<U+2019> This was used as a measure of prestige.  Lorge found that the participants rated the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author. More specifically, the rating of a statement tended to rise when it was referred to a more <U+2018>prestigious<U+2019> author. <ref name="Lorge">Lorge, Irving, and Carl C. Curtiss. "Prestige, suggestion, and attitudes." The Journal of Social Psychology 7.4 (1936): 386-402.</ref>

One of Lorge<U+2019>s main conclusions is that "an unchanged object of judgment undergoes a change of evaluation." Therefore, the prestige of the author is viewed as acting arbitrarily on the statement regardless of the content or merit of the statement. Participants simply view the statement as having higher value when the author has higher prestige. <ref name="Lorge" />

Asch, however, reinterprets Lorge<U+2019>s findings and suggests that there was, <U+201C>a change in the object of judgment, rather than in the judgment of the object" (Asch, 1940) He suggests that a person will redefine the object of judgment based on the content of the evaluations. Therefore, the person will base the meaning of the quote in the context of what he/she believes to be true about the person who said the quote, resulting in different meanings of the statements based on the author. <ref name="Prestige" />

In evidence of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements with the name of one author below each statement. They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them.  Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The main finding was that there was a "cognitive reorganization" of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant<U+2019>s felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement. <ref name="Principles">Asch, S E. "Studies in the principles of judgments and attitudes II Determination of judgments by group and by ego standards ." The Journal of Social Psychology 12 (1940): 433-465. </ref>

For example, the following quote was presented to both groups of subjects: <U+201C>Only the willfully blind can fail to see that the old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining ad fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, is a thing of the past.<U+201D> When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an <U+201C>expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack.<U+201D> However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be <U+201C>a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of <U+2018>enlightened<U+2019> business.<U+201D> Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin. <ref name="Principles" />

One of the major points that Asch makes is that participants are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because the context of the judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author. <ref name="Prestige" />

'''Sherif critique'''

[[Muzafer Sherif]] conducted an experiment, very similar to Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College students were asked to rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author.  Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.<ref>Sherif, Muzafer. "The psychology of social norms." (1936).</ref>

Asch suggested that Sherif<U+2019>s results could be largely influenced from the envrionment of a laboratory experiment.  Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, <U+2018>Which of these am I expected to like and dislike?<U+201D>  With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.<ref name="Prestige" />

===Conformity experiments===
Asch is most well known for his [[conformity experiments]].  His main finding was that group pressure can change opinion, of even obvious facts.  He attributed his research on group conformity to an experience he had as a child growing up in Poland. When Asch stayed up late to participate in his first Passover, he witnessed his grandmother setting out an extra glass of wine out on the table. When Asch asked who would be drinking that glass of wine, his uncle replied that it was for the prophet Elijah. Asch was <U+201C>filled with the sense of suggestion and expectation<U+201D> and believed he saw the level of wine in the glass decrease slightly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stout|first=David|title=Solomon Asch is dead at 88; a leading social psychologist|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/us/solomon-asch-is-dead-at-88-a-leading-social-psychologist.html|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 February 1996}}</ref> 

Asch wanted to examine throughout his experiments to 1) What extent do social forces alter people's opinions?  and also 2) Which aspect of the group influence is most important-the size of the majority or the unanimity?<ref name="Conformity" />

Asch's conformity experiment was conducted using 123 male participants who were told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each participant was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive "real" participant). The participants were shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched the line on the first card in length. Each line question was called a "trial". The "real" participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other "participants" gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all said the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were considered the "critical trials."  The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond the same way as the confederates or stick with the clearly obvious answer. <ref name="Conformity">Asch, Solomon E. "Opinions and social pressure." Readings about the social animal (1955): 17-26.</ref>

Asch found that a considerable percentage followed the majority. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch also found that the effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when the participant had a confederate pose as a supporting partner who also responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the participant decreased substantially. <ref name="Conformity" />

Asch told his colleagues that his idea to study conformity was brought about by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalls being seven years old and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she said that it was for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether he would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" Asch "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit." <ref name="NYtimesArticle">Stout, D. (February 29, 1996). [http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/us/solomon-asch-is-dead-at-88-a-leading-social-psychologist.html Solomon Asch is dead at 88; a leading social psychologists]. ''The New York Times''.</ref> Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to conformity, which fostered his idea to investigate conformity later in life.

===Other work===

'''Metaphors'''

Asch examined metaphors in a variety of different languages, such as Old Testament Hebrew, Homeric Greek, Chinese, Thai, Malayam, and Hausa. He found that there was a similar meaning for the sensory term, such as "cold" in English, and the corresponding personality trait. He concluded that metaphors, and thus language, reflects a person's attempt to understand the true properties of a person or object. <ref> Asch S. E. ( 1955).

'''Unitary and nonunitary associations'''

Asch showed that simple properties would enter into associations much easier when they are part of the same unit than when they are from different units. <ref> Asch S. E. ( 1962).

==Notable influences==
Asch was [[Stanley Milgram]]'s advisor at Princeton University, and Milgram completed his dissertation on national differences under conformity under Asch.<ref>Milgram, Stanley. "Nationality and conformity." Scientific American (1961).</ref> Asch also largely influenced the theory of many other social psychologists, such as [[Harold Kelley]]. <ref> Raven, Bertram H., Albert Pepitone and John Holmes. (2003) Harold Kelley (1921-2003). American Psychologist, 806-807 </ref>

==End of life==

Asch was disappointed and concerned by the direction social psychology was going in the 1980s. He wrote, "Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?....Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?" (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world. Asch died at the age of 88 on February 21, 1996 in his home in Haverford, Pa. <ref name="Legacy" />
