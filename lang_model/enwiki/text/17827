The '''Monumento al Indio Comahue''' (''Monument to the Comahue Indian'') is a monument located in [[Villa Regina]], in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[R<U+00ED>o Negro Province|R<U+00ED>o Negro]]. It was constructed to honor the native inhabitants of the [[Comahue|Comahue Region]]. The monument was completed in time for the inaugural Comahue National Fair in 1964.

Commissioned by the organizers of the fair, Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, it was designed by Miguel De Lisi and constructed in two months by local bricklayer Aldo Cardozo. Presently it is used as an overlook for its panoramic view. The monument is considered to be a symbol of the town, and as such it is depicted in the coat of arms.

==History==
The monument was erected to commemorate the native inhabitants of [[Comahue]].{{sfn|Autom<U+00F3>vil Club Argentino|2004|p=268}} It was constructed for the first Comahue National Fair,{{sfn|YPF|1998|p=96}} in 1964. This was a 45-day event that aimed to highlight the economic potential of the Comahue Region, and at the same time commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Villa Regina. Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, who organized the fair, proposed the construction to designer Miguel De Lisi, after seeing his work at the City Hotel in [[Mar del Plata]].{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=432}}

===Construction===

De Lisi sent the drawings to the local construction team, led by Aldo Humberto Cardozo and Alberto Sartor. The monument had been originally planned to be {{convert|10|m}} tall, but Cardozo re-scaled it to be nearly {{convert|11|m}}, and later also added a high base of {{convert|2|m}}.{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=432}} The completed monument, now standing at almost 13 metres (42.4&nbsp;ft), depicts a native who is holding a long spear while watching the horizon.{{sfn|YPF|1998|p=96}}

Work started in July 1964, with the structure being built of [[reinforced concrete]]. It had an iron skeleton made up of 4 inch pipes (100mm), which was reinforced with radial sections that were soldered every {{convert|50|cm}}. Later, the figure was filled from the feet to the hips with ceramic brick and concrete, with the top half finished using a layer of reinforced concrete. The monument was completed in two months with an estimated weight of 80 tons, and a height of {{convert|12.90|m}}. In its construction, five hundred bags of cement, {{convert|2500|kg}} of iron, {{convert|60|m}} of steel, and {{convert|80|m2}} of sand were used.{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=433}}

It was later painted by a local man, Carlos Basabe Cerd<U+00E1>. The job proved to be very difficult due to strong winds that blew the wooden planks off the scaffolding and into a nearby ditch. A construction team later tied on the planks, solving the problem. The painters first applied  a [[Primer (paint)|primer coat]], then linseed oil, varnish, and finally a coat of copper [[glitter]].{{sfn|YPF|1998|p=96}} The monument was inaugurated during the opening of the Comahue National Fair on September 7, 1964.{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=433}}

==The monument and Villa Regina==
The structure is located on the northern hill of the town, which has an elevation of 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet). The hill is mostly covered in bushes and can be accessed by two paths.{{sfn|Autom<U+00F3>vil Club Argentino|2004|p=268}} Currently it is used as an [[overlook]] for its panoramic view of the town.{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=432}} It also serves to mark the finishing line for the annual [[trekking]] trail competition, Desaf<U+00ED>o al Indio Comahue.{{sfn|R<U+00ED>o Negro staff|2013}}

Considered as the symbol of [[Villa Regina]], the Indio Comahue is depicted in the city's [[coat of arms]].{{sfn|Zanini, Silvia Laura|2006|p=433}} It was also depicted in the previous seal of the R<U+00ED>o Negro Province,{{sfn|R<U+00ED>o Negro staff|2004}} designed by the  government of the [[Argentine Revolution]]. The seal was replaced in 2009 by the one that the overthrown government designed in 1966, months before the [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]].{{sfn|Al D<U+00ED>a staff|2009}} The Comahue National Fair was relaunched in 2004, and is currently  celebrated every two years.{{sfn|Feria del Comahue staff|2008}}
