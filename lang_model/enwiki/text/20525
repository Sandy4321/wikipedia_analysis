The '''Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.''' is a [[non-profit]] [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|charitable organization]] headquartered at Stillman Street, [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]],<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | url = http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stillman_Wiki_Wall_Photo_Contest | title = Stillman Wiki Wall Photo Contest | archiveurl = http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stillman_Wiki_Wall_Photo_Contest&oldid=860716 | archivedate = 2008-02-01 | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | quote = As many of you probably know, the Wikimedia Foundation has relocated its main offices to San Francisco.

It operates several online collaborative projects including [[Wikipedia]], [[Wiktionary]], [[Wikiquote]], [[Wikibooks]] (including [[Wikijunior]]), [[Wikisource]], [[Wikimedia Commons]], [[Wikispecies]], [[Wikinews]], [[Wikiversity]], and [[Meta-Wiki]].

The Foundation's creation was officially announced by [[Wikipedia]] co-founder<ref name="sanger-NYTimes">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Meyers | title = Fact-Driven? Collegial?

==Foundation goals==
The Wikimedia Foundation falls under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]] as a [[public charity]]. Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing Education).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.guidestar.org/npo/ntee.jsp | title = NTEE Classification System | accessdate = 2008-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://nccs2.urban.org/ntee-cc/b.htm#b60 | title = NCCS definition for Adult Education | accessdate = 2008-01-28 }}</ref> The Foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws#ARTICLE_II_-_STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE | title = Wikimedia Foundation bylaws | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws&oldid=20641#ARTICLE_II_-_STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE | author = Jd | authorlink = foundation:User:Jd | archivedate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref>

The Wikimedia [[Foundation (charity)|Foundation's]] stated goal is to develop and maintain [[open content]], [[wiki]]-based projects and to provide the full contents of those projects to the public [[gratis|free of charge]].<ref name="wikimedia-mission">{{cite web | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Mission_statement | title = Mission statement | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Mission_statement&oldid=21859 | archivedate = 2007-09-01 | first = Florence | last = Devouard | authorlink = Florence Devouard }}</ref>

In addition to the multilingual general [[encyclopedia]] ''Wikipedia'', the Foundation manages a multi-language [[dictionary]] and [[thesaurus]] named ''[[Wiktionary]]'', an encyclopedia of [[quotation]]s named ''[[Wikiquote]]'', a repository of source texts in any language named ''[[Wikisource]]'', and a collection of [[e-book]] texts for students (such as [[textbook]]s and annotated [[public domain]] books) named ''[[Wikibooks]]''. ''[[Wikijunior]]'' is a subproject of Wikibooks that specializes in books for children.

==Foundation operations==
The continued growth of each of the Wikimedia projects is dependent mostly on [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising donations] but the Wikimedia Foundation also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as [[federal grant|grants]], sponsorship, services (''datafeed'') and brand merchandising.

==Foundation history and growth==
The name "Wikimedia" was [[neologism|coined]] by [[Sheldon Rampton]] in a post to the English Wikipedia's mailing list in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-March/001887.html | title = Wikipedia English mailing list message | date = [[2003-03-16]] | first = Sheldon | last = Rampton | authorlink = Sheldon Rampton }}</ref> The name has been criticized for its similarity to the name of [[Wikipedia]] and the software it runs on, [[MediaWiki]]; this sometimes leads to confusion among people new to the project.

With the Foundation's announcement, Wales also transferred ownership of all Wikipedia, Wiktionary and [[Nupedia]] [[domain name]]s to Wikimedia along with the copyrights for all materials related to these projects that were created by [[Bomis]] employees or Wales himself. The computer equipment used to run all the Wikimedia projects was also donated by Wales to the Foundation. The Foundation also acquired the [[domain name]]s [http://www.wikimedia.org/ wikimedia.org] and [http://www.wikimediafoundation.org/ wikimediafoundation.org].

In April 2005, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] approved (by letter) the Foundation as an educational foundation in the category "Adult, Continuing Education" means all contributions to the Wikimedia Foundation are [[Tax deduction|tax deductible]] for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

On [[December 11]], [[2006]] the Wikimedia Foundation board acknowledged that the corporation could not become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida Statute. Accordingly the bylaws were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the Board unanimously.

On [[September 25]], [[2007]] the Wikimedia Foundation board acknowledged that the operations would be moving to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in late 2007. Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and potential partners as well as cheaper and more convenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg.<ref name="MoncadaWikimoveTribune">{{cite web | url = http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/sep/25/wikimedia-foundation-moving-another-bay-area/?news-breaking | title= Wikimedia Foundation Moving To Another Bay Area | author = Carlos Moncada | work = [[The Tampa Tribune]] |date = [[2007-09-25]] | quote = }}</ref><ref name="MullinsWikimoveTribune">{{cite web | url= http://www.tbo.com/news/money/MGBNF5F517F.html | title = Online Encyclopedia To Leave St. Petersburg For San Francisco | author = Richard Mullins | work = [[The Tampa Tribune]] |date = [[2007-09-26]] | quote = }}</ref><ref name="KimWikimoveSFChronicle">{{cite web | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/10/BU69SNMQ2.DTL&tsp=1 | title = Wikipedia team plans move to San Francisco | first = Ryan | last = Kim | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = [[2007-10-10]] | quote = }}</ref>

===Board of Trustees===
In January 2004, [[Jimmy Wales]] appointed his business partners [[Tim Shell]] and Michael Davis to the Board of the Wikimedia Foundation. In June 2004, an election was held for two user representative Board members. Following one month of campaigning and two weeks of online voting, [[Angela Beesley]] and [[Florence Devouard|Florence Nibart-Devouard]] were elected to join the board. In late 2004, Wales and Beesley launched a startup company, [[Wikia]], affiliated with neither Wikimedia nor Bomis. In July 2005, Beesley and Nibart-Devouard were re-elected to the Board.

On [[July 1]], [[2006]], Beesley resigned from the board effective upon election of her successor, expressing concern about "certain events and tendencies that have arisen within the organization since the start of this year," but stating her intent to continue to participate in the Wikimedia projects, and in the formation of an Australian chapter. After her resignation, a special election was held in September, to finish Beesley's term, ending with the mid-2007 election. The election was won by Erik M<U+00F6>ller.

-->

In October 2006, Nibart-Devouard replaced Wales as chairwoman of the Foundation. On [[December 8]], [[2006]], the board expanded to seven people with the appointments of Kat Walsh and Oscar van Dillen. Effective [[December 15]], [[2006]], Jan-Bart de Vreede was appointed to replace Shell.

In the June 2007 election, M<U+00F6>ller and Walsh were reelected; van Dillen, who ran for re-election, was narrowly edged by Frieda Brioschi.

The appointed terms for Wales, Davis, and de Vreede all expire in December 2007. Nibart-Devouard's elected term expires in June 2008; the other three Board members have terms that expire in June 2009.

In December 2007, M<U+00F6>ller resigned from the Board of Trustees, and was hired as Deputy Director by the Executive Director.

In February 2008, Florence Devouard announced the addition to the board of two new members for a term which will expire at next board elections (june-july 2008): (1) American lawyer and Chair of the Commmunication Committee, Michael Snow; (2) Lithuanian computer software engineer, MySQl employee, and longtime member of the core tech team, Domas Mituzas<ref>{{cite web | url = http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2008-February/038528.html | title = <nowiki>[</nowiki>Foundation-l<nowiki>]</nowiki> <nowiki>[</nowiki>Announcement<nowiki>]</nowiki> Welcome to our two new board members | date = [[2008-02-13]] | first = Florence | last = Devouard | authorlink = Florence Devouard | accessdate = 2008-02-13 }}</ref>

===Volunteer committees and positions===
In 2004, the Foundation appointed Tim Starling as Developer Liaison to help improve the organization of the development of the [[MediaWiki]] software, Daniel Mayer as [[Chief Financial Officer]] ([[management accounting|finance]], [[budgeting]] and coordination of fund drives), and Erik M<U+00F6>ller as the Content Partnership Coordinator.

In May 2005, the Foundation announced the appointment of seven people to official positions:<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2005-05-30 | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-05-30/Foundation_official_positions | title = Wikimedia names seven to official positions | work = The Wikipedia Signpost | first = Michael | last = Snow | authorlink = User:Michael Snow | archiveurl = http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-05-30/Foundation_official_positions&oldid=17577767 | archivedate = 2005-05-30 | publisher = Wikipedia }}</ref>
* Brion Vibber as Chief Technical Officer (Vibber was also an employee of the Foundation, with other duties)
* Domas Mituzas as Hardware Officer
* Jens Frank as Developer Liaison
* M<U+00F6>ller as Chief Research Officer
* Danny Wool as Grants Coordinator
* Elisabeth Bauer as Press Officer
* Jean-Baptiste Soufron as Lead Legal Coordinator

M<U+00F6>ller resigned in August 2005 due to differences with the board, and was replaced by James Forrester. In February 2007, Forrester resigned and the Board appointed Gregory Maxwell to the position, renamed "Chief Research Coordinator".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Chief_Research_Coordinator | title = Resolution:Chief Research Coordinator | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | accessdate = 2007-03-01 | first = Kizu | last = Naoko | authorlink = foundation:User:Aphaia | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Resolution:Chief_Research_Coordinator&oldid=19693 | archivedate = 2007-03-01 }}</ref>

In January 2006, the Foundation created several committees, including the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize the activities of the Foundation, essentially handled by volunteers at that time.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2008-02-04 | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolutions | title = Resolutions | first = Florence | last = Devouard | authorlink = Florence Devouard | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Resolutions&oldid=24632 | archivedate = 2008-01-21 | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation }}</ref> Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.

===Employees===
[[Image:Wikimedia Foundation organization chart.svg|thumb|Organization chart as of January 2008<ref>[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2008-January/037383.html January 2008 Wikimedia Organization employee descriptions]</ref>]]

The functions of the Wikimedia Foundation were, for the first few years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In the Spring of 2005, the Foundation only had two employees, Danny Wool, a co-ordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager. Though the number of employees has grown, the bulk of Foundation work continues to be done by volunteers, with the Foundation having very few employees.

As of [[October 4]], [[2006]], the Wikimedia Foundation had five paid employees:<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Jimmy Wales]] | date= 2006-10-04 | title = Charlie Rose (46:22) | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5184822358876183858 | format = internet video | accessdate = 2006-12-08 | medium = TV-Series | location = Google Video | publisher = Charlie Rose }}</ref> two programmers, an administrative assistant, a co-ordinator handling fundraising and grants, and interim [[chief executive officer|executive director]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikimedia_Foundation_Announces_Interim_Executive_Director | title = Wikimedia Foundation Announces Interim Executive Director | archivedate = 2006-06-12 | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | accessdate = 2006-06-12 | author = Korg | authorlink = foundation:User:Korg | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Press_releases/Wikimedia_Foundation_Announces_Interim_Executive_Director&oldid=13996 }}</ref> Brad Patrick, previously the Foundation's [[general counsel]]. Brad Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective [[April 1]], [[2007]], replaced by [[Mike Godwin]] as general counsel and legal coordinator in July 2007.<ref>[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2007-July/031128.html Mailing list post] by the Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees announcing the appointment.</ref> Three further technical contractors were also appointed in December 2006: part-time hardware manager Kyle Anderson in Tampa, full-time MediaWiki software developer Tim Starling, and part-time networking coordinator Mark Bergsma.

In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named [[Chief Operating Officer]] and Sandy Ordonez came on board as [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Head_of_Communications Head of Communications].<ref>{{cite web | title = Current staff | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Current_staff | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | author = Danny | authorlink = foundation:User:Danny | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Current_staff&oldid=19370 | archivedate = 2007-02-01 }}</ref> Doran had begun working as a part-time bookkeeper for the Foundation in 2006 after being sent by a [[Temporary work|temporary agency]].

Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved in fundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. In April 2007, the Foundation added a new position, Chapter Coordinator, and appointed Delphine M<U+00E9>nard, then in the position of [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Volunteer_Coordinator Volunteer Coordinator], to fill it, with Cary Bass appointed to replace M<U+00E9>nard in co-ordinating of volunteer services. In May 2007, Vishal Patel was hired to assist in business development.<ref>{{cite web | title = Current staff | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Current_staff | accessdate = 2007-05-18 | first = Cary | last = Bass | authorlink = foundation:User:Cary Bass | archiveurl = http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Current_staff&oldid=21206 | archivedate = 2007-05-18 }}</ref>

==Economy==<!-- Ecomomy of Wikimedia Foundation redirects here -->
Wikimedia Foundation operates with predominantly volunteer staff and relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission of providing free knowledge to every person in the world.<ref name="financialstatements">{{cite web | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/2/28/Wikimedia_2006_fs.pdf | title = Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. - Financial Statements&nbsp;<U+2014> June 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 | accessdate = 2006-12-06 | date = [[2006-12-06]] | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation }}</ref> It is exempt from federal income tax<ref name="financialstatements" /><ref>See also Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of the Florida Statutes</ref> and from state income tax.<ref name="financialstatements" /><ref>See also Chapter 220.13 of the Florida Statutes</ref> It is not a private foundation and contributions to it qualify as charitable contribution deductions.<ref name="financialstatements" />

At the beginning of 2006, the [[net asset]]s were $270,000. During the year, the organization received a total support and revenue of $1,510,000, with concurrent expenses of $790,000. The increase in [[net asset]]s was $720,000, making it reach a total of one million dollars.<ref name="financialstatements" /> (See also [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Finance_report Finance report])

==Local chapters==
[[Image:Wikimedia chapters existing.svg|thumb|World map showing countries that have local chapters in blue.]]
The Wikimedia projects have an international scope, and their outreach has already made a significant impact throughout the world. To continue this success on an organizational level, Wikimedia is building an international network of associated organizations.

Local chapters are self-dependent organizations that share the goals of the Wikimedia Foundation and support them within a specified geographical region. They support the Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikimedia community and the Wikimedia projects in different ways&nbsp;<U+2014> by collecting donations, organizing local events and projects and spreading the word of Wikimedia, Free Content and Wiki culture. They also provide the community and potential partners with a point of contact capable of fulfilling specific local needs.

The local chapters are self-dependent associations with no legal control of or responsibility for the websites of the Wikimedia Foundation and vice versa.

===Wikimedia Deutschland===
The German Wikipedians were the first to form a chapter of Wikimedia outside the United States. ''Wikimedia Deutschland'' was formed as ''[[Eingetragener Verein]] (e. V.)'' (registered association) on [[June 13]], [[2004]]. The chapter organized several Wikipedia presentations, among others at the computer fairs [[Cebit]] in 2005, the Systems in Munich 2005 and the bookfair in Leipzig 2005.
