'''Stanley Augustus Holloway''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1&nbsp;October&nbsp;1890 <U+2013> 30&nbsp;January&nbsp;1982)  was an English stage and film actor, comedian, singer, poet and [[monologist]]. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his recordings of comic monologues and songs, which he performed throughout most of his 70-year career.

Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War.  After the war he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], [[The Co-Optimists]], and his career began to flourish. At first he was chiefly employed as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[music hall]], [[pantomime]] and [[musical theatre|musical comedy]].

In the 1940s and early 1950s, Holloway moved from the musical stage to acting in plays and films. He made well-received stage and film appearances in Shakespeare, and in a series of films for Ealing Studios. In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, in the West End and later on film, which brought him international fame.  In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the U.S. and the UK, toured in [[revue]], appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the U.S., and continued to make films into his eighties.  Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].

===Early career and First World War===
[[Image:Leslie Henson.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Leslie Henson]], Holloway's early mentor]]
Holloway's stage career began in 1910, when he travelled to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] to audition for "The White [[Coon song|Coon]]s Show", a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]] arranged and produced by Will S. Pepper, father of Harry S. Pepper, whom Holloway later starred with in ''[[The Co-Optimists]]''.<ref name="ReferenceB">Holloway and Richards, p. 49</ref> This seaside show lasted six weeks.<ref name="ReferenceC">Holloway and Richards, p. 50</ref>

In 1913, Holloway was recruited by the comedian [[Leslie Henson]] to feature as a support in Henson's more prestigious concert party called "Nicely, Thanks".<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became great friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs.{{#tag:ref|Henson's death in 1957 came when Holloway was experiencing a career high in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which had started on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1956. Holloway deeply regretted that Henson never got to see him in the role of Alfred P. Doolittle.|group= n}} In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson,<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 289</ref> whom he described as "the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had".<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic [[baritone]], and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in [[Milan]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/> However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the [[West Cliff Theatre]] caused him to return home after six months.<ref>Holloway and Richards, pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>  

In the early months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the U.S. and then went to [[Buenos Aires]] with the concert party "The Grotesques".<ref name="ReferenceC"/> At the outbreak of the First World War in August&nbsp;1914, he decided to return to the UK, but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe.<ref>Holloway and Richards, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref>  In 1915, Holloway enlisted in the [[Connaught Rangers]] infantry regiment. He was immediately commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] because of his previous training as a private in the London Rifle Brigade.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 58</ref> The war took him to France, where he fought in the trenches alongside [[Michael John O'Leary|Michael O'Leary]], who later won the [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry in the face of the enemy.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 60</ref>  Holloway and O'Leary stayed in touch after the war, becoming close friends.{{#tag:ref|When the war finished, O'Leary worked as a commissionaire at the Mayfair Hotel in London, where he was involved in numerous charitable events for wounded servicemen.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 60</ref>|group= n}}

===Inter-war years===
[[File:Stanley-Holloway-as-Ren<U+00E9>-in-a-night-out.jpg|thumb|270px|left|alt=theatrical photograph of chorus and principals for an early 20th century show|As Ren<U+00E9> (centre) in ''[[A Night Out (musical)|A Night Out]]'' (1920)]]
On being [[demobilisation|demobilised]], Holloway resumed his singing and acting career, appearing in London's [[music hall]]s and theatres, performing at the [[New London Theatre|Winter Garden]] as Captain Wentworth in [[Guy Bolton]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Kissing Time]]'' in 1919, and as Ren<U+00E9> in ''[[A Night Out (musical)|A Night Out]]'' in 1920.<ref>"A Night Out", ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', September 1920, p. 71</ref> After this, Holloway joined the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] but left, a year later, shortly before its disbandment in 1922. He decided to pursue a performing career and returned to London.

In 1921, Holloway made his film debut, appearing in a silent comedy called ''The Rotters''.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/12660 "Holloway, Stanley",] ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Oxford University Press, accessed 25 April 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> In the same year, he achieved considerable success in ''[[The Co-Optimists]]''. This was a co-operative venture by what ''[[The Times]]'' called "a group of well-known musical comedy and variety artists" presenting "an all-star '[[Concert party (entertainment)|pierrot]]' entertainment in the West-end."<ref>"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 20 June 1921, p. 9</ref> It opened at the small [[Royalty Theatre]] and soon transferred to the much larger [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] for a long run.<ref>"The Palace Itself Again <U+2013> Co-Optimists' Cheery Burlesque", ''The Times'', 23 August 1921, p. 6</ref>  It was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh, and the final edition, beginning in November&nbsp;1926, was the 13th new version.<ref>"The Co-Optimists", ''The Times'', 30 November 1926, p. 12</ref> After it closed,  [[The Co-Optimists (film)|a feature film version]] was made in 1929, with Holloway rejoining his former co-stars.<ref>"The Film World", ''The Times'', 18 December 1929, p. 12</ref>

From 1923, Holloway established himself as a [[BBC Radio]] performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist [[John Barbirolli]] or the [[Band of the Scots Guards]].<ref>"Programmes for the Week-End", ''The Times'', 16 January 1926, p. 4</ref> He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and ''The Co-Optimists''. In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for [[HMV Records|HMV]] two songs from ''The Co-Optimists'', "London Town" and "Memory Street".<ref>HMV records 1724 and 1725 (1924)</ref>

After ''The Co-Optimists'' disbanded in 1927, Holloway played in the New York and London productions of [[Vincent Youmans]]'s musical comedy ''[[Hit the Deck (musical)|Hit the Deck]]'' (1927), as Bill Smith, a performance judged by ''The Times'' to be "invested with many shrewd touches of humanity".<ref>"Hit the Deck", ''The Times'', 4 November 1912, p. 7</ref> In ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Ivor Brown]] praised him for a singing style "which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head."<ref>Brown, Ivor. "Hit the Deck", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 4 November 1927, p. 15</ref>

Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both onstage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in "Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket".{{#tag:ref|Holloway had earlier performed [[R. P. Weston]] and [[Bert Lee]]'s "And yet I don't know" at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1919.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 76</ref> He later took up their numbers, "Brahn Boots", "[[With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm]]" and "Yorkshire Puddin."|group= n}} Over the following years, he recorded more than 20&nbsp;monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself.  He created Small Sam after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref name=H83>Holloway and Richards, p. 83</ref> Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small;<ref name=H85>Holloway and Richards, p. 85</ref> the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character.<ref name=H85/> ''The Times'' commented, "For absolute delight <U+2026> there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo <U+2026> perfect, even to the curled moustache and the [[Lancashire]] accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero."<ref>"Variety Theatres", ''The Times'', 12 February 1929, p. 7</ref>

[[File:The Albert and the Lion, Blackpool - DSC07222.JPG|thumb|right|alt=exterior of large mid-20th century public house|The Albert and the Lion pub, on Blackpool Promenade, Lancashire (named after Holloway's 1932 monologue)]]
In 1929, Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy, Lieutenant Richard Manners in ''Song of the Sea'' (1929), and then performed in a [[revue]], ''Coo-ee'' (1929), with [[Billy Bennett (comedian)|Billy Bennett]], [[Dorothy Dickson]] and [[Claude Hulbert]].<ref name=Gale/> When ''The Co-Optimists'' re-formed in 1930, he again joined that company, now at the [[Savoy Theatre]], and at the same venue appeared in ''Savoy Follies'' in 1932,<ref name=Gale>Gale, p. 746</ref> where he introduced to London audiences the monologue "The Lion and Albert".<ref>"Savoy Follies <U+2013> Sparkle and Spontaneity", ''The Times'', 8 July 1932, p. 12</ref>{{#tag:ref|The monologue has become known as "Albert and the Lion", but "The Lion  and Albert" was the author, Marriott Edgar's, title for the piece.

Edgar named the lion Wallace after his half-brother [[Edgar Wallace]], a famous crime writer and playwright of the early 20th&nbsp;century.<ref>[http://monologues.co.uk/Marriott-index.htm "The Legendary Monologues of Mariott Edgar"], monologues.co.uk, accessed 23 April 2011</ref> At first, neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed, but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it.<ref name=H91>Holloway and Richards, p. 91</ref> It was well received, and Holloway introduced it into his stage act. Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, ''The Times'' wrote that Sam and Albert "became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War."<ref name=times/>  

Beginning in 1934, Holloway appeared in a series of British films, three of which featured his creation Sam Small.{{#tag:ref|''D'ye ken [[John Peel (farmer)|John Peel]]?''

In his first season in the part, he was overshadowed by his co-star, [[Henry Lytton|Sir Henry Lytton]], as the Emperor,<ref>"Stanley Holloway in Pantomime", ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 1 January 1935, p. 10</ref> but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role, playing it in successive years in [[Leeds]], London, Edinburgh and [[Manchester]].<ref name=who/>

===World War II and post-war===
When the Second World War started in 1939, Holloway was 49 and too old for active service. He decided to make his contribution in short propaganda pieces for the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path<U+00E9> News]]. He narrated documentaries aimed at lifting morale in war-torn Britain, including ''Albert's Savings'' (1940), written by Marriott Edgar and featuring the character Albert Ramsbottom,<ref name=Words>[http://www.iwmshop.org.uk/product/15588/Britains_Home_Front_Box_Set  "Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle"], Imperial War Museum, accessed 22 April 2011; and [http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/3298263/Britain-Home-Front-At-War-Words-For-Battle/Product.html?searchstring=stanley+holloway&searchtype=allproducts&searchsource=0&searchfilters=s{stanley+holloway}%2b&cpage=3&urlrefer=search "Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle"], Play.com, accessed 22 April 2011</ref> and ''Worker and Warfront No.8'' (1943) with a script written by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E.

In 1941 Holloway took a character part in [[Gabriel Pascal]]'s film of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', in which he played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944), ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'' (1945).<ref name=who>[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U165398 "Holloway, Stanley",] ''Who Was Who'', A & C Black, 1920<U+2013>2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 21 April 2011 {{subscription}}</ref>  After the war, he played Albert Godby in ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s 1948 film of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]''.

After playing at the [[Edinburgh Festival]], the production was taken to New York, where it played at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] and then on tour of the U.S. and Canada.

In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. The librettist, [[Alan Jay Lerner]], remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at [[Claridge's]]: Lerner recalled, "He put down his knife and fork, threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted."<ref>Lerner, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]], the 1958 London version at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], and the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version]] in 1964. In ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Alistair Cooke]] wrote, "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England."<ref>Cooke, Alistair. "Shavian Source of a Delicious Daydream", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 20 March 1956, p. 5</ref> Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer [[Eric Midwinter]] wrote, "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid baritone voice, and his wealth of comedy experience, he made a great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him 'bang on top of the heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane."<ref name=dnb/> His performances earned him a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 U.S. television [[Bell Telephone Hour]] production of ''[[The Mikado]]'', produced by the veteran [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performer [[Martyn Green]]. Holloway appeared with [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Helen Traubel]] of the Metropolitan Opera.<ref>Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mikmarx.htm Mikado <U+2013> Bell Telephone Hour].

Wodehouse]]'s [[Blandings Castle]] stories, playing Beach, the butler to [[Ralph Richardson]]'s Lord Emsworth.<ref name=times/> His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation, but the series was a popular success.{{#tag:ref|The critic of ''The Observer'' wrote, "rather far from my conception of Beach. <U+2026> The original Beach is rotund and pompous with an overwhelming consciousness of his own superiority."<ref>Richardson, Maurice.

Holloway continued to perform until well into his eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] and [[David Langton]] in ''[[The Pleasure of His Company]]'', by [[Samuel A. Taylor]] and [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]].<ref name=who/> He made his last appearance performing at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] at the [[London Palladium]] in 1980, aged 89.<ref>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/335080?view=cast Cast: Royal Variety Performance 1980].

Holloway died of a [[stroke]] at the Nightingale Nursing Home in [[Littlehampton]], [[West Sussex]], on 30&nbsp;January&nbsp;1982, aged 91.<ref name=dnb/> He is buried, along with his wife Violet, at St. Mary the Virgin Church in [[East Preston, West Sussex|East Preston]], West Sussex.<ref name=dnb/>

== Personal life ==
Holloway was married twice, first to Alice "Queenie" Foran. They met in June&nbsp;1913 in Clacton, while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the [[RNLI]]. Queenie was orphaned at the age of&nbsp;16, something that Holloway felt he and Queenie had in common, as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family. He married Queenie in November&nbsp;1913.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 68</ref>  

They had four children: Joan, born on Holloway's 24th birthday in 1914, Patricia (b. 1920), John (b. 1925) and Mary (b. 1928).<ref>Holloway and Richards, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> Upon the death of her mother, Queenie inherited some property in [[Southampton Row]] and relied on the rents from the property for her income.<ref name=H71>Holloway and Richards, p. 71</ref>  During the First World War, while Holloway was away fighting in France, Queenie began to have financial trouble, as the tenants failed to pay their rent. Out of desperation, she approached several loan sharks in order to survive, incurring a huge debt about which Holloway knew nothing.  She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll. On Holloway's return from the war, the debt was paid off, but in the late 1920s, he found himself in difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt.<ref>"An Actor's Affairs", ''The Times'', 4 December 1931, p. 4</ref> He and Queenie lived together until her death in 1937, at the age of&nbsp;45, from [[cirrhosis of the liver]].<ref>Holloway and Richards, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref> Little is known about the children from the first marriage, except that John worked as an engineer in an electrics company, and Mary worked for [[British Petroleum]] for many years.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 70</ref>

[[File:Stanley Julian and Violet.JPG|thumb|left|alt=group shot of young man, left, middle aged man wearing hat, centre, and woman in hat, right|Holloway with wife Violet and son Julian arriving at an American airport in 1962]]
On 2&nbsp;January&nbsp;1939, Holloway married a 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane (1913<U+2013>1997).<ref name=H170>Holloway and Richards, pp. 170<U+2013>71</ref> Violet was born into a working class family from [[Leeds]]. Her mother was Scottish, and her father was a [[Yorkshire]]man.<ref name=H170/> The marriage lasted over 40&nbsp;years until Holloway's death in 1982. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway's career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, "I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, she is also my manager, my cook, a mother to my children, my chauffeur, my lover and my best friend."<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 174</ref>  They had one son, [[Julian Holloway|Julian]], who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]'' films.  Julian had a brief relationship with [[Patricia Neal]]'s daughter [[Tessa Dahl]] (Stanley Holloway had appeared with Neal in the 1965 film ''In Harm's Way''), which produced a daughter, the model and author [[Sophie Dahl]],<ref>Banks-Smith, Nancy.

''The Telegraph'', 8 September 2003</ref>

Holloway, Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of [[Penn, Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 322</ref>  Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in [[St. John's Wood]] in North West London,<ref>[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/3433132/Hulton-Archive Holloway's Flat in St. John's Wood (1933)]. Hulton Archive, GettyImages.co.uk</ref> which he used when working in the capital,<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 172</ref> and a flat in [[Manhattan]] during the ''My Fair Lady'' Broadway years. The final years of his life were spent living in [[Angmering]], West Sussex with Violet.  Holloway had many friends in show business and forged close friendships with people such as Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, [[Maurice Chevalier]], Laurence Olivier,<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 227</ref> and [[Arthur Askey]], who said of him, "He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show."<ref>"Stanley Holloway dies, 91", ''[[The Sunday Express]]'', 31 January 1982</ref> While working in the U.S., Holloway numbered among his friends [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Burgess Meredith]] and Groucho Marx.<ref>Holloway and Richards, p. 333</ref>
