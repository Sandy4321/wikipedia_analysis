Any female capable of [[ovulation]] may become pregnant after rape by a male who has reached [[puberty]]. Many of the [[List of youngest birth mothers|youngest documented birth mothers]] in history experienced [[precocious puberty]] and were impregnated as a result of rape, including [[incest]].

=== Rape and enforced pregnancy in conflict ===

Rape, [[sexual enslavement]] and [[forced pregnancy]] have frequently been used in war and armed conflict as a form of [[psychological warfare]], to humiliate the enemy and undermine their morale. War rape is often systematic and thorough, although it can also be opportunistic. Military leaders have at times strongly encouraged rape.

Rape, sexual slavery and forced pregnancy are now recognized under the Geneva Convention as [[crimes against humanity]] and war crimes;<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/877066/Geneva-Conventions-as-discussed-in-rape-crime |title=Geneva Conventions as Discussed in Rape Crime |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> Article 27 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (1949) and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibit wartime rape and enforced prostitution.

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also recognized rape as capable of being a crime against humanity. In 2008, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820]] identified such acts as capable of being "war crimes, crimes against humanity or&nbsp;... genocide".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=Security Council Demands Immediate and Complete Halt to Acts of Sexual Violence Against Civilians in Conflict Zones, Unanimously Adopting Resolution 1820 (2008) |publisher=UN.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref> Despite these measures, rape, whether systematic or otherwise, remains widespread in conflict zones. 

During the 1992<U+2013>5 Bosnian war, there were reports of deliberately created "rape camps" intended to make captive Muslim and Croatian women pregnant. Women were reported to have been kept in confinement until late in their pregnancy. In the context of a patrilineal society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, such camps would create a new generation of Serbian children. The women's group ''Tresnjevka'' claimed that more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run camps.<ref name="Tresnjevka">{{cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |pages=9<U+2013>10 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm new Internationalist] issue 244, June 1993.

==== History ====
Although rape during war is documented throughout history, laws protecting civilians in armed conflict have tended not to recognize sexual assault on women.

The ancient Greeks considered the rape of women in war to be "socially acceptable behaviour well within the rules of warfare" and conquered women to be "legitimate booty, useful as wives, [[concubine]]s, slave labour or battle-camp [[trophy]]".<ref name=autogenerated14>{{cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages=10<U+2013>21 |year=1997}}</ref>  Women were included with property as [[spoils of war]], since in these cultures they were generally considered to be under the lawful ownership of a man, whether father, husband, or other.

In medieval Europe, women were considered as the inferior gender by law.<ref>{{cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 23<U+2013>24 |year=1997}}</ref> The Catholic Church sought to prevent rape during feudal warfare through the propagation of a Christianized version of [[chivalry]] and through the institution of [[Peace and Truce of God]], which discouraged{{Clarify|date=November 2012|post-text=(see talk)}} soldiers from attacking women and civilians in general. After World War I, the 1919 [[War Crimes Commission]] found substantial evidence of sexual violence and subsequently included rape and forced prostitution among the violations of the laws and customs of war, but efforts to prosecute failed.<ref>{{cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |page=5 |year=2005 }}</ref>

In modern times, [[Gita Sahgal]] of [[Amnesty International]] commented that, rather than being primarily about "spoils of war" or sexual gratification, rape is often used in ethnic conflicts as a way for attackers to perpetuate social control and redraw ethnic boundaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/in_depth/4078677.stm |title=In Depth &#124; How did rape become a weapon of war? |publisher=BBC News |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=4 March 2010 | first=Laura | last=Smith-Spark}}</ref>

A recent study lists the physical effects on war rape victims as traumatic injuries, [[sexually transmitted disease]] and pregnancy.

== Aftermath ==

===Treatment protocols===
Some who are raped carry the pregnancies to term, while others end them. [[Abortion]] rates for pregnancies due to rape vary significantly by culture and demographics. Peer-reviewed studies have reported from 38% of American women to 90% of Peruvian adolescents carrying the pregnancy to term.<ref name="AJOG"/><ref name="tobach"/>

High-dose estrogen pills were tried as an experimental treatment after rape in the 1960s, and in 1972 Canadian physician [[A. Albert Yuzpe]] and his colleagues began systematic studies on the use of [[ethinyl estradiol]] and [[dl-norgestrel]] to provide emergency contraception after an assault.<ref name="yuzpe">{{cite journal |pmid=7040117 |year=1982 |last1=Yuzpe |first1=AA |last2=Smith |first2=RP |last3=Rademaker |first3=AW |title=A multicenter clinical investigation employing ethinyl estradiol combined with dl-norgestrel as postcoital contraceptive agent |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=508<U+2013>13 |journal=Fertility and sterility}}</ref> This method is now called the [[Yuzpe regimen]].<ref name="Haspels">{{cite journal |pmid=7956209 |year=1994 |last1=Haspels |first1=AA |title=Emergency contraception: A review |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=101<U+2013>8 |journal=Contraception |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(94)90046-9}}</ref>

=== Children of rape ===
Both the traumatic effect of the rape and the child's blood relationship to the rapist can create significant psychological problems for both mother and child.<ref name=prewitt/><ref name=Palmer2012/>  For instance, in most US states, the rapist maintains parental rights.<ref name=prewitt/> Research by legal scholar Shauna Prewitt indicates that the resulting continued contact with the rapist is significantly damaging for women who keep the child.<ref name=prewitt>{{cite journal |last1=Prewitt |first1=Shauna R. |year=2010 |title=Giving Birth to a 'Rapist's Child': A Discussion and Analysis of the Limited Legal Protections Afforded to Women Who Become Mothers Through Rape |journal=Georgetown Law Journal |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=831<U+2013>62 |url=http://georgetownlawjournal.org/articles/giving-birth-to-a-rapists-child-a-discussion-and-analysis-of-the-limited-legal-protections-afforded-to-women-who-become-mothers-through-rape/}}</ref>  

One study estimated that 6% of children conceived in rape are given up for adoption, while another puts the number at 26%, compared with 1% of other children<ref name=Palmer2012/> According to Brian Palmer, psychologists recommend telling children the truth when they are old enough to understand it.<ref name=Palmer2012>{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Brian |title=Should a Mother Tell Her Child He Was Conceived in a Rape? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/08/rape_and_pregnancy_is_it_best_to_tell_a_child_he_was_conceived_in_a_rape_.html |work=Slate |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

== Political and societal perspectives ==

===Historical legal views===
In contrast to the modern scientific consensus that rape-induced pregnancies are no less likely than any other, according to historians such as Vanessa Heggie of the [[University of Cambridge]] and Jennifer Tucker of [[Wesleyan University]], beliefs that rape could not lead to pregnancy were widespread in both legal and medical opinion for centuries.<ref name=Heggie12>[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/people/heggie.html Vanessa Heggie], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-h-word/2012/aug/20/legitimate-rape-medieval-medical-concept 'Legitimate rape' <U+2013> a medieval medical concept], ''The H Word'', hosted by [[The Guardian]] (20 August 2012).</ref><ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/>

In the medieval British law texts ''[[Fleta]]''<ref name=Heggie12/> and ''[[Britton (law)|Britton]]'', it was asserted that pregnancy could not occur without consent and hence that it was a legitimate defense<ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/> against charges of rape. ''Britton'' states:

<blockquote>With regard to an appeal of rape, our pleasure is, that every woman, whether virgin or not, shall have a right to sue vengeance for the felony by appeal in the county court within forty days, but after that time she shall lose her suit; in which case, if the defendant confesses the fact, but says that the woman at the same time conceived by him, and can prove it, then our will is that it be adjudged no felony, because no woman can conceive if she does not consent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nichols|first=Francis Morgan|title=Britton|publisher=Macmillan and Co|page=114|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ep9BAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=britton+nichols+%22because+no+woman+can+conceive+if+she+does+not+consent%22&source=bl&ots=yJUiEeA_y8&sig=VUzsdzn33T27LlJT0uXsc3EPvjU&sa=X&ei=ONE0UMbBDYm09gS7yYDYDA&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=britton%20nichols%20%22because%20no%20woman%20can%20conceive%20if%20she%20does%20not%20consent%22&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>

Medieval literary scholar Corinne Saunders acknowledges a difficulty in determining how widely held was the belief that pregnancy implies consent, but concludes that it influenced "at least some justices", citing a 1313 case in Kent.<ref name="Saunders">Saunders, Corinne J. (2001). ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England.'' D. S. Brewer, ISBN 978-0-85991-610-3</ref>

The belief influenced medical as well as legal thinking. Saunders writes, "According to the [[Galen]]ic theory of conception, for pregnancy to occur as a result of rape was impossible."<ref name="Saunders"/> Similarly, Tucker writes that in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] viewpoint of reproduction (further expanded upon in the 12th century by [[Hildegard of Bingen]]), female pleasure played a central role in conception.<ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/> Female reproduction was, in many ways, viewed through the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence that orgasm was required for conception.<ref name=Heggie12/><ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/>

The 1814 British legal text ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' by [[Samuel Farr (physician)|Samuel Farr]] similarly claimed that conception "probably" could not occur without a woman's "enjoyment", so that an "absolute rape" was unlikely to lead to pregnancy.<ref name=Heggie12/><ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/><ref>Samuel Farr, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vTeHRzdCpJwC&lpg=PA25&ots=-ON8tpZavp&dq=%22So%20that%20if%20an%20absolute%20rape%20were%20to%20be%22&pg=PA25 Elements of Medical Jurisprudence], second edition, chapter IV (London, 1814). See also [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i1cOAAAAQAAJ&rdid=book-i1cOAAAAQAAJ&rdot=1 scanned original book].</ref> Another British legal text, ''[[Hawkins' Treatise of Pleas of the Crown|Treatise of Pleas of the Crown]]'', reported in 1795 on a similar belief, but then disparaged both its legal utility and its biological veracity:

<blockquote>Also it hath been said by some to be no rape to force a woman who conceives at the time; for it is said, that if she had not consented, she could not have conceived, but this opinion seems very questionable, not only because the previous violence is no way extenuated by such a subsequent consent, but also because, if it were necessary to shew that the woman did not conceive, the offender could not be tried till such time as it might appear whether she did or did not, and likewise because the philosophy of this notion may very well be doubted of.<ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/><ref>William Hawkins, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hLBCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA308&lpg=PA308 Treatise of Pleas of the Crown], seventh edition, p. 308 (London, 1795).</ref></blockquote>

In ''U.S. v. Dickinson, 1 Hempstead Reporter 1 (1820 Ark. Territory), at 2 n.1.'', a court case dealing with a man pleading innocent to rape charges because the victim became pregnant, the court rejected the argument:

<blockquote>The old notion that if the woman conceive, it could not be a rape, because she must have in such case have consented, is quite exploded.  Impregnation, it is well known, does not depend on the consciousness or volition of the female. If the uterine organs be in a condition favorable to impregnation, this may take place as readily as if the intercourse was voluntary."<ref name=Tucker-NYT-23-08-2012/><ref name="U.S. v.

Historian Ian Talbot has written about how countries with [[Quran]]-based [[Sharia|Islamic codes]] on rape and pregnancy use Sura [[An-Nur]], verse 2, as a legal basis: "The law of evidence in all sexual crimes required either self-confession or the testimony of four upright (''salah'') Muslim males. In the case of a man, self-confession involved a verbal confession. For women however medical examinations and pregnancy arising from rape were admissible as proof of self-guilt."<ref name="Talbot">Talbot Ian (1998). ''Pakistan: A Modern History.''

Lawyer Shauna Prewitt wrote in 2012 that in the US, 31 states allow rapists to assert custody and visitation rights over children conceived through rape. As a result, "a woman may feel forced to bargain away her legal rights to a criminal trial in exchange for the rapist dropping the bid to have access to her child."<ref name="prewitt">Prewitt, Shauna (August 22, 2012).

===Literary views===
An essay in the 2002 book ''Rape in Antiquity'' argues that classical Greek and Roman dramas treat rape merely as an "incidental occurrence or convenient plot device". Karen Pierce suggests, for example, that the rape in [[Menander]]'s ''Epitrepontes'' is given less importance than the resulting child.<ref>Karen Pierce, "The Portrayal of Rape in New Comedy.", from Susan Deacy and Karen F. Pierce, eds., ''Rape in Antiquity: Sexual Violence in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Bristol Classical Press, 2002).  Cited by Edward M. Harris, [http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/rape_harris.shtml Review article], ''Classical Views'' XL, no. 16, pp. 483<U+2013>496 (1997).</ref>

Religious scholar Betsy Bauman-Martin writes that the 1810 book ''[[The Marquise of O]]'' by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] "fits the form of romantic rape narratives in its confusion between coerced and passively accepted sex, the bewilderment over the results of the sex, in this case, the pregnancy, the ultimate pleasure the Marquise feels from the relationship with the Count, and the Count's dark, powerful heroism".<ref name="Sabbath">Sabbath, Roberta Sterman (2009).

Berkeley historian [[University of California, Berkeley|Thomas W. Laqueur]], in his 1992 book ''Making Sex'', illustrates the evolution of popular understanding by means of two retellings of a story in which a monk forces himself upon a woman in a coma, making her pregnant: a 1752 version reflects the beliefs of the time about conception in assuming that the woman must have experienced some sort of pleasure, while an 1836 version uses the incident to demonstrate that female pleasure is not required for conception.<ref>Thomas W. Laqueur, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 1992).

===Sociobiological views===
{{main|Sociobiological theories of rape}}
[[Sociobiologists]] and evolutionary psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape may be a [[mating strategy]] in humans.<ref name="mckibbin">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.12.1.86 |title=Why do men rape?

Palmer]] are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim<U+2019>s husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women of childbearing age experience less psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or women who are past menopause.<ref name="thornhill2000">{{cite journal |last1=Thornhill |first1=Randy |last2=Palmer |first2=Craig T |year=2000 |title=Why men rape |journal=Sciences |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=30<U+2013>6 |issn=0036-861X |oclc=93004665}}</ref>  Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by [[natural selection]].<ref name=Gottschall03/>

===Opposition to legal abortion===
Pregnancy from rape is an [[ethics|ethical]] and [[morality|moral]] issue in the context of [[opposition to legal abortion]]. While some people who oppose legal abortion make exceptions in cases of rape or incest, others do not. In recent decades, claims of the improbability of rape-induced pregnancy, reminiscent of historical beliefs,<ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/><ref name=Heggie12/> have again begun to play a role in political discourse surrounding abortion regulation in cases of rape.<ref name=Reuters-20-08-2012/><ref name=NJ-21-08-2012>Garance Franke-Ruta, [http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/analysis-a-canard-that-will-not-die-legitimate-rape-doesn-t-cause-pregnancy-20120820 Analysis <U+2014> A Canard That Will Not Die: 'Legitimate Rape' Doesn't Cause Pregnancy], ''[[National Journal]]'' (21 August 2012).</ref>

In a 1972 article, physician [[Fred Mecklenburg]] argued that pregnancy from rape is "extremely rare", adding that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape "will not [[ovulate]] even if she is 'scheduled' to".<ref name="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg, Fred E.

Related views have also been expressed by pro-life groups outside the United States.  The [[United Kingdom]] pro-life group [[Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]] similarly claims that rape-pregnancy is "extremely rare", in part because the "trauma of being raped makes it difficult for fertilisation or implantation to occur".<ref>[http://www.spuc.org.uk/youth/student_info_on_abortion/rape Abortion after rape], ''Society for the Protection of Unborn Children'' web site, accessed 23 August 2012.</ref>  The Irish pro-life group [[Youth Defence]] published claims on its web site that "trauma from the rape may bring into play some natural defence mechanisms that reduce the likelihood of pregnancy", but removed these statements in 2012 following the Akin controversy, explaining that the group now deemed them "unreliable".<ref>Pope, Conor.

She cited the Nazi experiments studied by Mecklenburg as well as alleged suppression of ovulation by nuns and missionaries raped in the Congo. She stated: "Pregnancy after correct medical treatment of rape is zero".<ref>Carolyn Gerstner, "[http://www.prolife.org.au/articles/abortion_anti-abortion_theology/article_18.php Why not keep legalized abortion for rape and incest?], ''Pro-Life Victoria'' web site, accessed 27 August 2012.</ref>  The [[Austria]]n group ''Jugend f<U+00FC>r das Leben'' (Youth for Life) writes that "pregnancies after rape are extremely rare" because "protective mechanisms" from the stress of rape will "almost always prevent conception".<ref>[http://www.youthforlife.net/abortion.php Youth for Life web page] (English version), accessed 28 August 2012.</ref>  The group ''Pro-Life Philippines'' claims that "pregnancies resulting from rape are so rare as to be virtually non-existent", because (they claim) "medical research indicates that an extremely high percentage of women exposed to severe emotional trauma will not ovulate".<ref>[http://2011.prolife.org.ph/?page_id=231 Abortion in woman<U+2019>s dilemma], ''Pro-life Philippines Foundation, Inc.'', accessed 30 August 2012.</ref>
