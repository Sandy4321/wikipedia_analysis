The '''McDonnell XF-85 Goblin''' was a prototype [[fighter aircraft]], conceived during [[World War II]] by [[McDonnell Aircraft]]. It was intended to be carried in the [[bomb bay]] of the giant [[Convair B-36|Convair B-36 "Peacemaker"]] bomber as a defensive "[[parasite fighter]]". During World War II, ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters provided stiff opposition for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers. The XF-85 was a response to a [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) requirement for a parasite fighter capable of being carried within the [[Northrop YB-35|Northrop XB-35]] and B-36 then underdevelopment. Two prototypes were built, which underwent testing and evaluation in 1948. Flight tests showed promise in the design, although the aircraft's inherent design flaws associated with parasite fighters were never resolved. It was swiftly canceled due to a number of factors, and are now museum exhibits.

==Design and development==
At the end of [[World War II]], ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighter jets posed a danger to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers which were making their offensive bombing runs. This emphasized the importance of long-range escort fighters, such as the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]. However, the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) was developing bombers, namely the [[Northrop YB-35|Northrop B-35]] flying wing and [[Convair B-36]], which had a much longer endurance than the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24s]] and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] the fighter escorts were protecting at the time. There were a number of options to protect the bombers. The first, developing longer-ranged fighters, was very expensive. The second option was the technically-risky [[aerial refueling]]. The last was to develop a parasite fighter, or an "internally stowed fighter".<ref name="J&L pp. 80<U+2013>81">Jenkins and Landis 2008, pp.&nbsp;80<U+2013>81.</ref>

In the 1930s, the U.S. Navy had been testing the viability of such aircraft, constructing the [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|USS ''Akron'']] and ''[[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|Mason]]'' for [[Reconnaissance|scouting]], as well as launching the [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk]].<ref name="J&L p. 81">Jenkins and Landis 2008, p.&nbsp;81.</ref> In January 1944, the [[Air Force Logistics Command|Air Technical Service Command]] (ATSC) began looking for a solution to combat the opposition from the ''Luftwaffe''. By January&nbsp;1945, it was decided that the best option was to develop a parasite fighter.<ref name="J&L p. 81"/> The USAAF, meanwhile, asked a number of aerospace companies regarding the feasibility of such aircraft; McDonnell was the only company which submitted a proposal.<ref name="J&L p. 81"/>

The Model 27 initial concept was to be carried half exposed under the B-29, B-35 or B-36. The USAAF, however, rejected this, citing increased drag, and hence reduced range for the composite bomber-fighter configuration.<ref name="J&L p. 81"/> On 19&nbsp;March&nbsp;1945, a revised proposal was submitted. The smaller aircraft had an egg-shaped fuselage, three fork-shaped vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizers with significant dihedral, as well as 37<U+00B0> swept-back wings. The miniature aircraft measured 14&nbsp;ft&nbsp;10&nbsp;in (4.55 m) long, the folding wings spanned 21&nbsp;ft (6.4 m), and had a empty weight just short of {{Convert|4,000|lb|t}}.<ref name="Winchester p. 151">Winchester 2005, p.&nbsp;151.</ref> To save weight, the parasite fighter had no landing gear. During the testing program, steel skids were installed in case of any emergency.<ref name="J&L p. 81"/><ref name="Boeing XF-85">[http://www.boeing.com/history/mdc/goblin.htm "McDonnell XF-85 Goblin Parasite Fighter."] ''Boeing''. Retrieved: 29 June 2011.</ref> Four .50-caliber machine guns made up the aircraft's armament.<ref name="J&L pp. 82<U+2013>83">Jenkins and Landis 2008, pp.&nbsp;82<U+2013>83.</ref>

In service, the parasite fighter would be launched and retrieved by a trapeze system. The aircraft would approach the mother ship from underneath, and with a retractable hook on top of the cockpit, would link up with the trapeze. The 24th B-36 onward were to be built to accept one parasite fighter, with a maximum of three per bomber envisioned.<ref name="J&L pp. 82<U+2013>83"/>

On 9 October 1945, the USAAF signed a contract for two prototypes ([[United States military aircraft serials|US serial numbers]] ''46-523/4''), although the contract was not finalized until February 1947.<ref name="J&L p. 82">Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 82.</ref> Model 27 was re-designated "XP-85", but by June&nbsp;1948, was changed to XF-85 and given the name "Goblin".<ref name="J&L pp. 82<U+2013>83"/> There were plans to acquire 30 production P-85s, but the USAAF took the cautious approach&nbsp;<U+2013> if test results from the two prototypes were positive, production orders for the Goblins would be later finalized.<ref name="J&L p. 82"/> During [[wind tunnel]] testing at [[Moffett Field]], California, the first prototype XF-85 was damaged. Consequently, the second aircraft was used for the initial flight tests.<ref name="J&L p. 85">Jenkins and Landis 2008, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

==Operational history==
As the B-36 was unavailable, all XF-85 flight tests were carried out using a converted [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|EB-29 Superfortress]] parent ship. Since the B-29, named ''Monstro'', was smaller than the B-36, the XF-85 would be flight-tested half-exposed.<ref name="J&L p. 85"/> On 23&nbsp;August&nbsp;1948, the XF-85 flew the first of several captive flights, designed to test whether the EB-29 and its parasite fighter could fly "mated".<ref name="Boeing XF-85"/>

Although in flight, the fighter was stable, easy to fly and recovered well from spins, initial estimates of a 648&nbsp;mph (1,043&nbsp;km/h) top speed proved optimistic.<ref name="J&L p. 85"/> McDonnell test pilot Edwin Schoch, who flew the only proving flights on the type, also found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze. Even after Schoch had flown dummy dockings with a [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed F-80]] without problems, the lighter Goblin proved to be more sensitive to turbulence than the F-80. On 28 August 1948, his fourth flight aboard the EB-29 mothership, and the first "free" flight, Schoch was released, attempted a hook-up, but it became obvious that turbulence around the bomber created difficult control problems. In an aborted effort, Schoch struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and his helmet and mask were knocked off. He saved the prototype by making a belly landing.<ref>Gunston 1981, pp. 127<U+2013>128.</ref> Schoch was able to make a successful hookup on 14 October 1948, <ref>Gunston 1981, p. 128.</ref>and although McDonnell considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze, before modifications could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.<ref name="Yeager"> Yeager and Janos 1986, p. 179.</ref>

The program was canceled not only because the XF-85's performance proved inferior to contemporary foreign jet fighters but also due to the high pilot demands involved should the XF-85 fail to dock, as evidenced by the test program flights. The development of practical aerial refueling was also a factor in the program cancellation.<ref name="J&L p. 85"/><ref name="Boeing XF-85"/> The Goblin flew six times with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes;<ref name="J&L p. 85"/> Schoch was the only person who ever flew it.<ref>Dorr 1997, p.&nbsp;101.</ref>

==Aircraft on display==
Two XF-85 prototypes were built, and both still survive:
*[[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''46-523'' is on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The aircraft was transferred to the museum on 23 August 1950 following the cancellation of the XF-85 program, and was one of the first experimental aircraft to be displayed at the new Air Force Museum.<ref>''United States Air Force Museum Guidebook'' 1975, p.&nbsp;76.</ref> For several decades the aircraft was displayed alongside the museum's Convair B-36.  In 2000, it was decided to move the aircraft to the museum's Experimental Aircraft Hangar. Museum staff and visitors objected to this move, believing the aircraft should be displayed alongside the B-36 to properly represent its original design intentions.<ref name="J&L p. 85"/>
*s/n ''46-524'' is on display at the [[Strategic Air and Space Museum]] in [[Ashland, Nebraska]].<ref name="J&L p. 85"/>
