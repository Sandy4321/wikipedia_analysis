The IPWP was set up by exiled West Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda, and is chaired by the British Labour Party MP [[Andrew Smith (politician)]] and Lord Harries. The group aims to develop international parliamentary support for West Papuan self-determination, through "''recognising the inalienable right of the indigenous people of West Papua to self-determination, which was violated in the 1969 <U+201C>Act of Free Choice''<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipwp.org|title=Mission statement of IPWP|date=2008-10-15|publisher=International Parliamentarians for West Papua|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>.

So far the IPWP has gathered the support of politicans from countries including the United Kingdom, The United States of America, Australia, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipwp.org|title=List of politicans who support IPWP|date=2008-10-15|publisher=International Parliamentarians for West Papua|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>.
