Prince '''Matila Costiesco Ghyka''' (born ''Matila Costiescu''), [[Royal Victorian Order|K.C.V.O.]], [[Military Cross|M.C.]] (September 13, 1881 &ndash; July 14, 1965), was a novelist, mathematician, historian, philosopher and diplomat at the [[Romania]]n [[Diplomatic rank|Plenipotentiary Minister]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during the late 1930s and until 1940. His first name is sometimes written as '''Matyla'''.

==Life==
He was born in [[Ia<U+015F>i]], the former capital of [[Moldavia]], of the [[Ghica family]] of [[boyar]]s. On his mother's side he was the great-grandson of [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], last reigning [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince of Moldavia]] before the union of the [[Danubian Principalities]].<ref>[http://www.ghyka.org/G4_Index.htm  Arbre g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>alogique de la famille Ghyka]</ref><ref>[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-ROYAL/2008-01/1201170339 GEN-ROYAL-L Archives]</ref>

He first studied at the [[Jesuit]] Maritime College of [[Jersey]] (where he passed his matriculation when only 14), then at the [[French Naval Academy]] in [[Brest, France|Brest]], at the High School of Electricity in [[Paris]], and finally at the Faculty of Law of [[Universit<U+00E9> Libre de Bruxelles]], where he took his [[doctorate]] ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]''. He joined the diplomatic service in 1910, being stationed at the Romanian Legations in [[Rome]], [[Berlin]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[Vienna]], [[Stockholm]] (as ''Minister Plenipotentiary'') and twice again in London between 1936-1938 and between 1939 and 1940.<ref name="Oyster">Matila Ghyka - The World Mine Oyster, Heinemann, 1961</ref> 

In 1918, at the [[Brompton Oratory]], he married Eileen O'Conor (b. 1897, Sankt Petersburg), daughter of the late [[Sir Nicholas Roderick O'Conor]] (d. 1908), the former British Ambassador to [[Istanbul]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], and Minna Margaret Hope-Scott. During his first diplomatic assignments in London and Paris, Prince Ghyka was introduced by  [[Paul Morand]] and Prince [[Antoine Bibesco]] to the English and French literary circles. He became a friend of [[Marcel Proust]] and a "''pi<U+00E9>ton de Paris''" with the poet [[L<U+00E9>on-Paul Fargue]]. A frequent visitor of [[Natalie Clifford Barney]]'s literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]], he also met most of the American "exiled" writers of the 1920s, but his chief interest was always the synthesis of high [[mathematics]] and [[poetry]].<ref name="Oyster"/>

After [[World War II]], Ghyka fled [[Communist Romania]], and was visiting professor of [[aesthetics]] in the [[United States]], at the [[University of Southern California]] and at the [[Mary Washington College]], [[Virginia]]. An unassuming scholar, he took a mild interest in politics. His memoirs, which were published in 1961 under the title ''The World Mine Oyster'', concluded with a confident message on the indestructibility of [[humanism]].<ref name="Oyster"/><ref>Mihai Sorin R<U+0103>dulescu - Pe urmele lui Matila C.
