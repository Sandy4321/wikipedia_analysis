[[Image:Miss Hong Kong Logo.jpg|thumb|Screenshot depicting the Logo for Miss Hong Kong Pageant.]] The '''Miss Hong Kong Pageant''' ({{zh-t|t=<U+9999><U+6E2F><U+5C0F><U+59D0><U+7AF6><U+9078>}}), or MHK (<U+6E2F><U+59D0>) for short, is a [[beauty pageant]] organized by the leading Hong Kong television station, [[Television Broadcasts]] (TVB).

All participants must have a valid Hong Kong identity card or must be born in Hong Kong (with a valid [[birth certificate]]). The pageant has been an annual event since [[1973]]. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB. 

The pageant is televised into two events. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 semi-finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20-25 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held where the 12 semi-finalists are reduced to a final 5. The second and first runner-ups and the winner are then announced. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants. 

== Wai Yin Association ==
'''Wai Yin Association''' (<U+6167><U+598D><U+96C5><U+96C6>) is the official association for all official contestants (i.e., those that made it into the semi-finals). It is a registered charity. It was established in 1982 to help the citizens of Hong Kong.

==Miss Hong Kong 2007==

[[Miss Hong Kong 2007]] pageant will be helded in the [[Hong Kong Coliseum]] on July 21, 2007. Outgoing titleholder, Miss Hong Kong 2006, [[Aimee Chan]] will crown the new winner after the show.

Notice that Vancouver has the most Miss Hong Kong winners from the overseas. They had a record of four consecutive winners from 1997-2000. 2000 was the only special year where the top 3 were all from overseas.

==Miss Hong Kong showing at the International beauty stage==
The top 3 winners of Miss Hong Kong are sent by TVB to represent Hong Kong at various international pageants.

*Miss Hong Kong (First Place) competes in '''[[Miss Universe]]''' and '''[[Miss Chinese International|Miss Chinese International Pageant]]'''. (However, as of 2001 TVB has stopped sending representatives to Miss Universe.)
*First runner-ups competes in '''[[Miss World]]'''.
*Second runner-ups competes in '''[[Miss International]]'''. 

However, this has not always been the case.  For example, Miss Hong Kong 2004 first runner-up, Queenie Chu was sent to both Miss World and Miss International.  While Miss Hong Kong 2005, [[Tracy Ip]] was sent to compete in Miss World 2005. Miss Hong Kong 1987, [[Pauline Yeung Po Ling]] and 1988 winner, [[Michelle Reis]] also competed at Miss World 1987 and 1988 represectively. Since 2005, TVB has decided to send the winners to Miss World instead of the 1st runner ups. However in 2006, winner [[Aimee Chan]] was 25 years old and was considered overage by the Miss World Organization. That's why 1st runner up, [[Janet Chow]] competed at [[Miss World 2006]].
