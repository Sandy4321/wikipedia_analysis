'''Rena Mero-Lesnar''' (born [[August 8]], [[1967]]), better known as '''Rena Mero''', is an [[United States|American]] [[model (person)|model]], [[actor|actress]], and [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. She is primarily known for her stints in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] as the buxom '''Sable''' character. As Sable, she was one of the first [[WWE Diva]]s, gaining considerable popularity and gracing the cover of ''[[Playboy]]'' several times.

== Early life ==
Born '''Rena Greek''' in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], she was active in her youth and was interested in activities such as gymnastics, horseback riding and softball. After winning her first beauty pageant at 12 years of age, she eventually became a model, working with companies such as [[L'Oreal]], [[Pepsi]] and [[Guess?]]. She married Wayne Richardson in 1987, with whom she had a daughter named Mariah in 1988. They were married until his death in October 1991. <ref name="askmen">{{cite web|title=AskMen.com - Rena Mero|url=http://www.askmen.com/women/models_300/316_rena_mero.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==World Wrestling Federation==
She met her second husband, professional wrestler and former [[boxing|boxer]] [[Marc Mero]] (who had been performing in [[World Championship Wrestling]] as "Johnny B. Badd") in 1993. After marrying Marc in 1994, she broke into the wrestling business through the World Wrestling Federation. Rena Mero made her World Wrestling Federation debut as the Sable character at [[WrestleMania XII]] in March 1996, escorting [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] to the ring . She even won two awards at the 1997 [[Slammy Awards]]: "Dressed to Kill" and "Miss Slammy." <ref name="askmen" />

Rena's first major [[angle (professional wrestling)|storylines]] as Sable involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at WrestleMania XII as "Wildman" Marc Mero. Witnessing Sable being mistreated by Helmsley backstage, the "Wildman" attacked Helmsley and took Sable as his [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. She remained Mero's manager until his injury in 1997. Between 1997 and the time he returned from injury in 1998, Sable became popular on her own. A returning Marc Mero (now known as "Marvelous" Marc Mero) became jealous, refused to let Sable get any of the spotlight and mistreated her. The duo would enter into a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Luna Vachon]] and [[Dustin Rhodes|The Artist formerly known as Goldust]], which climaxed at [[WrestleMania XIV]], when the two took on Goldust and Vachon. Sable delivered a superkick to Goldust and executed a [[powerbomb]] (known as the "Sable bomb") on Luna. <ref name="oww">{{cite web|title="Obsessed With Wrestling: Sable profile"|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/s/sable.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="mania98">{{cite web|title=Gerweck.net: WrestleMania XIV results|url=http://www.gerweck.net/mania98.htm|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref> At the following [[pay-per-view]] event, [[WWE Unforgiven#1998|Unforgiven]], Sable lost to Luna in the promotion's first [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra and Panties match|evening gown match]] after being distracted by Marc Mero. <ref name="insidepulse">{{cite web|title=Inside Pulse - Unforgiven 1998|url=http://www.insidepulse.com/article.php?contentid=36529|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Sable eventually broke away from "Marvelous" Marc Mero and Mero debuted [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] as his new manager. This resulted in a feud between Jacqueline and Sable. The two met in a [[bikini]] contest at [[WWF Fully Loaded#1998|WWF Fully Loaded]] in July 1998. Sable, only wearing impressions of her husband's hands painted on her covering her exposed [[breast]]s, won the contest easily. However, the next night on ''[[WWE RAW|RAW]]'', [[Vince McMahon]] disqualified Sable from the previous night's contest since she did not actually wear a bikini.  The match was then awarded to Jacqueline. In response, Sable gave McMahon the double [[finger (gesture)|finger]]. <ref name="crz">{{cite web|title=CRZ.net: RAW 27 July 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980727.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}.</ref> At [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], Sable and her mystery partner, federation newcomer [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], defeated Marc Mero and Jacqueline in a mixed gender [[tag team]] match. <ref name="oww" />

Sable and Jacqueline faced off for the newly reinstated [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Title]] on the September 21, 1998 edition of ''RAW''. Jacqueline claimed the title after Marc Mero interfered. <ref name="crz2">{{cite web|title=CRZ.net: RAW 21 September 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980921.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref> However, on [[November 15]], [[1998]] at ''[[WWE Survivor Series#1998|Survivor Series]]'', Sable won the title from Jacqueline. <ref name="oww" /> During this time, Rena had a guest appearance on an episode of the [[USA Network]] show ''[[Pacific Blue]]''. <ref name="askmen" /> Sable then briefly entered a storyline where she was forced to play a subservient role to Vince and [[Shane McMahon]], but the storyline did not progress very far.

Sable holds the record for most diva match wins in 1998, ahead of both Luna Vachon and Jacqueline.<ref name="crz3">{{cite web|title="CRZ.net: RAW 16 November 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/981116.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Sable defeated Luna in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope match|strap match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 ''Royal Rumble'']] after an assist from a female Sable fan. This fan turned out to be federation newcomer [[Terri Poch|Tori]]. <ref name="oww" /> Tori's debut would signify a change in Rena's Sable persona.

=== Heel turn ===
After the Royal Rumble, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of ''Playboy''. It was around this time that the Sable character turned [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] by "going Hollywood" with an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori and feuded with Tori and Luna Vachon (who turned [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]). She debuted a new [[catchphrase]]: "This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who come to see me" and a dance move called "the [[grinding (dance)|grind]]". The feud with Tori lead to a match at [[WrestleMania XV]]. During the contest, [[Nicole Bass]] debuted as Sable's [[bodyguard]] and helped Sable win. <ref name="owow">{{cite web|title=Official Women of Wrestling: Sable 1999 Updates|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Sable/99Update.htm|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[May 10]] [[1999]], [[Debra Marshall|Debra]] "won" the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown Match. Normally in an Evening Gown Match, the winner is the woman who forcibly removes her opponent's dress, which Sable did. However, [[kayfabe]] [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|WWF Commissioner]] [[Shawn Michaels]] ruled that the woman who had lost her dress was the winner, making Debra the new Women's Champion. With this, Sable became the first woman to lose a title without losing it by [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. <ref name="askmen" />

=== Post-WWF career ===
In June 1999, Rena Mero quit the WWF and filed a [[United States dollar|$]]110 million lawsuit against the company, with allegations of [[sexual harassment]] and unsafe working conditions. During the course of the lawsuit, Vince McMahon counter-sued Rena over the WWF licensing of the name Sable. <ref name="owow" /> Mero reduced her settlement figure and eventually settled out of court. Subsequently, her husband Mark was released from his WWF contract. Mero used her real name for her appearance in September 1999's issue of ''Playboy''. After her WWF exit, she made an on-camera appearance as an audience member on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', but was contractually forbidden from working for WCW, although she stated that she wanted to.

During this time Rena made appearances on ''[[Howard Stern|The Howard Stern Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. She also made appearances on television shows such as ''[[Relic Hunter]]'' and ''[[First Wave]]''. She also appeared in the film ''[[Corky Romano]]''. She released her autobiography, entitled ''Undefeated'' in August 2000.<ref name="askmen" /> She also released a [[comic book]] entitled ''The 10th Muse'' starring herself as a superhero. <ref name="cbr">{{cite web|title=WOLFMAN TAG TEAMS WITH RENA MERO ON '10TH MUSE'|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2168|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=July 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She was signed on to star in the film ''Doppleganger 224'', but the film was cancelled for monetary reasons. {{fact}}

On November 13 and 14 of 2001, she appeared as the on-air "CEO" of the newly formed [[X Wrestling Federation|XWF]]. These would be her only appearances with the company. <ref name="oww" /> In 2003 she announced that she and Marc Mero were getting [[divorce|divorced]]. <ref name="askmen" /> Despite this, she continues to publicly use Mero as her surname.

==World Wrestling Entertainment==
Rena returned to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]) on the [[April 3]] [[2003]] episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'', reprising her role as Sable. Sable spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl [[Torrie Wilson]]  which led to a showdown bikini contest between the two that Torrie won. Sable then would go on to a heated feud with [[Stephanie McMahon-Levesque|Stephanie McMahon]] which involved her in a storyline as Vince McMahon's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. At [[WWE Vengeance#2003|Vengeance 2003]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], Sable defeated Stephanie after interference from her new ally, the [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]]. At [[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam]], Sable was in the corner of the A-Train when he lost to [[The Undertaker]]. After the match, Undertaker held Sable as Stephanie delivered a slap. <ref name="oww" />

Sable's next major move was when she appeared on the cover of ''Playboy'' magazine for the third time in her career, only this time with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in ''Playboy'' together. The duo feuded with ''RAW'' divas [[Stacy Keibler]] and Miss [[Jackie Gayda|Jackie]]. The two teams squared off at [[WrestleMania XX]] in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, <ref name="oww" /> but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a [[lingerie]] match. The change was rumored to have happened after Sable suffered damage to her [[breast]].  <ref name="owow2">{{cite web|title="Official Women of Wrestling: Sable, 2004 Updates"|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Sable/04Update.htm|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Following WrestleMania XX, Sable engaged in another short feud with Wilson, facing off in a match at the [[WWE Great American Bash#2004|2004 Great American Bash]], which Sable won. However Sable was defeated by Torrie Wilson the following night on smackdown after Torrie delivered a DDT. Sable's final appearance in the WWE would be on ''SmackDown!'' when she, [[Dawn Marie Psaltis|Dawn Marie]] and Torrie Wilson would accompany [[Eddie Guerrero]] to the ring in his lowrider. On [[August 10]] [[2004]], WWE's official website announced that Rena Mero and WWE had parted ways. <ref name="owow2" />

Her marriage to another former WWE performer, [[Brock Lesnar]] was announced at a NJPW show she and Lesnar attended together. In 2004, she became engaged to Lesnar. The engagement was called off in early 2005, but they were engaged again in January 2006 and the two married in May 2006. <ref name="askmen"/> <ref name="owow3">{{cite web|title="Official Women of Wrestling: Sable, Latest updates"|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Sable/index.htm|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
Mero appeared at several [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] shows since her WWE release along with Lesnar.
