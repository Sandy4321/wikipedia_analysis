The '''American Geophysical Union''' ('''AGU''') is a nonprofit organization of [[geophysicist]]s, consisting of over 62,000 members from 144 countries. AGU's activities are focused on the organization and dissemination of scientific information in the interdisciplinary and international field of geophysics. The geophysical sciences involve four fundamental areas: atmospheric and ocean sciences; solid-Earth sciences; hydrologic sciences; and space sciences.

== History ==
The AGU was established in 1919 by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to represent the United States in the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]], and its first chairman was [[William Bowie (engineer)|William Bowie]] of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Louis A.|title=The organization and aims of the American Geophysical Union|journal=Bulletin of the National Research Council|date=January, 1924|volume=7|issue=41|pages=7&ndash;18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GHQ-AQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA10&lpg=RA1-PA10&dq=mareology+-horse&source=bl&ots=t67XseZ6sd&sig=XHOTHRXwExfv1x6gJr-OhM9SQq0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z-WPUoijOdTVoATcxoGgDQ&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=mareology%20-horse&f=false|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Cochrane>{{cite book|last=Cochrane|first=Rexmond C.|title=The National Academy of Sciences: The First Hundred Years, 1863-1963|year=1978|publisher=National Academies}}</ref>{{rp|267}} For more than 50 years it operated as an unincorporated affiliate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. In 1972 AGU was incorporated in the [[District of Columbia]] and membership was opened to scientists and students worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/about/history/|title=AGU History|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606073614/http://www.agu.org/about/history/| archivedate= 6 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=Doel>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Ronald E. |last=Doel |title=American Geophysical Union |editor-last=Rothenberg |editor-first=Marc |year=2012 |encyclopedia=History of Science in the United States |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135583187}}</ref> 

The AGU was intended to promote "pure" geophysics; [[exploration geophysics]] has its own society, the [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]].<ref name=Doel/> In a March 1919 report by a committee chaired by [[Robert S. Woodward]] of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]], geophysics was defined as a collection of "borderlands" (closely related, mutually dependent subjects): [[astronomy]], [[geodesy]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]],  mareology ([[oceanography]]), [[seismology]], [[Earth's magnetic field|terrestrial magnetism]], [[Geoelectricity|terrestrial electricity]], [[tide]]s, and [[volcanology]]. Later that year the AGU defined "geophysics" as a grouping of geodesy, geological physics, meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, electricity, tides and oceanography concerned with the "figure and physics" of the Earth.<ref name=Cochrane/>

Up to 1928, the AGU had at most 75 members. The membership grew to 4600 in 1950; 13,000 in 1980; and 26,000 in 1990.<ref name=Doel/> As of 2013, it had 62,000 members from 144 countries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brennan|first=Charlie|title=Boulder scientists draw top honors from American Geophysical Union|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science_environment/ci_23775527/boulder-scientists-draw-top-honors-from-american-geophysical|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Daily Camera|date=1 August 2013}}</ref>

== Publications ==
AGU is the publisher of 22 scientific periodicals, including the weekly ''[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]'' newspaper and eighteen [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research journals, most notably the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' and ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/|title=AGU Publications|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606045831/http://www.agu.org/pubs/| archivedate= 6 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Many of the journals have high [[impact factors]], with [[Paleoceanography]] having the highest within [[paleontology]] and [[Reviews of Geophysics]] the second highest within [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]] as of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports/|title=Journal Citation Reports|work=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=July, 2011}}</ref> AGU has also been publishing books for more than 85 years.<ref name=geopress>{{cite web|title=geopress books|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/books/|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref> It maintains a digital book library with 16 book series and over 550 book titles.<ref name=dlibrary>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/dlibrary/ |title=Digital library |accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref>

In 2012 the journals and books, including over one and a half million pages of legacy content, were transferred to the [[Wiley Online Library]].

===Fellowships===
AGU nominates members for fellowship in the society.  According to the AGU website "To be elected a Fellow of AGU is a special tribute for those who have made exceptional scientific contributions. Nominated Fellows must have attained acknowledged eminence in the Earth and space sciences. This designation is conferred upon not more than 0.1% of all AGU members in any given year. New Fellows are chosen by a Committee of Fellows."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/fellows/|title=AGU Fellows|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011}}</ref>

== Sections and focus groups ==
The AGU is divided into 11 sections that provide the main structure for managing volunteers, developing leaders and honoring scientists. These sections also reflect the breadth of science within geophysics:  [[atmospheric sciences]]; biogeosciences; [[geodesy]]; [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetism]] and [[paleomagnetism]]; [[hydrology]]; [[Oceanography|ocean sciences]]; [[planetary science]]s; [[seismology]]; [[space physics]] and aeronomy; [[tectonophysics]]; [[volcanology]], [[geochemistry]], and [[petrology]].<ref name=focus>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/about/governance/section_fg/|title=Sections and Focus Groups|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July, 2011}}</ref>

There are also 12 focus groups that organize research involving two or more sections. These are atmospheric and space electricity; [[cryosphere]] sciences; Earth and planetary surface processes; Earth and space science informatics; [[Mineral physics|mineral]] and [[Petrophysics|rock physics]]; global environmental change; [[natural hazard]]s; near surface geophysics; [[Mathematical geophysics|nonlinear geophysics]]; [[paleoceanography]] and [[paleoclimatology]]; study of the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's deep interior]]; and societal impacts and policy sciences.<ref name=focus/>

== Meetings ==

AGU holds annual meetings in San Francisco every December (known as the Fall meeting) and every Spring (April through May) in locations around the world. The latter grew out of AGU's annual Spring meeting, which had been held for many years in Baltimore, until declining interest caused AGU to move the meeting to different locations, starting with Boston in 1998. With the 2003 meeting in Nice, France, it became known as the Joint Assembly because AGU co-sponsors it with other societies such as the [[Geochemical Society]], the [[Mineralogical Society of America]], the [[Canadian Geophysical Union]], and the [[European Geosciences Union]]. The Fall Meeting had more than 20,000 attendees in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=AGU Fall Meeting, San Francisco, 3-7 December 2012|url=http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/|publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> In addition to these meetings, which cover all areas of the geophysical sciences, AGU sponsors many specialized meetings that are intended to serve the needs of particular scientific disciplines or geographical areas, including the Ocean Sciences Meetings and Western Pacific Geophysical Meetings which are held in even numbered years. Small, highly focused meetings are offered through the Chapman Conferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/|title=AGU Meetings|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110708110633/http://www.agu.org/meetings/| archivedate= 8 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Position statements ==
On occasion the AGU Council issues position statements on matters affecting public policy that are related to geophysics. These include [[Evolution|biological evolution]], [[natural hazards]], [[science education]] and funding, and [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_pol/positions/|title=AGU Position Statements|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=September 2011}}</ref> The AGU issued a position statement on climate change  in December 2003, and revised and reaffirmed the statement in 2012.  The revised statement begins:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_pol/positions/climate_change2008.shtml|title=AGU Position Statement <U+2013> Human Impacts on Climate|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=September 2011}}</ref>

 {{Quote|text=The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming. Many components of the climate system&mdash;including the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasons&mdash;are now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century.|sign=AGU Council}}
