'''Suluan Island''' is a small island in the [[Philippines]], in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Eastern Samar]]. It lies east of [[Leyte Gulf]], near [[Homonhon Island]] and [[Calicoan Island]].

It was the first ever landing place of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s Armada after their 98 days Pacific crossing although Samar was their first land sighting. Samar did not have a safe harbor. "They headed to Suluan and dropped anchor for a few hours of respite." (source: Laurence Bergreen's Over the Edge of the World). They then next dropped anchor at Homonhon Island, where they spent a week with the natives, and then to [[Limasawa]], where the 1st ever Christian mass was held [[March 31]], [[1521]].
