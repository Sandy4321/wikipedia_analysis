'''Big Truck''' (foaled 2005 in [[New York]]- March 4, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|Racehorse]]. Sired by [[Hook and Ladder (horse)|Hook and Ladder]], a grandson of [[Northern Dancer]], out of the [[Mare (horse)|mare]] Just A Ginny, a daughter of the 1994 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner, [[Go for Gin]].

Trained (until the fall of 2009) by [[Barclay Tagg]], owned by Eric Fein and ridden by [[Ramon A. Dominguez|Ramon Dominguez]], Big Truck broke his Maiden on August 23, 2007 at [[Saratoga Race Course]] winning by about 6 and half lengths over runner-up, Post Exchange.

Prior to his next start in the [[Bertram F. Bongard Stakes]] at [[Belmont Park]] on September 23, 2007, trainer Tagg noted that Big Truck may be his best two-year-old in a barn that has many promising colts for the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|Triple Crown]]. Tagg, noting other promising two year old Tale of Ekati who won the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes]], said that Big Truck might "end up being the best out of them all." Adding "This guy's as smooth as glass." {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Following Tagg's remarks, Big Truck was sent to the gate as a heavy 1/5 in the Bongard Stakes on September 23, 2007. Big Truck defeated a field of 5 after dueling with the [[Todd Pletcher]]-trained colt Spanky Fischbein in the final 1/8 of the stretch, winning by about two and a half lengths.

Big Truck next raced on October 20, 2007 in the [[Sleepy Hollow Stakes]], stretching out his distance yet again, this time to one mile. Though sent off as a heavily favored 1/4, Big Truck was upset by Giant's Moon and edged out for second by a nose by Costal Drive.

Big Truck's next race was on November 24, 2007 in the $200,000 Grade II [[Remsen Stakes]]. Being ridden this time by [[Alan Garcia (jockey)|Alan Garcia]], Big Truck was cut off by the first and third place finishers, Court Vision and Trust N Dustan respectfully in the stretch. Garcia claimed foul after the race and following a lengthy inquiry no changed were made. Big Truck finished Fourth.

==2007 season==

Tagg brought the Horse down to Florida in preparation for the major Kentucky Derby preps at [[Gulfstream Park]], [[Tampa Bay Downs]] and [[Fairgrounds]]. Big Truck was put into the 7 Furlong [[Hutchenson Stakes]], which is a lot shorter than the horse's preferred distance. Over a sloppy track, Big Truck was no factor and finished fifth.

Despite the need for graded money in order to qualify for the Kentucky Derby, Big Truck was put in the [[Sam F Davis Stakes]] at [[Tampa Bay Downs]], to regain some form and confidence. Big Truck avenged his Hutchenson loss to Smooth Air by finishing 2nd to [[Smooth Air]]'s 3rd and lost by 3/4 of a length to [[Fierce Wind]].

Big Truck stunned the racing world by upsetting 1-9 favorite [[War Pass]] in the Tampa Bay Derby. Big Truck who sat off the pace for most of the race, turned for home outside a troubled War Pass and dueled with [[Atoned]] until Big Truck won by a neck. That win put him on the Kentucky Derby Trail, and Tagg said he will most likely ship right to Churchill in preparation for the Kentucky Derby on May 3, 2008

However, due to the amount of prep races and different horses winning them, Big Truck seemingly needs a little more in graded earnings to be a starter in Lousiville. Big Truck has been entered into the Grade 1 [[Toyota BlueGrass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland Race Course]]

In the Grade 1 [[Toyota BlueGrass Stakes]] Big Truck competed early and flattened out in the stretch in his first career start on the Polytrack. Tagg was shocked by the results and didn't know the reason for his performance although all of the main contenders including [[Pyro (horse)|Pyro]] and [[Cool Coal Man]] didn't produce. Many were quoted by saying that the Bluegrass was a throw out for Big Truck. With his 11th place finish Big Truck didn't earn any graded money and with $194,500 is on the bubble to make the starting gate on the first Saturday in May.

With the defections of War Pass and Salute the Sarge from the Kentucky Derby trail, Big Truck finished the graded stakes race in 18th place, good enough to earn a start in [[Kentucky Derby 134]] on [[May 3, 2008]]. Big Truck will be ridden by Javier Castellano who rode him in the Hutchenson Stakes because Eibar Coa picked up the mount on Tagg's other Derby entrant Tale of Ekati due to Edgar Prado committing Adriano for the Derby.

In the [[Kentucky Derby]], Big Truck broke well from the 7 post but steadied after about 6 furlongs because of hard contact with Remsen foe Court Vision. Big Truck finished 18th in the Run for the Roses and will take some time off, most likely skipping the other two triple crown races, to come back on the turf against New York breds at Belmont and Saratoga.

Big Truck was rested until the August 20, 2008 running of the [[Albany Stakes (United States)|Albany Stakes]] at Saratoga where Big Truck was in contention and fell out to finish third behind OTB Big Apple Triple Winner [[Tin Cup Chalice]] and Thatsrightofficer.

==2009 season==

Unraced in all 2009, he was transferred from the training barn of Barclay Tagg to trainer Derek Ryan in the fall of that year.

==2010 season==

Under Ryan he had started in a $20,500 allowance race at Tampa Bay January 29, 2010 where he finished last.<ref>http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/55764/big-truck-injured-euthanized-at-tampa</ref> Unfortunately during training he was injured and euthanized on Thursday March 4, 2010 at Tampa Bay Downs.<ref>http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/55764/big-truck-injured-euthanized-at-tampa</ref>
