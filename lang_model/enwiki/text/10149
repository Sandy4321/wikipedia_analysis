The '''Huia''' ({{IPA-all|hui<U+0251>}}; ''Heteralocha acutirostris'') was the largest species of [[Callaeidae|New Zealand wattlebird]] and was [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. Its [[extinction]] in the early 20th&nbsp;century had two primary causes. The first was rampant [[Overexploitation|overhunting]] to procure Huia skins for [[Taxidermy|mounted specimens]], which were in worldwide demand by museums and wealthy private collectors. Huia were also hunted to obtain their long, striking tail feathers for locally fashionable hat decorations. The second major cause of extinction was the widespread [[Habitat destruction|deforestation]] of the lowlands of the North Island by European settlers to create pasture for agriculture. Most of these forests were ancient, ecologically complex [[primary forest]]s, and Huia were not able to survive in regenerating [[secondary forest]]s. The last confirmed sighting of a Huia was on 28 December 1907 in the [[Tararua Ranges]]. Further credible sightings near [[Wellington]] were reported until 1922, and the last reported sightings were in [[Te Urewera National Park]] in the early 1960s.

The Huia was remarkable for having the most pronounced [[sexual dimorphism]] in bill shape of any species of bird in the world. The female's beak was long, thin and arched downward, while the male's was short and stout, like that of a [[crow]]. The sexes were otherwise similar, with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a green sheen. The birds lived in forests at both [[montane]] and lowland altitudes <U+2013> they are thought to have moved seasonally, living at higher altitude in summer and descending to lower altitudes in winter. Huia were [[omnivorous]] and ate insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood, while the female's longer, more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the Huia is frequently mentioned in biology and [[ornithology]] textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction. The Huia is one of New Zealand's best-known extinct birds because of this bill shape and its sheer beauty and special place in [[M<U+0101>ori culture]] and [[M<U+0101>ori mythology|oral tradition]]. The bird was regarded by [[M<U+0101>ori]] as ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' (sacred), and the wearing of its skin or feathers was reserved for people of high status.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The genus name, ''Heteralocha'', derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''<U+1F15><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>'' "different" and ''<U+1F04><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C2>'' "wife".<ref name=CabMusHeinThI/> It refers to the striking difference in bill shape between male and female. The [[specific name]], ''acutirostris'', derives from [[Latin]] ''acutus'', meaning "sharp pointed", and ''rostrum'', meaning "beak", and refers to the beak of the female.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/><!--cites both sentences-->

[[John Gould]] described the Huia in 1836 as two species: ''Neomorpha acutirostris'' based on a female specimen, and ''N. crassirostris'' based on a male specimen<U+2014>the epithet ''crassirostris'' derives from the Latin ''crassus'', meaning "thick" or "heavy", and refers to the male's short bill.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> In 1840, [[George Robert Gray]] proposed the name ''N. gouldii'', arguing that neither of Gould's names was applicable to the species.<ref name="Gray1840">[[#GRG|Gray 1840]]:15</ref> In 1850, [[Jean Cabanis]] replaced the name ''Neomorpha'', which had been previously used for a [[cuckoo]] genus, with ''Heteralocha''.<ref name="CabMusHeinThI">[[#JC|Cabanis 1850<U+2013>1851]]:218, footnote</ref> In 1888 Sir Walter Buller wrote: "I have deemed it more in accordance with the accepted rules of zoological nomenclature to adopt the first of the two names applied to the species by Mr. Gould; and the name ''Neomorpha'' having been previously used in ornithology, it becomes necessary to adopt that of ''Heteralocha'', proposed by Dr. Cabanis for this form."<ref name="BullerPpage8">[[#WLB|Buller 1888]]:8</ref> 

The Huia appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of [[passerines]] in New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family [[Callaeidae]], the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the [[Saddleback (bird)|Saddleback]] and the [[K<U+014D>kako]]. The only close relative to the family is the [[Stitchbird]]; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined.<ref name="Ewen2006">{{cite journal |last1=Ewen |first1=John G |last2=Flux |first2=Ian |last3=Ericson |first3=Per GP |year=2006 |title=Systematic affinities of two enigmatic New Zealand passerines of high conservation priority, the hihi or stitchbird ''Notiomystis cincta'' and the kokako ''Callaeas cinerea'' |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=40 |pmid=16527495 |issue=1 |pages=281<U+2013>84 |url=http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e1d3ca810c24ddc7038000945/Ewen+et+al+Stitchbird+MPEV+2006.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.01.026}}</ref> A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging Kokako or Huia.<ref name="shepherd07">{{cite journal|last=Shepherd, Lara D.; Lambert, David M.|year=2007|first1=LD|last2=Lambert|first2=DM|title=The relationships and origins of the New Zealand wattlebirds (Passeriformes, Callaeatidae) from DNA sequence analyses|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=17369056|volume=43|issue=2|pages=480<U+2013>92|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.12.008}}</ref>

[[File:Heteralochaskull.png|thumb|alt=Skull of a bird drawn in outline, side view, back view and view from underneath|The skull had hollows, ''digastric fossae'', accommodating the strong muscles that open the bill]]
Although sexual dimorphism in bill shape is found in other birds, such as the [[Ptiloris|riflebirds]], [[Epimachus|sicklebills]] and other wood-excavating birds including some species of [[woodpecker]],<ref name="KJWA-76">[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:76</ref> it was most pronounced in the Huia.<ref name="Firth">{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=CB |year=1997 |title=Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris: Callaeidae'')-like sexual bill dimorphism in some birds of paradise (Paradisaeidae) and its significance |journal=Notornis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=177<U+2013>84 |url=http://www.notornis.org.nz/free_issues/Notornis_44-1997/Notornis_44_3_177.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2009 | format=PDF}}</ref> The beak of the male was short at approximately 60&nbsp;mm (2.3&nbsp;in) and slightly arched downwards<ref name="MBL"/> and robust, very similar to that of the closely related Saddleback, while the female's beak was finer, longer at around 104&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;in), and decurved (curved downward) like that of a [[hummingbird]] or [[honeyeater]]. The difference was not only in the bone; the [[rhamphotheca]] grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood-boring beetle larvae. The skulls and mandibles of the Huia and Saddleback are very similar, the latter essentially miniatures of the former.<ref name="worholC-481">[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:481</ref> 

There are two possible explanations for the evolution of this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources.<ref name="KJWA-76"/> This divergence may have arisen because of a lack of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the Huia.<ref name="KJWA-76"/> It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.<ref name="KJWA-76"/> 

Another, less obvious aspect of the Huia's sexual dimorphism was the minor size difference between the sexes. Males were 45&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) long, while females were larger at 48&nbsp;cm (19&nbsp;in).<ref name="FGBNZ"/> Additionally, the tail of the male was about 20&nbsp;cm (7.8&nbsp;in) in length and the wingspan was between 21 and 22&nbsp;cm (8.2<U+2013>8.6&nbsp;in), while the female's tail was 19.5 to 20&nbsp;cm (7.6<U+2013>7.8&nbsp;in) and the female's wingspan was 20 to 20.5&nbsp;cm (7.8<U+2013>8&nbsp;in).<ref name="WWFE"/> 

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Subfossil]] deposits and [[midden]] remains suggest that the Huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the [[North Island]],<ref name="FGBNZ"/> extending from the northernmost tip at [[Cape Reinga]]<ref name="Tennyson, Martinson">[[#ATPM|Tennyson and Martinson 2006]]</ref> to [[Wellington]] and the [[Aorangi Range]] in the far south. Only a few Huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the [[karst]] of the [[Waitomo Caves|Waitomo caves area]] and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and [[Hawke's Bay]]; it seems to have preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present.<ref name="Tennyson, Martinson"/> Its range appears to have contracted following M<U+0101>ori settlement in the middle 12th century. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s, the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island, south of a line from the [[Raukumara Range]] in the east, across the [[Kaimanawa Range]], to the [[Turakina River]] in the [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]] in the west.<ref name="FGBNZ"/> In the south, its range extended to the [[Wairarapa]] and the [[Rimutaka Range]] east of Wellington.<ref name="FGBNZ"/> Reports collected by [[Walter Buller]] and a single ''waiata'' (M<U+0101>ori song) suggest that the Huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the [[South Island]]; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait,<ref name="worholA-437">[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:437</ref> and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014">[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1014</ref><ref name="NZ Geo"/> 

The Huia inhabited both of the two principal forest types in New Zealand. They were primarily found in [[Temperate_rainforest#New_Zealand_temperate_rain_forests|broadleaf-podocarp]] forests where there was a dense understorey, but occasionally also in Southern Beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') forest. The species was observed in native vegetation including Mata<U+012B> (''[[Prumnopitys taxifolia]]''), Rimu (''[[Dacrydium cupressinum]]''), Kahikatea (''[[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]]''), Northern R<U+0101>t<U+0101> (''[[Metrosideros robusta]]''), Maire (''[[Nestegis]]''), Hinau  (''[[Elaeocarpus dentatus]]''), Totara (''[[Podocarpus totara]]''), Rewarewa (''[[Knightia excelsa]]''), Mahoe (''[[Melicytus ramiflorus]]''), and Taraire (''[[Beilschmiedia tarairi]]''), and at sea level in Karaka (''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'') trees at [[Turakirae Head|Cape Turakirae]]. It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> 

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[Image:Lappenhopf fg01.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Stuffed bird in side view, mounted on a stump|Mounted female Huia taxidermy specimen illustrating its well-developed long legs and its long downward curved beak]]
===Movements===
The Huia's movements are little known, but it was most likely sedentary.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> The Huia is thought to have undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the Saddleback and the K<U+014D>kako, the Huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] or across the forest floor,<ref name="FGBNZ"/> or cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.<ref name="WS"/> 

===Feeding and ecology===
The Huia, with the previously endangered Saddleback, were the two species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore [[Guild (ecology)|guild]] in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of [[Wallace Line|Wallace's line]]; their [[ecological niche]] is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and ''Nothofagus'' forests; one was the Huia and the other was the [[New Zealand Kaka|Kaka]].<ref name="worholB-483">[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:483</ref> 
[[File:Huhu grubs.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two large insect larvae in tunnels in a tree branch|A favourite food of the Huia: the larvae of the Huhu beetle ''[[Prionoplus reticularis]]'']]
The Huia foraged mainly on decaying wood.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> Although it was considered a specialist predator of the [[larva]]e of the [[nocturnal]] Huhu beetle (''[[Prionoplus reticularis]]''), it also ate other insects including [[Weta]], insect larvae, spiders and fruit.<ref name="FGBNZ"/><ref name="HANZAB7A-1015">[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1015</ref> 

Insects and spiders were taken from decaying wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016">[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1016</ref> The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its [[adze]]-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood,<ref name="worholB-483"/> while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by "gaping" motions.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature of the head and neck between males and females.<ref name="worholA-437"/> Huia had very well developed [[depressor jaw muscles]], and an [[internal occipital crest|occipital crest]] that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Burton, Philip J.K.|title=Anatomy of head and neck in the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris'') with comparative notes on other Callaeidae|journal=Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), Zoology|volume=27|issue=1|year=1974|pages= 3<U+2013>48|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/bulletinofbritis27zoollond#page/3/mode/1up/}}</ref> Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The Huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.<ref name="WWFE"/> 

<!-- Contrary to popular opinion, meals were not often shared by a pair (although such behaviour may have occasionally served to strengthen the pair bond). --> 
A pair did not cooperate in feeding, at least not in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist [[Walter Buller]]<ref name="Buller">[[#WLB|Buller 1888]]</ref> of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae.<ref name="Jamieson and Spencer">{{cite journal |last1=Jamieson |first1=Ian G |last2=Spencer |first2=Hamish G |year=1996 |title=The bill and foraging behaviour of the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris''): were they unique? |journal=Notornis |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=14<U+2013>18 |url=http://www.notornis.org.nz/free_issues/Notornis_43-1996/Notornis_43_1_14.pdf |format=PDF fulltext |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill.<ref name="worholA-437"/> Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of [[niche differentiation]], reducing [[intraspecific competition]] between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.<ref name="worholD-482">[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:482</ref><ref name="Moorhouse">{{cite journal |last=Moorhouse |first=Ron J |year=1996 |title=The extraordinary bill dimorphism of the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris''): sexual selection or intersexual competition? |journal=Notornis |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=19<U+2013>34 |url=http://www.notornis.org.nz/free_issues/Notornis_43-1996/Notornis_43_1_19.pdf |format=PDF fulltext |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

===Voice===
Like so many other aspects of its biology, the vocalisations of the Huia are not well known,<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> and present knowledge is based on very few accounts. The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles, "peculiar and strange", but also "soft, melodious and flute-like".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> An imitation of the bird's call survives as a recording of 1909 Huia Search Team member Henare Haumana whistling the call (see ''External links'').<ref name="HoldawayTeAra">{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/extinctions/6/3/2 |title=Extinctions |last=Holdaway|first=Richard|year=2009 |work=Te Ara <U+2013> the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=9 September 2010}}</ref> Huia were often silent. When they did vocalise, their calls could carry considerable distances <U+2013> some were audible from up to 400&nbsp;m (1300&nbsp;ft) away through dense forest.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> The calls were said to differ between sexes, though there are no details. Calls were given with the bird's head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> Most references describe Huia calls as heard in the early morning; one records it as the first bird to sing in the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]], and captive birds were known to "wake the household".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> Like the [[Whitehead (bird)|Whitehead]], Huia behaved unusually before the onset of wet weather, being "happy and in full song".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> The bird's name is [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]:<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> it was named by M<U+0101>ori for its loud distress call, a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as ''uia, uia, uia'' or ''where are you?''. This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> Chicks had a "plaintive cry, pleasant to the ear", would feebly answer imitations by people, and were very noisy when kept in tents.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/>

A quiet, social bird, the Huia was [[monogamous]], and pairs probably paired for life.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> The bird was usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes groups of four or more were encountered.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> [[Walter Buller]] records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other, constantly uttering a "low affectionate twitter", even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> and a further, wild pair<ref name="WS"/> "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" and uttering these noises. The male is said to have fed the female in courtship.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest "lacks evidence".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female "manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards".<ref name="Buller"/> A M<U+0101>ori man in the 19th century recalled: "I was always told by my old people that a pair of Huia lived on most affectionate terms&nbsp;... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief".<ref name="MBL"/> The Huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest,<ref name="MBL"/> and birds could easily be captured by hand.<ref name="FLM"/> 

Little is known about the Huia's reproduction, as only two eggs and four nests were ever described.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> The breeding season for mating, building nests, laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring (October<U+2013>November).<ref name="WWFE">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Huia |encyclopedia=The Official World Wildlife Fund Guide to Extinct Species of Modern Times |volume=1 |pages=63<U+2013>65| publisher=Beacham Publishing|location=Osprey, Florida |year=1997|isbn=0933833407}}</ref><ref name="NZ Geo"/><ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/><ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> It is thought they nested solitarily; pairs are said to have been [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and the birds would remain on their territories for life.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season;<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3<U+2013>5,4,2<U+2013>4 and 1<U+2013>4.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles, and measured 45 by 30&nbsp;mm (1.8 by 1.5&nbsp;in). [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] was mostly by the female, though there is evidence that the male also had a small role, as rubbed-bare [[brooding patch]]es that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> The incubation period is unknown.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> Eggshells were apparently removed from the nest by adults. The brood size was usually one or two, though there was the odd record of up to three chicks in a single nest. Nests were constructed in varying places: in dead trees, the crooks of large branches, tree hollows, on branches, or "on or near the ground", and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines. The nest itself was a large saucer-shaped structure, up to 350&nbsp;mm in diameter and 70&nbsp;mm deep, with thick walls of dry grass, leaves and "withered stems of herbaceous plants".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/> A central small, shallow cup of soft materials such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs.<ref name="FGBNZ"/><ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/>  After hatching, young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months, by which time they appeared adult.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/>

===In culture===

In M<U+0101>ori culture, the "white heron and the huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes, worn by people of high rank".<ref name="Orbell">[[#MRO|Orbell 1992]]:82<U+2013>83</ref><ref name="Orbell note">Orbell mentions some of the sacred associations of the Huia, saying that if a man dreamed of a Huia or its feathers, it meant his wife would conceive a daughter (page 83).</ref> The bold and inquisitive nature of the Huia made it particularly easy to capture.<ref name="FLM"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> M<U+0101>ori attracted the Huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a ''tari'' (a carved pole with a noose at the end) or snare, or killed it with clubs or long spears. Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair, which would then call out, attracting its mate, which could be easily captured.<ref name="NZ Geo"/><ref name="Buller"/> Opinion on the quality of Huia meat as food varied wildly; although not usually hunted for this purpose, the Huia was considered "good eating" in pies or curried stew<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> by some,<ref name="MBL"/> but a "tough morsel" and "unfit to eat" by others.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> 

Although the Huia's range was restricted to the southern North Island, its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as [[pounamu]] and shark teeth, or given as tokens of friendship and respect. Through this trade, the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/><ref name="FLM"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> They were stored in intricately carved boxes called ''[[waka huia]]'', which were hung from the ceilings of chiefs' houses.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate the heads of the deceased.<ref name="NZ Geo"/><ref name="FULLER">{{cite book |title=Extinct Birds; Foreword by The Hon.

The bird was also kept by M<U+0101>ori as a pet, and like the [[Tui (bird)|Tui]], it could be trained to say a few words.<ref name="MBL"/> There is also a record of a tame Huia kept by European settlers in a small village in the [[Tararua District|Forty-Mile Bush]] in the 19th century.<ref name="FLM"/> 

[[File:1898 Huia 3 pence brown.JPG|left|125px|thumb|alt=Orange-coloured postage stamp with a central picture of two birds|A pair of Huia are pictured on New Zealand's 1898 threepenny stamp.]]
New Zealand has released several postage stamps portraying the Huia,<ref name="nzpost1">{{cite web |last=New Zealand Post |title=Redrawn Pictorials |work=Stamps: Historical Issues |url=http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/Cultures/en-NZ/Stamps/StampsHistoricalIssues/1919+-+1900/Redrawn+Pictorials.htm |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="nzpost2">{{cite web |last=New Zealand Post |title=Extinct Birds |work=Stamps: Historical Issues |url=http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/Cultures/en-NZ/Stamps/StampsHistoricalIssues/1996/Extinct+Birds.htm |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> and the New Zealand sixpence circulated from 1933 to 1966 featured a female Huia on the reverse.
The degree to which the Huia was known and admired in New Zealand is reflected in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species. There are several roads and streets named after the Huia in the North Island, with several in Wellington (including Huia Road in [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Days Bay]] <U+2013> not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of [[East Harbour Regional Park]]) and also in Auckland, where there is even a [[Huia (place)|Huia]] suburb in [[Waitakere City|Waitakere]]. A [[Huia River|river]] on the west coast of the South Island and the [[Huiarau Range]]s in the central North Island are also named after the bird. The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains:<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> ''Huiarau'' means "a hundred Huia".<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> Businesses include the public swimming pool in [[Lower Hutt]], a [[Marlborough]] winery, and [[Huia Publishers]], which specialises in M<U+0101>ori writing and perspectives. The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century, to the son of members of a lower North Island [[iwi]] concerned about the bird's rapid decline,<ref name="NZ Geo"/> and although uncommon, it is still used today in New Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys (e.g. [[Huia Edmonds]]), of both European and M<U+0101>ori descent. 

Tail feathers of the extinct Huia are very rare and they have become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single Huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, much higher than the $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a [[Bald Eagle]] feather at auction in the United States.<ref name="stamp">{{cite news |last=Malkin |first=Bonnie |title=Most expensive feather ever fetches <U+00A3>4,000 at auction ''Heteralocha acutirostris'' |work=Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/7846625/Most-expensive-feather-ever-fetches-4000-at-auction.html|accessdate=27 June 2010 | location=London | date=22 June 2010}}</ref> 

===Extinction===
The Huia was found throughout the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The M<U+0101>ori arrived around 800 years ago, and by the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island.<ref name="FGBNZ"/> However, M<U+0101>ori hunting pressures on the Huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a ''[[r<U+0101>hui]]'' (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer.<ref name="NZ Geo"/> It was not until European settlement that the Huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and overhunting. 

Like the extinctions of other New Zealand birds such as the [[North Island Piopio|Piopio]] in the 19th century, the decline of the Huia was poorly studied. Massive deforestation occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern [[Hawkes Bay]], the [[Manawatu]] and the [[Wairarapa]], as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The Huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in [[old-growth forest]] where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, [[secondary forest]]s.<ref name="WS"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed.<ref name="MBL"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on Huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes<ref name="FULLER"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> 

It appears that predation by invasive mammalian species including [[Black Rat|ship rat]]s, cats, and [[mustelid]]s was an additional factor in the decline in Huia numbers <U+2013> introduction of these animals by New Zealand [[Acclimatisation society|Acclimatisation Societies]] peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in Huia populations.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> Because it spent a lot of time on the ground, the Huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators.<ref name="WS"/><ref name="FGBNZ"/> Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease<ref name="IUCN9983">{{IUCN2006|assessors= BirdLife International |year=2004|id=9983|title=Heteralocha acutirostris|downloaded=11 May 2006}}</ref> introduced from Asia with the [[Common Myna]]. 
Habitat destruction and the predations of introduced species were problems faced by all New Zealand birds, but in addition the Huia faced massive pressure from hunting. Due to its pronounced sexual dimorphism and its beauty, Huia were sought after as [[taxidermy|mounted specimens]] by wealthy collectors in Europe<ref name="KJWB-140">[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:140</ref> and by museums all over the world.<ref name="NZ Geo"/><ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> These individuals and institutions were willing to pay large sums of money for good specimens, and the overseas demand created a strong financial incentive for hunters in New Zealand.<ref name="KJWB-140"/> This hunting was initially by naturalists. Austrian taxidermist [[Andreas Reischek]] took 212 pairs as specimens for the natural history museum in [[Vienna]] over a period of 10 years,<ref name="NZ Geo"/> while New Zealand ornithologist [[Walter Buller]] collected 18 on just one of several expeditions to the [[Rimutaka Range]]s in 1883.<ref name="NZ Geo"/> Others keen to profit soon joined in. Buller records that also in 1883, a party of 11 M<U+0101>ori obtained 646 Huia skins from the forest between the [[Manawatu Gorge]] and [[Akitio]].<ref name="FGBNZ"/><ref name="Buller"/> Several thousand Huia were exported overseas as part of this trade.<ref name="WS"/> Infrastructure development within lowland forest did not help the situation: hundreds of Huia were shot around road and rail construction camps.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> {{quote|While we were looking at and admiring this little picture of bird-life, a pair of Huias, without uttering a sound, appeared in a tree overhead, and as they were caressing each other with their beautiful bills, a charge of No.&nbsp;6 brought them both to the ground together. The incident was rather touching and I felt almost glad that the shot was not mine, although by no means loth to appropriate 2 fine specimens.<br/>|<small>Sir Walter Buller, New Zealand's well-known 19th-century ornithologist, encapsulating what one source describes as the "ambiguous" 19th-century attitudes towards the declining New Zealand avifauna.</small><ref name="Hutching">[[#GH|Hutching 2004]]</ref>}}

The rampant and unsustainable hunting was not just financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect.<ref name="KJWB-140"/> The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European.<ref name="KJWC-265">[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:265</ref> It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species.<ref name="KJWC-265"/> This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; instead, Victorian collectors focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.<ref name="KJWB-140"/>

There were some attempts to conserve the Huia, but they were few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was still very much in its infancy.<ref name="NZ Geo"/> There were successive sharp declines in numbers of Huia in the 1860s<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014" /> and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a [[r<U+0101>hui]] on the [[Tararua Range]].<ref name="WS"/> In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the Huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously.<ref name="WS"/> Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this Act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including [[Kapiti Island]], [[Little Barrier Island]] and [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]], were never stocked with Huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no Huia were ever transferred.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed.<ref name="WS"/> A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for [[Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], along with the last collected live pair of [[Laughing Owl]]s.<ref name="KJWC-265"/> 

The [[Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Duchess of York]], later [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], visited New Zealand in 1901. At an official M<U+0101>ori welcome in [[Rotorua]], a guide took a Huia tail feather from her hair and placed it in the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/><ref name="WS"/> Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear Huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to <U+00A3>1, making each bird worth <U+00A3>12, and some feathers sold for as much as <U+00A3>5.<ref name="WS"/> Female Huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery.<ref name="NZ Lib">{{cite web |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=226654&coltype=history&regno=gh005020 |title=Huia beak brooch |work=Collections Online |publisher=Museum of New Zealand-Te Papa Tongarewa |year=2004 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> Shooting season notices ceased listing the Huia as a protected species in 1901,<ref name="NZ Geo"/> and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the Solicitor General ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.<ref name="WS"/> 

[[Image:Mokau Falls.JPG|upright|right|thumb|alt=Dense forest with a waterfall|[[Mokau Falls]] in [[Te Urewera|the Ureweras]] is close to the location of the last credible Huia sightings.]]
The decline of the Huia over the southern half of the North Island occurred at markedly different rates in different locations. Areas where dramatic declines were observed in the 1880s included the Puketoi Range, the [[Hutt Valley]] and Tararuas, and the [[Pahiatua]]-[[Dannevirke]] area.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/> The species was abundant in a few places in the early 20th century between Hawke's Bay and the Wairarapa;<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> a flock of 100<U+2013>150 birds was reported at the summit of the Akatarawa-Waikane track in 1905; they were still "fairly plentiful" in the upper reaches of the [[Rangitikei River]] in 1906<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> <U+2013> and yet, the last confirmed sighting came just one year later.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> 

The last official, confirmed Huia sighting was made on 28 December 1907 when W. W. Smith saw three birds in the forests of the Tararua Ranges.<ref name="FGBNZ"/> Unconfirmed, "quite credible" reports suggest that extinction for the species came a little later. A man familiar with the species reported seeing three Huia in Gollans Valley behind York Bay (between [[Petone]] and [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]] on Wellington Harbour), an area of mixed beech and podocarp forest well within the bird's former range, on 28 December 1922.<ref name="WS">[[#RMHS|Morris and Smith 1995]]</ref> Sightings of the Huia were also reported here in 1912 and 1913. Despite this, naturalists from the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Dominion Museum]] in Wellington did not investigate the reports. The last credible reports of Huia come from the forests of [[Te Urewera National Park]], with one from near Mt Urutawa in 1952 and final sightings near [[Lake Waikareiti]] in 1961 and 1963.<ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/> The possibility of a small Huia population still surviving in the Urewera ranges has been proposed by some researchers, but is considered highly unlikely. No recent expeditions have been mounted to find a living specimen.<ref name="WS"/><ref name="NZ Geo"/> 

Students at [[Hastings Boys' High School]] organised a conference in 1999 to consider cloning the Huia, their school emblem.<ref name="NZSM">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612131328/http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |archivedate=12 June 2008 |url=http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |title=Boys Cloning Birds |work=New Zealand Science Monthly |publisher=Webcentre |last=Perry |first=Chris |date=September 2000 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="CNN1999">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/NATURE/9907/20/cloning.enn/ |title=Cloning of extinct Huia bird approved |work=CNN Nature |publisher=Cable News Network |date=20 July 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> The tribe [[Ng<U+0101>ti Huia]] agreed in principle to support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the University of Otago, and a California-based internet start-up volunteered $100,000 of funding.<ref name="Dorey1999">{{Cite journal |last=Dorey |first=Emma |title=Huia cloned back to life? |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=17 |issue=8 |page=736 |year=1999 |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v17/n8/full/nbt0899_736c.html |pmid=10429272 |doi=10.1038/11628 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], said that the complete Huia [[genome]] could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the [[DNA]], and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.<ref name="listener3433">{{cite web |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3433/columnists/5528/the_last_huia.html |title=The Last Huia |last=Priestley |first=Rebecca |date=25 February <U+2013> 3 March 2006 |work=New Zealand Listener |publisher=APN Holdings NZ |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>
