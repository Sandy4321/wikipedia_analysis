[[Image:Andrew Martin-Test at ECW Live.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Andrew Martin|Test]], who faced off against [[Scott Steiner]]]]
The next match was between [[Andrew Martin|Test]] and [[Scott Steiner]]. Before the bell rang, Keibler hugged Steiner to make Test jealous. The match officially started when Test was giving a series of hits to the back and body when down on the mat. After Test tried to get a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] on him, Steiner reversed with a powerful [[Professional wrestling throws#Fallaway slam|fallaway slam]] and quickly went to cover, but Test kicked out right after the referee counted one. Steiner then continued hitting him with a series of chops to the chest. Later during the match, Test had the upper hand over Steiner, until Test went for a flying [[Professional wrestling attacks#Double axe handle|double Axe handle]] and Steiner reversed it into a [[suplex]]. At the end of the match, Test tried to go for a chair shot to Steiner, but Keibler came inside the ring and took the chair and tried to hit Test. Instead, she hit Steiner, and Test hit him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|running big boot]] and got the pin. Therefore, Steiner became Test's property, as per the pre-match stipulation.<ref name="SLAM! Review"/><ref name="WWE results"/><ref name="PWWEW.net results"/>

The third match was [[Shawn Michaels]] versus [[Randy Orton]] in a match billed "''Legend vs. Legend Killer''." Michaels hit Orton with [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] and covered him for the pin, but on the outside, Flair put Orton's foot on the bottom rope. Flair passed Orton a pair of [[brass knuckles]], but Michaels hit Flair with another superkick. Michaels went for a back suplex, which did not succeed. Orton then hit Michaels with the brass knuckles and pinned Michaels to win the match.<ref name="SLAM! Review"/><ref name="WWE results"/><ref name="PWWEW.net results"/>

Next was a [[WWE Diva|Divas]] [[tag team]] match between the team of [[Trish Stratus]] and Lita and the team of [[Nora Greenwald|Molly Holly]] and [[Gail Kim]]. When the match began, all four Divas were battling each other. When the two legal Divas were inside the ring, it was between Lita and Kim. Lita started out, getting Kim with arm takedowns, then a throw back. Throughout the match, Lita's team had the upper hand over Kim and Holly. Later at the end of the match, Stratus threw Kim out of the ring, and Lita, her partner, performed a [[moonsault]] on Molly Holly to ge the pin.<ref name="SLAM!

Next on the [[Undercard|card]] was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing match]] between [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] and [[Shane McMahon]]. Before the match began, McMahon popped up from behind Kane, who was doing his entrance, and hit him with steel chair multiple times on the back. As the referee officially called to ring the bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away, to block another chair shot. After McMahon got back into the ring, he jumped and hit Kane. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon dropped the chair and went after Kane's knee using the steel pole on the turnbuckle. Later during the match, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he moved away, and instead, it hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane went to the outside of the ring and brought the steel steps into the ring, in attempt to [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone Piledriver|Tombstone]] McMahon, but McMahon countered and reversed it into a bulldog. Later at the end of the match, McMahon had Kane near the entrance area, and McMahon attempted to do his signature move, the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]], from the top of the arena Titantron. He missed, however, when Kane moved out of the way. Kane won the match when McMahon did not get up from a ten count.<ref name="SLAM! Review"/><ref name="WWE results"/><ref name="PWWEW.net results"/> 

A [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] involving [[Jason Reso|Christian]], [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] (RVD) was next. The match started off with Jericho and Christian teaming up on RVD, both giving him multiple stomps to the back. RVD reversed Jericho and Christian's offense, by performing a double [[dropkick]] to take them both down. In the middle of the match, RVD did a double [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] on the two, which brought Christian to the outside of the ring, leaving RVD and Jericho in the ring. Later during the match, RVD got thrown out of the ring, leading to a battle between Christian and Jericho. At the time, Christian was about to jump off the turnbuckles and RVD was about to get back into the ring, but Jericho ran and pushed the ring ropes, which caused RVD to fall back to the outside. It also caused Christian to lose balance and fall on his [[groin]] before the jump attempted. At the end of the match, RVD was about to do another one of his signature move, the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|frog splash]], but when the referee's back was turned, Christian took the belt, and when RVD was about to land on him, he landed on the belt. Christian then quickly went for a pin and retained title.<ref name="SLAM! Review"/><ref name="WWE results"/><ref name="PWWEW.net results"/>

[[Image:Bill goldberg.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], who challenged [[Triple H]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]]]

Chris Jericho came out and interfered, allowing Al Snow and Coach to get the victory.<ref name="SLAM! Review"/><ref name="WWE results"/><ref name="PWWEW.net results"/>

Next was the [[main event]], which saw [[Triple H]] defend the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]. Triple H made the first attack when he threw a fist at Goldberg and then threw him face first into the turnbuckle. Later, Triple H tried to throw Goldberg into the other turnbuckle, but Goldberg reversed and performed his signature move, the [[Professional wrestling throws#Pumphandle fallaway slam|pumphandle fallaway slam]]. Triple H fell on his back and then rolled to the outside. Goldberg then tried to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], but Triple H countered and reversed it into, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Facebreaker knee smash|facebreaker knee smash]]. After Triple H tried to perform a second knee facebreaker, Goldberg reversed the move, kicked Triple H in the stomach, and performed a clothesline. Later at the end of the match, Goldberg did a spear and a Jackhammer, quickly got the cover, and became the new World Heavyweight Champion.<ref name="SLAM!
