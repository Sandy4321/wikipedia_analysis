The '''Knights of the Band''', or '''Equites Bindae''', were a [[military order]] in [[Spain]], instituted by [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], [[List of Castilian monarchs|King]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], c. 1330.<ref>''The New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 6: c. 1300 - c. 1415'', Michael Jones (ed.) (Cambridge, 1998), p. 209.</ref> It takes its name from the ''banda'', band, sash or red ribbon which came across over the right shoulder and under the left arm of the knight. 

The order was awarded to certain distinguished knights and squires of the king, and has roots back as far as 1324.<ref name="Members">[http://www.zingzang.org/historiaviva/nombres/vanda-ing.shtml Members of the Order of the Band]</ref> This order was for none but nobles; the eldest sons of [[grandee]]s were excluded; and a prerequisite to admittance was to have served at least ten years either in the army, or at court. They were bound to take up arms for [[Catholicism]] against infidels. The King himself was Grand Master of the order. After a period of decline it is considered to have been extinct by 1474.<ref name="Members"/>
