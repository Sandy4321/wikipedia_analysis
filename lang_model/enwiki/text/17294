{{nihongo|'''Type-Moon'''|<U+30BF><U+30A4><U+30D7><U+30E0><U+30FC><U+30F3>|Taipu M<U+016B>n}} is a prominent [[Japan]]ese game company, best known for their [[visual novel]]s. It is also known under the name {{nihongo|Notes|<U+30CE><U+30FC><U+30C4>|N<U+014D>tsu}}. After creating the popular visual novel ''[[Tsukihime]]'' as a [[dojin soft]] organization, Type-Moon has since incorporated and produced the immensely popular visual novel ''[[Fate/stay night]]''.  Both of their works have been adapted into [[anime]] and [[manga]] series that have amassed a global fanbase.

==History==
Type-Moon was founded by artist [[Takashi Takeuchi]] and writer [[Kinoko Nasu]], whose first project was the [[novel]] ''Kara no Kyoukai'', which was originally released in October 1998  and reprinted in 2004 . The company name Type-Moon actually comes from one of Kinoko's older works, Angel Notes.  In December 2000, Type-Moon released the [[eroge]] [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]-based visual novel game Tsukihime, which sold extremely well and amassed a large fanbase because of its comprehensive and expansive storyline and writer Kinoko Nasu's unique style of storytelling. The game led to the creation of numerous top selling merchandise, memorabilia, and a fanbase numbering millions around the World. Tsukihime was adapted soon after in 2003  into an anime series, [[Tsukihime, Lunar Legend|Shingetsutan Tsukihime]], which was produced by [[J.C.Staff]] and published by [[Geneon]], and a [[manga]] series based upon Shingetsutan Tsukihime that has been published since 2004.   

Soon after, in January [[2001]], Type-Moon released ''Plus-Disk'', an addition to Tsukihime that featured three side-stories and assorted multimedia, and in August 2001  released a sequel to Tsukihime, [[Kagetsu Tohya]], and soon, in April 2003  released ''Tsuki-Bako'', a specially packaged three-disk set that included Tsukihime, Plus-Disk and Kagetsu Tohya and a remixed soundtrack for both games and more multimedia. 

In December [[2002]], Type-Moon, in association with [[French-Bread]] (known as Watanabe Seisakujo prior to 2003), released their first fighting game, [[Melty Blood]], a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]-based [[doujin]] game based on the Tsukihime universe, and which was very popular and was followed soon after by an expansion, [[Melty Blood ReACT]], released in May 2004, to which a patch update, [[Melty Blood ReACT Final Tuned]], was released as a free download over the [[Internet]]. Melty Blood is widely considered amongst the best doujin 2D fighting games ever made, and has been released as an arcade port, Melty Blood: Act Cadenza in March 2005, and was released on the [[PS2]] platform in August 2006 . 

Type-Moon soon transitioned from a [[dojin soft]] organization to a commercial organization, and in [[30 January]] [[2004]], released their first commercial release, a PC-based eroge visual novel game, [[Fate/stay night]], which broke all records on its opening day and was later adapted into an anime series that aired 24 episodes in Japan starting [[6 January]] [[2006]] and a manga series that has been published since [[26 December]] [[2005]] in Shonen Ace (Known for the manga adaptation of [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] and [[Keroro Gunsou]]. A sequel to Fate/stay night, [[Fate/hollow ataraxia]], was released on [[October 28]], [[2005]]. Fate/stay night was released on the PS2 platform in May 2007.
