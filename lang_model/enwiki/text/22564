Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [rap] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing."<ref name="Ketchum"/>

At the age of 16, Smith released his debut album, ''[[Boomin' Words from Hell]]'', in 1989.<ref name="AMGHipHop"/><ref name="Discography">{{cite web |url=http://www.acidrap.com/eshamcatalog.html |title=Discography |accessdate=2008-08-18 |last=Smith |first=Esham A |publisher=[[Reel Life Productions]]}}</ref> Of the album, Smith stated, "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that really came from. It was all an expression about ['70s-'80s drug cartel] [[Young Boys Inc.|Young Boys Incorporated]], Mayor [[Coleman Young]], the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred to the streets of Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where my ideas came from."<ref name="Ketchum"/> In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label [[Reel Life Productions]],<ref name="AMGHipHop"/><ref name="McLeod"/> which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork.<ref name="Discography"/> Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as [[shock value]], while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] influences.<ref name="Ketchum"/> 

After releasing two EPs, ''[[Erotic Poetry]]'' and ''[[Homey Don't Play]]'', Esham completed the [[double album]] ''[[Judgement Day (album)|Judgement Day]]'', and its two volumes, ''Day'' and ''Night'' were released separately on April 9, 1992.<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> [[Allmusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier wrote that ''Judgement Day, Vol. 1'' "may not be his most well-crafted work, but it certainly stands as his most inspired work of the '90s", while ''Vol. 2'' "isn't quite as strong as the first volume, suffering mostly from a number of weak tracks [...] the first volume doesn't rely quite so much on cheap shock, instead focusing on evocative horror motifs, making ''Judgement Day, Vol. 2'' the less important of the two."<ref name="AMGHipHop"/>

===''KKKill the Fetus'', ''Closed Casket'' and ''Dead Flowerz''===
As a student at Osborn High School, Esham met Mastamind, who gave him a three-song demo tape of his music, leading the two to form the group [[Natas (group)|Natas]] with Esham's longtime friend, TNT.<ref name="Birchmeier"/> In 1992, Esham appeared on ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'', the debut album of [[Insane Clown Posse]], released on October 18. He produced three tracks and rapped on the album's final track.<ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=174<U+2013>185 |chapter=The Dark Carnival }}</ref> In November, Natas released their debut album, ''[[Life After Death (Natas album)|Life After Death]]''.<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> In 1993, Esham released his third solo album, ''[[KKKill the Fetus]]''. Jason Birchmeier wrote that "At this point in his career, his rapping has already reached near-peak levels, and his production shows a continued path towards an inventiveness. [...] Never again would Esham be so gritty."<ref name="AMGHipHop"/>

On November 22, 1994, Esham released his fourth studio album, ''[[Closed Casket]]''. Jason Birchmeier wrote that "most fans taking a chronological approach to his catalog should be fairly numb to Esham's exploitative shock attempts. Yet if this is one of your first experiences with Esham the Unholy, this album should pack a punch with its dark nature."<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> In May 1996, Esham released his fifth studio album, ''[[Dead Flowerz]]''. It peaked at #38 on the ''[[Billboard]]'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums [[Billboard charts|chart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jzfrxqrhld0e~T3 |title=Charts & Awards for ''Dead Flowerz'' |accessdate=2008-07-19 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> 

===Overcore Records (1999<U+2014>2001)===
In 1999, Reel Life Productions became Overcore Records, and Esham signed a deal with [[TVT Records]] to distribute the label's output.<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> In June of 2001, Overcore released [[Kool Keith]]'s ''[[Spankmaster]]'' album, which featured several contributions by Esham, as well as Smith's eighth album, ''[[Tongues (Esham album)|Tongues]]'', which peaked at #7 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #46 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #195 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzfpxqr0ldje~T3 |title=Charts & Awards for ''Tongues'' |accessdate=2008-07-19 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In August of 2001, Esham and [[D12]] were kicked off the [[Warped Tour]] after members of the group allegedly physically attacked Smith over the lyrics of his song "Chemical Imbalance," which contained a reference to the daughter of D12 leader [[Eminem]], who was not present during the tour.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Moriates |title=Rappers Esham, D12 kicked off Warped Tour after alleged attack |url=http://dailybruin.com/archives/id/15893/ |publisher=''The Daily Bruin'' |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hasted |first=Nick |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Dark Story of Eminem |origyear=2005 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location= |language= |isbn=1844497267 |chapter=The Waiting Room |page=151 }}</ref>

===Psychopathic Records (2002<U+2014>2005)===
In 2002, Esham signed to [[Psychopathic Records]], releasing the compilation ''[[Acid Rain (album)|Acid Rain]]''. It was announced that Esham would be moving away from the horror themes of his previous efforts.<ref name="Bruce">{{cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_wf_20020903 |title=Weekly Freekly: 2 |accessdate=2008-08-17 |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |coauthors= |date=June 25, 2004 |work= |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040820162159/www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_wf_20020903 |archivedate=2002-09-03}}</ref> On November 18, 2003, Esham released his ninth studio album, ''[[Repentance (album)|Repentance]]''. It peaked at #9 on the Top Heatseekers chart, #10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #71 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wvfexqqaldhe~T3 |title=Charts & Awards for ''Repentance'' |accessdate=2008-07-19 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Jason Birchmeier wrote that "''Repentance'' is a small step forward for Esham.

===''Sacrificial Lambz'' (2008)===
On [[August 26]], [[2008]], Smith released his eleventh studio album, ''[[Sacrificial Lambz]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:giftxzrkldfe |title=''Sacrificial Lambz'' > Overview |accessdate=2008-07-19 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> It peaked at #50 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Heatseekers [[Billboard charts|chart]] and at #42 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:giftxzrkldfe~T3 |title=Charts and awards for ''Sacrificial Lambz'' |accessdate=2008-10-11 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In October, Smith started a petition to run for mayor of Detroit.<ref name="Ketchum"/> Smith has stated "The jump to running for mayor is a pretty drastic change, but I just want to take a stance. If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."<ref name="Ketchum"/>

==Style and influence==
Esham refers to his performance style as "[[acid rap]]," comparing the lyrics to hallucinations induced by [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref name="McLeod"/> Esham's style has also been described as [[horrorcore]] hip hop, which "utilize[s] shocking (and blatantly over the top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit", according to author Sara Cohen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Sara |title=Decline, Renewal and the City in Popular Music Culture: Beyond The Beatles |year=2007 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=0754632431 |page=52 }}</ref> Smith's lyrics have focused on themes such as death, drug use, evil, paranoia and sex, and have included references to [[Satan]]. According to Smith, "People were literally scared of my records. There have been so many rumors about me and my records. People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said a lot of things that people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [issues] that people didn't want to talk about."<ref name="Ketchum"/> Following accusations of [[Satanism]], Smith decided that ''[[Closed Casket]]'' would be the last album to feature such themes, and that he would no longer rap about the [[Devil]].<ref name="Bruce"/> According to Smith, "I've been able to entertain people for 20 years. I just try to uplift people now. The latest things I do, I'm trying to get a message out to people, while I'm entertaining them at the same time."<ref name="Ketchum"/> 

Acid rap has been described as a fusion of hip hop beats and [[death metal]] lyrics.<ref name="McLeod"/> Esham defined the genre as analogous to "'modern day [[blues]] [or] heavy metal'".<ref name="Keyes">{{cite book |last=Keyes |first=Cheryl Lynette |title=Rap Music and Street Consciousness |year=2002 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0252072014, 9780252072017 |chapter=Blending and Shaping Styles: Rap and Other Musical Voices |page=108 }}</ref> [[Insane Clown Posse]] member [[Joseph Bruce]] has credited Esham as an influence on the group's work.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> In the lyrics of "Still Don't Give a Fuck" from the album ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', [[Eminem]] refers to himself as "a cross between [[Charles Manson|Manson]], Esham and [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Stubbs |first=David |authorlink=David Stubbs |title=Eminem: The Stories Behind Every Song |year=2006 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=1560259469 |chapter=The Slim Shady LP |page=89 }}</ref>  According to author Cheryl Lynette Keyes, Esham's "metal sound with a hip-hop feel" formed the musical basis for acts such as [[Kid Rock]], [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], and [[Kottonmouth Kings]].<ref name="Keyes"/> Smith has stated that "A lot of people go into my extensive back catalog and redo my ideas, and think they're coming up with something new. I'm flattered by a lot of it. I used to get upset, but the older I get, I realize that we were on a higher plane than a lot of people."<ref name="Ketchum"/>
