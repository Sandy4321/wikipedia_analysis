The '''2014 GoDaddy Bowl''' was an American [[college football]] [[bowl game]] that was played on January 5, 2014 at the [[Ladd Peebles Stadium]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]].  The fifteenth edition of the [[GoDaddy Bowl]] (originally known as the Mobile Alabama Bowl), it featured the [[2013 Ball State Cardinals football team|Ball State Cardinals]] from the [[Mid-American Conference]] and the [[2013 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|Arkansas State Red Wolves]], co-champions of the [[Sun Belt Conference]]. It was one of the [[2013<U+2013>14 NCAA football bowl games|2013<U+2013>14 bowl games]] that concluded the [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013 FBS football season]].  The game began at 8:00 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]] and aired on [[ESPN]]. It was sponsored by [[web hosting service]] company [[Go Daddy]]. Arkansas State defeated Ball State by a score of 23<U+2013>20.

The Cardinals, who earned a 10<U+2013>2 record during the season, made their second appearance in the bowl, while the Red Wolves, who earned a 7<U+2013>5 record during the season, made their third consecutive appearance in the bowl. The pregame buildup focused on the teams' respective strong offenses. For Ball State, the passing game centered around quarterback [[Keith Wenning]] connecting with wide receiver Willie Snead. In tandem with the rushing attack fueled by a strong offensive line, one writer asserted that they would enjoy "easy pickings" against a mediocre Arkansas State defense. Unlike the Ball State offense, Arkansas State's offense focused predominantly on the rushing attack, to which both [[dual-threat quarterback]] Adam Kennedy and running back Michael Gordon contributed. Ball State's defense was average in terms of points allowed, but poor in terms of yards allowed. Ball State was a 9.5 point favorite to win the game, and was the predicted winner among most sportswriters.

Ball State jumped out to an early lead via a [[Keith Wenning|Wenning]] to [[Willie Snead|Snead]] touchdown, and led at the end of the first quarter 7<U+2013>0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 <U+2013> at half time, the teams were tied at 10. Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus entering the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into [[field goal range]] as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game, 23<U+2013>20.

===Ball State offense vs. Arkansas State defense===

===Arkansas State offense vs. Ball State defense===
====Matchup====
A key to this matchup was for Ball State to force Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, limiting his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary.<ref name="br-bs-keys"/> For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season <U+2013> seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) <U+2013> seventh nationally).<ref>{{cite web|last=Lena|first=Sebastian|title=Arkansas State Keys to Victory - Ball State vs. Ark.

====Ball State defense====
Defensive coordinator Jay Bateman led the Cardinals' defense, which was in the middle of the pack in the FBS in terms of points allowed (24.8 per game), in the bottom half in terms of yards allowed (420.8 per game), particularly struggling against the running game, allowing 194.8 rushing yards per game, which was in the bottom third nationally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game By Game Stats (Ball St. Cardinals)|url=http://stats.ncaa.org/team/index/11520?org_id=47|website=NCAA.org|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Ball State's defensive line was led by fifth-year senior defensive end [[Jonathan Newsome]], who achieved first team All-MAC honors,<ref name=bsu-release-9>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Joe|title=Ball State vs. Arkansas State - Pregame Release|url=http://ballstatesports.com/downloads2/835508.pdf?&ATCLID=209334615&SPSID=67657&SPID=7633&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=14200|work=Ball State football|publisher=Ball State Athletics Department - Media Relations Office|accessdate=December 13, 2013|page=9}}</ref> and totaled 57 tackles, 11.5 TFL, and 8 sacks.<ref name="bsu-def-stat">{{cite web|title=Cumulative Season Statistics - Overall Defensive Statistics|url=http://www.ballstatesports.com/fls/14200/Stats/Football/2013/teamcume.htm#TEAM.DEF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055458/http://www.ballstatesports.com/fls/14200/Stats/Football/2013/teamcume.htm|archivedate=December 22, 2013|work=Ball State Athletics|publisher=Ball State University|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Senior Nathan Ollie was also a leader of the line, earning second team All-MAC accolades,<ref name="bsu-release-9"/> and totaling 67 tackles, 9 TFL, and 3 sacks on the season.<ref name="bsu-def-stat"/> Like Ollie (Newsome did not start the second game of the season), senior Joel Cox and junior Nick Miles started every game of the season, at nose tackle and defensive end respectively.<ref name=bsu-release-21>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Joe|title=Ball State vs. Arkansas State - Pregame Release|url=http://ballstatesports.com/downloads2/835508.pdf?&ATCLID=209334615&SPSID=67657&SPID=7633&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=14200|work=Ball State football|publisher=Ball State Athletics Department - Media Relations Office|accessdate=December 13, 2013|page=21}}</ref> Junior Ben Ingle started 11 of the 12 games at [[outside linebacker|weak side linebacker]], and led the defense with 105 tackles, including 3.5 TFL, redshirt freshman Zack Ryan, who started every game at [[middle linebacker]], was third on the defense with 80 tackles, with 8 TFL and 2.5 sacks, and senior Kenneth Lee played [[outside linebacker|strong side linebacker]], and recorded 42 tackles, 4.5 TFL, and 2.5 sacks.<ref name="bsu-def-stat"/><ref name="bsu-release-21"/> Aside from junior Brian Jones, who started all 12 games and finished the season second on the defense with 90 tackles and led the defense with 4 fumble recoveries,<ref name="bsu-def-stat"/> continuity was lacking in the Cardinals' secondary <U+2013> three different players started at the "BC" cornerback spot, two different players started at the "FC" cornerback spot, and two different players started at the free safety spot.

==Game summary==
===First quarter===
After receiving the opening kickoff, Ball State's first drive stalled, and it ultimately went [[three-and-out]]. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 yards on the punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed to capitalize on the good field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard drive that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards for a total of 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also on the drive, Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game. At the end of the quarter, the Red Wolves had just concluded a drive, that had crossed into Ball State's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5-yard line. On that drive, Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas State Red Wolves vs. Ball State Cardinals - Play By Play - January 05, 2014 (Q1)|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=340052050&period=1|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Second quarter===
The victim of poor field position, Ball State executed only three plays, the last of which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. They got on the score board on that drive via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7<U+2013>3 Ball State. On their ensuing drive, Ball State executed another extended drive, this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10<U+2013>10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas State Red Wolves vs. Ball State Cardinals - Play By Play - January 05, 2014 (Q2)|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=340052050&period=2|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Third quarter===
Arkansas State got the ball to start the second half, and promptly drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13<U+2013>10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt <U+2013> Schmidt lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. Arkansas State took advantage of the field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State [[turnover on downs|turned the ball over on downs]] on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, Ball State was in the midst of a possession around their 25-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas State Red Wolves vs. Ball State Cardinals - Play By Play - January 05, 2014 (Q3)|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=340052050&period=3|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Fourth quarter===
Ball State took advantage of a pass interference penalty on Arkansas State on their drive <U+2013> Secor kicked a 37-yard field goal to pull the Cardinals within three points. The Red Wolves then went three-and-out. After that, each team's quarterback (Wenning and Knighten respectively) threw interceptions; after the interceptions, Ball State had the ball at their own 4-yard line (Wenning's interception was returned to the 8-yard line). They scored after executing a demoralizing 16-play, 80-yard drive that encapsulated 6:51 <U+2013> it culminated when Edwards rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. Arkansas State efficiently responded, scoring on a 13-yard pass from Knighten to Allen Muse, a {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}}, {{convert|225|lb|kg}} senior wide receiver. The touchdown gave Arkansas State a 23<U+2013>20 lead that they would not relinquish <U+2013> Secor attempted a 38-yard field goal as time expired to try to tie the game, however the kick was blocked, and the Red Wolves held on to win.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas State Red Wolves vs. Ball State Cardinals - Play By Play - January 05, 2014 (Q4)|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=340052050&period=4|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref>
