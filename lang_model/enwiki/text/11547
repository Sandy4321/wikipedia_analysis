'''WCVE-FM''' is a public [[radio station]] licensed to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. It is owed by [[Commonwealth Public Broadcasting Corporation]]. The station, which went on the air [[March 25]], [[1988]], is a [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) affiliate. It broadcasts at 88.9 MHz in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]], with transmitter and tower located in downtown Richmond. The studios are located at the WCVE-TV complex located in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] at 23 Sesame Street in [[Bon Air, Virginia]]. The station also has a repeater station in [[Heathsville, Virginia|Heathsville]], '''WCNV-FM,''' which serves the [[Northern Neck]] region at 89.1 FM.  It has plans to build another repeater in [[Chase City, Virginia|Chase City]] on 90.1 FM. 

== History ==
WCVE-FM follows a [[European classical music|classical music]] format established in 1961 by [[WFMV]], Virginia's first radio station to broadcast in stereo. That station had a loyal and influential following, but low ratings as a commercial radio station enterprise, and was sold to new owners in 1970. After the transition in 1971, WFMV listeners followed the classical music and public radio format through 17 years with [[WRFK]]. In the mid 1980's, WRFK's owners, Union Theological Seminary, were looking to sell the station, which would be highly valuable as a commercial station. Efforts were made to keep WRFK as an NPR and classical station while another station could be found to take up the format. 

In less than two months time, Commonwealth Virginia Educational Television (CVET) got special permission to broadcast on 101.1 MHz while a deal could be worked out with [[WTVR-TV]] to place a permanent home for the new station on 88.9. On March 25, 1988, with the help of Virginia public broadcasting pioneer [[Benjamin W. Spiller]],a temporary assignment was granted to CVET for 101.1, which broadcast from a tower on the property of WCVE-TV. WRFK signed off at 12:30 pm with a farewell from longtime staffer Stephanie Pyle who encouraged listeners to tune into the new radio station, WCVE-FM at 101.1. At exactly 12:31pm, WCVE-FM signed on with [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''Fanfare For the Common Man''.The first voice on the new station was WRFK veteran Henry Wailes.

Because of possible interference from [[WWDC-FM]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the station only broadcasted at 3,000 [[watt]]s at about 300 feet in 101.1. On November 16, 1989, WCVE was allowed to move to 88.9 MHz on WTVR-TV tower, Richmond's largest tower, with 8,300 watts of power.( The tower, now owned by Raycom, not only holds the antennas for WCVE-FM and WTVR-TV, but also separately owned 98.1 WTVR-FM ( Lite 98 ).) 

In [[2003]], [[FCC]] regulations changed, so WCVE-FM was permitted to increase its power to 17,500 watts. It is one of the most powerful signals in Richmond, heard as far west as [[Appomattox]], as far North as [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredricksburg]], and as far east as [[Newport News]]. 

Grete Dollitz's program, "An Hour With the Guitar" was originally on WFMV. After more than 30 years, is still heard on WCVE-FM.

Although it's ranking is not included in the Arbitron ratings when they are issued for the commercial stations,( they are usually issued separately at a later date ), WCVE-FM averages to manage 4th or 5th place in the local Arbitron ratings, making it a very competitive and popular radio station.
