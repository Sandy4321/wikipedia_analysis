'''M-204''' runs across the [[Leelanau Peninsula]] between [[Leland, Michigan|Leland]] and [[Suttons Bay, Michigan|Suttons Bay]] in the northwestern [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] of the US state of [[Michigan]]. The trunkline runs through a rural section of [[Leelanau County, Michigan|Leelanau County]], connecting two villages with the [[county seat]]. Originally a gravel road in 1933, it was later paved within the first three years of existence. Segments were realigned to straighten curves in the late 1930s and early 1970s near the villages of [[Lake Leelanau, Michigan|Lake Leelanau]] and Suttons Bay.

==Route description==
M-204 starts at an intersection with [[M-22 (Michigan highway)|M-22]] (Manitou Trail) south of Leland next to Duck Lake. From there it follows Duck Lake Road along the south shore of [[Lake Leelanau]]'s northern lobe. The two-lane roadway runs eastward and then southeasterly through a mixture of woods and fields to the village of Lake Leelanau. One there, M-204 follows Phillip Street across the Narrows and turns northeasterly.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> The bridge that the trunkline uses is eligible for listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=LLNB>{{cite web |author= Staff |date= May 13, 2002 |title= M-204<U+2013>Lake Leelanau Narrows |url= http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154_11188-29711--,00.html |work= Michigan's Historic Bridges |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |accessdate= July 7, 2012}}</ref> Outside of town, the highway follows Duck Lake Road again past the [[county seat]] of Leelanau County. Near the intersection with Horn Road, M-204 turns southeasterly toward the village of Suttons Bay. As the trunkline descends a hill into the village, it passes through vineyards and woods. Inside town, M-204 follows Race Street and ends downtown at M-22 (St. Joseph Avenue).<ref name=MDOT12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |section= F8<U+2013>F9 }}</ref><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=M-204+E%2FE+Duck+Lake+Rd&daddr=Race+St&hl=en&sll=44.991391,-85.765028&sspn=0.014629,0.01457&geocode=FQqQrgId0ELj-g%3BFZ9ZrgIdfCDl-g&oq=Sutt&t=h&mra=ls&z=12 |title= Overview Map of M-204 |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}</ref>

Like other state highways in Michigan, M-204 is maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on [[average annual daily traffic|average]], 3,397&nbsp;vehicles used the highway daily in Suttons Bay and 2,931&nbsp;vehicles did so each day near the western terminus, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning<U+200E> |url= http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |year= 2008 |accessdate= June 30, 2012}}</ref> No section of M-204 is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |title= National Highway System, Michigan |date= April 23, 2006 |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |cartography= MDOT |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= October 7, 2008}}</ref> a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |last= Adderley |first= Kevin |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/ |title= The National Highway System |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= August 26, 2010 |accessdate= January 1, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
M-204 was first designated on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road.<ref name=ROW-L>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Right-of-Way Maps for Leelanau County |at= Sheets 43-1 through 45A |month= July |year= 2005}}</ref> The highway was paved by the middle of 1936.<ref name=MSHD36-06>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1936 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= June&nbsp;1, 1936 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= F8<U+2013>F9 }}</ref> The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of [[Lake Leelanau]] in the village of the same name.<ref name=ROW-L43-3>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Right-of-Way Maps for Leelanau County |at= Sheet 43-3 |month= July |year= 2005}}</ref> Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a curve in the road.<ref name=ROW-L44>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Right-of-Way Maps for Leelanau County |at= Sheet 44 |month= July |year= 2005}}</ref> A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau.<ref name=ROW-L43-2>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Right-of-Way Maps for Leelanau County |at= Sheet 43-2 |month= July |year= 2005}}</ref> The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway.
