'''''The Amber Witch''''' is an [[opera]] four acts composed by [[William Vincent Wallace]] to an English [[libretto]] by [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]]. It premiered at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London on 28 February 1861 conducted by [[Charles Hall<U+00E9>]].<ref>Beale (2007) p. 126</ref> The libretto was based on a story by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold, ''Maria Schweidler die Bernsteinhexe'', which had been translated into English and published in 1846 as ''[[The Amber Witch]]''. Wallace considered it his best work,<ref>Flood (1912) p. 28</ref> but it met with only mixed success. After its run at Her Majesty's Theatre, it transferred to the [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]], with several member of the original cast, including [[Charles Santley]]. Santley recalled in his memoirs that although ''The Amber Witch'' contained some fine music, it played to nearly empty houses at Drury Lane.<ref>Santley (1892/2008) p. 189</ref> Like most of Wallace's operas, it sank into obscurity, although Mary's aria "My Long Hair Is Braided" was a popular concert piece.

The opera is set in 17th century Germany during [[The Thirty Years War]] and tells the story of Mary, the "Amber Witch" of the title, and the daughter of the local pastor. She has discovered a vein of [[amber]] in the mountains outside her village. She uses it to buy food and clothes for the starving villagers, but tells no one of the source of her apparent wealth. Count Rudiger of Ravenstein falls in love with her and woos her disguised as a peasant. However, the local Commandant is also in love with her. When Mary spurns his affections for Rudiger, he contrives with the aid of his jealous servant Elsie to have Mary accused of witchcraft and imprisoned. After many vicissitudes, Count Rudiger rescues Mary as she is about to be burnt at the stake, Elsie dies of after taking poison, and the Commandant is banished.
