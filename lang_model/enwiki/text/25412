'''Sidney Luckman''', known as '''Sid Luckman''',  ([[November 21]] [[1916]] <U+2013> [[July 5]] [[1998]]) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Chicago Bears]] from 1939 to 1950. During his 12&nbsp;seasons with the Bears he led them to four NFL [[List of NFL champions|championships]].

==Early life==
Luckman was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], to [[Jewish]] [[immigrants]] from [[Germany]]. His father sparked his interest in American football at age eight, by giving him a football to play with.<ref name="GreatJewsinSport">{{cite web

He played both [[baseball]] and football for [[Erasmus Hall High School]], with his football skills impressing recruiters from about 40&nbsp;colleges.<ref name="NYT"/>  Luckman chose [[Columbia University]] after meeting Lions coach [[Lou Little]] during a Columbia/[[Navy]] game at the university's [[Columbia_University#Athletics|Baker Field athletic facility]].<ref name="Columbia250">{{cite web

}}</ref>  Despite being sought after by numerous colleges, Columbia never offered Luckman a scholarship.  The university did however provide him with opportunities to work so that he could pay his own way through college.  Sid, keen to remain in Columbia to stay close to his family, took on jobs such as dish-washing, baby-sitting, and messenger delivery around the campus.<ref name="JewsinSport2"/>  At Columbia, as a part of the football team, he completed 180&nbsp;of 376&nbsp;passes for 2,413&nbsp;yards and 20&nbsp;touchdowns and finished third in the 1938 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting, behind [[Davey O'Brien]] and [[Marshall Goldberg]].<ref name="Columbia250"/>

==Chicago Bears==
[[Image:1946Bears.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chicago Bears]]' 1946 team &ndash; Luckman is second row from bottom &ndash; fifth from the right]]
===Draft===
Hearing of Sid Luckman's exploits as a [[Single-wing formation|single-wing]] [[Running back#Halfback/tailback|tailback]] at [[Columbia University]], Chicago Bears owner and [[coach (sport)|coach]] [[George Halas]] believed Luckman had the ability to become an effective T-formation quarterback, and traveled to New York to watch him play. Halas then convinced the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to draft Luckman second overall and then trade him to the Bears because he was interested in using Luckman's skills to help him restructure the offensive side of the game.<ref name="Slater 189">Slater, Robert, 2003, p.&nbsp;189.</ref>  However, despite his successes at Columbia University, Luckman initially declined any further interest in pro football, instead preferring to work for his father-in-law<U+2019>s trucking company.<ref name="ColumbiaHOF"/> Halas went to work on convincing him otherwise.<ref name="ColumbiaHOF"/><ref name="Slater 189"/> After gaining an invitation to Luckman's tiny apartment for a dinner which Luckman's wife Estelle prepared, Halas produced a contract for $5,500 which Luckman immediately signed.<ref name="NYT"/>  At that time both at the college and pro levels, offenses were a drab scrum of running the ball with only occasional passes. In what was then the predominant [[single-wing]] formation, the quarterback was primarily a blocking back and rarely touched the ball. Most passing was done by the tailback, and then usually only on third down with long yardage to go. Halas and his coaches, primarily [[Clark Shaughnessy]], invented a rather complex scheme building on the traditional [[T-formation]], but needed the right quarterback to run it properly.<ref>Slater, Robert, 2003, p.&nbsp;189&ndash;190.</ref>

Upon starting with Halas, Luckman mastered an offense that revolutionized football, and became the basis of most modern professional offenses.<ref>Slater, Robert, 2003, p.&nbsp;190.</ref> Eventually, Luckman tutored college coaches across the [[Big Ten]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] and [[West Point]] in the intricacies of the passing game.<ref name="AJHS"/>

===T-formation===
[[Image:T Formation.PNG|thumb|right|A common type of T-Formation]]
In 1940, during his second season with the Bears, Luckman took over the offense and led the Bears to the [[1940_NFL_season#NFL_Championship_Game|title game]] against [[Sammy Baugh]] and the Redskins. The Redskins had beaten the Bears 7<U+2013>3 during the regular season. Using the "man-in-motion" innovation to great advantage, the Bears destroyed the Redskins 73<U+2013>0, stated to be ''the most one-sided game in the history of the sport''.<ref name="One-Sided">{{cite web
 | url = http://www.jewsinsports.org/Publication.asp?titleID=3&current_page=274
 | title = Luckman, Sid, p.274
 | publisher = jewsinsports.org
 | accessdate = 2008-08-19
}}</ref> Luckman passed only six times, with four completions and 102 yards in the rout. From 1940 to 1946 the Bears displayed their dominance in the game, playing in five NFL championship games, winning four, and posted a 54<U+2013>17<U+2013>3 regular season record. In 1942, the Bears posted a perfect 11<U+2013>0&nbsp;record and outscored their opponents 376<U+2013>84, however they lost the championship game to the Redskins.<ref name="perfect"> The Bears were denied perfect seasons on two accounts. The first one was in the [[1934 Chicago Bears season|1934]] when the 13-0 club lost to the [[New York Giants]] in the Championship game. The second occurrence happened in [[1942 Chicago Bears season|1942]] when the 11-0 club was denied perfection and a "three-peat" by the [[Washington Redskins]]. See [[Chicago Bears seasons]] for full list</ref> Although the T-formation had been used many years before Luckman joined the Chicago Bears, he was central to Chicago's successful use of this style of play because of his game-sense and versality.<ref name="NYT"/> Perfecting Halas' complex offensive scheme of fakes, men in motion, and quick hitting runs, Luckman added the dimension of accurate downfield throwing. He was instrumental in his team's record-setting 73&ndash;0 over the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1940|1940 NFL championship game]]. Sportscaster [[Jimmy Cannon]] once said in reference to Luckman's years at Columbia, "You had to be there to realize how great Sid was."<ref name="Columbia250"/> Luckman later became a sought-after tutor and instructor for universities wishing to install the T-formation as an offense.<ref name="Columbia250"/>

===Service with the Merchant Marines===
In 1943, as soon as the season had ended, Luckman volunteered as an [[ensign]] with the [[U. S. Merchant Marine]]. He was stationed stateside and whilst he could not practice with the team, he did receive permission to play for the Bears on game days during the following seasons. He returned again to the Bears, as a full-time occupation, in 1946 and led them to a fifth NFL championship.<ref name="AJHS"/>

===Numbers and accomplishments===
During his career, Luckman completed 51.8% of his passes for 14,686&nbsp;yards and 137&nbsp;touchdowns with 134&nbsp;interceptions.<ref name="SidStats"/> He averaged 8.4 yards per attempt,<ref name="SidStats"/> second all-time only to Otto Graham (8.6). His career touchdown rate (percentage of pass attempts that result in touchdowns) of 7.9%<ref name="SidStats"/> is easily the best in history. In [[1943]], Luckman completed 110 of 202&nbsp;passes for 2194&nbsp;yards and 28&nbsp;touchdowns.<ref name="SidStats"/> His 13.9% touchdown rate that year is the best ever in a single-season, while his 10.9&nbsp;yards per attempt is second all-time. During one game that year, Luckman threw for 443&nbsp;yards and seven [[touchdowns]], still tied for the most passing touchdowns in one game; it was also the first 400-yard passing game in NFL history. Luckman led the NFL in yards per attempt an NFL record seven times, including a record five consecutive years from 1939&nbsp;to&nbsp;1943, and led the NFL in passing yards three times. Luckman was a five-time All-NFL selection, was named the National Football League's Most Valuable Player Award in 1943, and led the "Monsters of the Midway" to championships in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946. Despite the fact that his career ended in 1950, Luckman still owns most major Bears' passing records, including career yards and touchdowns.<ref name="Columbia250"/>
