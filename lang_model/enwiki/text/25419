==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
''R. plebeiana'' is in the ''Vespidae'' family along with thousands of other wasp species. The genus, ''[[Ropalidia]]'', is typically made up of wasps that live in tropical locations, but ''R. plebeiana'' is the exception. The genus, ''Ropalidia'' is classified as brown paper wasps. Although ''R. plebeiana'' does not yet have a place within the taxonomy of the ''Ropalidia'' family, it has been discovered to be closely related to ''R. proletaria''.<ref name=Saito>{{cite journal|last=Saito|first=Fuki|title=Taxonomy and biogeography of Australian species of the Ropalidia stigma group and R. variegata group (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal=Entomological Science|date=June 2005|volume=8|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2005.00111.x/full|issue=2}}</ref>

==Description and identification==
''R. plebeiana'' is a white faced, brown paper wasp. It is a medium size paper wasp, with a reddish brown colored body. There are small, thin white rings on its shoulders, waist, and abdomen.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_vespoidwasps/BrownPaperWasp3.htm|title = White-faced Brown Paper Wasp - Ropalidia plebeiana|date = August 1, 2012|accessdate = October 12, 2014|website = Brisbane Insects and Spiders|publisher = |last = Chew|first = Peter}}</ref>

Nests of ''R. plebeiana'' are seen as a horizontal single comb with an irregular shape, and they are grayish brown in color.<ref name=Ito-Y>{{cite journal|last=Ito|first=Yosiaki|title=Social Behavior of an Australian Paper Wasp, Ropalidia plebeiana, with Special Reference to the Process of Acceptance of an Alien Female|journal=Journal of Ethology|date=June 1985|volume=3|url= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02348162|issue=1}}</ref> Nests have been found to have 1-3 males and anywhere from 13-28 females.<ref name=Kojima/> ''R. plebeiana'' nests have been found to have about 40 cells, which have transparent windows, with about 20 [[larvae]] and eggs at any point. The central cells of the nest are where the [[cocoons]] and larvae are found, and these cells are usually longer than the peripheral cells that contain eggs. The nests are seen to congregate together in central areas in a <U+201C>city<U+201D> type atmosphere.<ref name=Ito-Y/> Cooperation has been witnessed between different nest combs, and each separate nest comb is occupied by a single [[colony]].<ref name=Saito-F>{{cite journal|last=Saito|first=Fuki|title=Colony cycle in the south-eastern coastal populations of Ropalidia plebeiana, the only Ropalidia wasp occurring in temperate Australia|journal= Entomological Science |date=September 2005|volume=8|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2005.00125.x/full|issue=3}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''R. plebeiana'' is widely distributed in Australia.<ref name=Kojima/> It can be found in New South Wales, or [[Canberra]] in this country. They are also found in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], and this is considered to be the northern boundary of the species distribution.<ref name=Ito-Y/> ''R. plebeiana'' can be found in tropical highland areas as well, such as the [[Atherton Tableland]].<ref name=Saito-F/>

''R. plebeiana'' builds has been known for building its nest in aggregrations, which are often formed under bridges and under overhanging rocks. These aggregations are made of separate nests that are built side by side. They were often built over running water.<ref name=Fukuda>{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Hirokazu|title=Size-dependent reproductive dominance in foundresses of Ropalidia plebeiana, an Australian paper wasp forming nest aggregations (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal= Entomological Science |date=December 2003|volume=6|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1343-8786.2003.00025.x/full|issue=4}}</ref>''R. plebeiana'' with nests in Canberra are not aggregated.<ref name=Kojima/>

==Colony cycle==
''R. plebeiana'' colonies have a single top-dominant female, or they are started by one or more foundresses that then compete for egg laying duties. ''R. plebeiana'' colonies start in early spring, or mid to late August in Australia. The first [[brood]] of workers emerge as adults in mid-December. Reproductive females and males present in early March, and the females may become the foundresses of nests. They are called [[gynes]]. Gynes do not stay in the nest after they emerge as adults, but may spend their winters in their maternal nests.<ref name=Saito-F/><ref name=Yamane>{{cite journal|last=Yamane|first=Soichi|title=Population consequences of huge nesting aggregations of Ropalidia plebeiana (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal= Researches on Population Ecology|date=December 1988|volume=30|url= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02513250|issue=2}}</ref> Most wasps were gone from the nest by early May, and this ends the reproductive stage of the nest. Most females leave the nest by May 1. Founding females in the nests do not stay in the nest overnight, and before dusk they leave the nest for the night. Females returned to the nest when the sun heated up the nest, and began their activities. These patterns of leaving and returning depend on the temperature of the nest.<ref name=Saito-F/>

==Nesting patterns==

===Occupying Old Nests===
Nests maintain their structural integrity over the winter months because they are hidden from the elements, and top dominant females sometimes occupy previously occupied nests.<ref name=Saito-F/> They may return to the nests of their mothers to start their own colony there or with up to 10 other females. If this is the case, the foundresses divide the comb into their own nesting areas. They then fight to be the sole foundress and egg layer. Other females may remain as subordinate workers. The first brood females were larger than non laying foundresses in the nest.<ref name= Fukuda/> Occupying an old nest has advantages, because females do not feed to forage for nesting materials, and they can spend nights and cold days in the places between the nests in aggregations. The competition for these old nests is fierce, and early females have the advantage. Females may lose the competition to be egg-layers at a nest, but may remain in the nest to get the benefit of fitness through relatives kin or by creating their own nests nearby, adding to the nest aggregation.<ref name=Saito-F/>

===Multi-foundress nests===
Foundresses have developed [[ovaries]] with [[oocytes]], and those with only slightly developed [[ovarioles]] are non laying foundresses. Foundresses had fresh wings and [[mandibles]], whereas other females (the non-laying foundresses) had worn-out, shorter wings and mandibles. The length of the largest body mass of the wasp, the [[mesosoma]], is greater in multi-female colonies than other colonies. Solitary laying foundresses were smaller than those of multi-female colonies. Once the dominance hierarchy of the foundresses has occurred, monopoliziation of the oviposition by a single foundress occurs. There can be more than one laying foundress in colonies with more than 20 foundresses. Single foundress colonies were more common in newly constructed nests.<ref name=Fukuda/>

===Aggregations===
The nests in an aggregation are suspended side by side. They are suspended in a horizontal position from whatever they are nesting against, but older nests may be suspended vertically. New nests form mainly along the edge of aggregations.<ref name= Yamane/> ''R. plebeiana'' nest aggregations can persist for up to 15 years. In aggregations of ''R. plebeiana'', each comb is independent nest that is occupied by residential females. There is rarely drift between the different nests, and aliens to the nest were expelled and attacked.<ref name=Ito/>

===Costs and benefits of aggregations===
Survival rate of nests in aggregation are very high, over 90%. The main pros of aggregating are high survival rates of nests and high reproductive rates for females. However, overexploitation of food sources such as insects may occur, so foraging trips may need to be at locations farther away from the nests. Possible reasons for aggregation are based on cooperation or the selfish herd effect. Also, the whole colony together may act as a communal defense against predators. There are risks however, because if a new nest joins the aggregation and does not play a role in this defense, they could increase their fitness at the expense of everyone else. The factors regulating the aggregations in these areas as forest fires, which could destroy a whole aggregation, the collapse of the cliffs they are built on, and possible attacks by predators.<ref name=Yamane/>

==Behavior==

===Dominant behavior===
In ''R. plebeiana'', the regular nestmates do not direct any dominance or aggressive acts. Some dominance acts that the top dominant female conducted were <U+201C>dart at another but stop short.<U+201D> They also attack new wasps coming to the nest. The top dominant female can mount the new wasps body and tried to sting them repeatedly in order to get them to leave the nest. The attacked wasp made a particular posture when attacked, tried to integrate into the nest, and successfully did so.<ref name=Ito-Y/> Sometimes, when females land on strange combs in a nest aggregation, they immediately leave without being attacked.<ref name=Ito/> Other dominance acts exhibited by females were pecking, mounting, and biting. Sometimes these fights resulted in a loss of wing ability.<ref name=Saito-F/>

===Foraging===
In ''R. plebeiana'', females, not males are the ones who [[forage]] for the food for larvae. Females also forage for plant fibers for nest construction. The top dominant female does not forage directly for insect meat, the other females do.<ref name=Kojima/> On foraging trips, these females get solid food, honey, water, or pulp for the nest.<ref name=Ito-Y/> Sometimes however, the females give the flesh pellets they accumulate while foraging to the top-dominant female, who passes these pellets onto the males. In this way, both males and females do the feeding. Flesh pellets are shared with individuals back at the nest upon return, and they are particularly often shared with males. Males do not solicit prey-laden females for these pellets, but they are given to them.<ref name=Kojima/>

===Feeding===
Food for larvae is typically insects. Food is brought back to the nests by females, and then distributed. The period of [[malaxation]] for females is generally much shorter than males, about 30 seconds, and then they feed several larvae with a single flesh pellet. Males on the other hand can chew for a couple of minutes, approximately 3<U+2013>4 minutes, and then feed only one mature larva during a feeding episode. This larval feeding by males means they are extracting liquid from the food, possibly to get rid of the pellet after this extraction. However, males of ''R. plebeiana'' were not observed to get rid of pellets, so further research needs to be conducted.<ref name=Kojima/>

===Female behavior===
In ''R. plebeiana'', specifically in aggregations of nests, females were observed to have specific behaviors when in their individual nests. Females repeatedly stick their head into larval cells and vibrate their heads in the cell. This behavior was observed as a way for the females to check on the larvae. Females were also observed to <U+201C>kiss<U+201D> for the sake of transferring food or liquid between different members of the nest. When the regular females the top dominant female kissed, the top dominant female got the larger part of the food.  Females also <U+201C>kissed<U+201D> males in order to pass food along to them, so that they could also feed the larvae.<ref name=Ito-Y/>
