Versace grew up in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and attended Gonzaga College High School in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He joined the [[U.S. Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. As had his father before him, Versace entered the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy West Point]]. He graduated in 1959 and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] of [[Armoured forces|Armor]] in the U.S. Army.<ref name=TouchtheWall>{{cite web |url=http://www.touchthewall.org/Rocky.html

He was a member of [[Ranger School|Ranger]] Class 4-60 and was awarded the [[Ranger Tab]] on [[December 18]], [[1959]]. Upon graduation from [[Ranger School]], Capt. Versace attended [[Airborne School]] and was awarded the parachutist badge. He then served with 3rd Battalion, 40th Armor, [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] in the [[Republic of Korea]] as an [[M48 Patton#The M48|M-48 tank]] [[platoon leader]] from March 1960 to April 1961. Captain Versace was then assigned to the [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment (TOG)|3d U.S. Infantry (Old Guard)]], where he served as a tank platoon leader in Headquarters and  Headquarters Company. After volunteering for duty in Vietnam, he  attended the Military Assistance Institute, the Intelligence course at [[Fort Holabird]], Maryland, and the USACS Vietnamese language Course at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].<ref name=Vogel2001>{{cite news|url=http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html

==Vietnam War==
On [[May 12]], [[1962]], Versace began his first tour of duty in the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] as an intelligence advisor. In May 1963 he volunteered for a six month's extension of his tour, planning to attend seminary at the conclusion of his service and join the Catholic priesthood, hoping to return to Vietnam as a missionary working with orphans.<ref name=VersacePlaza>{{cite web

Less than two weeks before the end of his tour, on [[October 29]], [[1963]], while acting as intelligence advisor to Detachment 25, [[5th Special Forces Group]] in the [[Mekong Delta]], Versace accompanied several companies of South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense ([[Civilian Irregular Defense Group|CIDG]]) troops who had planned to remove a [[Viet Cong]] (VC) command post located in the U Minh Forest, a Viet Cong stronghold. A VC Main Force battalion ambushed and overran Versace's unit, wounding him in the process.  He was able to provide enough covering fire so that the CIDG forces could withdraw from the killing zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html

Upon learning of their son's fate, Marie Teresa Rios Versace and her husband, Colonel Versace, tried to find out what they could about the circumstances. She went to Paris in the late 1960s, trying unsuccessfully to see the North Vietnamese delegation as it arrived for peace talks. Rios Versace expressed her frustration and anguish in poems.<ref name=Vogel2002>{{cite news |url=http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html

Nominations to award Versace the Medal of Honor were initiated in 1969, but the nomination failed and he was posthumously awarded the [[Silver Star]] instead. The quest for a Medal of Honor for Versace languished until the "Friends of Rocky Versace" reinitiated the crusade once more in 1999. Language added by Congress in the 2002 Defense Authorization Act ended the standoff and authorized the award of the nation's highest military decoration for combat valor to Versace.<ref name=Sorokin2002>{{cite news|url=http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html

Bush]] for his heroism, the first time an Army POW had been awarded the nation's highest honor for actions in captivity. Present were his surviving siblings, Dr. Stephen Versace, [[Dick Versace|Richard]] (former coach of the [[Indiana Pacers]]), Michael and Trilby Versace.<ref name=MOH_PresidentRemarks>{{cite web |url=http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html

:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while a prisoner of war during the period of [[29 October]] [[1963]] to [[26 September]] [[1965]] in the Republic of Vietnam. While accompanying a Civilian Irregular Defense Group patrol engaged in combat operations in Thoi Binh District, An Xuyen Province, Republic of Vietnam on [[29 October]] [[1963]], Captain Versace and the CIDG assault force were caught in an ambush from intense [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[small arms]] fire from elements of a reinforced enemy Main Force battalion. As the battle raged, Captain Versace fought valiantly and encouraged his CIDG patrol to return fire against overwhelming enemy forces. He provided covering fire from an exposed position to enable friendly forces to withdraw from the killing zone when it was apparent that their position would be overrun, and was severely wounded in the knee and back from automatic weapons fire and [[shrapnel]]. He stubbornly resisted capture with the last full measure of his strength and ammunition. Taken prisoner by the Viet Cong, he demonstrated exceptional leadership and resolute adherence to the tenets of the Code of Conduct from the time he entered into a prisoner of war status. Captain Versace assumed command of his fellow American prisoners, and despite being kept locked in irons in an isolation box, raised their morale by singing messages to popular songs of the day, and leaving inspiring messages at the latrine. Within three weeks of captivity, and despite the severity of his untreated wounds, he attempted the first of four escape attempts by dragging himself on his hands and knees out of the camp through dense swamp and forbidding vegetation to freedom. Crawling at a very slow pace due to his weakened condition, the guards quickly discovered him outside the camp and recaptured him. Captain Versace scorned the enemy's exhaustive interrogation and indoctrination efforts, and inspired his fellow prisoners to resist to the best of their ability. When he used his Vietnamese language skills to protest improper treatment of the American prisoners by the guards, he was put into leg irons and gagged to keep his protestations out of earshot of the other American prisoners in the camp. The last time that any of his fellow prisoners heard from him, Captain Versace was singing God Bless America at the top of his voice from his isolation box. Unable to break his indomitable will, his faith in God, and his trust in the United States of America and his fellow prisoners, Captain Versace was executed by the Viet Cong on [[26 September]] [[1965]]. Captain Versaces extraordinary heroism, self-sacrifice, and personal bravery involving conspicuous risk of life above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army, and reflect great credit to himself and the U.S. Armed Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/citations_1960_vn/versace.htm
