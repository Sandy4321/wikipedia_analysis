"'''The Harrowing'''" is the sixth and final episode of the first series of [[British dark comedy]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Inside No. 9]]''. It aired on 12 March 2014 on [[BBC Two]]. The episode was written by [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], and stars Shearsmith, [[Aimee-Ffion Edwards]], [[Helen McCrory]], [[Poppy Rush]] and [[Sean Buckley (actor)|Sean Buckley]]. While comedic in places, "The Harrowing" makes extensive use of [[gothic horror]] elements transmuted into a modern context. The plot follows Katy (Edwards), who has been hired to housesit for eccentric siblings Hector (Shearsmith) and Tabitha (McCrory). They rarely leave the house, but have an event to attend. They tell Katy about their bedridden, disabled brother Andras (Buckley), who cannot speak but will ring a bell if he needs assistance. Katy is joined by her friend Shell (Rush) once Hector and Tabitha leave, and, upon hearing Andras's bell, the pair reluctantly head upstairs. The episode takes place in Hector and Tabitha's mansion, which is kept deliberately cold and filled with paintings depicting Hell. The writers experimented with a variety of possible endings, hoping to make the episode's close both interesting and scary.

Critics agreed that the episode was the most gothic and scary of the series, with journalists writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' saying that "The Harrowing" would be best avoided by those of a nervous disposition. Critics writing in the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' felt that the episode was a poor finale for the series, and that the episode's ending was unsatisfying. By contrast, Alex Hoskins, writing for the ''[[Cheddar Valley Gazette]]'', felt the episode's ending was very strong, and [[Bruce Dessau]] described "The Harrowing" as an excellent end to the series. On its first showing, the episode was watched by 833,000 people, which was 4.7% of the audience. Due in part to her appearance, Edwards was nominated for a "Daffta" award.

==Production==
[[File:Reece Shearsmith.jpg|thumb|left|Shearsmith ''(pictured in 2003)'' co-wrote "The Harrowing" and starred as Hector]]
Writers [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], who had previously worked together on ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' and ''[[Psychoville]]'', took inspiration for ''Inside No. 9'' from "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of ''Psychoville''. This episode, in turn, was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. "David and Maureen" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9, TV review: A top-drawer cast puts these twisted tales in a league of their own|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/inside-no-9-tv-review-a-topdrawer-cast-puts-these-twisted-tales-in-a-league-of-their-own-9110196.html|author= Dean, Will|date= 5 February 2014|accessdate= 6 February 2014|newspaper= [[The Independent]]}}</ref> At the same time, the concept of ''Inside No. 9'' was a "reaction" to ''Psychoville'', with Shearsmith saying that "We'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week."<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9, BBC2|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/inside-no-9-bbc2/5059391.article|newspaper= [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date= 22 August 2013|accessdate= 6 February 2014}} {{subscription needed}}</ref> As an [[anthology series]] with [[Horror film|horror]] themes, ''Inside No. 9'' also pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9: How Shearsmith and Pemberton have revived a lost genre|author= Lawson, Mark|url= http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/feb/05/inside-no-9-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton|date= 5 February 2014|accessdate= 6 February 2014|publisher= [[theguardian.com]]}}</ref>

This route, Shearsmith suggested, has now become atypical.<ref name="Interview"/> The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror,<ref name="Cheddar"/> sometimes for comedic effect (a reference to "something called broadbands"),<ref name="Cheddar"/> and sometimes to add to the horror (mobile phones cannot be used, as the characters are in a "dead zone").<ref name="Dessau"/> While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality, they also wanted to make more use of gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of ''Inside No. 9''.<ref name="Interview"/><ref name="PopMatters">{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/180233-inside-no.-9-series-one/|title= 'Inside No. 9' is a bit like a box of chocolates, albeit one full of dark, bitter sweets|work= [[PopMatters]]|author=Upton, David|date= 26 March 2014|accessdate= 21 April 2014}}</ref> "The Harrowing" was advertised with a [[film poster|poster]] homage to classic horror films.

The character Katy is initially hired to babysit, though it turns out that there is no baby.<ref name="Sunday Times"/> Previous horror films, including ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'', have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and [[The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs|an urban legend]] involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary.<ref name="Interview"/>

Katy has been hired to take care of Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy at the door and explains that the house is always kept at <U+2212>3&nbsp;<U+00B0>C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.

Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, especially when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's [[stairlift]], sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's [[Party line (telephony)|party line]] is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.

Katy and Shell explore and enter Hector's bedroom, where they find a circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's deformed body is revealed; he is tied to the bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' and explain that [[Hell]] is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.

Tabitha and Hector prepare to inject Katy with a sedative, but she fights back. She runs downstairs only to find that the door is locked. Shell arrives and says that Katy cannot escape. Shell says she wanted to be Castiel's new human host, but she is too weak, whereas Katy has the strength of character needed to keep the demon contained. Shell injects Katy, who collapses. Upstairs, Hector strips Katy and ties her to a chair, while Tabitha feeds Andras his "last supper": [[rusk]]s and baby milk, the only food he can manage. Hector, Tabitha and Shell leave Katy to become acquainted with Castiel, who, they say, will possess her as Andras dies. Andras advances on Katy as she screams.

Concerning the comedic elements of "The Harrowing", ''Sunday Times'' critics said that "comedy doesn't come blacker than this".<ref name="Sunday Times"/> Jack Seale, of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', said that viewers would "marvel at how [the writers could] pepper the elegant script with gags without breaking the spell".<ref name="Seale"/> Dessau also felt that the script was "great", and commented on a "particularly plithy" joke, "just when you least expect it".<ref name="Dessau"/> Nick Rutherford and Keith Watson, writing for the ''Metro'', downplayed the comedy of the episode, saying that "the odd defiantly bad joke ... pierced the darkness".<ref name="Metro"/> They felt that "The Harrowing" was a weak instalment of ''Inside No. 9'', giving it three out of five stars. The ending, these critics suggested, was "a bit of a cop out" rather than "daring". For them, unlike in other ''Inside No. 9'' scripts, there was no twist.<ref name="Metro"/> Alex Hoskins, writing for the ''Cheddar Valley Gazette'', acknowledged that the "ending will most likely have sparked an online outcry", but felt that "it was fantastic, fearless and a perfect end to [the] series".<ref name="Cheddar"/> Dessau shared a positive view, saying that the series ended "on an absolute high", with one of his favourite episodes.<ref name="Dessau"/>

"The Harrowing" was watched by 833,000 people, which was 4.7% of the audience.
