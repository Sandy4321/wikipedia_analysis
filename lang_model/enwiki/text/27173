'''Ezra Ray Johnson''' (born October 2, 1955 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]) is a retired [[American football]] [[defensive end]] who played for the [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Houston Oilers]] in a fifteen-year career that lasted from 1977 to 1991 in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

A first-round pick from [[Morris Brown College]] by the Green Bay Packers in 1977, Johnson was known as one of the best defensive linemen in his first few years in the league. He clinched a spot in the [[Pro Bowl]] after leading the league with 20.5 [[Sack (football)|sacks]] in 1978. However by 1981, Johnson's career was marred by a series of back injuries and allegations of his lack of discipline on the field, including one incident in which he ate a hot dog while sitting on the bench during a preseason game, and being inconsistent at times.<ref name="consistency">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2sUVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6xEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6562,491890&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Is Ezra on the Bench?|last=Salituro|first=Chuck|date=September 1, 1981|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=9|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> He lost and regained his starting job multiple times during that period.

Johnson was exclusively used as the third-down pass rush specialist after 1986, and took a leadership role with the team. He was released by the Packers in 1988 and played with two seasons with the Colts, and one with the Oilers before retiring in 1991. Despite his adverse relationship with the team at times, Johnson was elected to the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

==College career==
Johnson played college football at [[Morris Brown College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In his last year at Morris Brown he had 112 [[tackle (football move)#American and Canadian football|tackle]]s and 28 sacks.<ref name="earlycollegeinfo1">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SWIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eykEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3672,3974938&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Packers Johnson Makes Adjustment|last=Kupper|first=Mike|date=August 26, 1977|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=16|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> However his size and the small school he played for helped lower his draft stock.<ref name="earlycollegeinfo1"/> He was projected to go anywhere from the first to fourth rounds prior to the [[NFL Draft]].<ref name="projectdraft">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2sUVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6xEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6562,491890&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Packers Go for Defense|last=Hofmann|first=Dale|date=May 4, 1977|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|pages=11, 13|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>

==NFL career==

===Green Bay Packers===
Johnson was drafted as the 28th pick of the first round in the [[1977 NFL Draft]] by the Green Bay Packers.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnEz00.htm?redir|title=Ezra Johnson NFL Football Statistics|work=Pro-Football Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC./USA Today|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> Johnson was considered a "gamble pick" for the Packers because of lack of major college experience and his relatively small size for a defensive end.<ref name="projectdraft"/> In his rookie season, Johnson appeared in 14 games as the backup for [[Alden Roche]] at defensive end. Johnson significantly improved in his second year, becoming one of the top defensive ends in the league with his size and speed, a 4.5 in the [[40-yard dash]], being the main factors for his success.<ref name="seahawks78">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sHlQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8hEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2293,2981328&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Johnson had Another Big Day in the Pit.|last=Lea|first=Bud|date=October 16, 1978|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=11|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> He thrived on the Packers [[4<U+2013>3 defense]], and recorded 14 [[Quarterback sack|sacks]] by the eighth game of the season.<ref name="seahawks78"/> Johnson had two sacks and forced two fumbles in a 45&ndash;28 win against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on October 16, 1978. At that time, the Packers had the best record in the NFC Central at 6&ndash;1.<ref name="seahawks78"/> By the end of the year, Johnson recorded an unofficial 20.5 sacks, a statistic used, but not kept, by the NFL until 1982.<ref name="losingjob">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rlYaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vCkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4819,267365&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Upset|last=Salituro|first=Chuck|date=October 1, 1981|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=29|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> However, the Packers offense were among the worst in the league, and the team lost a chance for a playoff berth in the final game of the season against the Los Angeles Rams.<ref name="playoff">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=suMdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mCkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3810,5293883&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Packers Finally Done In By Their Offense|last=Begel|first=Dave|date=December 18, 1978|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=9|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> Johnson was rewarded for his efforts by being selected to play in the [[Pro Bowl]] and was rewarded with the Packers Defensive Player of the Year award.<ref name="stats"/><ref name="playerofyearP">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lYNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8BEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6562,5319961&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Johnson and Middleton to be feted|date=January 30, 1979|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=9|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>

In 1979, Johnson missed seven games early in the season because of a sprained left ankle.<ref name="ankle1979">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y4BQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BhIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2080,2653537&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Johnson discovers that boxing is no soft touch.|last=Christopulos|first=Mike|date=November 14, 1979|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> On his return against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on November 11, he sacked [[quarterback]] [[Tommy Kramer]] four times in a 19<U+2013>7 win.<ref name="returnfrominjury">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yYBQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BhIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3879,2163858&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=The sack is back for the Packers as Johnson returns to the lineup.|last=Feuerherd|first=Vic|date=November 12, 1979|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=11|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> During that period, Johnson teamed up with fellow first-round pick [[Mike Butler (American football)|Mike Butler]] to form one of the league's most potent defensive lineups.<ref name="hotdog">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzUqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=visEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2231,3605858&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Johnson stands out as living symbol of Packers' resurgence.|last=Begel|first=Dave|date=November 27, 1980|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=24|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> Nicknamed the "Gang Green", they became known for their ability to pressure the quarterback to force a sack.<ref name="returnfrominjury"/>

Prior to the start to the 1980 season, Johnson was notoriously [[fine (penalty)|fined]] $1,000 and required by then-[[general manager]]-[[head coach]] [[Bart Starr]] to apologize for eating a [[hot dog]] on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of a 38&ndash;0 Packers' home preseason loss to the [[Denver Broncos]] on August 30, 1980.<ref name="hotdog"/> Starr gave Johnson back the $1,000 at the end of the year.<ref name="consistency"/> However, defensive line coach [[Fred von Appen]] [[resignation|resigned]] five days after the incident because Starr refused to suspend Johnson.<ref name="hotdog"/><ref name="development">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7R8qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ByoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6611,3802715&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra, Butler Predict Big Year|last=Salituro|first=Chuck|date=July 28, 1981|work=The Milwaukee Journal|pages=8<U+2013>9|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> He started in all 15 games that season, as the Packers finished with a 5&ndash;10&ndash;1 record.<ref name="stats"/>  After the season, Johnson and Butler were both criticized for not playing up to the Packers expectations when they drafted them. One journalist stated that their development was halted because of a lack of stability in the Green Bay coaching situation, who went though four defensive line coaches in three years.<ref name="development"/>

In 1981, Johnson lost his starting role to [[Casey Merrill]] as the Packers had changed to a [[3<U+2013>4 defense|3<U+2013>4 defensive scheme]], and decided instead to use Johnson exclusively for pass rushing situations.<ref name="unhappy">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0NQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4525,1751688&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Unhappy Johnson says he should be starting|last=Christopulos|first=Mike|date=November 11, 1981|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|pages=10, 12|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref> It was a decision which confused the local media as Johnson had been the starter since 1978. Merrill, who was released by the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[Waivers (American football)|claimed off waivers]] by the Packers, was considered by the team as the better, more consistent interior lineman against the run.<ref name="consistency"/><ref name="losingjob"/> The Packers claimed Johnson lost his job because of his lack of "size" and low upside.<ref name="losingjob"/> However, during the preseason, many people within the Packers organization "questioned" Johnson's desire to play and his attitude, an allegation Johnson quickly denied.<ref name="losingjob"/> He also was fined by Starr an unknown amount of money for almost missing a team flight to New York after celebrating his birthday the previous night, misplacing his car keys.<ref name="unhappy"/> He only started three games that season.<ref name="stats"/>

By 1982, Johnson regained his starting job over Merrill. [[Defensive coordinator]] [[John Meyer (American football)|John Meyer]] stated that Johnson was "playing his best football" since his breakout 1978 season.<ref name="bestinyears">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cmwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6SkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6615,4068800&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Packers say Ezra will start|last=Salituro|first=Chuck|date=August 27, 1982|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=16|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> Johnson stated that "eating his mother's cooking" and being "healthy" were the main reasons for his improvement.<ref name="bestinyears"/> He signed a three-year contract with the Packers at $450,000 a year. It led to a lawsuit against his former agency [[Bradcor Sports Servicing]], who claimed that he never gave the agency their commission.<ref name="suedcontract">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6GIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5SkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7011,838492&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Johnson sued by sports agency.|date=March 3, 1982|work=The Milwaukee Journal|publisher=UPI|page=22|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> He had an official career best of 14.5 [[quarterback sack]]s in 1983 along with 107 tackles, a team record by a defensive lineman in a single season.

The success didn't last long, as Johnson started to get hampered with back injuries, which reduced his effectiveness.<ref name="thirddown">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XolQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6907,2398652&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Johnson aiming for big year.|last=Silverstein|first=Tom|date=August 10, 1987|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=10|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> In 1984, Johnson had surgery for a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disk]], an injury he suffered during training camp, and was known as a potential career-ending injury.<ref name="potentialgameending">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Vm4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LSoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5087,5594854&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Johnson is optimistic that back will improve.|last=Salituro|first=Chuck|date=August 7, 1984|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=29|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> He missed the first game of the regular season against the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] and could not fully recover from the injury.<ref name="diskproblems">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h4lQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VBIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6742,6930195&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Ezra Johnson tries to remain optimistic|last=Feuerherd|first=Vic|date=August 29, 1984|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=9|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="secondsurgery">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nqpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5247,7560651&dq=ezra-johnson&hl=en|title=Johnson gets chance to put agony behind.|last=Lea|first=Bud|date=July 27, 1985|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|pages=7, 9|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> Again he lost his starting job, becoming a third-down pass-rushing specialist, and was credited with seven sacks for the year; the injury forced Johnson to mull retirement.<ref name="secondsurgery"/>
