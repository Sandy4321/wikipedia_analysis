'''''Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down''''' is the fourteenth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Ry Cooder]], released August 30, 2011, on [[Nonesuch Records]]. It was written and produced by Cooder and recorded at Drive-By Studios, Ocean Studios, and Wireland Studios in California. Inspired by the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|late-2000s economic crisis]] and past [[protest song]]s, the album features [[topical song]]s about [[political sociology|socio-political]] subject matter in 21st-century America, including politics, war, [[economic inequality|economic disparity]], and social injustice. Its music is rooted in [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and incorporates traditional styles and musical language from historical sources such as [[country blues]], [[tejano music|tejano]], and [[American folk music|American roots music]]. The album has been noted by music writers for its eclectic musical range, allegorical songs, [[working class|working-class]] perspective, and Cooder's sardonic lyrics.

The album's first and only [[single (music)|single]], "Quicksand", was released as a [[music download|digital download]], with the proceeds of its sales subsequently being donated to the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]]. Although it [[record chart|chart]]ed modestly in the United States, the album attained relatively higher charting in European countries, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Norway, where it reached its highest chart position. Upon its release, ''Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down'' received general acclaim from [[music criticism|music critic]]s, who praised its diverse sound, trenchant commentary, and Cooder's musicianship. Several critics drew comparisons of Cooder to singer-songwriter and folk musician [[Woody Guthrie]]. It was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album|Best Americana Album]], set to be presented at the [[54th Grammy Awards]] in 2012.

Bush|<nowiki>[George]</nowiki> Bush]]'s time. I was looking at things and paying attention to events, politically. So I started trying to write political songs because it's good to have something you can do other than just sit and fume about everything. After [[Barack Obama]] got elected I started thinking about other stories that might be good to do. It occurred to me that the social and political problems that we've been having, well [...] it's deja vu all over again, as the man said."<ref name="Shedden">{{cite web|last=Shedden|first=Iain|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/music-and-politics-mix-in-ry-cooders-hands/story-e6frg8n6-1226149071111|title=Music and politics mix in Ry Cooder's hands|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|date=October 1, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-05|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63nKoMs24|archivedate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

In early 2011, Cooder was inspired to write the song "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently the rest of the album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank [[bailout]]s and [[late-2000s recession|resulting recession]] during the late-2000s.<ref name="Huey"/> In an interview with [[Kai Ryssdal]] on ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from [[Robert Scheer]]'s [[Truthdig]] blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'"<ref name="Ryssdal"/> He compared the album's content to [[Woody Guthrie]]'s songs about the [[Dust Bowl]] era during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and said of his own songs, "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune <U+2014> this happened and this happened and you can see that at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of [[Wall Street]] in terms of [[Jesse James]] and bilingual heft."<ref name="Ryssdal"/>

The album's music is rooted in [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and draws on styles such as [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[ragtime]], [[norte<U+00F1>o (music)|norte<U+00F1>o]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[country music]].<ref name="Jurek"/> For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions.<ref name="Paton"/><ref name="Chilton">{{cite web|last=Chilton|first=Martin|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8739287/Ry-Cooder-Pull-Up-Some-Dust-And-Sit-Down-CD-review.html|title=Ry Cooder: Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, CD review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=September 3, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref> In his interview on ''Marketplace'', he explained his stylistic approach for ''Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down'', stating "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them <U+2014> if it's an accordion, horns, the [[banda music|banda]] horns for the immigrant tunes <U+2014> they all are part of the story. And you can see it then, you can imagine the Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there."<ref name="Ryssdal"/> According to him, musical settings for certain songs were decided based on their respective compositions, such as when "the words would come to me in [[triple metre|<U+00BE> time]], that meant ''[[corrido]]'', that means accordion; ''banda'' horns because they<U+2019>re exciting."<ref name="George"/> 

Cooder wanted the music of each song to compliment the stories and to serve as homages to particular traditional styles.<ref name="George"/> Cooder said that he did not want to "over-think it" and said of his creative process for each song's distinct style, "It<U+2019>s taken a long time, but it becomes natural to combine an idea you have or a story you want to tell with whatever seems conducive."<ref name="George"/> Graham Reid of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' writes that the music "refers to the dustbowl era, [[country blues|rural blues]], [[tejano music|Tex-Mex]] (with accordionist Flaco Jimenez) and old-time folk."<ref name="Reid">{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Graham|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10750083|title=Album Review: Ry Cooder, Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down - Entertainment|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News & Media]]|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref> ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s Neil Spencer comments that it is "grounded in the blues, folk and Tex-Mex the guitarist explored in the 1970s, but its songs belong to modern times."<ref name="Spencer">{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Neil|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/04/pull-up-some-dust-review|title=Ry Cooder: Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down <U+2013> review <nowiki>|</nowiki> Music|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media Limited]]|date=September 4, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref>

{{quote|We had a 16-piece band and we played great shows to 700 people a night. But none of them bought CDs. None of them. They had a good time but they weren't motivated to buy CDs. I don't understand it because I came up in the time of records. Back then the business ran. You still got the tunes out. It was a crooked business, you could get cheated and there could be crooked accounting, but I still prefer it to this new thing where there is no connection to the audience through radio or retail.<ref name="Shedden"/>|Ry Cooder}}

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' writer Mary Houlihan gave the album three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it "an album that matters" and Cooder "a modern-day Woody Guthrie".<ref name="Houlihan"/> Phil Sutcliffe of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' complimented Cooder's own musical influences and "trenchant commentary", noting "the spirit of Woody Guthrie".<ref name="Sutcliffe">{{cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|title=Ry Cooder, Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down (Nonesuch)|work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|publisher=Bauer Media Group|issue=96|page=215|month=October|year=2011}}</ref> ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''{{'}}s Graham Reid gave the album a five out of five rating and praised Cooder's "old styles and politics".<ref name="Reid"/> Neil Spencer of ''[[The Observer]]'' described it as "a fierce state-of-the-nation album" and called Cooder "a Woody Guthrie for our times."<ref name="Spencer"/> Robin Denselow of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the album "magnificent" and "as refreshing, brave and original as his early recordings in the 70s."<ref name="Denselow"/> Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' dubbed it "his best effort by far since ''[[Ch<U+00E1>vez Ravine (album)|Chavez Ravine]]''" and perceived "a dark parade of familiar Cooder figures [...] But almost everywhere one looks, Cooder finds a new twist on these old rivalries."<ref name="Gill"/> [[Nigel Williamson]] of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' gave it five out of five stars and dubbed it "one of his best albums ever".<ref name="Williamson">{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Williamson|title=Ry Cooder, Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down (Nonesuch)|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|issue=173|page=83|month=October|year=2011}}</ref> [[BBC Music]]'s Andy Fyfe commented that "this is about as good and sustained a [[wikt:riposte|riposte]] to the grubby, grabbing times we live in as any artist has mustered, which makes it essential listening."<ref name="Fyfe"/> 

In his consumer guide for [[MSN Music]], critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A<U+2013> rating,<ref name="Christgau"/> indicating "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction."<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=CG 90s: Key to Icons|publisher=Robert Christgau|date=October 15, 2000|accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref> Christgau commented that "Cooder has brought his longstanding obsession with the Great Depression into the present, where it unfortunately, tragically, enragingly belongs", adding that the album "doesn't rock, and it shouldn't. But it rollicks, skanks, and two-steps just fine."<ref name="Christgau"/> Philip Majorins of [[PopMatters]] commented that the album "may not be a seamless narrative, but the themes are clear. Ry Cooder plays the part of the prophet flawlessly".<ref name="Majorins"/> Majorins added that it would not have a significant impact due to commercial tastes and a "cynical" cultural climate, but wrote in conclusion, "''Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down'' could have tremendous cathartic power for [those] who are aware of history and its knack for repeating itself. For those who are willing, this is a good place to start an education."<ref name="Majorins"/> Peter Kane of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' gave the album four out of five stars and described its music as "the heartening sounds of an old master at work."<ref name="Kane"/>
