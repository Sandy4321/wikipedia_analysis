She currently plays for [[Western New York Flash]] in the [[National Women's Soccer League]] and for the [[United States women's national soccer team]]. She played [[college soccer|collegiate soccer]] for the [[Florida Gators|University of Florida Gators]], where she was a member of the school's first [[NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship|NCAA Division I Championship team]] and was recognized as a three-time [[All-American]].

A six-time winner of the [[U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year]] award, Wambach has been a regular on the U.S. women's national soccer team since 2003. As a [[striker|forward]], she currently stands as the [[United States women's national soccer team#Top scorers|highest all-time goal scorer]] for the national team and holds the world record for international goals for both female and male soccer players with 163 goals.

In 2012, Wambach was awarded the 2012 [[FIFA World Player of the Year]], becoming the first American woman to win the award in ten years.

====2007 FIFA Women's World Cup====

Heading into the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, the national team had not conceded a game in regulation time in nearly three years and was considered a favorite to win the tournament in China. Wambach had become a regular on the team for five years and had assumed a new position as leader on the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wambach Grows Into Her Role, Shoulders U.S. Women's Load|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101978.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref> During their first match of the tournament against [[Korea DPR women's national football team|North Korea]], Wambach collided in the air with North Korean defender, [[Ri Kum-Suk]], and landed on the ground with blood streaming down her head.

The United States was ahead 1<U+2013>0 thanks to a goal Wambach had scored in the 50th minute, assisted by [[Kristine Lilly]]. The squad allowed two goals while Wambach was away for those ten minutes. "When they scored right away as I went off I started to get worried. So I started to run to the locker room to get stitches put in," Wambach said. Just a couple minutes after Wambach returned to the pitch, the United States tied the match with a goal scored by [[Heather O'Reilly]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Stitches in Time Help Americans Gain a Tie|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/sports/soccer/12cup.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Abby bleeds red, white and blue | publisher =FIFA | date = September 13, 2007 | url =http://www.fifa.com/womenworldcup/news/newsid=595129.html?cid=rssfeed&att= | accessdate =October 5, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221105458/http://www.fifa.com/womenworldcup/news/newsid=595129.html?cid=rssfeed&att= <!--DASHBot--> |archivedate = December 21, 2007}}</ref>

The team faced [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]] in their next match on September 14, 2007.

The United States faced Brazil in the semi-finals in what would become a controversial and game-changing match for the team. Coach Greg Ryan decided to bench starting goalkeeper, [[Hope Solo]], and instead started [[Brianna Scurry]], a veteran goalkeeper who had started in three World Cups and two Olympics, but who had started very few matches since the 2004 Olympics.

Thirty-one minutes into the match in San Diego, California, Wambach ran at full speed seemingly to take a shot from about 30 yards and fiercely collided with Rosa. Wambach fell to the ground and immediately signaled for assistance. Her left leg was put in a brace and she was taken off the field on a stretcher. After being taken to a local hospital in an ambulance for X-rays, fractures to her [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] were confirmed. Wambach later underwent surgery to have a titanium rod inserted and was expected to be out of action for three months. The first match for the national team was slated to start on August 6. Wambach was the team's leading scorer at the time and had just reached 99 goals in 127 matches, just one shy of becoming the fifth U.S. player and ninth female player in world history to notch 100 career international goals.<ref>{{cite web | title =U.S. Women Defeat Norway, 4<U+2013>0, in Fredrikstad; Wambach Scores 99th Career International Goal| publisher =US Soccer| date = July 2, 2008 | url =http://www.ussoccer.com/news/womens-national-team/2008/07/u-s-women-defeat-norway-4-0-in-fredrikstad-wambach-scores-99th-career-international-goal.aspx| accessdate =July 3, 2008}}</ref>

Wambach fell to the ground in pain. The referees did not seem to see the play and made no call. Ending the match with a swollen black eye, Wambach described what happened, "I'm running toward the goal to get position, and I got sucker-punched," she said. "It's clear. We have it on film, so it's up to the Olympic committee and FIFA to decide what to do."<ref>{{cite web|title=Black eye, goal for Wambach in Olympic win for US|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&id=8209074|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref>  After reviewing match footage, FIFA officials later imposed a two-match ban on the Colombian player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colombia player gets Olympic ban for punching U.S. soccer star Abby Wambach|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/colombia-player-gets-olympic-ban-for-punching-us-soccer-star-abby-wambach/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics-2012/olympics-2012-megan-rapinoe-abby-wambach-carli-lloyd-find-back-net-lead-u-s-women-soccer-team-colombia-article-1.1123948 |title=Olympics 2012: Megan Rapinoe, Abby Wambach and Carli Lloyd find the back of the net to lead U.S. women<U+2019>s soccer team past Colombia |work=Daily News|location=New York |date=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='They were hitting US': Colombian women's soccer player blames American team's dirty play after she's SUSPENDED for giving Abby Wambach a black eye|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180632/London-Olympics-2012-Soccer-star-Abby-Wambach-gets-sucker-punched-eye-Colombian-opponent-Lady-Andrade-suspended.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=July 30, 2012}}</ref>

During the United States' third group stage match against North Korea, Wambach scored the lone goal of the match during the 25th minute on a play that consisted of a long ball by Lauren Cheney to Alex Morgan. Morgan slid a pass between two defenders to Wambach who easily tapped in her third goal of the tournament. In front of 29,522 spectators at [[Old Trafford]], the Americans finished first in their group with the win and it launched them to the quarter-final against [[New Zealand women's national football team|New Zealand]].
