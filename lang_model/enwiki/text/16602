'''Wayne and Shuster''' were a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[double act|comedy duo]] formed by [[Johnny Wayne]] and [[Frank Shuster]].

Wayne (born Louis Weingarten, [[May 28]], [[1918]] &ndash; [[July 18]], [[1990]]) and Shuster ([[September 5]], [[1916]] &ndash; [[January 13]], [[2002]]) were a comedy team well known in Canada and two of Ed Sullivan's recurring guests.

==Beginnings==

Wayne and Shuster met as [[high school]] students at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in [[1930]]. They both studied at the [[University of Toronto]], where they wrote and performed for the [[theatre]] there, and in [[1941]] they made their [[radio]] debut on [[CFRB]] in their own show, ''The Wife Preservers'' in which they dispensed household hints in a humorous fashion. This exposure resulted in the pair being given their own comedy show on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Trans-Canada Network as ''Shuster & Wayne''.

They enlisted in the Canadian [[army]] in [[1942]], and performed for the troops in [[Europe]] during [[World War II]] as part of the ''[[Army Show]]'' (they would also later perform for the army in the [[Korean War]]). They returned to Canada to create the ''Wayne and Shuster Show'' for [[CBC Radio]] in [[1946]]. They first performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the [[United States]] in [[1958]], and set a record there by appearing 67 times over the next 11 years.

Wayne and Shuster turned down many offers to go to the U.S. permanently, preferring to remain in [[Toronto]]. (They did co-star in a [[CBS]]-TV sitcom, ''Holiday Lodge'', which aired as a summer replacement for [[Jack Benny]] in [[1961]].) Shuster recounted how one network executive was incredulous that the pair would not accept an offer of their own show on US network television. The duo explained that they had debated it but decided that with friends and family all in Toronto, they would be happier in Canada. The executive apparently replied "There's more to life than happiness!"

After having a weekly television series in the [[1950s]], they began a series of long running, monthly ''Wayne & Shuster'' comedy specials on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Television]] in the early [[1960s]] which continued into the [[1980s]] by which time their comedy was regarded as old-fashioned. However, they were an influence for later Canadian comedians, such as [[Lorne Michaels]] (Shuster's son-in-law), the ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' and ''[[Kids in the Hall|The Kids in the Hall]]''. In the late 1980s, many of their comedy skits were repackaged in half-hour chunks and [[television syndication|syndicated]] around the world under the title ''Wayne & Shuster''; the comedians filmed new introductions for the series.

==The humour of Wayne and Shuster==

They performed "literate" comedy, combined with slapstick. They often used classical or [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] settings and characters; on their first [[Ed Sullivan]] appearance, for example, they performed a modern murder investigation using Shakespeare's [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] in a sketch called ''Rinse the Blood off My Toga'', which spawned the popular [[catch phrase]], "Julie, don't go!" After the opening of the [[Stratford Festival of Canada]] in [[1958]] they created a [[baseball]]-themed skit involving characters from [[Hamlet]] and [[Macbeth]]. The duo treated these sketches the way singers treat their most popular songs by performing new renditions many times over the years.

In an interview, Wayne and Shuster recalled how they once debated the wisdom of the baseball sketch, saying it might not be the best material for a mass audience. Wayne was hesitant, Shuster was confident that the baseball sketch would go over well on the Sullivan Show. They were in a Toronto diner discussing the matter when the dishwasher introduced himself, and asked if he thought most people 'got' the baseball sketch.

Some of Wayne's characters were scientific in nature, and used Waynegartner, a derivation of his birth name. The duo often based their sketches on contemporary events, trends and television programs.

They spoofed ''[[All in the Family]]'' as "All in the Royal Family", with the king calling Hamlet, "Meathead", and his queen "Dingbat". As Paramount was about to release ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the duo spoofed it with "Star Schtick". When ''[[The Equalizer]]'' went on the air, they responded with "The Tranquilizer", dealing with mysterious deaths on a game show that was a cross between ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' and the ''[[$64,000 Question]]''. When ''[[Dallas]]'' was popular, it was spoofed with a character determined to corner the fertilizer market, and featured a cameo by [[Barbara Frum]]. ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' was spoofed with "Fantasy Motel".

The duo spoofed the commercials "we love to hate" with their own versions: Crazar TVs spoofed the "Quasar" TV brand with the high pitched overture; Oil of Oyvay spoofed the de-aging ''[[Oil of Olay]]''; Macedonian Formula spoofed ''[[Grecian Formula]]'', and questioned why a man would say he used it and thus reveal he has grey hair; Russian Express spoofed ''[[American Express]]'', with a muscular KGB agent saying "Don't leave home!"

They spoofed accents and dialogue. After Wayne brought down an escaping felon with a gunshot (off screen), Shuster would say, "You got him in the rotunda/cloisters/etc.", with Wayne looking wryly at Shuster. "Srightry ahead of Panasonic!" "Srightry?" (Later...) "I go plug it in." "Don't you mean, 'prug it in'?" "No. One ethnic joke per sketch is plenty... or prenty if that's the way you like it." In another sketch, Shuster was calling on the phone for "Inspector Slattery." Wayne said, "Slattery will get you nowhere."

==Fade to black==

Wayne died in 1990. After his death the group received a special [[Gemini Awards|Gemini Award]] for their outstanding contribution to Canadian television. In 1996 Frank accepted the [[Margaret Collier Award]] for the duo comedy writing and was later named to the [[Order of Canada]]. Shuster, who died in 2002, attempted some solo work after Wayne died, but was mostly seen during his last decade hosting Wayne and Shuster retrospectives, including ''Wayne and Shuster in Black and White'', a CBC series that aired in prime time during the early-1990s. 

Shuster was a cousin of [[Joe Shuster]], who co-created [[Superman]] with artist [[Jerry Siegel]] .

As of 2005, the only Wayne and Shuster material available on DVD is the 1991 special ''Wayne and Shuster: 50 Years of Comedy'' which Shuster hosted.

==Trivia and parodies==
In a bit on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' called "National Act Like Canada Matters Day", guitarist [[Jimmy Vivino]] remarks to [[Conan O'Brien|O'Brien]], "Wow, Conan, you're a regular Wayne and Shuster."

After Wayne's death the two received a special [[Gemini Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Canadian Television. In 1998 they were honoured with the [[Margot Collier Award]] for outstanding contribution to Canadian television writing.

In [[1965]] ''The Wayne & Shuster Hour'' won the Silver Rose at the [[Rose d'Or]] Television Festival.

In 1999 the comedy pair were inducted into [http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/99_wayne_shuster.xml.htm Canada's Walk of Fame].

Wayne and Schuster's comedy album "Frontier Psychiatrist" is sampled by [[Australia]]n band [[The Avalanches]] in their album ''[[Since I Left You]]''. Samples from Wayne and Schuster are found on tracks "Frontier Psychiatrist" and "Radio".

The comedy duo also seems (to a certain extent) to be the basis for the fictional television characters [[Terrence and Phillip]] in the hit American cartoon [[South Park]]. The fictional characters are seen as making their debut on American television on the [[Ed Sullivan]] Show, much like Wayne and Shuster. Also, Wayne and Shuster have debated whether or not the "baseball sketch" was suited for American audiences; this is reflected in Terrence and Phillip's debut where the only part understood by the audience is a flatulence unintended as part of the act, which is also a reference to the supposed [[Canadian]] perception of Americans.
