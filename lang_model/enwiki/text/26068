'''Stones Brewery (William Stones Ltd)''' was a [[brewery]] founded in 1868 by William Stones in [[Sheffield]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, and purchased by [[Bass brewery|Bass]] in 1968 before closing in 1999. Its most famous brand, ''[[Stones Bitter]]'', is owned by the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] who continue to market it.

William Stones had started brewing in 1847 in Sheffield with Joseph Watts. Following Watts' death in 1854 Stones continued brewing by himself. In 1868 he purchased the lease of the Neepsend Brewery, and renamed it the Cannon Brewery, and he continued to brew there until his death in 1894. Stones' success saw him die as one of the richest men in Sheffield, although he lived a modest life. The company was taken over by [[Bass brewery|Bass]] in 1968, then in 2000 Bass sold its brewing operations to the Belgian brewer [[Interbrew]] who were ordered by the [[Competition Commission]] to sell the Stones brand. In 2002, the brand was purchased by the American [[Coors Brewing Company]], who became [[Molson Coors]] following a merger in 2005. 

The brewery is famous nationwide for ''Stones Bitter'', which was brewed at the Cannon Brewery from 1948 and was drunk by Sheffield's steel workers. It was brewed there until the brewery's closure in 1999, although its popularity saw it later additionally brewed elsewhere. [[Brewery conditioned]] ''Stones Bitter'' (3.7 per cent [[alcohol by volume]]) is brewed by Molson Coors at their breweries in [[Tadcaster]], [[North Yorkshire]] and [[Burton upon Trent]], and [[cask conditioned]] ''Stones Bitter'' (4.1 per cent abv) is contract brewed by [[Everards]] of [[Leicester]]. ''Stones Bitter'' was originally available across the south of [[Yorkshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Nottinghamshire]], with distribution extended to the rest of the north of England in 1977, and nationwide from 1979, accompanied by a considerable marketing push. The beer's popularity reached its apex in 1992 when it was the country's highest selling [[bitter (beer)|bitter]], selling 240 million [[pint]]s. The beer has been lauded in certain quarters as "one of Sheffield's most famous exports". 

''Stones'' notably sponsored the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] and its successor the [[Super League|Rugby Super League]] from 1986 until 1997. A well known series of television advertisements for the brand, starring Tony Barton and [[Michael Angelis]], became the longest running bitter advertisements in the country, running from 1983 until 1991. Since the withdrawal of the majority of marketing support by Bass in 1997 in favour of the ''[[Worthington Brewery|Worthington]]'' ale brand, the beer has experienced a heavy decline in sales, which are down to less than 10 per cent of their peak, although it remains among the twenty highest selling ale brands in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Origins (1847<U+2013>1900)===
Stones Brewery has its origins in 1847 when Joseph Watts and William Stones were brewing together at the modestly sized Cannon Brewery on Acorn Street in the Shalesmoor district of Sheffield.<ref>The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent (Sheffield, England), Saturday, 3 July 1847; p.

===Consolidation (1901<U+2013>1966)===
In 1905 net profit was <U+00A3>27,000 and the brewery was producing around 50,000 barrels of beer per year.<ref>Dividends and Reports The Financial Times (London, England), Tuesday, 22 August 1905; p. 2; Edition 5,359 (1167 words)</ref><ref>The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A.

In 1959 William Stones bought Ward & Sons of [[Swinton, South Yorkshire|Swinton]], local bottlers of beer and mineral water for <U+00A3>100,000 (<U+00A3>1.8 million in 2010 prices).

===Stones Bitter===
[[File:Stonesnice.jpg|thumb|upright|Pump clip for ''Nice Try'', a monthly special using the "Stones" brand name]]
{{main|Stones Bitter}}

'''Stones Bitter''' is a [[bitter (beer)|bitter]] [[beer]] first brewed in 1948 at the Cannon Brewery. It was designed for the steelworkers of Sheffield's [[Lower Don Valley]]. Bass extended its distribution to include the north of England in 1977, before extending distribution nationwide in 1979. Its popularity during the 1970s and 1980s in its heartland saw it desrcibed as "more of a religion than a beer." By 1992 ''Stones'' was the UK's highest selling bitter, with 240 million pints sold annually. That same year the ABV of ''Stones'' was reduced from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV, and then to 3.7 per cent in 1999. The cask conditioned ''Stones'' was restored to 4.1 per cent ABV in 2006.
