The '''RWD-14 Czapla''' (LWS Czapla) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[army cooperation aircraft]] (observation, close [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]] and [[liaison aircraft]]), designed in the mid-1930s by the [[RWD (aircraft manufacturer)|RWD]] team, and produced in the [[LWS (aircraft manufacturer)|LWS]] factory from 1938.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed in response to a [[Polish Air Force]] requirement of [[1933 in aviation|1933]] for a new army cooperation plane, a successor of the [[Lublin R-XIII]]. The [[RWD (aircraft manufacturer)|RWD]] team of the DWL workshops (''[[Do<U+015B>wiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze]]'') initially proposed the '''RWD-12''' project, based on the [[RWD-8]] trainer. It was however considered as not as good as the R-XIII, and was not built. Another aircraft, the '''RWD-14''' was designed by [[Stanislaw Rogalski]] and [[Jerzy Drzewiecki]] instead.<ref name=glass>Glass A.

The first prototype was flown in December [[1935 in aviation|1935]].<ref name=morg/> It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI project and the [[Podlaska Wytw<U+00F3>rnia Samolot<U+00F3>w]] factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In [[1937 in aviation|1937]] two modified prototypes were built, designated '''RWD-14a''', but both crashed during trials that year due to steering mechanism faults (the pilots survived).<ref name=glass/> Finally, in early [[1938 in aviation|1938]] the fourth improved prototype, designated '''RWD-14b''', was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the [[Polish Air Force]], receiving the name '''Czapla''' (Polish: ''[[heron]]''), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until the advent of the more modern [[LWS-3 Mewa]]. In return for refunding the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory [[LWS (aircraft manufacturer)|LWS]] (''Lubelska Wytw<U+00F3>rnia Samolot<U+00F3>w'' <U+2013> [[Lublin]] Aircraft Works, a successor of the [[Plage i La<U+015B>kiewicz]]).<ref name=glass/>

The LWS built a series of 65 RWD-14b Czapla by February [[1939 in aviation|1939]]. They were also known under a military designation '''LWS Czapla'''.<ref name=morg/>

==Operational history==
The Czapla entered service in the Polish Air Force in the spring of 1939, equipping some observation squadrons (''eskadra obserwacyjna''). Due to its long development, it was not a modern aircraft, only a little better than the [[Lublin R-XIII]]. Its advantage was its short take-off (140 m) and landing (120 m), enabling it to operate from fields and meadows.<ref name=glass/> Its modern successor, the [[LWS-3 Mewa]], did not manage to enter operational units due to the war.

By the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the [[Polish Air Force]] had 35 Czaplas in five observation squadrons (out of twelve): No.'s 13, 23, 33, 53 and 63, each with seven aircraft.<ref name=glass/> Squadrons were distributed among the field Armies. The remaining 30 Czaplas were initially in reserve. Several were used to supplement the combat units during the campaign (the mentioned squadrons and several others). In total, 49 Czaplas were used in units.<ref name=morg>Morga<U+0142>a. A (2003), pp. 201<U+2013>205</ref> Like the R-XIII, the Czapla was no match for any [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]], [[bomber]], or even [[reconnaissance aircraft]], being much slower, and armed with only two machine guns. In spite of this, they were actively used for close [[reconnaissance]] and [[Liaison aircraft|liaison]] tasks.<ref name=morg/>

Most <U+2013> 35 RWD-14b were destroyed during the campaign.<ref name=morg/> At least 14 were withdrawn to [[Romania]] (the sources quote numbers from 14 to 17). They were taken over by the [[Romanian Air Force]] and used for training and auxiliary duties.<ref name=morg/> Several aircraft were captured in Poland by the Germans or the Soviets, but were not used by them. No RWD-14b has survived. 

==Technical description==
