The '''1638 New Hampshire earthquake''' struck central [[New England]] on June 1, 1638 ([[Julian calendar]]).<ref>http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1638_06_11_hs.php</ref> It was the first major [[earthquake]] in New England after the start of European colonization. Modern analysis places its epicenter somewhere near central [[New Hampshire]], and it probably measured between magnitude 6.5 and 7.0 on the [[Richter scale]],<ref>http://marybarrettdyer.blogspot.ca/2011/09/great-new-england-quake-of-1638.html</ref> making it the strongest earthquake on record in New Hampshire and one of the strongest in the region's history (the [[1663 Charlevoix earthquake]] was probably stronger).
