'''Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0435><U+0301><U+0439> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0301><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D>}}, ''Aleksej Nikolajevi<U+010D> Kosygin''; 20 February 1904 <U+2013> 18 December 1980) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]]-[[Russians|Russian]] statesman from the start to the end of the [[Cold War]]. He served as [[List of Prime Ministers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] from 1964 to 1980, and as [[List of heads of government of Russia|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Peoples Commissars of the Russian SFSR]], or Russian Premier, from 1943 to 1946. Kosygin was responsible for the economic administration of the Soviet Union, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic and external policies. Kosygin retired in 1980 due to bad health and was replaced by [[Nikolai Tikhonov]].

Kosygin was born in the city of [[St. Petersburg]] in 1904 to a Russian [[working class]] family. He was conscripted into the labor army during the [[Russian Civil War]], and after the Red Army's demobilisation in 1921, left to work in [[Siberia]] as an industrial manager. Kosygin returned to Leningrad in the early 1930s, working his way up the Soviet hierarchy. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]) Kosygin was a member of the [[State Defense Committee]] and was tasked with moving Soviet industry out of territories soon to be overrun by the German military. In the war's aftermath Kosygin served as [[Minister of Finance (Soviet Union)|Minister of Finance]] for a year before becoming Minister of the [[Minister of Light Industry (Soviet Union)|Ministries of Light Industry]] and [[Minister of Light and Food Industry|Light and Food Industry]]. One year before Stalin's death in 1952, he removed Kosygin from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo), purposely weakening his position within the Soviet hierarchy.

After the power struggle triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader. On 20 March 1959, Kosygin was appointed to the position of Chairman of the [[Gosplan|State Planning Committee]] (Gosplan), a post he would hold for little more than a year. After he left his post as Gosplan Chairman Kosygin became [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy]] of the Council of Ministers. When Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Kosygin was made Premier and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] made [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Kosygin, along with Brezhnev and [[Nikolai Podgorny]], the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], was a member of the new "[[collective leadership]]" (later known as the [[All-People's Government]]). Kosygin became one of two major power players within the Soviet hierarchy, the other being Brezhnev, and was able to initiate the failed [[1965 Soviet economic reform|1965 economic reform]], usually referred to simply as the Kosygin reform. This reform, along with his more open stance on solving the [[Prague Spring]], made Kosygin one of the most [[Liberalism|liberal]] members of the top leadership.

Some of Kosygin's policies were seen as too radical, particularly by the more conservative members of the top leadership. They were, however, never able to depose Kosygin as Premier, even if he and Brezhnev disliked each other. During most of the 1970s, Brezhnev had consolidated enough power to stop any "radical" reform-minded attempts by Kosygin. In 1980, Kosygin retired from office due to bad health, and he died two months later on 18 December 1980.

==Early life and career (1904<U+2013>1964)==
Kosygin was born into a Russian<ref>Law 1975, p. 221.</ref> [[working class]] family consisting of his father and mother Nikolai Lenin and Matron Alexandrovna and his siblings. The family lived in [[St. Petersburg]]. Kosygin was [[baptised]] one month after his birth on 7 March.<ref>{{cite web | author = <U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0412><U+0438><U+043A><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440> | title = <U+041D><U+0435><U+0438><U+0437><U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D> | trans_title = The Unknown Kosygin | language = Russian | work = [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] | url = http://www.rg.ru/2003/08/24/NeizvestnyjKosygin.html | date = 23 August 2003 | accessdate = 4 September 2010 }}</ref> As many like him, he was conscripted into a labor army to fight with the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

Stalin shared certain information with Kosygin, such as how much the families of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]] possessed, spent and paid their staff. It should be noted that a Politburo member earned a modest salary by Soviet standards<ref>Elliott and Lewin 2005, p. 95.</ref> but enjoyed unlimited access to [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]]. Kosygin was sent by Stalin to each home to put their houses into "proper order". Assignments such as these made Kosygin unpopular with certain members of the Soviet leadership. Kosygin told his [[son-in-law]] [[Mikhail Gvishiani]], an [[NKVD]] officer, of the accusations leveled against his co-worker [[Nikolai Voznesensky]], then Chairman of the [[Gosplan]] and a [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy]], because of his possessions of [[firearm]]s. Gvishiani and Kosygin threw all their weapons into an unknown lake and searched both their houses for any listening devices. They found one at Kosygin's house, but it might have been installed to spy on Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] who had lived there before him. According to his own [[memoirs]], Kosygin never left his home without reminding his wife what to do if he did not return from work. After living two years in constant fear, they reached the logical conclusion that Stalin would not harm them.<ref>Elliott and Lewin 2005, p. 96.</ref>
[[File:DNN Iofan.jpg|left|thumb|The [[House on Embankment]] was a building completed in 1931 to house the government elite; Kosygin lived there]]
Kosygin, along with [[Alexey Kuznetsov]] and Voznesensky formed a [[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]] in the aftermath of the war, with all three being promoted up the Soviet hierarchy by high standing officials, such as Stalin for example. There are some who believe that [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were plotting against them, and initiated what became known as the [[Leningrad Affair]] in 1950. The Leningrad Affair consisted of several fabricated criminal charges against Kuznetsov and Voznesensky. Both Kuznetsov and Voznesensky were sentenced to "collective sentencing", and were executed. Kosygin's life, which was connected to Kuznetsov through marriage, was hanging by a thread. How or why Kosygin survived the [[show trial]]s has been left unexplained, but he, as some jokes say, "must have drawn a lucky lottery ticket".<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = Life hung by a thread | year = 1970| date = 11 December | pages = 59 | url = http://books.google.no/books?id=1VMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq | accessdate = 3 September 2010  | work = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] }}</ref> [[Nikita Khrushchev]] blamed Beria and Malenkov for the innocent deaths of Kuznetsov and Voznesensky, accusing Malenkov in 1957 to have been plotting against them so that either he or Beria could succeed Stalin upon his death.<ref name="unknownStalin"/> 

Following Stalin's death in March 1953, Kosygin was demoted but as a staunch ally of Khrushchev his career soon turned around. While never one of Khrushchev's prot<U+00EB>g<U+00EB>s, Kosygin quickly moved up the party ladder and was promoted to head of the [[Gosplan|State Planning Committee]] and became Khrushchev's First Deputy Premier in 1960, and regained his old seat in the Politburo.<ref name="kosyginwasgood"/>

Kosygin, along with [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] and [[Nikolai Podgorny]], were the most liberal members while Brezhnev, [[Kirill Mazurov]] and [[Arv<U+012B>ds Pel<U+0161>e]] belonged to the moderate faction. [[Mikhail Suslov]] retained his leadership of the [[Stalinist]]-wing of the party. Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev-Kosygin attempt at creating stability was failing on various fronts. From 1969<U+2013>1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown to such an extent that some started to doubt former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]<ref name="elevenhundredandeleven"/> (which Kosygin initially resisted),<ref name="twohundredandtwo"/> the decline in [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|agriculture production]], the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]]<ref name="elevenhundredandeleven"/> (advocated restraint),<ref name="twohundredandtwo"/> the [[Vietnam War]] and the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and USSR were held, the [[Warsaw Pact Summit Conference]] and the [[Moscow Summit Conference]], both failed at gaining support for Soviet policies. By 1970 these differences had not been resolved, and Brezhnev even postponed the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th party congress]] and the [[Ninth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Ninth Five-Year Plan]] because of it. The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 however, it became apparent that Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny becoming an even more important member of the "collective leadership" than before.<ref name="elevenhundredandeleven">Law 1975, p. 211.</ref> Kosygin would prove to be a very competent administrator, with the Soviet [[standard of living]] rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy.<ref name="unknownStalin"/>

Kosygin would later challenge Brezhnev on the rights of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] to represent the country abroad; a function Kosygin believed should fall into the hands of the Premier, a common trait in non-communist countries.<ref name="kosyginwasgood"/> This was actually implemented for a short-period of time,<ref name="kosyginwasgood"/> which led [[Henry A. Kissinger]] to believe that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union.<ref name="twice"/> During this period, Kosygin acted as a mediator between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1966, and got both nations to sign the [[Tashkent Declaration]]. Kosygin even became the [[chief spokesman]] on the issue of arms control. In retrospect, many of Kosygin's co-workers felt he carried out his work "[[stoically]]", but lacked the "[[enthusiasm]]" that went with it, and therefore never developed a real taste for [[international politics]]. The [[Sino-Soviet split]] chagrined Kosygin a great deal, and for a while refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to increased [[Suspense|tension]] between the USSR and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Kosygin said, in a close knit-circle, that; "We are communists and they are communists. It is hard to believe we will not be able to reach an agreement if we met face to face".<ref>{{cite book | author = Zubok, Vladislav Martinovich | title = A Failed Empire: the Soviet Union in the Cold War from Stalin to Gorbachev | publisher = [[UNC Press]] | year = 2007 | location = | pages = 194<U+2013>195 | url = http://books.google.no/books?id=jfoUhMOS10kC&dq | isbn = 0807830984 }}</ref> Kosygin, who had been the chief negotiator with the [[First World]] during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the [[Second World]]<ref>Wesson 1978, p. 248.</ref> after Brezhnev strengthened his position within the Politburo,<ref name="kosyginwasgood"/> and due to [[Andrey Gromyko]]'s dislike of Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.<ref name="coldwarenc"/>

===The "Kosygin reform" (1965<U+2013>71)===
{{main|1965 Soviet economic reform}}
Like Khrushchev before him, Kosygin tried to reform the [[command economy]] within a [[communist]] framework. In 1965, Kosygin initiated the [[1965 Soviet economic reform|Soviet economic reform]] widely referred to as the "Kosygin reform". Kosygin sought to make Soviet industry more efficient by including some market measures seen in the west such as [[Profit (economics)|profit making]] <U+2013> and the quantity of production, increasing [[incentives]] for managers and workers, and freeing managers from [[centralised]] state [[bureaucracy]].<ref name="kosyginreform">Moss 2005, p. 431.</ref> The reform had already been proposed to Khrushchev in 1964, who evidently liked it and took some preliminary steps to implement it. Brezhnev allowed the reform to proceed, because the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth.<ref name="CIA">{{cite book | author = Chauhan, Sharad | title = Inside CIA: Lessons in Intelligence | publisher = APH Publishing | year = 2004 | location = | page = 207 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rUIauNFQnngC&dq | isbn = 8176486604 }}</ref> The reform, in its testing phase, was applied to 336 enterprises in [[light industry]].<ref>Wesson 1978, p. 240.</ref>

The reform had originated from Soviet economist [[Evsei Liberman]]. Liberman's work influenced him, but Kosygin had overestimated the Soviet administrative machine to develop the economy. This led to "corrections" to some of Liberman's more controversial beliefs of [[decentralisation]]. The changes brought on by Kosygin to Liberman's original vision led, according to critics, the reform to fail.<ref name="CIA"/>
[[File:Kosyginreform1965.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A propaganda poster promoting the reform. The poster reads; "We're forging the keys of happiness"]]
Kosygin, who had for a long-time been conscious of the West's superiority, believed the key to catching up with them was decentralisation, [[Government-owned corporation|semi-public companies]] and cooperatives. His reform sought for a gradual change from a "state-administered economy" to an economy were "the state restricts itself to guiding enterprises". Kosygin also believed in various forms of property and management. To his disgruntlement, Khrushchev had fully nationalised all Soviet cooperatives and Brezhnev hampered any genius discussion on the topic taking. Kosygin criticised Brezhnev's defence and foreign aid policy, believing the expenditures were to heavy of a burden for the economy.<ref>Elliott and Lewin 2005, p. 249.</ref> The reform was implemented, but showed several malfunctions and [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] early one.<ref name="kosyginreform"/> With the hostility towards the reform growing, the grim results and Kosygin's reformist stance led to a popular backlash against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev was never able to remove him from the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position.<ref name="twice">Brown 2009, p. 403.</ref>

The salary for Soviet citizens increased abruptly almost 2.5 times. Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, whereas 166.3 rubles before the reform. The first period, 1960<U+2013>1964 is characterised by four years of low growth, while the second period, 1965<U+2013>1981 had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated the success of the Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times higher than in the first period and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981<U+2013>1985). Consumption of goods and daily demands also increased. The consumption of home appliances such as [[refrigerators]] greatly increased, increasing from a low 109 in 1964 to 440 thousand units by 1973, but declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, but would continue to increase until the late 1980s, this can be explained by the fact that the Soviet leadership under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers. 

The removal of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1964 signalled the end of his "[[Khrushchyovka|housing revolution]]". Since Khrushchev's removal input had declined between 1960<U+2013>64 to an average of 1.63 million square meters. Following this sudden decrease, housing construction was followed once again by a sharp increase between 1965<U+2013>66, but dropped again just to be followed up by a steady growth (average annual growth rate being 4.26 million square meters). This came largely to the expense of businesses. While the housing shortages were never fully resolved, and still remains a problem in present-day Russia, the reform managed to overcome the negative trend and renew growth of housing construction.<ref name="Pravdafour"/>

===Later life (1970<U+2013>80)===
By the early-to-mid 1970s Brezhnev had established a strong enough power base to effectively become supreme leader, however, Kosygin was to retain his position until 1980 when he resigned due to bad health.<ref name="Brown 2009, p. 402"/> Early signs in the 1970s showed that Brezhnev had taken full control over both party and government activities, and Brezhnev had been able to weaken Kosygin considerably. Kosygin's presentation to the [[25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|25th party congress]] is seen as final proof that Kosygin lost the power struggle to Brezhnev. The Tenth-Five Year Plan was less ambitious than its predecessors, with targets of national industrial growth being no higher than what the rest of the world had already achieved. [[Soviet agriculture]] would receive a share investment of 34 percent, even if it counted for only 3 percent of the Soviet GDP. A share much larger than its proportional contribution to the Soviet economy.<ref name="twofivethree"/> Kosygin was further pushed aside when Brezhnev published his [[memoirs]] which stated that Brezhnev, not Kosygin, was in charge of all major economic decisions.<ref>Wesson 1978, p. 254.</ref> Brezhnev had blocked any future talks on economic reforms within the party and government apparatus, and information regarding the reform of 1965 was suppressed.<ref name="twofivethree">Wesson 1978, p. 253.</ref>
[[File:Kosygin and Ceau<U+015F>escu.jpg|thumb|right|Kosygin (right) shaking hands with Romanian communist leader [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]]]]
During an official visit by an Afghan delegation, Kosygin and [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] criticised the Afghan leaders [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and [[Hafizullah Amin]] for [[stalinist]] repressionist behavior. An intervention in Afghanistan would strain the USSR's foreign relations with the [[First World]], most notably [[West Germany]]. He did promise to send more economic and military aid, but rejected any proposal regarding a possible Soviet intervention. In an address to the Afghan leadership, Kosygin is quoted saying:<ref>{{cite book | author = Harrison, Selig S.; Cordovez, Diego | title = Out of Afghanistan: the Inside Story of the Soviet withdrawal | volum = | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1995 | location = | pages = 36<U+2013>37| url = http://books.google.no/books?id=iFasqHGo3p0C&dq | isbn = 0195062949 }}</ref>
<blockquote>"We should tell Taraki and Amin to change their tactics. They still continue to execute those people who disagree with them. They are killing nearly all of the [[Parcham]] leaders, not only the highest rank, but of the middle rank, too".</blockquote> 

Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.<ref name="sidelined">{{cite book | author = Zemtsov, Ilya | title = Chernenko: the last Bolshevik : the Soviet Union on the eve of Perestroika | volum = | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | year = 1989 | location = | pages = 119 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=hgscfLr5dCsC&dq | isbn = 0887382606 }}</ref> In 1976 Kosygin suffered his first [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. After this incident, it is said that Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to becoming tired, fed up and losing the will to continue his work. He twice filled a letter of [[resignation]] prior to 1980 but both were turned down.<ref name="Pravdafour">{{cite web | author = | title = <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0413><U+0432><U+0438><U+0448><U+0438><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438>: <U+00AB><U+041D><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+043E> <U+0436><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+0442><U+044C> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>!<U+00BB> (Page 4) | trans_title = Alex Gvishiani: "Do not feel sorry for Kosygin!" | language = Russian | publisher = [[Pravda|Pravda Online]] | url = http://www.pravda.ru/society/fashion/models/19-04-2004/47012-kosygin-3/ | accessdate = 4 September 2010 | date = 9 April 2004 }}</ref> During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed [[Nikolai Tikhonov]] as new [[First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers|First Deputy]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]]. Tikhonov was a conservative just as Brezhnev and his entourage were, therefore, when he took command over the Soviet economy Kosygin was reduced to a standby figure. In June 1980 a [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] plenum, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.<ref name="sidelined"/> 

The last significant reform undertaken by the [[Kosygin's fifth government|Kosygin government]], and some believe the pre-''[[perestroika]]'' era, was a joint decision of the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers named; "Improving planning and reinforcing the effects of the economic mechanism on raising the effectiveness in production and improving the quality of work", or more commonly known as the [[1979 Soviet economic reform|1979 reform]]. The reform, in contrast to the 1965 reform, wanted to increase the central government's economic involvement by enhancing the duties and responsibilities of the ministries. Due to Kosygin's death in 1980, and due to his successor, Tikhonov, conservative approach to economics, very little of the reform was actually carried out.<ref>{{cite web | author = <U+044E><U+0442><U+0443><U+0431><U+0430>, <U+043B><U+044E><U+0431><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> | title = 30 <U+043B><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0437><U+0430><U+0434> <U+0443><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D> | trans_title = A reformer before Yegor Gaidar?

In October 1980 Kosygin was again hospitalised. During his stay Kosygin wrote a very brief letter of resignation; the following day he was deprived of all government protection, communication, cars and other luxury goods he had earned during his political life. Kosygin died alone on 18 December 1980, none of his Politburo colleagues, former aidees or security guards visited him. At the very end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] claiming that the sitting leadership were reluctant to reform the stagnent Soviet economy. Kosygin died on 18 October 1980, his death was not announced until three-days after his death; Brezhnev was celebrating his own birthday on 19 December. He was buried in [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]].<ref name="saddeath">{{cite web | author = <U+0412><U+0435><U+0440><U+0433><U+0430><U+0441><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0424><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+0445> | title = <U+041E><U+0440><U+0433><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0437><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043D><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430> | trans_title = The Healthy Glow of Organisation | language = Russian | publisher = pseudology.org | url = http://www.pseudology.org/byvaly/ZdorovyjNakal.htm | accessdate = 4 September 2010 }}</ref> A [[state funeral]] was conducted, and Kosygin was honored by his peers; Brezhnev, [[Yuri Andropov]] and Tikhonov laid an urn containing his ashes at the [[Kremlin Wall]].<ref name="saddeath">{{cite web | author = | title = <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0413><U+0432><U+0438><U+0448><U+0438><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438>: <U+00AB><U+041D><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+043E> <U+0436><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+0442><U+044C> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>!<U+00BB> (Page 3) | trans_title = Alex Gvishiani: "Do not feel sorry for Kosygin!" | language = Russian | publisher = [[Pravda|Pravda Online]] | url = http://www.pravda.ru/society/fashion/models/19-04-2004/47012-kosygin-2/ | accessdate = 4 September 2010 | date = 9 April 2004 }}</ref>

Kosygin's moderate [[1965 Soviet economic reform|1965 reform]], as with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]], radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While [[Leonid Brezhnev]] was content with maintaining the centralised structure of the Soviet [[planned economy]]; Kosygin attempted to revitalise with reforms which would [[decentralise]] the system. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982 the reform movement was split between [[Yuri Andropov]]'s path of discipline and control, and  Gorbachev's [[liberalisation]] of all aspects of public life.<ref name="coldwarenc">{{cite book | author = van Dijk, Ruud | title = Encyclopedia of the Cold War | volum = 1 | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | year = 2008 | location = | page = 525 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&dq | isbn = 0415975158 }}</ref> 

Compared to other Soviet officials Kosygin stood out as a pragmatic and relatively independent leader. In a description given by an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] high-ranking [[GRU]] official, Kosygin is described as "a lonely and somewhat tragic figure" who "understood our faults and shortcomings of our situation in general and those in our [[Middle East]] policy in particular, but, being a highly restrained man, he preferred to be cautious." Another anonymous, this time an old co-worker of Kosygin, said; "He always had an opinion of his own, and defended it. He was a very alert man, and performed brilliantly during negotiations. He was able to cope quickly with the material that was totally new to him. I have never seen people of that calibre afterwards."<ref name="Kosyginafghanistan">{{cite book | author = Saikal, Amin | title = Modern Afghanistan: a History of Struggle and Survival | volum = | publisher = [[I.B.

In an official state visit Kosygin struck the Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] of being "Khrushchev without the rough edges, a fatherly man who was the forerunner of Mikhail Gorbachev". Moreover, he noted that Kosygin was willing to discuss issues so long that the Soviet position was not tackled head-on.<ref>{{cite book | author = Bothwell, Robert; Granatstein J.L. | title = Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | year = 1991 | location = | page = 193 | url = http://books.google.no/books?id=taZ0pK71QikC&dq | isbn = 0802068731 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Rosenberger, Chandler | title = Perspective | publisher = [[Boston University]] (Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology & Policy) | volume = 8 | number = 2 | page = | url = http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol8/Rosenberger.html | accessdate = 3 September 2010 }}</ref> Kosygin was viewed with [[sympathy]] by the Soviet people, and is at the present seen as an important figure in both Russian and Soviet history.<ref name="saddeath">{{cite web | author = | title = <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0413><U+0432><U+0438><U+0448><U+0438><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438>: <U+00AB><U+041D><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+043E> <U+0436><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+0442><U+044C> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0433><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>!<U+00BB> (Page 1) | trans_title = Alex Gvishiani: "Do not feel sorry for Kosygin!" | language = Russian | publisher = [[Pravda|Pravda Online]] | url = http://www.pravda.ru/society/fashion/models/19-04-2004/47012-kosygin-0/ | accessdate = 3 September 2010 | date = 9 April 2004 }}</ref>

During his lifetime, Kosygin received seven Orders and two Awards by the Soviet state.<ref name="peoplesrussia"/> During a [[state visit]] to [[Peru]] in the 1970s with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Andrei Gromyko]] all three of them were awarded the [[Order of the Sun (Peru)|Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun]] by President [[Francisco Morales Berm<U+00FA>dez]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Central Asian Research Centre | voume = 8 | title = USSR and third world | publisher = Central Asian Research Centre | year = 1979  (8 February 2010; digitalised) | location = [[Indiana University]] | pages = 64 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=7l7vAAAAMAAJ&q | isbn = }}</ref>
