'''New York State Route 12D''' is a north-south [[state highway|highway]] located in the northern part of the [[United States]] [[state]] of [[New York]]. The southern terminus of the route is in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] village of [[Boonville (village), New York|Boonville]], where it intersects [[New York State Route 12|NY 12]]. The northern terminus is at NY 12 in the [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]] village of [[Lyons Falls, New York|Lyons Falls]]. [[New York State Route 46|NY 46]] and [[New York State Route 294|NY 294]] are also present in the immediate area of the route's southern terminus.

NY 12D was originally assigned in the 1930s to most of what is now NY 12 between Boonville and [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]]. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped by 1947, placing NY 12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners and on [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY 12D and NY 26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY 12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing  then-NY 337.

==Route description==
NY 12D begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 12|NY 12]] at the southeastern edge of the village of [[Boonville (village), New York|Boonville]] in northern [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]. While NY 12 bypasses the village to the east, NY 12D heads northwest into the village on Main Street. At Schuyler Street, NY 12D bears west for one block to Post Street, where it intersects the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 46|NY 46]]. The eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 294|NY 294]] is located one block to the south at the junction of Post and Ford Streets. NY 12D, meanwhile, turns north at Post Street and follows the street out of the village and through the town of [[Boonville (town), New York|Boonville]] to the [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]] town of [[Leyden, New York|Leyden]].

Within Leyden, NY 12D passes through largely rural terrain with the exception of a pair of roadside communities: the hamlet of Talcottville on the [[Sugar River]], a tributary of the nearby [[Black River (New York)|Black River]], and the community of Locust Grove at the intersection of NY 12D and Locust Grove Road. The route crosses into [[West Turin, New York|West Turin]] roughly {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, where it intersects [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] at Potters Corners. NY 26 turns north here to follow the right-of-way of NY 12D; however, NY 12D turns northeast onto the right-of-way of NY 26 toward [[Lyons Falls, New York|Lyons Falls]]. Near the western edge of the village, NY 12D passes over NY 12 with no access between the two. The connection is made a short distance to the southeast via McAlpine and Cherry Streets, which NY 12D follows to terminate at NY 12.

==History==
When [[state highway]]s in [[New York]] were first signed in 1924, the north-south roadway connecting [[Boonville (village), New York|Boonville]] to [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]] via Potters Corners was designated as part of [[New York State Route 12|NY 12]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York)|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|year=1926|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> An alternate route of NY 12 between Potters Corners and Lowville via [[Lyons Falls, New York|Lyons Falls]] was assigned NY 12D as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]].<ref name=gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

The former routing of NY 12D between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls was then redesignated as '''New York State Route 337'''.<ref name=1935map>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> The routings of NY 12 and NY 12D between Boonville and Lowville were swapped by 1938.<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A.

Originally, NY 12 entered Lyons Falls on Franklin Street and followed Center and McAlpine Streets through the village before leaving the area on Cherry Street.<ref>{{cite map |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-utica-1948.jpg|title=Utica, United States - New York |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=1948 |scale=1 : 250,000 |series=Eastern United States 1 : 250,000|accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> NY 12 was rerouted onto its current alignment around the western edge of Lyons Falls by 1952;<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1952}}</ref> however, NY 337 was not truncated nor rerouted to meet the new path of NY 12.

In the early 1970s, the overlap between NY 12D and [[New York State Route 26|NY 26]] north of Potters Corners was eliminated when NY 12D was rerouted to follow NY 337 to Lyons Falls, placing NY 12D on its current alignment.<ref name=1970log /><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1974}}</ref>
