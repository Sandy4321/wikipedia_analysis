==Influence==

''Whipped Cream'' sold over 6 million copies in the United States and the album cover alone is considered a classic pop culture icon. It featured model ([[Dolores Erickson]]) wearing chiffon and shaving cream. The picture was taken at a time when Erickson was three months pregnant. The cover was so popular with Alpert fans that, during in concerts, when about to play the song "Whipped Cream", Alpert would tell the audience, "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you!"

The art was parodied by several groups including once A&M band [[Soul Asylum]], who made fun of the liner notes along with the back cover on their album ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'', comedian [[Pat Cooper]] on his album ''[http://franklarosa.com/vinyl/Exhibit.jsp?AlbumID=31 Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights]'', the [[Frivilous Five]] on a Herb Alpert tribute album, ''"[http://tralfaz-archives.com/coverart/F/frivolous_sour.html Sour Cream and Other Delights]"'' and by Peter Nero on his album, ''Peter Nero Plays a Salute to Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass''. 

The singles included the title cut and "Lollipops and Roses". Many of the songs on the album were featured on ''[[The Dating Game]]'', as in the song "Whipped Cream" as the intro to the bachelorette. "[[Spanish Flea]]", a cut from ''[[Going Places]]'', became the theme for the bachelor.

Up until this album, Alpert had utilized LA area studio musicians, to back him.  On this album 
eventual members of the Tijuana Brass (John Pisano, guitar and Bob Edmondson, trombone) were featured as well as studio vets Hal Blaine, Carol Kaye, Russell Bridges (better known as Leon Russell) and Chuck Berghofer.  With the success of "Whipped Cream" came huge demands for concert appearances.  It was at this time that Alpert formed the public version of the Tijuana Brass which included: Pisano, Edmondson, Nick Ceroli (drums), Pat Senatore (bass), Tonni Kalash (trumpet), Lou Pagani (piano) as well as Julius Wechter on marimba and vibes (studio only).

A [[remix]] of the album, ''[http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000EDWM5E.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1138734049_.jpg Whipped Cream & Other Delights Rewhipped]'', was released in 2006 on the [[Shout Factory]] label with a similarly "clothed" model on the cover.

==Miscellanea==

*Herb's partner, [[Jerry Moss]], suggested that the album be titled after food items, hence the titles of the songs.
*Also, New Orleans pianist/producer [[Allen Toussaint]] wrote "Whipped Cream" (under the pseudonym Naomi Neville), and "El Garbanzo" means "The Chick-Pea" in Spanish.
*In 2000, author [[Jack Gantos]] wrote [[Joey Pigza Loses Control]], which includes many references to ''Whipped Cream and Other Delights''. For example, in one part of the book, Joey tries to recreate the cover by covering himself in shaving cream, but realized that he didn't look like the cover. Also, he kissed everything in sync with "Love Potion No. 9", including a mailbox. He shot peanuts out of his nose while whistling "Peanuts". He also wanted to play "A Taste of Honey" on his trumpet while at the church choir practice.
*The album can be spotted in the background of various episodes of [[Freaks and Geeks]], in the living room of the Weir house.
*Comedian [[Pat Cooper]] spoofed the album cover with his LP "Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights," which featured him standing in a pile of spaghetti, splashed with tomato sauce, and grasping a bunch of bread sticks in his left hand while licking the fingers of his right.
