'''Samuel Lewis Cunningham, Jr''' (nicknamed '''"Bam"''', born [[August 15]], [[1950]], in [[Santa Barbara, CA]]) is a retired [[American football]] [[fullback (American football)|fullback]].

==College career==
Cunningham was a letterman for the [University of Southern California [USC]] University football team from 1970 through 1972 where he played [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. He was named an [[All-America]]n in 1972. He was a member of USC<U+2019>s 1972 national championship team. In the [[1973 Rose Bowl]], he scored four touchdowns, which still stands as a modern-day Rose Bowl record. He was named Rose Bowl Player of the Game. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1992

He had a notable performance (135 yards, 2 touchdowns) against an all-white [[University of Alabama]] football team, as USC beat Alabama 42-21 in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] on September 12, 1970. His performance in the game was reportedly a factor in convincing the University of Alabama and its fans to let Coach [[Bear Bryant]] integrate [[Southern United States|Southern]] football.  Jerry Claiborne, a Bryant assistant, said, "Sam Cunningham did more to integrate Alabama in 60 minutes than [[Martin Luther King]] did in 20 years."<ref>[http://usclegends.org/sam-cunningham.php USC Legends: Sam Cunningham]</ref><ref>[http://www.rosebowllegends.org/sam-cunningham.php Rose Bowl Legends: Sam Cunningham]</ref>

Despite the legend surrounding the story, in reality Bryant had already integrated his team.  [[Wilbur Jackson]], the first African-American offered a scholarship by the University of Alabama, watched the game from the stands, ineligible to play as a freshman due to NCAA rules at the time.<ref>[http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/readings/BEAR%20BRYANT.htm]</ref>

==Professional career==
In only his second year 1974, he gained 811 yards and 9 touchdowns as he led the [[New England Patriots]] to a surprising 4-0 start before faltering to a 7-7 finish. In 1977 he gained a career high 1,015 yards and scored 4 touchdowns, and also caught 42 receptions for 370 yards and a touchdown. He played his entire career (1973 through 1982) with the Patriots and was a 1978 [[Pro Bowl]] selection.

Cunningham finished his career with 5,453 rushing yards, 210 receptions for 1,905 yards, and 49 touchdowns.  He is the older brother of former NFL quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]].
