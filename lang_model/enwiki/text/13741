'''''Jonathan Creek''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] mystery series produced by the [[BBC]] and written by [[David Renwick]].  Primarily a crime drama, the show stars [[Alan Davies]] as the titular character, an eccentric magician's assistant who also solves seemingly supernatural mysteries through his talent for logical deduction and knowledge of illusionism. No matter how magical the mystery &mdash; a lock-roomed murder or a seemingly impossible theft &mdash; the detective would come up with a very down-to-earth explanation as to what happened. Although a crime drama, the series contained often broadly comical touches as well.

The series ran from 1997 to 2004, initially co-starring [[Caroline Quentin]] as Creek's collaborator, writer Maddie Magellan. After Quentin's departure in 2001, [[Julia Sawalha]] joined the cast as a new character, journalist Carla Borrego. Following a five-year hiatus, the series returned for a one-off special on 1 January 2009, "[[The Grinning Man (Jonathan Creek)|The Grinning Man]]", which featured [[Sheridan Smith]] as another paranormal investigator with whom Creek joins forces.

The cult success of the series won it the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] in 1998. It was actually notable for featuring comic characters and sub-plots which lent a lot of humour to the series. Unusually, it was produced by the BBC's in-house Entertainment department rather than the Drama department &mdash; this was because Renwick preferred working with people he knew rather than the people at Drama who might not share his vision.<ref name=WorldOfJonathanCreek>''The World of Jonathan Creek'' by Steve Clark, BBC Worldwide Ltd</ref> When the series was made, it included stars and guest-stars such as [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Jack Dee]] and [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], who are mainly associated with comedy, but who put on straight performances.

==Concept and casting==
[[David Renwick]] wanted to write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of detection rather than action, as most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time.<ref name=WorldOfJonathanCreek>''The World of Jonathan Creek'' by Steve Clark, BBC Worldwide Ltd</ref> Also, whereas most of these were about ''who did it'' (''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' or ''[[Taggart]]'') and ''why it was done'' (''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]''), this new series would be about ''how it was done'' with an element of magic thrown in, such as murders committed in [[Locked room mystery|locked rooms]], a person being in two places at once or impossible thefts; finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job but the emphasis would be on how the crime was committed.

Magic would play an important part of the series, but it would be in the form of tricks and sleight-of-hand used by stage magicians to deceive their audiences. The programme often exposed how such tricks are actually done, the way being quite "banal" compared to the trick itself.

The series would also focus on the relationship between Creek and his collaborator Maddie Magellan, a writer who often uses dishonest means in order to expose [[miscarriages of justice]]. It would be a mainly [[Platonic love|platonic]] one, though they do at some stage consummate their relationship only to agree that it must never happen again. (In his early planning, Renwick had thought that Maddie should be Creek's stepmother and that they would investigate crime in memory of his murdered father. However, he decided that the concept of the avenging son was far too "[[Batman]]" and in the series Creek's parents are mentioned as having moved to [[United States|America]].)<ref name=WorldOfJonathanCreek>''The World of Jonathan Creek'' by Steve Clark, BBC Worldwide Ltd</ref>

[[Caroline Quentin]] was Renwick's first choice for Maddie Magellan, but the casting of Creek proved something of a problem. Renwick had wanted [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]], but he turned it down. [[Rik Mayall]] was also offered the part but was, at the time, busy with stage work (he would later guest-star in a Christmas special of the series). [[Hugh Laurie]] showed a great deal of interest and agreed to take the part, but later turned it down as he could not figure out Creek's motivations for investigating the cases Maddie involves him in, especially when he shows so much reluctance in some of the episodes.<ref name=WorldOfJonathanCreek>''The World of Jonathan Creek'' by Steve Clark, BBC Worldwide Ltd</ref>

Others who were tried for the part included [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Angus Deayton]], both very popular at the time, but lacking a certain something that identified them as Creek. Almost a dozen actors were considered before producer [[Susan Belbin]] saw [[Alan Davies]] during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and "turned up in his [[duffle coat]] with straggly hair and a broad grin [and] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him".<ref name=WorldOfJonathanCreek>''The World of Jonathan Creek'' by Steve Clark, BBC Worldwide Ltd</ref>

==Plot== 
The series follows the exploits of Jonathan Creek, a designer of illusions for a [[magic (illusion)|stage magician]], and &mdash; in the first three series &mdash; Maddie Magellan, a pushy journalist, as they work together to solve crimes where others have failed.

Creek contributes his lateral thinking, and Magellan is a plausible liar who never seems to have trouble sneaking in to closed crime scenes. The programme usually features 'impossible crimes', for example an offence having been committed in a sealed environment from which no criminal could have escaped (a "[[locked room mystery]]"). Several episodes deal with paranormal thefts and murders, which Creek solves using his knowledge of misdirection and illusion, giving the character a passing resemblance to stage magician turned paranormal investigator [[James Randi]]. No matter how fantastic the crime appears to be at first, Creek finds a rational explanation.

Creek's employer is the amoral and ambitious Adam Klaus, a flamboyant performer with a sinister stage persona who is really a drug-addled, insensitive womaniser.  In some instances, his magic tricks go comically wrong.  The character appears on camera infrequently, his shenanigans usually revealed to or by Jonathan in conversation with other characters. Sub-plots in the episodes revolve around the problems that Adam gets himself into and how Jonathan has to get him out of them, such as when Adam was blackmailed by a barmaid after spending the night with her, or when he was forced to hire a midget as a bodyguard in order to appear more politically correct. Some aspects of the character were inspired by [[Ali Bongo]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

As the series progressed, Creek gradually changed from an antisocial [[anorak (slang)|anorak]] to a man with a great deal of wit and charm. This helped to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddie. Jonathan's trademark [[duffle coat]] worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Years' special.<ref>Wylie, Ian (18 December 2008).

Retrieved on 19 December 2008.</ref>
 
For the 2001 Christmas special and thereafter, Caroline Quentin declined to appear, and so a second supporting role was introduced, [[Theatre|theatrical agent]] Carla Borrego, played by [[Julia Sawalha]]. After her first appearance, the character married TV producer Brendan Baxter ([[Adrian Edmondson]]), and she became a [[Television presenter|TV presenter]].

Part of the humour comes from the fact that Jonathan often doesn't want to get involved in other people's problems, and has to be pressured into it by Maddie or Carla. In "The Scented Room",  which centred around a theft from a critic who had lambasted Adam's act, he took great delight in announcing he had solved the crime but wasn't going to tell anybody how it was done. Initially Jonathan was only brought in to investigate because he was asked by Maddie due to her having a connection to the crime, or because it involved an old friend of hers.  As time went on, he acquired a more significant reputation and was independently recruited by such varied contacts as a chief of police or the United States military.

Over time the show became noticeably darker, with Jonathan investigating psychopaths, pimps, gangsters and corrupt policemen, who stood in stark contrast to the duplicitous suburbanites of earlier series.  The [[The Grinning Man (Jonathan Creek)|2009 special]] contained a hybrid of elements from earlier and later seasons, with the more benign (if no less lethal) engineering element, somewhat reminiscent to '[[Mother Redcap]]', and the torture and murder of a young woman as she is held dangling by chains in the middle of a room.

==Music==
The distinctive [[theme music|theme tune]] is an arrangement of [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]]' ''[[Danse Macabre (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Danse Macabre]]'' by [[Julian Stewart Lindsay]], who also wrote the underscore for the first three series and the two specials.

==Similarity to other shows==
Other television programmes have utilised the same formula of a magician helping police to solve crimes<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19970615/ai_n14464919]</ref>.  The U.S.-made programme ''[[The Magician (TV series)|The Magician]]'' starring [[Bill Bixby]] aired in 1973-74, and 1986' short-lived ''[[Blacke's Magic]]'', starring [[Hal Linden]].<ref>[http://www.usfca.edu/pj/creek_corcos.htm]</ref>  Other current American series utilising a similar format include ''[[The Mentalist]]'' and ''[[Psych]]'', the latter two revolving around "mind-readers" who use their skills to help solve crimes and mysteries.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19970615/ai_n14464919]</ref>

There were two attempts to make a [[United States|U.S.]] version of ''Jonathan Creek''.  The first involved [[Castle Rock Entertainment|Castle Rock]], the production company behind series such as ''[[Seinfeld]]'', but the initial scripts were not felt good enough, and David Renwick's scripts were rejected by [[CBS]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/jonathancreek/usa/index.shtml]</ref>  The second attempt, also by Renwick, was for [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and would have included Alan Davies.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/jonathancreek/usa/index.shtml]</ref>
