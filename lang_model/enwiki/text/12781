{{nihongo|'''''Dodes'ka-den'''''|<U+3069><U+3067><U+3059><U+304B><U+3067><U+3093>|Dodesukaden|literally, "Clickety-clack"}} is a 1970 Japanese film directed by [[Akira Kurosawa]] and based on the [[Sh<U+016B>gor<U+014D> Yamamoto]]<ref>pen name of Satomu Shimizu</ref> book ''Kisetsu no nai machi'' ("The Town Without Seasons").

==Plot==

The film focuses on the lives of a variety of characters who happen to live in a [[rubbish dump]]. The first to be introduced is a mentally challenged boy who lives in a world of fantasy in which he is a [[tram]] conductor. He is both the tram and the tram driver and follows a set route and schedule through the dump; his dedication to the fantasy is fanatical. The film title refers to a Japanese [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound made by a tram or train while in motion ( "Do-desu-ka-den do-desu-ka-den do-desu-ka-den"). The sound is made by the boy as he makes his daily faux-tram route through the dump.

==Production==
''Dodesukaden'' was Kurosawa's first color film. After the success of ''[[Red Beard]]'', it took Kurosawa five years before this film appeared. Very few of the actors from Kurosawa's stock company of the 1950s and 1960s were in it, and most of the cast were relatively unknown.  ''Dodesukaden'' was unlike anything Kurosawa had made before. It gained an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]] in the [[44th Academy Awards]].<ref name="Oscars1972">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/44th-winners.html |title=The 44th Academy Awards (1972) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-27 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>  ''Dodesukaden'' was a financial failure, and came during the worst possible time in Kurosawa's life.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}   ''Dodesukaden'' was only made by the cooperation and co-producing of three other Japanese directors, [[Keisuke Kinoshita]], [[Masaki Kobayashi]], and [[Kon Ichikawa]].  {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
