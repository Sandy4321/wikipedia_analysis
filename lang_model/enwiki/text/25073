'''Audenshaw''' is a town within the [[Tameside|Metropolitan Borough of Tameside]], in [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|date=31&nbsp;July 2003|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref> It is located along the course of both the [[M60 motorway]] and the [[Ashton Canal]], {{convert|1.8|mi|km|1}} southwest of [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and {{convert|4.9|mi|km|1}} east of the city of [[Manchester]]. As at the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]], Audenshaw had a population of 13,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&Pos=2&ColRank=1&Rank=224 |title=KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas |publisher=National Statistics |accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref>

The name Audenshaw derives from Aldwin, a [[Saxons|Saxon]] personal name, combined with the [[Old English]] suffix ''shagh'' meaning woodland. [[Nico Ditch]], an [[Early Middle Ages|early-medieval]] linear earthwork possibly built as a defensive barrier against [[Vikings]], runs through the area. During the Middle Ages, Audenshaw was a division of the [[Township (England)|township]] of [[Ashton-under-Lyne|Ashton]], in the county of [[Lancashire]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Audenshaw's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Victorian era]]. In the 1870s, many of Audenshaw's inhabitants were employed in hat-making, cotton-spinning, calico-printing, and silk-weaving.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=879460&word=NULL|work=[[Great Britain Historical GIS]]|visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=2009-09-04|Descriptive Gazetteer entry for Audenshaw}}</ref> In 1894 this area became [[Audenshaw Urban District]] and in the [[poor law union]] of Ashton-under-Lyne poor law Union. In 1974 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside.

==History==
[[File:Audenshaw Reservoir, 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Audenshaw Reservoir]]
The name derives from ''Aldwin'', a [[Saxon]] name, and the [[Old English]] ''shagh'' meaning a wood.<ref name="Lewis 1848">Lewis (1848), pp.&nbsp;112&ndash;116.</ref>

[[Nico Ditch]], a medieval linear [[earthwork]], runs through the area. Stretching {{convert|6|mi}} from Ashton Moss in the east to just east of [[Stretford]] in the west, the origin of the ditch is unclear.<ref>Nevell (1998), p.&nbsp;40.</ref> According to legend, it was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869<U+2013>870.<ref>Hylton (2003), p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Despite the legend, the U-shape of the ditch&nbsp;<U+2013> as opposed to the usual V-shape of of military earthworks&nbsp;<U+2013> and the absence of an associated bank indicates that Nico Ditch was probably a boundary marker.<ref>Nevell (1998), pp.&nbsp;40<U+2013>41.</ref> Although it is thought to be earlier, the earliest documented reference to Nico Ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in Audenshaw to the monks of the [[Kersal Cell]]. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as "Mykelldiche", and a magnum fossatum, Latin for "large ditch".<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;78.</ref>

In 1877, part of the original village of Audenshaw was demolished to make way for the three [[Audenshaw Reservoirs]]. Also destroyed to allow the construction of the reservoirs was a section of Nico Ditch.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;81.</ref>

==Governance==
In 1874, the Audenshaw Local Board of Health was created in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Lancashire]]. It was succeeded by Audenshaw Urban District in 1894. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the urban district was abolished and since 1&nbsp;April 1974, Audenshaw has formed part of the [[Tameside|Metropolitan Borough of Tameside]] within the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazza.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County |publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]] |date=31&nbsp;July 2003 |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</reF>

Audenshaw is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by the [[Denton and Reddish (UK Parliament constituency)|Denton and Reddish constituency]]. Since its creation in 1983, the constituency has been held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and the current [[Member of Parliament]] is [[Andrew Gwynne]] who gained 57.4% of the vote at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/869/denton-and-reddish |title=Denton and Reddish |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>
