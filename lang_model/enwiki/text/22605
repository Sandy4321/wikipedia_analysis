'''Sittas''' ({{lang-el|<U+03A3><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C2>}}; died 538) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] military commander during the reign of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527<U+2013>565). During the [[Iberian War]] against the [[Sassanid Empire]], Sittas was given command of forces in [[Armenia]], similar to the status of [[Belisarius]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. He won a victory over the Sassanids at [[Satala]]. 

==Biography==
Sittas was the husband of [[Comito]], the elder sister of the Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], and possible father of the later empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]].<ref name=PLRESittas>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=1160<U+2013>1163}}.</ref>

Sittas's origin is obscure. [[Byzantinists]] have suggested his name was [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Thracian language|Thracian]],<ref name=PLRESittas/> but his theoretical descent from either the [[Goths]] or the [[Thracians]] is not mentioned in primary sources. He enters history in the reign of Emperor [[Justin I]] (r. 518<U+2013>527) as a ''doryphoros'' ("bodyguard") in the guard of Justinian, then ''[[magister militum]] per [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Orientem]]''.<ref name=PLRESittas/>

In 527, Sittas and [[Belisarius]] were given command of an invasion of [[Persarmenia]]. They were successful in [[looting]] the area and capturing a significant number of [[Armenians|Armenian]] prisoners. They attempted to invade the rest of the [[Marzpanate Period|Marzpanate of Armenia]] later in the year but were defeated by [[Aratius]] and Narses.<ref name=PLRESittas/> The latter should not be confused with [[Narses]], another Byzantine general under Emperor Justinian. 

In 528, Sittas was appointed in the new office of ''[[magister militum]] per [[Roman Armenia|Armeniam]]''. According to both Malalas and [[Theophanes the Confessor]], Sittas recruited his ''scriniarii'' (administrative officials) among the local Armenian populace, as he considered them more familiar with the territory.<ref name=PLRESittas/> Procopius records Sittas's victory over the [[Tzanni]], a tribe of the [[Caucasus]], which led occasional raids in neighbouring areas. Sittas successfully converted them from [[Paganism]] to [[Christianity]] and recruited the former [[Brigandage|brigands]] to the [[Byzantine army]].<ref name=PLRESittas/>

In 530, Sittas also received the office of ''magister militum praesentalis ''("Master of soldiers in the Presence [of the Emperor]"). That same year, Sittas and [[Dorotheus (magister militum)|Dorotheus]] defended [[Erzurum|Theodosiopolis]] against an invading force from the Sassanid Empire, part of the ongoing [[Iberian War]] between Emperor Justinian and the Persian [[shah]], [[Kavadh I]] (r. 488<U+2013>531). Procopius notes that the Roman forces managed to [[pillage]] the enemy camp. Sittas also defended [[Satala]] against the invasion force by attacking the larger army at its rear and forcing them to retreat ([[Battle of Satala (530)|Battle of Satala]]). The invasion was called off and the Sassanids retreated back to Persia following the two defeats.<ref name=PLRESittas/>

Following the defeat of Belisarius in the [[Battle of Callinicum]] (19 April 531), Sittas replaced him in the leadership of the Persian campaign.<ref name=PLRESittas/> Kavadh, however, died within the year, and his son and successor [[Khosrau I]] (r. 531<U+2013>579 AD) was interested in stabilizing his internal position for the time being and started negotiations for a peace. The "[[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]]" agreement (which eventually lasted ten years) was signed on September 532 on the terms of all Byzantine land lost under Emperor Justinian's rule to be returned, and the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] to pay heavy tribute in exchange for peace. The country of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] remained under Sassanid control.

Sittas received the honorific title of [[patrikios|patrician]] in 535. The same year, Sittas is credited with a victory against the [[Bulgars]] in [[Moesia]], by the Iatrus ([[Yantra River|Yantra]]). He was named an honorary [[consul]] in 536.<ref name=PLRESittas/> In 538/539, Sittas was sent back to Armenia to face a revolt in protest against heavy [[taxation]]. Failing to negotiate peace, Sittas started active fighting. In the Battle of Oenochalcon, the nature of the terrain forced both armies to fight in scattered groups rather than in unified forces. Procopius records that Sittas was killed by either [[Artabanes (general)|Artabanes]], a leader of the revolt, or Solomon, an otherwise obscure rebel.<ref name=PLRESittas/>
