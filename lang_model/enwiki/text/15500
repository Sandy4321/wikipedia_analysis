==School Vandalism==

On [[November 1]],[[2007]] the school was [[vandalized]] by its own students. Damage to the school mainly consisted of walls and windows being spray painted over. More saddening is the fact that the memorial for alumni who have died in the armed sevices was both spray painted, and hit to where some of the marble plaque is now missing. As of now all of the spray paint has been cleaned off, or painted over.
