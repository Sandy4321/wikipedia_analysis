== Countryborn ==
A community of the [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis people]] of [[Canada]], the '''Anglo-M<U+00E9>tis''', more commonly known as '''Countryborn''', were children of the fur trade; typically of [[Orkney]], [[Scottish]], or [[English people|English]] paternal descent and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] maternal descent.  Their first languages would have been aboriginal (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc.) and English.  It seems likely that some of their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of the now extinct Metis "contact language" referred to as "Bungee".

==History==
Forming communities in [[Red River Valley|Red River]] and the [[Saskatchewan Valley]], they initially had fewer problems with the expansion of the [[Canadian]] [[state]] westward during the 19th Century than their francophone brethren.  This was due to their tendency and ability to identify more with the politically and economically dominant British culture of Canada at this time.  Additionally, the Anglo-Metis/Countryborn are held to have led a somewhat more sedentary lifestyle of farming than the francophone Metis community.  Historical research indicates that the French speaking Metis were somewhat more nomadic due to their strong reliance upon the bison as a trade and food resource.  Regardless of cultural and linguistic ties to Anglo Canada the Countryborn played a role in both the [[Red River Rebellion]] (or "Red River Uprising") of [[1869]] and the [[Northwest Rebellion]] (or "Northwest Uprising") of [[1885]], suffering from the same racism and land problems as their [[francophone]] brethren. 

Through "[[ethnogenesis]]" by the 19th century the Metis, both Anglophone and [[France|French]] were culturally quite similar.  Their musical traditions, especially in the case of violin music, hail from both British Isles and French origins, as does Metis traditional dance referred to as "jigging", or the "Red River Jig".  In complexion they ranged from fair skinned, blonde and blue eyed through dark skinned, with dark hair and dark eyes.  Metis elders say that no distinctions were made between individuals based upon complexion within the community.  Family, culture, and strong identification with their Christian faith were the unifying bond amongst them.  The two communities' primary differences lay in their language, and Christian religious affliation being either  [[Protestant]], or [[Roman Catholic]] .  Most Countryborn were [[Anglican]] or [[Presbyterian]]. They were involved in a mixed economy of [[subsistence farming]] and [[bison]] hunting throughout most of the 19th century; they also found employment with the [[Hudson Bay Company]] and the [[Northwest Company]].

The Countryborn were often known in the [[19th century]] as "Mixed-Bloods", "Black Scots", "Native English", or "Halfbreeds" (a term now considered pejorative). The French Metis referred to them simply as "les metis anglais," or "les autres metis." Thus, they gradually came to see themselves as little different from their French M<U+00E9>tis brethren.  Today, the two groups are no longer politically distinct, and are commonly known on the [[Canadian Prairies]] simply as M<U+00E9>tis.

Prominent Anglo-Metis/Countryborn include [[James Isbister]], and [[John Norquay]], the  [[Premier]] of [[Manitoba]] from 1878 to 1887.
