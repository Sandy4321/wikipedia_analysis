== Moulin Neuf Industrial Equipment Facility ==
[[File:Chambly - Moulin Neuf - 2.jpg|thumb|[[SNCF]] Chambly-Moulin Neuf Industrial Equipment Facility as it is today]]
During the [[First World War]], the French military decided to establish a facility at Chambly for repairing strategic infrastructure behind the front lines. This is the origin of the Moulin Neuf works, which opened in 1916 and in 1917 was augmented with a site for the construction of track equipment (such as [[Railroad switch|point]]s) for equipping new strategic lines and repairing existing behind the lines track. Installations were overseen by the 5th Engineer Regiment, the only unit of the [[French Army]] which specialised in railway works.

At the end of the war, the military relinquished the facilities and the [[Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord|Nord company]] took possession of them again in order to rebuild their track and installations, which had suffered considerably from the years of conflict.

In 1920, wood processing facilities which had been established before the war at [[Villers-Cotter<U+00EA>ts]] were moved to Moulin Neuf. Since the railway had significant needs for treated wood, notably for making [[Railroad tie|sleeper]]s, a sawmill, a joinery and a carpentry shop were set up at Moulin Neuf, as well as facilities for impregnating and [[Creosote|creosoting]] wood and [[Chair (railway)|chair]]ing sleepers.

The facilities continued to be enlarged with the creation of an electric [[power station]], [[forge]] and machine shops, and in 1933 the works had 850 employees and included an apprentice school. Moulin Neuf provided the Nord rail network with everything necessary for construction and upkeep in terms of wood, tooling, and track.

From 1931 on, Moulin Neuf took over the functions of the former works at [[Gare d'Ermont-Eaubonne|Ermont]] and was enlarged onto another 10&nbsp;hectares, with a gantry and a workshop for [[machining]] [[Rail profile|rail]]s. At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], more than 1,000 people worked on site; in the early 1960s, 1,150.

The Nord company built 160 units of housing for their workers in a [[company town]] at Chambly between 1920 and 1930; after 1930 this grew by roughly 100 houses.

The site was bombed on several occasions, particularly in 1944. On 2 May 1944 the [[Royal Air Force]] dropped more than 1,200 explosive incendiary bombs, causing significant damage to the works.
  
In the early 1950s, the facilities for repair and manufacturing of rail track material was one of the largest in Europe. It covered more than 90&nbsp;hectares, a portion of which was within the commune of [[Le Mesnil-en-Thelle]]. The site is crisscrossed by 50&nbsp;km of track. Since 1966, it has been called the Moulin Neuf Industrial Equipment Facility.

{{As of|2010}}, it still employs 500 workers.<ref>[http://www.ville-chambly.fr/Decouvrir-Chambly/Histoire/Les-ateliers-Sncf-Moulin-Neuf Les ateliers Sncf Moulin-Neuf], Ville de Chambly, retrieved 27 June 2010 ([http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.ville-chambly.fr/article/fichedescview/308/1/47/&title=Site%20municipal%20de%20la%20ville%20de%20Chambly cached at Wikiwix]) {{fr icon}}.</ref>
