'''Mimivirus''' is a [[virus|viral]] genus containing a single identified species named '''''Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus''''' (APMV), or is a group of phylogenetically related large viruses (designated usually MimiN).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1743-422X-2-62}}</ref> In colloquial speech, APMV is more commonly referred to as just "mimivirus". Until October 2011, when a larger virus ''[[Megavirus chilensis]]'' was described, it had the largest [[capsid]] diameter of all known viruses.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's biggest virus found in sea off Chile|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/8819432/Worlds-biggest-virus-found-in-sea-off-Chile.html|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=11 November 2011|location=London|date=11 October 2011}}</ref>  Mimivirus has a large and complex [[genome]] compared with most other viruses. Mimivirus, short for "mimicking microbe", is so called to reflect its large size and apparent [[Gram-staining]] properties.<ref name='nature'>{{cite journal | title = Discovery of the Giant Mimivirus | journal = Nature Education | year = 2010 | first = D R | last = Wessner | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 61| id = | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-the-giant-mimivirus-14402410 | accessdate = 2012-01-07}}</ref>

==Discovery==
APMV was discovered serendipitously in 1992 within the [[amoeba]] ''Acanthamoeba polyphaga'', after which it is named, during research into [[Legionellosis]]. The virus was observed in a [[gram stain]] and mistakenly thought to be a [[gram-positive]] [[bacterium]]. As a consequence it was named '''Bradfordcoccus''', after the district the amoeba was sourced from in [[Bradford]], [[England]]. In 2003, researchers at the [[Universit<U+00E9> de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]] published a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' identifying the micro-organism as a virus.<ref name="LaScola2003">{{cite journal |author=La Scola B, Audic S, Robert C, Jungang L, de Lamballerie X, Drancourt M, Birtles R, Claverie JM, Raoult D.|title=A giant virus in amoebae|journal=Science|volume=299|issue=5615|pages=2033|year=2003|pmid=12663918|doi=10.1126/science.1081867}}</ref>

Mimivirus may be a causative agent of some forms of [[pneumonia]]; this is based mainly on indirect evidence in the form of [[antibodies]] to the virus discovered in pneumonia patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=La Scola B, Marrie T, Auffray J, Raoult D |title=Mimivirus in pneumonia patients |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no03/04-0538.htm |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=449<U+2013>52 |year=2005 |pmid=15757563}}</ref> However, the classification of mimivirus as a [[pathogen]] is tenuous at present as there have been only a couple of papers published potentially linking mimivirus to actual cases of pneumonia.  Indeed, a significant fraction of pneumonia cases are due to unknown [[etiology]].<ref name="Marrie1989">{{cite journal |author=Marrie TJ, Durant H, Yates L|title=Community-Acquired Pneumonia Requiring Hospitalization: 5-Year Prospective Study|journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases|volume=11|issue=4|pages=586<U+2013>99|year=1989|pmid=2772465 |doi=10.1093/clinids/11.4.586}}</ref>

==Classification==
Mimivirus has been placed into a viral family by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] as a  member of the  ''Mimiviridae'',<ref name="isbn0-12-375146-2">{{cite book |author= Claverie J-M |editor=Mahy W.J. and Van Regenmortel M. H. V. |others= |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|edition= 1|publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2010 |pages= 189 }}</ref> and has been placed into [[Virus classification#Group I|Group I]] of the [[Baltimore classification]] system.<ref name="isbn1-4051-3645-6">{{cite book |author=Leppard, Keith; Nigel Dimmock; Easton, Andrew |title=Introduction to Modern Virology |edition= 6|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited |year=2007 |pages= 469<U+2013>470}}</ref>
Although not strictly a method of classification, Mimivirus joins a group of large viruses known as [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] (NCLDV). They are all large viruses which share both molecular characteristics and large genomes. The mimivirus genome also possesses 21 genes encoding homologs to proteins which are seen to be highly conserved in the majority of NCLDVs, and further work suggests that mimivirus is an early divergent of the general NCLDV group.<ref name="LaScola2003" />

==Structure==
The mimivirus is the second-largest virus, preceded by the recently discovered ''[[Megavirus|Megavirus chilensis]]'', and has a [[capsid]] diameter of 400 [[Nanometre|nm]]. Protein filaments measuring 100&nbsp;nm project from the surface of the capsid, bringing the total length of the virus up to 600&nbsp;nm. Variation in scientific literature renders these figures as highly approximate, with the "size" of the [[virion]] being casually listed as anywhere between 400&nbsp;nm and 800&nbsp;nm, depending on whether total length or capsid diameter is actually quoted. The capsid appears hexagonal under an [[electron microscope]], therefore the [[virus#Structure|capsid symmetry]] is icosahedral.<ref name="Xiao2009">{{cite journal |author=Xiao C, Kuznetsov YG, Sun S, Hafenstein SL, Kostyuchenko VA, Chipman PR, Suzan-Monti M, Raoult D, McPherson A, Rossmann MG |title=Structural Studies of the Giant Mimivirus |journal=PLoS Biol. |date=2009-04-28 |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=e92 |pmid=19402750 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000092 |pmc=2671561 |editor1-last=Sugden |editor1-first=Bill}}</ref> It does not appear to possess an outer viral envelope, suggesting that the virus does not exit the host cell by [[exocytosis]].<ref name="Suzan-Monti2006">{{cite journal |author=Suzan-Monti M, La Scola B, Raoult D |title=Genomic and evolutionary aspects of Mimivirus |journal=Virus Research |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=145<U+2013>155 |year=2006 |pmid=16181700 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2005.07.011}}</ref>

The same team that discovered the mimivirus later discovered a slightly larger virus, dubbed the [[mamavirus]],
and the [[Sputnik virophage]] that infects it.<ref>

Mimivirus shares several morphological characteristics with all members of the NCLDV group of viruses. As an internal lipid layer surrounding the central core is present in all other NCLDV viruses, it has been suggested by M. Suzan-Monti et al. that this may also be present in mimivirus. The condensed central core of the virion appears as a dark region under the electron microscope. The large genome of the virus resides within this area.

Several [[mRNA]] transcripts can be recovered from purified virions. Like other NCLDVs, transcripts for [[DNA polymerase]], a capsid protein and a TFII-like [[transcription factor]] were found. However, three distinct [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] enzyme transcripts and four unknown mRNA molecules specific to mimivirus were also found. These pre-packaged transcripts can be [[translation (genetics)|translated]] without viral gene expression and are likely to be necessary to Mimivirus for replication. Other [[DNA virus]]es, such as the ''[[Cytomegalovirus|Human cytomegalovirus]]'' and ''[[Herpes simplex|Herpes simplex virus type-1]]'', also feature pre-packaged mRNA transcripts.<ref name="Suzan-Monti2006" />

==Genome==
The mimivirus genome is a linear, double-stranded molecule of [[DNA]] with 1,181,404 [[base pair]]s in length.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Overview&list_uids=18057 |title=Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, complete genome |publisher=NCBI}}</ref> This makes it the largest viral genome in scientific knowledge, outstripping the next-largest virus genome of the [[Cafeteria roenbergensis virus|''Cafeteria roenbergensis'' virus]] by about 450,000 base pairs. In addition, it is larger than at least 30 cellular [[clade]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Claverie |first=Jean-Michel |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2006 |month= |title=Mimivirus and the emerging concept of 'giant' virus |journal=Virus Research |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=133<U+2013>144 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2006.01.008 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16469402 }}</ref>

In addition to the large size of the genome, mimivirus possesses an estimated 979 protein-coding [[gene]]s, far exceeding the minimum 4 genes required for viruses to exist (''c.f.'' [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] and [[Bacteriophage Q<U+03B2>|Q<U+03B2>]] viruses).<ref>{{cite book |title=Microbiology |last=Prescott |first=Lansing M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers |location=Dubuque, IA |isbn=0-697-01372-3 |pages= |url= |editor=2nd edition }}</ref> Analysis of its genome revealed the presence of genes not seen in any other viruses, including aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and other genes previously thought only to be encoded by cellular organisms. Like other large DNA viruses, mimivirus contains several genes for sugar, lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as some metabolic genes not found in any other virus.<ref name="Suzan-Monti2006" /> Roughly 90% of the genome was of coding capacity, with the other 10% being "[[junk DNA]]".

==Replication==
The stages of mimivirus replication are not well known, but as a minimum it is known that mimivirus attaches to a [[receptor (biochemistry)|chemical receptor]] on the surface of an amoeba cell and is taken into the cell. Once inside, an ''eclipse phase'' begins, in which the virus disappears and all appears normal within the cell. After about four hours small accumulations can be seen in areas of the cell. Eight hours after infection many mimivirus virions are clearly visible within the cell. The cell [[cytoplasm]] continues to fill with newly synthesised virions and about 24 hours after initial infection the cell likely bursts open to release the new mimivirus virions.<ref name="Suzan-Monti2006" />

Little is known about the details of this replication cycle, most obviously attachment to the cell surface and entry, viral core release, DNA replication, transcription, translation, assembly and release of progeny virions. However, scientists have established the general overview given above using [[electron micrograph]]s of infected cells. These micrographs show mimivirus capsid assembly in the nucleus, acquisition of an inner lipid membrane via budding from the nucleus, and particles similar to those found in many other viruses, including all NCLDV members. These particles are known in other viruses as ''viral factories'' and allow efficient viral assembly by modifying large areas of the host cell.

==Implications for defining "life"==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Mimivirus possesses many characteristics which place it at the boundary of living and non-living. It is as large as several bacterial species, such as ''[[Rickettsia|Rickettsia conorii]]'' and ''[[Whipple disease|Tropheryma whipplei]]'', possesses a genome of comparable size to several bacteria, including those above, and codes for products previously not thought to be encoded by viruses. In addition, mimivirus possesses genes coding for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, which even some small obligate intracellular bacteria lack. This means that unlike these bacteria, mimivirus is not dependent on the host cell genome for coding the metabolic pathways for these products.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} They do however, lack genes for ribosomal proteins, making mimivirus dependent on a host cell for protein translation and energy metabolism.

Because its lineage is very old and could have emerged prior to cellular organisms,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} ''Mimivirus'' has added to the debate over the [[Origin of life|origins of life]]. Some genes unique to ''Mimivirus'', including those coding for the capsid, have been conserved in a variety of viruses which infect organisms from all domains. This has been used to suggest that ''Mimivirus'' is related to a type of DNA virus that emerged before cellular organisms and played a key role in the development of all life on Earth.<ref name="Siebert2006">{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Siebert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Unintelligent Design |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/mar/unintelligent-design |work=Discover Magazine |publisher= |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate= }}</ref> An alternative hypothesis is that there were three distinct types of DNA viruses that were involved in generating the three known [[Domain (biology)|domains]] of life - [[eukarya]], [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].<ref name="Forterre2006">{{cite journal |last=Forterre |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |month= |title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: A hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |pmid=16505372 |volume=103 |issue=10 |pmc=1450140 |pages=3669<U+2013>3674 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref>

Nevertheless, mimivirus does not exhibit the following characteristics, all of which are part of many conventional [[Life#Definitions|definitions of life]]: [[homeostasis]], energy metabolism, response to stimuli, autopoiesis, growth in the normal sense of the term (instead replicating via self-assembly of individual components) or undergoing cellular division.
