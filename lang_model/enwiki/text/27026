'''M-44''' is a {{convert|37.4|mi|km|adj=on|lk=on}} highway in the [[West Michigan|western region]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] that runs northward from the intersection of [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]], 28th street and [[M-37 (Michigan highway)|M-37]] toward the [[Rockford, Michigan|Rockford]] area. The highway then turns eastward to [[Belding, Michigan|Belding]], and it ends six miles north of [[Ionia, Michigan|Ionia]] at [[M-66 (Michigan highway)|M-66]]. M-44 is known in Grand Rapids as the "East Beltline" and intersects with its cousin highway, [[M-44 Connector (Michigan highway)|Connector M-44]], in [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield Township]]. This highway runs concurrently and redundantly with M-37 between M-11 and [[Interstate 96|I-96]].

==Route description==
M-44 starts at the intersection of 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue in [[Kentwood, Michigan|Kentwood]]. M-11 runs east and west along 28th Street and M-37 runs south along Broadmoor Avenue as the continuation of East Beltline. M-44 and M-37 run together on East Beltline Avenue north. This intersection is also the location of the Woodview Mall in Kentwood. For here north, M-37/M-44 runs along a four-lane divided boulevard intersecting [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]] at M-21's western terminus. Just north of this intersection is I-96 exit 38. M-37 leaves East Beltline Avenue and runs long I-96 just east of the I-96/[[Interstate 196|I-196]] split. M-44 continues north along East Beltline Avenue. At Plainfield Avenue, it meets CONN M-44.M-44 turns eastward near Rockford and crosses the county line between [[Grattan, Michigan|Grattan]] and [[Cooks Corners, Michigan|Cooks Corners]]. In Belding, M-44 meets [[M-91 (Michigan highway)|M-91]] and then ends north of [[Ionia, Michigan|Ionia]] at M-66.

==History==
M-44 was first designated in 1920 beginning at [[M-13 (Michigan highway)|M-13]] (later [[U.S. Route 131|US 131]]) from Rockford to Belding. Near [[Orleans, Michigan|Orleans]], M-44 turned south into town and ended at [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]]. The segment near Orleans was realigned to end at [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]] (now M-66) in Woods Corners. M-44 was extended along East Beltine Avenue concurrently with US 131 to end at a junction with US 131/M-11/M-21/M-37 in Grand Rapids. The next year, M-44 was moved along M-21/Fulton Street and then with M-21 to M-11/28th Street when US 131 was moved off East Beltline Avenue to Plainfield Avenue. The M-21 concurrency only lasted until 1964 when M-21 was moved to [[Interstate 196|I-196]].

US 131 was moved to the freeway alignment in 1969. The former US 131/M-44 was redesignated as M-44 and the Plainfield Avenue segment became CONN M-44. M-37 was rerouted as well up East Beltline from M-11 along M-44 to I-96. M-44 officially stays on East Beltline as a redundant concurrency until 1977. The signs for M-44 along the M-37/East Beltline Avenue concurrency were removed. They would be replaced in August 2003 as part of a sign rehabilitation.<ref name="bessert"/>
