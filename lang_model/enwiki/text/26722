In [[Jainism]], Diwali marks the attainment of [[moksa]] by  [[Mahavira]] in 527 BC.<ref>{{citation | year=2006 | title = Fairs and Festivals of India | author1=S.P.

Diwali has been significant in [[Sikhism]] since the illumination of the town of [[Amritsar]] commemorating the return of [[Guru Har Gobind|Guru Har Gobind Ji]] (1595-1644), the sixth Guru of Sikhism, who was imprisoned along with 52 other Hindu kings at Fort Gwalior by Emperor [[Jahangir]]. After freeing the other prisoners, he went to the [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple) in the holy city of Amritsar, where he was welcomed happily by the people who lit candles and divas to greet the Guru. Because of this, Sikhs often refer to Diwali also as Bandi Chhorh Divas - "the day of release of detainees."

The festival is also celebrated by Buddhists in [[Nepal]], a majority-Hindu country, particularly the [[Newar]] [[Buddhists]]. 
 
In India and Nepal, Diwali is now considered to be a national festival, and the aesthetic aspect of the festival is enjoyed by most Indians and Nepalese regardless of faith.<ref>[http://festivals.iloveindia.com/diwali/history-of-diwali.html History of Diwali]</ref> 

On the day of Diwali / Deepavali, many wear new clothes and share sweets and snacks. Some North Indian business communities start their financial year on Diwali and new account books are opened on this day.

==Occasion==
[[File:Diwali fireworks 3.jpg|thumb|Fireworks on the occasion of Diwali]]

As per [[Hindu calendar]], the five day festival of Diwali is centered on the new moon day that ends the month of [[Ashwin]] and begins the month of [[Kartika]], beginning on the 13th day of the dark half of [[Ashwin]] (Ashwin 28th) and ending on the 2nd day of the bright half of [[Kartika]] (Kartika 2nd).  The main day of celebration varies regionally.<ref>[http://www.mahavidya.ca/?page_id=80 mahavidya:Resources for the Scholarly Study of the Hindu Tradition - Divali]</ref><ref>[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/deepavali.html When is Deepavali (Diwali)?]</ref>

Kidha is celebrated for a differing number of days by different communities. Though the core days are common and fall on exactly the same set of days across Nepal and India, they fall in different Gregorian months depending on the version of the Hindu calendar being used in the region. 
The ''Amanta'' ("ending on the new-moon") version of the [[Hindu Calendar]] has been adopted as the Indian national calendar. According to this calendar, which is prevalent in [[southern India]] and [[Maharashtra]], the 6-day celebration is spread over the last four days of the month of [[Ashwin]]a and the first two days of the new month of [[Kartika]]. According to the ''Purnimaanta'' ("ending on the full-moon") version prevalent in [[northern India]], it falls in the middle of the month of Ashwayuja/Ashvin. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it falls generally in the months of October or November. In Nepal, it is celebrated according to [[Nepal Sambat|Nepalese calendar]]. The festival marks the last three days and the first two days of Nepalese era.

==In Hinduism==
While Diwali is popularly known as the "festival of lights", the most significant spiritual meaning is "the awareness of the inner light".

Central to Hindu philosophy is the assertion that there is something beyond the physical body and mind which is pure, infinite, and eternal, called the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. Just as we celebrate the birth of our physical being, Diwali is the celebration of this inner light, in particular the knowing of which outshines all darkness (removes all obstacles and dispels all ignorance), awakening the individual to one's true nature, not as the body, but as the unchanging, infinite, [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] reality. With the realization of the Atman comes universal compassion, love, and the awareness of the oneness of all things (higher knowledge). This brings Ananda (inner joy or peace).

The gunas are the underlying forces or tendencies which one needs to have unaffected, direct relation with in order to find effectiveness and righteousness in life: they are lines of potential and illuminate thought and action, thus the inner meaning of Diwali being the festival of lights.

Diwali celebrates this through festive fireworks, lights, flowers, sharing of sweets, and worship. While the story behind Diwali varies from region to region, the essence is the same - to rejoice in the inner light ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) or the underlying reality of all things ([[Brahman]]).
[[Image:Krishna Narakasura.jpg|thumb|300px|Krishna and Satyabhama fighting Narakasura's armies -Painting from the [[Metropolitan Museum]]]]
[[Hindu]]s have several significant events associated with it:
* '''The Killing of Narakasura''': Celebrated as Narak Chaturdashi, one day before Diwali day, it commemorates the killing of [[Narakasura]], an evil demon who created havoc, by  [[Krishna]]'s wife [[Satyabhama]]. This happened in the [[Dwapara Yuga]] during this time of  Krishna's [[avatar]]. In another version, the demon was killed by Krishna ( Krishna provokes his wife Satyabhama to kill Narshna defeating [[Indra]]: Govardhan Puja is celebrated the day after Diwali. It is the day Krishna defeated Indra, the deity of thunder and rain. As per the story, Krishna saw huge preparations for the annual offering to Lord Indra and questions his father Nanda about it. He debated with the villagers about what their 'dharma' truly was. They were farmers, they should do their duty and concentrate on farming and protection of their cattle. He continued to say that all human beings should merely do their 'karma', to the best of their ability and not pray for natural phenomenon. The villagers were convinced by Krishna, and did not proceed with the special puja (prayer). Indra was then angered, and flooded the village. Krishna then lifted Mt Govardhan and held it up as protection to his people and cattle from the rain. Indra finally accepted defeat and recognized Krishna as supreme. This aspect of Krishna's life is mostly glossed over {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} but it set up the basis of the 'karma' philosophy later detailed in the ''[[Bhagavat Gita]]''. 

=== The Five days ===
Diwali celebrations are spread over five days<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/festivals/diwali/details.php|work=hindujagruti.org|title= Importance of various days of Diwali|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> in India and all over the world. All the days except Diwali are named according to their designation in the [[Hindu]] calendar. 

[[File:Lanterns-at-Durpan-stores.gif|thumb|right|Diwali being festival of lights, across India people celebrate it via symbolic diyas or [[kandil]]s (colorful paper lanterns) as an integral part of Diwali decorations.]]
[[File:The Rangoli of Lights.jpg|thumb|[[Rangoli]], decorations made from colored powder, is popular during Diwali]]
# ''Vasu Baras'' (27 ''[[Ashvin]]'' or 12 ''[[Paksha|Krishna Paksha]] [[Ashvin]]''): Baras means 12th day and vasu means cow. On this day cow and calf are worshipped.
# ''[[Dhanteras|Dhanatrayodashi or Dhan teras]]'' (28 ''[[Ashvin]]'' or 13 ''[[Paksha|Krishna Paksha]] [[Ashvin]]''): Dhan means "wealth" and Trayodashi means "13th day". Thus, as the name implies, this day falls on the 13th day of the second half of the lunar month. It is an auspicious day for shopping of utensils and gold.This day is also regarded as the Jayanti of God Dhanvantri who came out during the churning of the great ocean by the gods and the demons. 
# ''[[Naraka Chaturdashi]]'' (29 ''[[Ashvin]]'' or 14 ''[[Paksha|Krishna Paksha]] [[Ashvin]]''): ''Chaturdashi'' is the fourteenth day on which demon Narakasura was killed by god [[Krishna]] - an inacranation of god [[Vishnu]]. It signifies the victory of good over evil and light over darkness (Gujarati: Kali Chaudas, Rajasthan : Roop Chaudas). In south India, this is the actual day of festivities. Hindus wake up well before dawn, as early as two in the morning, have a fragrant oil bath and wear new clothes. They light small lamps all around the house and draw elaborate [[kolam]]s /[[rangoli]]s outside their homes. They perform a special [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] with offerings to Krishna or Vishnu, as he liberated the world from the demon Narakasura on this day. It is believed that taking a bath before sunrise, when the stars are still visible in the sky is equivalent to taking a bath in the holy [[Ganges]].  After the puja, children burst firecrackers heralding the defeat of the demon. As this is a day of rejoicing, many will have very elaborate breakfasts and lunches and meet family and friends.
# ''[[Lakshmi Puja]]'' (30 ''[[Ashvin]]'' or 15 ''[[Paksha|Krishna Paksha]] [[Ashvin]]''): Lakshmi Puja marks the most important day of Diwali celebrations in North India.  Hindu homes worship [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth, and [[Ganesh]], the God of auspicious beginnings, and then light lamps all across the streets and homes to welcome prosperity and well-being.
# ''[[Bali Pratipada]]'' and ''[[Govardhan Puja]]'' (1 ''[[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]'' or 1 ''[[Paksha|Shukla Paksha]] [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]'') : In North India, this day is celebrated as Govardhan Puja, also called ''Annakut'', is celebrated as the day [[Krishna]] - an incaranation of god [[Vishnu]] - defeated god [[Indra]] and by the lifting of [[Govardhana hill]] to save his kinsmen and cattle from rain and floods. For ''Annakut'', a mountain of food is decorated symbolizing Govardhan hill lifted by Krishna. In [[Maharashtra]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]], it is celebrated as Bali-Pratipada or Bali Padyami. The day commemorates the victory of Vishnu in his dwarf form [[Vamana]] over demon-king [[Mahabali|Bali]], who was pushed to the nether world and the return of Bali to earth from the nether-world. In Maharashtra, it is called as ''Padava'' or ''Nava Diwas'' ("new day"). Men present gifts to their wives on this day.  It is celebrated as the first day of the [[Vikram Samvat]] calender, in [[Gujarat]].  
# ''[[Bhaiduj]]'' (also Bhayyaduj, Bhaubeej or Bhayitika) (2 ''[[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]''or 2 ''[[Paksha|Shukla Paksha]] [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]''): on this day, brothers and sisters meet to express their love and affection for each other (Gujarati: Bhai Bij, Bengali: Bhai Phota). It is based on a story when Yam, lord of Death, visited his sister Yami. Yami welcomed yam with an Aarti and they had a feast together. Yam gave a gift to Yami while leaving as a token of his appreciation. So, the day is also called 'YAM DWITIYA'. Most Indian festivals bring together families, Bhaiduj brings together  sisters and brothers, and is a significant festive day for them. This festival is ancient, and pre-dates '[[Raksha Bandhan]]' another brother-sister festival celebrated in the present day.

=== Lakshmi Puja ===
[[File:Diwalipuja.jpg|thumb|Goddess [[Lakshmi]] (left) worshipped with [[Ganesha]] (left)]] 
{{Main|Lakshmi Puja}}
Diwali marks the end of the harvest season in most of India and Nepal. Farmers are thankful for the plentiful bounty of the year gone by, and pray for a good harvest for the year to come. Traditionally this marked the closing of accounts for businesses dependent on the agrarian cycle, and the last major celebration before winter. [[Lakshmi]] symbolizes wealth and prosperity, and her blessings are invoked for a good year ahead. 

There are two legends that associate the worship of Lakshmi on this day. According to the first legend, on this day, Lakshmi emerged from Kshira Sagar, the Ocean of Milk, during the great churning of the oceans, [[Samudra manthan]]. The second legend (more popular in western India) relates to the [[Vamana]] avatar of [[Vishnu]], the incarnation he took to kill the demon king [[Mahabali|Bali]]. Thereafter it was on this day, that Vishnu came back to his abode, the [[Vaikuntha]]; so those who worship Lakshmi on this day, get the benefit of her benevolent mood, and are blessed with mental, physical and material well-being.<ref>[http://www.indiaexpress.com/faith/festivals/dhistory.html Diwali History]</ref>

As per spiritual references, on this day "Lakshmi-panchayatan" enters the Universe. Vishnu, Indra,  Kubera, Gajendra and  Lakshmi are elements of this "panchayatan" (a group of five). Add more
The tasks of these elements are:
* Lakshmi: Divine Energy ([[Shakti]]) which provides energy to all the above activities.
* Vishnu: Happiness (happiness and satisfaction)
* [[Kubera]]: Wealth (Generosity; one who gives away wealth)
* [[Indra]]: Opulence (satisfaction due to wealth)
* Gajendra: Carries the wealth

== In Jainism ==
[[Image:PavaPansara.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of Pava temple at Pansara.
Mahavira attained Nirvana at [[Pawapuri|Pava]].]]
Diwali has a very special significance in [[Jainism]], just like [[Buddha Purnima]], the date of Buddha's [[Nirvana]], is for Buddhists as [[Easter]] is for Christians. [[Lord Mahavira]], the last of the [[Jain]] [[Tirthankar]]as, attained [[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]] on this day at [[Pavapuri]] on Oct. 15, 527 BC, on Chaturdashi of Kartika, as Tilyapannatti of [[Yativrsabha|Yativrashaba]] from the sixth century states:

Mahavira is responsible for establishing the [[Dharma]] followed by Jains even today. According to tradition, the chief disciple of [[Mahavira]], Ganadhara [[Gautam Swami]] also attained complete knowledge (Kevalgyana) on this day, thus making Diwali one of the most important Jain festivals.   

Mahavira attained his nirvana at the dawn of the [[amavasya]] (new moon). According to the [[Kalpasutra]] by [[Acharya]] [[Bhadrabahu]], 3rd century BC, many gods were present there, illuminating the darkness<ref>{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of the East|volume=22: Gaina Sutras Part I|first=Hermann|last=Jacobi|year=1884}}</ref>. The following night was pitch black without the light of the gods or the moon. To symbolically keep the light of their master's knowledge alive:

<blockquote>
16 Gana-kings, 9 Malla and 9 Lichchhavi, of Kasi and Kosal, illuminated their doors. They said: "Since the light of knowledge is gone, we will make light of ordinary matter" ("<U+0917><U+092F><U+0947> <U+0938><U+0947> <U+092D><U+0935><U+0941><U+091C><U+094D><U+091C><U+094B><U+092F><U+0947>, <U+0926><U+0935><U+094D><U+0935><U+0941><U+091C><U+094D><U+091C><U+094B><U+092F><U+0902> <U+0915><U+0930><U+093F><U+0938><U+094D><U+0938><U+092E><U+094B>").
</blockquote>

Dipavali was first mentioned in [[Jain]] books as the date of the [[nirvana]] of  [[Mahavira]]. In fact, the oldest reference to Diwali is a related word, dipalikaya, which occurs in Harivamsha-Purana, written by Acharya [[Jinasena]] <ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian literature|volume=2|year=1988|first=Sahitya|last=Akademi|isbn=8126011947}}</ref> and composed in the [[Saka Era|Shaka Samvat]] era in the year 706.

<blockquote>
Translation: The gods illuminated Pavanagari by lamps to mark the occasion. Since that time, the people of Bharat celebrate the famous festival of "Dipalika" to worship the Jinendra (i.e. Lord Mahavira) on the occasion of his nirvana.
</blockquote>

Dipalikaya roughly translates as "light leaving the body". Dipalika, which can be roughly translated as "splenderous light of lamps", is used interchangeably with the word "Diwali".

The way Jains celebrate Diwali is different in many respects. There is a note of asceticism in whatever the Jains do, and the celebration of Diwali is not an exception. The Jains celebrate Diwali during the month of Kartik for three days. During this period, among the Shvetambaras, devoted Jains observe fasting and chant the Uttaradhyayan Sutra, which contain the final pravachans of Lord Mahavira, and meditate upon him. Some Jains visit [[Pavapuri]] in Bihar where he attained Nirvan. In may temples special laddus are offered particularly on this day.

'''Vira Nirvana [[Samvat]]''': The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Vira Nirvana [[Samvat]] 2534 starts with Diwali 2007. The Jain businesspeople traditionally started their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya [[Virasena]]:<br>

On 21 October 1974 the 2500th Nirvana Mahotsava was celebrated by all the Jain throughout India<ref name="N. Upadhye, Review 1982 pp. 231-232"/>.

==Significance in Sikhism==
The story of Diwali for the [[Sikhs]] is a story of the Sikh struggle for freedom. From the time of [[Guru Nanak]] (1469 <U+2013> 1539), the founder of [[Sikhism]].When the Muslim king was ruling he locked up the Guru but while the king had tried to make him eat he refused and fasted. It was then realized that outside the palace people had gathered around with lanterns, candles, torches and protested to set the Guru free and the king had eventually agreed that his greediness had got in the way of his responsibilities and released the Guru and the people celebrated his release known as Diwali.
===Bandi Chhorh Divas===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Deepawali.jpg|thumb|right|Shri Darbar Sahib, [[Amritsar]] being lit up for Diwali.]] -->
For [[Sikhs]], Diwali is particularly important because it celebrates the release from prison of the sixth guru, [[Guru Hargobind Ji]], (hence also called "'''Bandi Chorr Devas'''" or "the day of release of detainees") and 52 other princes with him, from the Gwalior Fort in 1619.

The Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] had imprisoned Guru Har Gobind Ji and 52 other rajas (princes). Emperor Jahangir had imprisoned the sixth Guru because he was afraid of the Guru's growing, following and power. The Emperor was asked to release Guru Hargobind which he agreed to do. However, Guru Hargobind asked that the princes be released also. The Emperor agreed, but said only those who could hold onto his cloak tail would be allowed to leave the prison. This was in order to limit the number of prisoners who could leave.

However, Guru Hargobind had made a large cloak with 52 tassels and so each prince was able to hold onto one tassel and leave prison.

Sikhs celebrated the return of Guru Hargobind Ji by lighting the Golden Temple and this tradition continues today.

===Martyrdom of Bhai Mani Singh Ji===
{{Main|Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh}}
An important [[Sikh]] event associated with Diwali is the martyrdom of the elderly Sikh scholar and strategist [[Bhai Mani Singh]] in [[1737]].  Bhai Mani Singh was the [[Granthi]] (keeper/reader of Sikh scripture) of Harmandir Sahib (popularly known as the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]]). He transcribed the final version of [[Guru Granth Sahib]] dictated to him by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] in 1704.

Bhai Mani Singh assumed charge of [[Harmandir Sahib]]'s management in 1708. In 1737, he received permission from Zakariya Khan, the then [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of Punjab, to hold a religious gathering of the [[Khalsa]] for celebrating ''Bandi Chhorh Diwas'' on the auspicious day of Diwali for a large tax of 5000 [[Rupees]]. He expected to put together the required sum from contribution made by the Sikhs who would assemble that day. But on discovered Zakariya Khan's plot to kill the Sikhs during the gathering, he sent out messages warning them not to turn up for the meeting. As a result the tax could not be paid and Zakariya Khan ordered Bhai Mani Singh's execution at [[Lahore]]. 

Ever since the Bandi Chhorh Diwas celebrated during Diwali is also commemorated the martyrdom of [[Bhai Mani Singh]]. It is also believed that this event along with other Sikh martyrdoms gave further momentum to the Khalsa struggle for freedom and eventual success in establishing the Khalsa rule in the north of [[Delhi]].

===Uprising against the Mughal Empire===
The festival of Diwali became the second most important day after the [[Baisakhi]], when [[Khalsa]] was formally established by the Tenth [[Guru Gobind Singh]] in 1699.

The Sikh struggle against [[Mughal Empire]]'s atrocities on non-Muslims, especially on Sikhs, which intensified in the 18th century, came to be centered around this day. After the execution of [[Banda Bahadur]] in 1716, who had led the agrarian uprising in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], the Sikhs started the tradition of deciding matters concerning the community at the biennial meetings which took place at [[Amritsar]] on the first of Baisakh and at Diwali. These assemblies were known as the [[Sarbat Khalsa]] and a resolution passed by it became a [[gurmata]] (decree of the Guru).

==Diwali in different regions of India==

The celebrations vary in different regions:

===In South India ===

* In [[Southern India]], ''narakasura vratha'' is the main day, with celebration with firecrackers at dawn after lakshmi puja.
* Deepavali is one of the seven most important festivals of [[Andhra Pradesh]].Diwali festival is very popular among the children for the joy of bursting fire crakers. Special areas to sell fire crackers are set up in all towns and cities including bigger villages. There are some pseudo-traditional customs followed such as buying new clothes for this festival. Buying new home or vehicles such as cars and trucks is considered auspicious. Special sweets are made too. Some eateries in [[Hyderabad,_India|Hyderabad]] make some delicious sweets during Diwali which will not be available at any other time. Meat and alcohol are generally not consumed. Tradition has it that Andhraites gift sweets during Diwali. Some areas host local stage story telling called Hari Katha. Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fire crackers. This will be burst by a person wearing the dress of Lord Krishna or more accurately, a costume of [[Satyabhama]], the consort of [[Lord Krishna]] who actually killed the demon [[Narakasura]]; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations. The evening of Diwali is a colourful sight to watch the evening sky. 
* The main festival in Karnataka is on the first day -Narakachaturdashi and  third day- Balipadyami, with no celebration on the middle day of ''Amavasye''. The festivities begin a day, during which water is stored (following the tradition, since running water was not available with ease, and it had to be carried from nearby ponds and lakes) for the next day's oil bath in the early hours of the morning. Then the entire house is cleaned and new clothes are purchased for the entire family (signifies becoming a new/better person by giving up darkness within us) which is followed by lighting of oil lamps around the house and bursting firecrackers.
* The third day is celebrated as [[Bali Padyami]] as the day of Vamana's victory over '[[Mahabali]]'. This festival is greatly celebrated in Karnataka.
* In Tamil Nadu it is celebrated as Deepavali. Celebrate this with lighting deepams, firecrackers, wearing new dresses and Sweets. It is a big festival in Tamil Nadu. They Take Oil bath early in the morning and poosai. After that Crackers and a traditional Visit to the Temple.

===In Maharashtra===
In [[Maharashtra]], Diwali starts from ''Vasubaras'' which is the 12th day of the 2nd half of the month of ''Ashwin''. This day is celebrated by performing an ''[[Aarti]]'' of the cow and its calf- which is a symbol of love between mother and her baby.

The next day is ''Dhanatrayodashi''or ''Dhanteras''. This day is of special importance for traders and business people. 

The 14th day of ''Ashwin'' is ''Narakchaturdashi''.  On this day, people wake up before sunrise and bathe after rubbing scented oil on their body (they also bathe using ''[[Utna]]'').  After this the entire family visits a temple and offers prayers to their God.  After this visit, everyone feasts on ''Faral'' which is a special Diwali preparation consisting of delectable sweets such as "''karanji''", "''ladoo''", "''shankarpale''", 'anarase' and "''mithai''" as well as some spicy eatables like "''chakli''", "''shev''" 'kadboli' and "''chivda''".

The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] performs a token bidding called ''Muhurta'' bidding.  Generally the traders do not make any payments on that day (according to their belief ''Lakshmi'' should not be given away but must come home).  In every household, cash, jewellery and an idol of the goddess Lakshmi is worshipped.  Friends, neighbours and relatives are invited over and celebrations are in full swing.  The broom used to clean one's house is also worshipped as a symbol of Lakshmi in some places . 

''Padwa' is the 1st day of the new month - ''Kartik'' in the Hindu calendar. It marks the start of Hindu financial year. Its a special day for Husband and wife. The wife puts tika on her husbands forehead and gets an expensive gift.

''Bhaubeej'' - it is the time  where in the bond of love between a brother and sister is further strengthened as the sister asks God for her brother/s long and successful life while she receives presents from her beloved brother/s. 

Homes are cleaned and decorated before ''Diwali''.   Offices perform ''puja''.  Bonuses and holidays are granted to employees on these auspicious days.

Diwali is celebrated in various parts of the world, in countries such as [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Suriname]], [[Canada]], [[Guyana]], [[Kenya]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]],  [[Singapore]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Jamaica]],  [[Thailand]], [[United Arab Emirates]],  [[Australia]], much of [[Africa]], and the [[United States]].<ref> {{Cite web|url=http://www.diwalifestival.org/diwali-celebrations-around-the-world.html|work=diwalifestival.org|title= Diwali Celebrations Around The World|accessdate=2006-08-27}} </ref> With more and more Indians and Tamils now migrating to various parts of the world, the number of countries where Diwali / Deepavali is celebrated has been gradually increasing.  While in some countries it is celebrated mainly by Indian expatriates, in others it has become part of the general local culture.  In most of these countries Diwali is celebrated on the same lines as described in this article with some minor variations.  Some important variations are worth mentioning.

In [[Nepal]], Diwali is known as "Tihar" or "Swanti". It is celebrated during the October/November period.  Here the festival is celebrated for five days and the traditions vary from those followed in India. On the first day (Kaag tihar), crows are given offerings, considering them to be divine messengers. On the second day (Kukur tihar), dogs are worshipped for their honesty. On the third day, Laxmi puja and worship of cow is performed. This is the last day according to [[Nepalese calendar|Nepal Sambat]], so many of the businessmen clear their accounts on this day and on finishing it, worship goddess Laxmi, the goddess of wealth. The fourth day is celebrated as new year. Cultural processions and other celebrations are observed in this day. The Newars celebrate it as "Mha Puja", a special ritual in which the body is worshipped to keep it fit and healthy for the year ahead on this day. On the fifth and final day called "Bhai Tika", brothers and sisters meet and exchange gifts.  

In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], communities all over the [[Caribbean|islands]] get together and celebrate the festival. One major celebration that stands out is the Diwali Nagar, or Village of the Festival of Lights. It features stage performances by the east Indian cultural practitioners, a folk theatre featuring skits and plays, an exhibition on some aspect of Hinduism, displays by various Hindu religious sects and social organizations, nightly worship of Goddess Lakshmi, lighting of deeyas, performances by various schools related to Indian culture, and a food court with Indian and non-Indian vegetarian delicacies. The festival culminates with magnificent fireworks displays ushering in Diwali. Thousands of people participate in an atmosphere devoid of alcohol and in a true family environment. 

In [[Malaysia]], Diwali is known as "Hari Deepavali," and is celebrated during the seventh month of the Hindu solar calendar. It is a federal public holiday throughout Malaysia. In many respects it resembles the traditions followed in the Indian subcontinent. 'Open houses' are held where Hindu Malaysians ([[Tamil Malaysians|Malaysian Tamils]]) welcome fellow Malaysians of different races and religions to their house for a sumptious meal. This is a practice unique to Malaysia and shows the goodwill and friendly ties practised by all Malaysians during any festive occasion. 

In [[Singapore]], the festival is called "Deepavali", and is a [[Holidays in Singapore|gazetted public holiday]]. Observed primarily by the minority Indian community ([[Tamils]]) , it is typically marked by a light-up in the [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] district. The Hindu Endowment Board of Singapore along with Singapores' government organizes many cultural events around Deepavali time. 

In [[Sri Lanka]], this festival is also called "Deepavali" and is celebrated by the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] community. On this day, it is traditional for people to wear new clothes and exchange gifts.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm and in most ways very similarly to as in India.  People clean and decorate their homes with lamps and candles. A popular type of candle used to represent this holiday is a ''[[diya (light)|diya]]''. People also give each other sweets such as [[laddoo]] and [[barfi]], and the different communities may gather from around the country for a religious ceremony and get-together. It is also an important time to contact family in India and perhaps exchange gifts through the post. It is a greatly celebrated holiday and is a great way to connect with the culture and heritage of India. Diwali is becoming a well known festival in Britain and non-Indians also join in the festivities. [[Leicester]] plays hosts to some of the biggest celebrations outside of India itself.
Diwali also coincides closely enough with the British [[Guy Fawkes]] ([[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]]) traditions on November the 5th that in many areas, such as the East End of London, a kind of joint festival has evolved where everyone celebrates and enjoys the same fire and fireworks for their own diverse reasons.

In [[New Zealand]], Diwali is celebrated publicly among many of the South Asian diaspora cultural groups. There are main public festivals in Auckland and Wellington, with other events around the country becoming more popular and visible.  An official reception has been held at the New Zealand Parliament since 2003.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Sch091JMS-t1-g1-t5.html|title=Diwali Downunder: Transforming and Performing Indian Tradition in Aotearoa/New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Media Studies|volume=9|number=1|pages=25-35|year=2005| issn=1173 0811}}</ref>

In [[Australia]], Diwali is celebrated publicly amongst the people of Indian origin and the local Australians in Melbourne.

Diwali was first celebrated in the [[White House]] in 2003 and was given official status by US congress in 2007. Barack Obama became the first president to personally attend the Diwali function at the white house in 2009. Indian diaspora celebrate Diwali in different parts of USA, just as in India.
