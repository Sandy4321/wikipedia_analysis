The '''2006-07 NCAA College Football Bowl Games''' schedule caps the [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season]] in [[college football]].  The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I|Division I-A]] does not include a [[play-off]] system.  Instead, the season concludes with a series of [[bowl games]] that have developed as a reward for teams that do well in the regular season.  

The 2006-07 schedule is the largest post-season lineup ever, with the addition of the new stand-alone [[BCS National Championship|Bowl Championship Series National Championship Game]] as well as the [[International Bowl]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]] which is the first game to be played outside the [[United States of America|USA]] since the last [[Bacardi Bowl]] was played in [[Havana, Cuba]] in 1937.  The season also adds two additional games---the [[PapaJohns.com Bowl]] and the [[New Mexico Bowl]]---as part of a record 38 post-season games (32, not including the post-BCS all-star games) scheduled between the [[Poinsettia Bowl|Poinsettia]] and [[Las Vegas Bowl|Las Vegas]] Bowls on [[December 19]], [[2006]], and the post-season-ending [[Texas vs. The Nation Game]] on [[February 2]], [[2007]]. Thus, 64 teams out of the 119 in Division I-A will be playing in the post-season, thanks in part to the NCAA's decision to expand D-I schedules to 12 games and allow teams with a 6-6 record to be [[bowl eligible]] if the team or their conference has negotiated a bowl contract.

===Selection of the teams===
The selection of the team can be, but is not always based on the regular-season final standings. For example, bowls affiliated with the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences are held to a "one-win" rule <ref>http://www.hokiesports.com/rothreport/recaps/20061113aaa.html</ref>.  When the [[Chick-fil-A Bowl]], which receives the first pick after the BCS bowls, selects an ACC team, it must select a team that is within one win of the team with the best conference record available.  Thus, if there is a 6-2 ACC team available, the Chick-fil-A Bowl could select a 5-3 team, but not a 4-4 team.

The team with the best conference record will not automatically play in the Bowl game with the biggest payout and thus teams will often lobby bowl administrators to select their team.  This scheme is in place to avoid teams returning to the same bowls year after year, if possible.  The selection of which team will fill which of the team's conference bowl spots is largely arbitrary.  The designation "#1 team" may imply the best conference record or the highest ranking on any of the national polls at the end of the season of the remaining conference teams that are not in BCS bowl games.  In some conferences the rules state which is the case, and in others the decision is made by the universities, the conferences, and the bowl administrators, and may be based on geography.  The [[Independence Bowl]], for instance, only has loose ties with the Big 12 and SEC, although any Division I-A team may be chosen to play in the bowl.

In certain cases, a [[List of college athletic conferences|conference]] may not have enough "bowl-eligible" teams to fulfill its obligations to provide teams to certain bowls. In this case, an "at-large" team may be chosen. This happened in [[2006]] as the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to fill its slot in the [[Motor City Bowl]].

[[NCAA]] bylaws stipulate any team finishing 6-6 can only be selected to fill a conference tie-in bowl slot once all other available conference teams are chosen.  For example, since the Big East had 6 bowl-eligible teams, but only 5 bowl tie-ins, 6-6 [[University of Pittsburgh Panthers#Football|Pittsburgh]] was automatically the odd team out.  The same rule also applies to at-large bowl selections.  With only 2 at-large bowl positions available and two remaining 7-5 teams, [[Northern Illinois University|Northern Illinois]]' selection to the [[Poinsettia Bowl]] and [[Middle Tennessee State University#Athletics|Middle Tennessee]]'s selection to the Motor City Bowl meant any remaining 6-6 teams had no chance of playing in a bowl game.

Conference commissioners took control of the Bowl games in the early 1990s. Now, revenue from the bowl games goes directly to the respective conferences to split among its members. Conferences compete aggressively for the automatic [[tie-in]]s to bowl games.

====Bowl-Eligible Teams Who Stayed Home====
With a total of 73 teams, and 64 spaces open for eligible teams, one team with a winning record was not chosen for post-season.  The [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]]'s [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|Louisiana Lafayette]] finished 7-5, but were shut out when [[Troy University|Troy]] and [[Middle Tennessee State University|Middle Tennessee]] went bowling.  Among the 6-6 teams that were shut out were [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]] from the [[Big East Conference]], [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] from the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Arizona Wildcats|Arizona]] and [[Washington State Cougars|Washington State]] from the [[Pacific Ten|Pac-10]], [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] from [[Conference USA]], [[Kent State University#Athletics|Kent State]] from the [[Mid-American Conference|MAC]], fellow Sun Belt member [[Arkansas State University#Athletics|Arkansas State]] and the [[University of Wyoming#Athletics|Wyoming Cowboys]] from the [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]], who were passed over by the New Mexico Bowl in favor of hometown [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]] despite the Cowboys having a better conference record (5-3) than the Lobos (4-4).

==2006-07 Changes==
*The new stand-alone BCS National Championship debuts with the double-hosting plan. The BCS Championship and the Fiesta Bowl will now be played at the brand-new [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. As a result of this, the [[Insight Bowl]] moves from Downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]'s [[Chase Field]], home of baseball's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] to the Fiesta Bowl's old home, [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]] in nearby [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]].
*Several games have changed television rights holders. For example, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] takes over the BCS games except the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], which will remain on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] under a separate contract. The [[NFL Network]] will televise their first college post-season game, the [[Texas Bowl]] on [[December 28]] at [[Reliant Stadium]]. The NFL Network will also televise the Insight Bowl on [[December 29]], the [[Las Vegas All-American Classic|All-American Classic]] on January 15, and the [[Senior Bowl]] on [[January 27]]. [[CBS]] returns to the New Year's Day bowl picture after a prolonged absence as they have acquired the telecast rights to the [[Toyota Gator Bowl]], replacing [[NBC]], leaving the Peacock network without a bowl game for the first time in NBC's history.
*Three bowl games which had been without a sponsor have found new corporate partners. After three years without a sponsor, the [[Independence Bowl]] has signed Phoenix-based energy company PetroSun as their new sponsor starting with the 2006 game. In addition, as part of their return to their titular home city after a year in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] due to [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[New Orleans Bowl]] has found a new sponsor in freight carrier R+L Carriers. [[Bell Helicopter]] takes over the sponsorship of the former Fort Worth Bowl, renaming it the [[Armed Forces Bowl]]. For a short period of time, [[Alltel]] held sponsorship rights until the proposed sponsorship deal fell through. However, the location ([[Fort Worth, Texas]]) and the conference tie-ins remain the same.
*The Houston Bowl has been renamed the Texas Bowl and will be played despite the sponsors suffering a major collapse of finances; the NCAA approved a new operator of the game to be played on December 28 at Reliant Stadium. The game will be promoted by Lone Star Sports and Entertainment, the marketing arm of the [[Houston Texans]] and will also feature the largest holiday fireworks show in the Lone Star State after the game is completed.
*Two new post-season all-star games have been added. The [[North-South All-Star Classic]] is scheduled to be played on [[January 13]], 2007 in [[Houston, Texas]] at the [[Galena Park ISD Stadium|Galena Park Independent School District Stadium]]; TV rights are unknown ([[as of November 2006]]). The other new post-season all-star game is the [[Texas vs. The Nation Game]], which will be played on [[February 2]], 2007 in [[El Paso, Texas]] at [[Sun Bowl Stadium]], and will be televised by [[College Sports TV|CSTV]]. In this game, a team of top-rated college seniors who have played either college or high school football in Texas will face a team comprised of other top-rated seniors from around the nation.
