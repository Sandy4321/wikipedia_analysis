'''Stade de Reims''' ({{IPA-fr|st<U+0251>d d<U+0259> <U+0281><U+025B><U+0303>s|}}; commonly referred to as '''Stade Reims''' or simply '''Reims''') is a [[France|French]] [[association football]] club based in [[Reims]]. The club was formed in 1911 under the name ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Sportive du Parc Pommery'' and currently play in [[Ligue 2]], the second level of [[Football in France|French football]] having achieved promotion to the league following the [[2009<U+2013>10 Championnat National|2009<U+2013>10 season]]. Reims plays its home matches at the [[Stade Auguste Delaune II]], a renovation of the [[Stade Auguste Delaune|old complex]] located within the city. The team is managed by [[Hubert Fournier]] and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] by [[striker]] [[C<U+00E9>dric Faur<U+00E9>]].

Stade Reims is one of the [[List of French football champions|most successful clubs]] in [[French football]] history having won six [[Ligue 1]] titles, two [[Coupe de France]] trophies, and five [[Troph<U+00E9>e des champions]] titles. The club has also performed well on European level having finished as runner-ups in the 1956 and 1959 editions of the [[European Cup]] and winning the [[Latin Cup]] and [[Coppa delle Alpi]] in 1953 and 1977, respectively. However, since the 1980s, Reims have struggled to get back to its [[zenith]]. The club last played in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[1978<U+2013>79 French Division 1|1978<U+2013>79 season]], and since then, have hovered between [[Ligue 2]] and the Championnat National.

Historically, Stade Reims is viewed as a legendary club within French football circles, not only due to its domestic and European accolades, but its charity towards the [[France national football team|France national team]] through the 1940s and 50s, as well. Reims were largely responsible for the first [[Golden Generation]] of French football with notable national team members [[Roger Marche]], [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Just Fontaine]], [[Jean Vincent]], [[Robert Jonquet]], [[Armand Penverne]], [[Dominique Colonna]], and [[Roger Piantoni]] all playing for Reims during the national team's successful run to the semi-finals at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]].

== History ==
Stade de Reims was founded in 1911 under the name ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Sportive du Parc Pommery'' under the guidance of Marquis Melchior de Polignac, a Frenchman who later went on to serve on the [[International Olympic Committee]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Members of the International Olympic Committee since 1907 |url=http://olympic-museum.de/iocmembers/iocmembers1907.html |publisher=Olympic Museum |date= |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}</ref> The club adopted its current name on 18 June 1931. Despite the country adopting professional football in 1932, Reims remained an amateur club until 1935 after the club successfully won the [[Championnat de France amateur]] under the leadership of [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Billy Aitken]]. The club reached Division 1 for the first time in the [[1945<U+2013>46 French Division 1|1945<U+2013>46 season]], the first championship following the conclusion of [[World War II]]. During the same year, the club promoted [[Defender (football)|defender]] [[Robert Jonquet]] to the senior team and signed [[Roger Marche]] from [[OFC Charleville|Olympique de Charleville]]. Together, the two went on to become, arguably, the club's most famous players in its history.

[[File:RKopa.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Raymond Kopa]] played on four of Reims' six championship-winning teams.]]

Reims won its first [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] championship in [[1948<U+2013>49 French Division 1|1949]]. Led by a talented backline of Marche, Jonquet, and [[Armand Penverne]], as well as midfielders [[Albert Batteux]] and [[Michel Leblond]], and an underrated [[striker]] trio of [[Pierre Flamion]], [[Pierre Sinibaldi]], and Pierre Bini, Reims won the league by a single point over Lille. The following season, the club won the [[Coupe de France]] defeating [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Paris]] 2<U+2013>1 in [[1950 Coupe de France Final|the final]]. After the season, manager [[Henri Roessler]] departed the club and longtime player Batteux took the reins. The team's subsequent rise in the sport led to the signings of [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Raoul Giraudo]]. In 1953, Reims won its second league title [[1952<U+2013>53 French Division 1|winning the league]] by four points. That same year, the club won the [[Latin Cup]] becoming the first French football club to attained the honour. The victory was cited as a coup for France after the country finished three straight years as runner-ups in the competition. After the 1954 season, Marche retired from football. In 1955, Reims [[1954<U+2013>55 French Division 1|won its third title]] in six seasons. The championship led to the club's qualification for the newly-created [[European Cup]].

In the inaugural edition of the European Cup, Reims reached [[1956 European Cup Final|the final]] where the team was defeated 4<U+2013>3 by [[Spain|Spanish]] club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Reims controlled the match from the outset scoring two goals in the first ten minutes. However, two first half goals by [[Alfredo Di St<U+00E9>fano]] and [[H<U+00E9>ctor Rial]] for Madrid canceled out Reims' early attacks. In the second half, Reims took the lead through [[Michel Hidalgo]], but within minutes, the match was re-drawn courtesy of a goal from [[Marcos Alonso Imaz|Marquitos]]. Rial's game-winner in the 79th minute ended Reims' hopes of winning the first edition of the European Cup. In the following season, Reims lost prominent midfielder Kopa to Madrid, but still were able to recruit [[France national football team|French internationals]] [[Just Fontaine]], [[Jean Vincent]], [[Roger Piantoni]], and [[Dominique Colonna]] to the team. After early struggles, the additions paid off with the club winning its third title of the decade in the [[1957<U+2013>58 French Division 1|1957<U+2013>58 season]]. The team also won the Coupe de France after beating [[N<U+00EE>mes Olympique]] 3<U+2013>1 in [[1958 Coupe de France Final|the final]], thus achieving [[the double]].

In the [[1958<U+2013>59 European Cup|1958<U+2013>59 edition]] of the European Cup, Reims returned to [[1959 European Cup Final|the final]] to faced, for the second time, Real Madrid. Aside from Kopa switching sides and the arrival of Fontaine, Colonna, Piantoni, and Vincent to Reims, the lineups were nearly identical to the previous meeting. However, an undeterred Madrid, who had already won the competition three times, cruised through to a victory with a convincing 2<U+2013>0 win. After the season, Penverne departed the club. The team was, however, boosted by the return of Kopa who, subsequently led the team to its fifth league title in 11 seasons in [[1959<U+2013>60 French Division 1|1960]]. Following the season, Jonquet retired from international football and left Reims for Strasbourg. He was followed by Giraudo and Leblond. The departures failed to hinder Reims' performances domestically as the team won the league in [[1961<U+2013>62 French Division 1|1962]]. The championship capped an amazing career for Just Fontaine, who, subsequently, retired from football.
In the ensuing season, which was longtime manager Albert Batteux's last, Reims finished runner-up to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the league and, the following season, shocked many by finishing 17th, which resulted in the club falling to the second division. The relegation led to the departures or retirements of many of the players who were a part of Reims' dynastic run in the 1950s; all except for Kopa who remained with Reims until 1967.

Reims returned to top-flight for the [[1966<U+2013>67 French Division 1|1966<U+2013>67 season]] after two seasons in the second division. However, the stint proved short with Reims finishing 19th. In 1970, the club returned to top-flight and many in the league for nearly a decade. Reims' best performance in the league during its nine-year stint was finishing 5th in the [[1975<U+2013>76 French Division 1|1975<U+2013>76 season]]. Reims were relegated in [[1978<U+2013>79 French Division 1|1979]] and have yet to returned back to the first division of French football.
