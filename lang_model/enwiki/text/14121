The '''blacktip sawtail catshark''' (''Galeus sauteri'') is a [[species]] of [[catshark]], [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scyliorhinidae]], found off [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]]. It is [[demersal fish|demersal]] in nature and occurs deeper than {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Growing up to {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, this slim-bodied species is characterized by its plain brownish dorsal coloration with dark tips on the [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[caudal fin]]s, and a prominent crest of enlarged [[dermal denticle]]s on the upper edge of the caudal fin. It is [[oviparous]], with females producing [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|encapsulated eggs]] two at a time year-round. The blacktip sawtail catshark is [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] in [[bottom trawl]]s and used for [[fishmeal]] in Taiwan. However, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) currently lacks enough information to assess its conservation status.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
In 1906, the [[Carnegie Museum]] purchased an extensive collection of fishes assembled from the markets of Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]), [[Taiwan]] by Hans Sauter. American [[ichthyologist]]s [[David Starr Jordan]] and Robert Earl Richardson described several new species from the collection in a 1909 issue of ''Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum'', including a catshark of the genus ''Pristiurus'' that they named in Sauter's honor. Jordan and Richardson referenced six [[syntype]]s {{convert|30|-|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} long in their description, of which four survive to the present day. Later authors have recognized ''Pristiurus'' as a [[junior synonym]] of the genus ''[[Galeus]]''.<ref name="jordan and richardson">{{cite journal |author=Jordan, D.S. and R.E.

==Distribution and habitat==
The blacktip sawtail catshark is found in the waters around Taiwan, where it is very common, and the [[Philippines]]. It was once thought to occur off southern [[Japan]] as well, but recent observations by [[Kazuhiro Nakaya]] have determined that this is not the case. This species is found on or near the bottom over the [[continental shelf]]. In the [[Taiwan Strait]], it has been recorded over mud at depths of {{convert|60|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while off [[Guishan Island]] it is known from {{convert|100|-|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Description==
A small species, the blacktip sawtail catshark attains a maximum length of {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="iucn"/> Its body is slim and firm, with the head comprising roughly one-fifth of the total length. The rather long snout is pointed, with large nostrils divided by triangular flaps of skin on their anterior margins. The large, horizontally oval eyes bear rudimentary [[nictitating membrane]]s (protective third eyelids) and lack prominent ridges underneath. Behind each eye is a small [[spiracle]]. The mouth is large and forms a long, wide arch; the corners of the mouth bear well-developed furrows.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="nakaya">{{cite journal |author=Nakaya, K. |date=1975 |title=Taxonomy, comparative anatomy and phylogeny of Japanese catsharks, Scyliorhinidae |journal=Memoirs of the Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University |volume=23 |pages=1&ndash;94}}</ref> There are about 70&ndash;78 upper and 82 lower tooth rows.<ref name="compagno1988">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |year=1988 |title=Sharks of the Order Carcharhiniformes |publisher=Blackburn Press |page=433 |isbn=1930665768}}</ref> Each tooth is small and usually has five cusps, with the central one the longest. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short, with the fourth and fifth pairs located over the bases of the [[pectoral fin]]s.<ref name="nakaya"/>

Both [[dorsal fin]]s are rounded; the first is slightly larger and positioned over the latter half of the [[pelvic fin]] bases, while the second is positioned over the latter half of the [[anal fin]] base. The pectoral fins are medium-sized and blunt-cornered. The small pelvic fins are low and angular; the [[claspers]] of adult males reach the origin of the anal fin. The space between the pelvic and anal fin origins is greater in males than in females. The anal fin is elongated and angular; its base measures 12&ndash;15% of the total length, comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins. The [[caudal peduncle]] is compressed from side to side, and leads to a low [[caudal fin]] with a small lower fin and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body is covered by small, slightly overlapping [[dermal denticle]]s, which are leaf-shaped with a median ridge and three marginal teeth. A crest of enlarged denticles is present along the upper edge of the caudal fin. This species is a uniform ochre above and white below, with distinctive dark brown tips on the dorsal and caudal fins; the interior of the mouth is light gray.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="nakaya"/>

==Biology and ecology==
Reproduction in the blacktip sawtail catshark is [[oviparous]] and proceeds throughout the year, without well-defined seasonal patterns. Adult females have a single functional [[ovary]], on the right, and two functional [[oviduct]]s; a single egg matures within each oviduct at a time. The eggs are enclosed in purse-shaped, translucent golden brown [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|capsules]] measuring about {{convert|36|-|39|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The surface of the capsule is smooth and unlined; there are coiled tendrils on the anterior corners and bundles of long fibers on the posterior corners. Half of all males and females are [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at {{convert|35|-|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|41|-|42|cm|in|abbr=on}} long respectively.<ref name="nakaya"/><ref name="chen et al">{{cite journal |author=Chen, C.T., Y.Y.

==Human interactions==
In Taiwanese waters, blacktip sawtail catsharks of most sizes are frequently [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] in [[bottom trawl]]s operated by [[commercial fishing|commercial]] [[shrimp]] [[fisheries]]. Captured sharks are processed into [[fishmeal]] and used in [[aquaculture]]. This species is probably also caught incidentally by bottom trawlers in the Philippines, as it has been observed at markets. Because specific catch data is lacking, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed the blacktip sawtail catshark as [[Data Deficient]].<ref name="iucn"/>
