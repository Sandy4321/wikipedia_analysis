'''Gregory Bateson''' ([[9 May]] [[1904]] <U+2013> [[4 July]] [[1980]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]], [[social sciences|social scientist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], and [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] whose work intersected that of many other fields. Some of his most noted writings are to be found in his books, ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'' (1972) and ''Mind and Nature'' (1980). ''Angel's Fear'' (published posthumously in 1987) was co-authored by his daughter [[Mary Catherine Bateson]].

== Biography == <!-- I have edited this section to correct a typo, improve readability and delete information which is imo too remote to be relevant to the entry, eg Margaret Mead's previous marriages. Apart from the deletions there has been no (intentional)change of content -->
Bateson was born in [[Grantchester]], [[England]] on 9 May 1904, the youngest of three sons of distinguished geneticist [[William Bateson]] and his wife, [Caroline] Beatrice Durham. He attended Charterhouse School from [[1917]] to [[1921]]. He graduated BA in [[biology]] at St. John's College, Cambridge University, in [[1925]] and continued at Cambridge from [[1927]] to [[1929]].  Bateson lectured in linguistics at the University of Sydney [[1928]]. From [[1931]] to [[1937]] he was a fellow at Cambridge <ref> NNBD, [http://www.nndb.com/people/169/000100866/ Gregory Bateson], Soylent Communications, 2007.</ref> and then moved to the United States.

In [[Palo Alto]], Gregory Bateson and his colleagues [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]] and [[John Weakland|John H. Weakland]] developed the [[double bind]] theory.<ref>Bateson, G., Jackson, D. D., Haley, J. & Weakland, J., 1956, Toward a theory of schizophrenia. (in: 'Behavioral Science', vol.1, 251-264)</ref> 

One of the threads that connects Bateson's work is an interest in [[systems theory]], [[cybernetics]] a science he helped to create as one of the original members of the core group of the [[Macy conferences|Macy Conferences]].  Bateson's take on these fields centers upon their relationship to [[epistemology]], and this central interest provides the undercurrents of his thought. His association with the editor and author [[Stewart Brand]] was part of a process by which Bateson<U+2019>s influence widened &mdash; for from the 1970s until Bateson<U+2019>s last years, a broader audience of university students and educated people working in many fields came not only to know his name but also into contact to varying degrees with his thought.

In [[1956]], he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]]. Bateson was a member of [[William Irwin Thompson]]'s [[Lindisfarne Association]].

== Personal life ==

Bateson's life was greatly affected by the death of his two brothers.  John Bateson (1898-1918), the eldest of the three, was killed in World War I.  Martin, the second brother (1900-1922), was then expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a scientist, but came into conflict with William over his ambition to become a poet and playwright.  The resulting stress, combined with a disappointment in love, resulted in Martin's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of [[Eros]] in [[Piccadilly Circus]] on [[April 22]], [[1922]], which was John's birthday.  After this event, which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal, all William and Beatrice's ambitious expectations fell on Gregory, their only surviving son.<ref>Schuetzenberger, Anne.  ''The Ancestor Syndrome''.  New York, Routledge.  1998.</ref> 

Bateson's first wife was the American cultural anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]].<ref name="Britannica">[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356738/Gregory-Bateson "Gregory Bateson."] Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 5 Aug. 2007</ref> Bateson and Mead had a daughter [[Mary Catherine Bateson]] (b. 1939), who also became an anthropologist. 

Bateson and Mead separated in 1947, and were divorced in 1950.<ref>''To Cherish the Life of the World: Selected Letters of Margaret Mead''. Margaret M. Caffey and Patricia A. Francis, eds. With foreword by Mary Catherine Bateson. New York. Basic Books. 2006.</ref>  Bateson then married his second wife, Elizabeth "Betty" Sumner (1919-1992), in 1951.<ref>Idem.</ref>  She was the daughter of the Episcopalian Bishop of Chicago, Walter Taylor Sumner.  They had a son, John Sumner Bateson (b. 1952), as well as twins who died in infancy.  Bateson and Sumner were divorced in 1957, after which Bateson married therapist and social worker Lois Cammack (b. 1928) in 1961.  Their daughter, Nora Bateson, was born in 1969.<ref>Idem.</ref>  Nora is married to drummer [[Dan Brubeck]], son of jazz musician [[Dave Brubeck]].

=== Epigrams coined by or referred to by Bateson ===
*[[Number]] is different from [[quantity]].
*[[Map-territory relation|The map is not the territory]], and the name is not the thing named. Coined by [[Alfred Korzybski]].
*There are no monotone "values" in biology.
*"Logic is a poor model of cause and effect."<ref>Bateson (1980) Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity</ref>
*Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction. Double description is better than one.
*Bateson defines [[information]] as "a difference that makes a difference."<ref> [http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html] [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:%22Jacob%22%20intitle:%22Classification%20and%20Categorization:%20A%20Difference%20that%20...%22%20]</ref>
*The source of the new is the random.
*What is true is that the idea of [[Power (sociology)|power]] corrupts. Power corrupts most rapidly those who believe in it, and it is they who will want it most. Obviously, our democratic system tends to give power to those who hunger for it and gives every opportunity to those who don<U+2019>t want power to avoid getting it. Not a very satisfactory arrangement if power corrupts those who believe in it and want it.<br>
Perhaps there is no such thing as unilateral power. After all, the man <U+2018>in power<U+2019> depends on receiving information all the time from outside. He responds to that information just as much as he <U+2018>causes<U+2019> things to happen...it is an interaction, and not a lineal situation.
But the myth of power is, of course, a very powerful myth, and probably most people in this world more or less believe in it. It is a myth, which, if everybody believes in it, becomes to that extent self-validating. But it is still epistemological lunacy and leads inevitably to various sorts of disaster. "<ref>Bateson (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind</ref>
*"No organism can afford to be conscious of matters with which it could deal at unconscious levels." <ref>''Steps To An Ecology of Mind'', quoted in ''Two Cybernetic Frontiers''</ref>

=== Double bind ===

In 1956, [[Palo Alto]], Gregory Bateson and his colleagues [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]] and [[John Weakland]] <ref>Bateson, G., Jackson, D. D., Haley, J. & Weakland, J., 1956, Toward a theory of schizophrenia. (in: 'Behavioral Science', vol.1, 251-264)</ref> articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from [[double bind]] situations. The perceived symptoms of schizophrenia were therefore an expression of this distress, and should be valued as a cathartic and trans-formative experience. The [[double bind]] refers to a communication paradox described first in families with a schizophrenic member. 

Full double bind requires several conditions to be met: 
* a) The victim of double bind receives contradictory injunctions or emotional messages on different levels of communication (for example, [[love]] is expressed by words and [[hate]] or detachment by nonverbal behavior; or a child is encouraged to speak freely, but criticised or silenced whenever he or she actually does so). 
* b) No metacommunication is possible; for example, asking which of the two messages is valid or describing the communication as making no sense 
* c) The victim cannot leave the communication field 
* d) Failing to fulfill the contradictory injunctions is punished, e.g. by withdrawal of love. 
The double bind was originally presented (probably mainly under the influence of Bateson's psychiatric co-workers) as an explanation of part of the [[etiology]] of [[schizophrenia]]; today it is more important as an example of Bateson's approach to the complexities of communication.

=== Other terms used by Bateson ===
*'''[[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]]'''.  Used by Bateson to refer to a third scientific methodology (along with [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[deduction]]) which was central to his own holistic and qualitative approach. Refers to a method of comparing patterns of relationship, and their symmetry or asymmetry (as in, for example, [[comparative anatomy]]), especially in complex organic (or mental) systems.  The term was originally coined by American Philosopher/Logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who used it to refer to the process by which scientific hypotheses are generated.
*'''Criteria of Mind (from ''Mind and Nature A Necessary Unity'')''':<ref name="Bateson 1972">{{cite book | author=Bateson, Gregory | title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | year=1972 | id=ISBN 0-226-03905-6}}</ref>
#Mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components. 
#The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by difference. 
#Mental process requires collateral energy. 
#Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination. 
#In mental process the effects of difference are to be regarded as [[transformation|transforms]] (that is, coded versions) of the difference which preceded them. 
#The description and classification of these processes of transformation discloses a hierarchy of [[type theory|logical types]] immanent in the phenomena.

*'''Creatura and [[Pleroma]]'''.  Borrowed from [[Carl Jung]] who applied these Gnostic terms in his "The Seven Sermons To the Dead". Like the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] term [[maya (illusion)|maya]], the basic idea captured in this distinction is that meaning and organization are projected onto the world. Pleroma refers to the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity; Creatura for the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information.

*'''Deuterolearning'''. A term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organization of learning, or learning to learn:<ref name="Visser 2002">{{cite book | author=Visser, Max | title=Managing knowledge and action in organizations; towards a behavioral theory of organizational learning | publisher=EURAM Conference, Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management, Stockholm, Sweden | year=2002}}</ref>

*'''[[Schismogenesis]]''' - the emergence of divisions within social groups.
