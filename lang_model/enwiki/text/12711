'''MV ''Keppel''''' was a passenger-only ferry built in 1961 for the [[Tilbury]] to [[Gravesend]] crossing. She had twenty years of service on the [[Largs]] to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]] route. Since 1993, she has operated in Malta.

==History==
MV ''Keppel'' was the last of three sisters built for [[British Railways]] Eastern Region. Originally named '''''Rose''''', she was launched in 1961 and entered service on the [[Tilbury]] to [[Gravesend]] route. In 1967 ''Rose'' became surplus to the needs of B.R., and was transferred to the [[Caledonian MacBrayne|Caledonian Steam Packet Company]], on the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] where she was renamed ''Keppel''.<ref name="fleet"/> The ship then underwent some modifications, and was then placed onto the [[Largs]] to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]] route, a service she carried out for almost 20 years.

In 1980 she ran aground off Farland Point and sustained considerable damage.<ref name="fleet"/>

She became surplus to requirements on the Clyde and was sold in 1993. She operated independently as ''Clyde Rose'' (name never registered) for that summer but was laid up at the James Watt Dock, before being sold to [[Malta|Maltese]] interests.<ref name="Tramscape">{{Cite web|url=http://paddlesteamers.awardspace.com/Keppel.htm |title=MV ''Keppel'' (ex - Rose, later Clyde Rose) |work=Paddle Steamer Resources| publisher=Tramscape| accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

==Service==
Built for the [[Tilbury]] to [[Gravesend]] route on the Thames, she was used as the backup and relief vessel to her sisters. On transfer to the Clyde, she was placed on the [[Largs]] to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]] crossing. From 1974, she berthed overnight at [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]], giving a morning crossing to [[Wemyss Bay]] and serving the McAlpine yard at Ardyne. This ceased when the yard closed in 1977 and ''Keppel'' was laid up for most of the year. She gave afternoon cruises to Rothesay and round Cumbrae.<ref name="fleet2">{{cite book| author=McCrorie, Ian| title=Hebridean and Clyde Ferries| publisher=Caledonian MacBrayne|year=1985 }}</ref>

Despite the introduction of {{MV|Isle of Cumbrae}}, in 1977 on the Largs to Cumbrae Slip crossing, ''Keppel'' was retained for a further nine years, until the arrival of the new car ferries, {{MV|Loch Striven}} and {{MV|Loch Linnhe}}.<ref name="fleet2"/> Even then, she survived another seven years as a cruise vessel.<ref name="Tramscape"/>

Her Maltese owners have extended her career on cruises out of [[Valletta]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sunscopetravel.com/cruises/hornblower/hornblower.html| title=Horn Blower Cruises| publisher=Sunscope Travel| accessdate=10 September2010}}</ref>
