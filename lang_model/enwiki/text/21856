"'''The Last Temptation of Krust'''" is the 15th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]]. It was written by [[Donick Cary]] and directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]]. The episode first aired on [[February 22]], [[1998]].  [[Comedian]] [[Jay Leno]] makes a guest appearance.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Another Simpsons season hits DVD  | work =[[Orlando Sentinel]]  |    date =[[December 22]], [[2006]]  |  }}</ref> [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] convinces [[Krusty the Clown]] to appear at a comedy festival organized by Jay Leno, but Krusty's old material does not go over well with the audience, and he receives bad reviews. After Krusty goes on a drinking binge, Bart and Jay Leno bathe him in the Simpsons' house, and Krusty decides to announce his retirement. At Krusty's retirement press conference, the audience finds his tirade against modern comedy hysterical, and he returns to comedy with a new style where he complains about commercialism.  He later agrees to a deal with marketing executives in return for a new "Canyonero" <U+2013> a [[spoof]] on [[sport utility vehicle]]s, and markets products during his next comedy appearance. The episode ends with an extended Canyonero sequence, with a background song sung by [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]

The production team's decision to write an episode about stand-up comedy was influenced by comedy festivals. The writing staff initially had trouble getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through network censors, but convinced them this was simply a way to emphasize his old and dated comedic material. The "[[Canyonero]]" sequence was modeled after [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] commercials, and was given its own segment at the end of the episode because the production staff liked it so much. The episode was listed by ''[[USA Today]]'' as one of the six best episodes of the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|''The Simpsons'' ninth season]], and received positive reviews in ''[[The Washington Times]]'', the ''[[Evening Herald]]'', and in books on ''The Simpsons''.

==Plot==
Krusty is persuaded by Bart to appear at a comedy festival organized by Jay Leno. His old-fashioned and dated material fail to impress the audience when compared the more trendy comics also appearing. After reading a critical review of his act in the press, Krusty decides to go on a "bender to end all benders", and a montage sequence shows him getting drunk. After Bart finds him passed out on the [[Flanders family|Flanders]]' front lawn, he enlists the help of Leno to clean him up in the Simpsons' bathtub. Krusty holds a press conference to announce his retirement, and in short order launches into a bitter tirade against modern-day comics. The crowd find Krusty's rant hysterical, and he subsequently announces his return to comedy.

Krusty is inspired to return to doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a comic who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to [[sell out]] to [[Corporate America]]. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in [[Moe's Tavern]], he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s bar in Krusty's new SUV.

== Production ==
In the [[DVD]] commentary for ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> ninth season, writer [[Donick Cary]] stated that the inspiration for the idea of an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time.<ref name="cary">{{cite video | people=[[Donick Cary|Cary, Donick]] |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "The Last Temptation of Krust"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Executive producer [[Mike Scully]] said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through the network censors.<ref name="scully">{{cite video | people=[[Mike Scully|Scully, Mike]] |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "The Last Temptation of Krust"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The stereotypical jokes were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand it was simply emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.<ref name="scully" /> Before the scene where Jay Leno and Bart wash Krusty's hair in the bathtub, there was going to be a scene where Bart sought Leno to ask for help. The writing staff thought viewers would understand if Leno simply appeared helping Krusty, without this intermediary scene.<ref name="scully" />

[[Mike B. Anderson]] stated that at least three different acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It was not until the editing process that the material used was decided upon.<ref name="anderson">{{cite video | people=[[Mike B.

The production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be obscured by the credits, and gave it its own segment at the end of the episode.<ref name="scully" />
