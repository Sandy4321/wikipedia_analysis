==Background==
The song was co-written by [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Kev Carmody]] and is based on the story of [[The Gurindji Strike]] and [[Vincent Lingiari]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1147120.htm |title=The Gujindji Strike |publisher=ABC Radio |date=2004-07-04|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>  It describes how the [[Gurindji people]]<U+2019>s claim sparked the [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] land rights movement. The protest led to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Commonwealth Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]]. The Act gave Indigenous people freehold title to traditional lands in the [[Northern Territory]] and the power of veto over mining and development on those lands. In 1975, 3,236 sq km of land was handed back to the Gurindji.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/blood-brothers-little-things/clip2/ |title=Blood Brothers <U+2013> From Little Things Big Things Grow |publisher=Australian Screen (National Film & Screen Archive) |accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>
