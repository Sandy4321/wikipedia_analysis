'''Johann Gottfried Eichhorn''' (October 16, 1753 <U+2013> June 27, 1827) was a [[Germany|German]] Protestant [[theology|theologian]] of Enlightenment and early orientalist.

== Education and Early Career ==
He was born at D<U+00F6>rrenzimmern (now part of the city of [[Ingelfingen]]), in the principality of [[Hohenlohe]]-Oehringen. He was educated at the state school in Weikersheim, where his father was superintendent, at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Heilbronn]] and at the [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen]] (1770<U+2013>1774), studying under [[Johann David Michaelis]]. In 1774 he received the rectorship of the gymnasium at Ohrdruf, in the duchy of [[Saxe-Gotha]].

== Professorship in Jena 1775<U+2013>1788 ==
In 1775 he was made professor of Oriental languages at the Faculty of Theology at [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|Jena University]]. His published habilitation lecture was about "monetary matters of the early Arabs (De rei numariae apud Arabas initiis)" on the basis of the chronicle of [[Makin ibn al-'Amid]]. Later he edited the "Briefe <U+00FC>ber das arabische M<U+00FC>nzwesen" by [[Johann Jacob Reiske]]. As a supplement to it he compiled the first commentated bibliography of Islamic numismatics in 1786 with more than 100 pages. It is still a reference tool for numismatic literature prior to this date. He also edited some historical works of the Reiske, who died 1774. Eichhorn was acquainted with him from time of his study in G<U+00F6>ttingen.

During his professorship in Jena he wrote his seminal "Introduction into the Old Testament (Einleitung in das Alte Testament)", which was a breakthrough in the historical understanding of the [[Pentateuch]]. In 1776 he founded the first important journal for Oriental studies, the "Repertorium f<U+00FC>r biblische und morgenl<U+00E4>ndische Litteratur", which he edited until 1788.

== Professorship in G<U+00F6>ttingen 1788-1827 ==

On the death of Michaelis in 1788 he was elected professor ordinarius at G<U+00F6>ttingen, where he lectured not only on Oriental languages and on the exegesis of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, but also on political history. His health was shattered in 1825, but he continued his lectures until attacked by fever on June 14, 1827. His son, [[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn|Karl Friedrich]], became a famous jurist.

== Achievements in theology ==

Eichhorn has been called "the founder of modern Old Testament [[criticism]]." He recognized its scope and problems, and began many of its most important discussions. "My greatest trouble," he says in the preface to the second edition of his ''Einleitung,'' "I had to bestow on a hitherto unworked field--on the investigation of the inner nature of the Old Testament with the help of the Higher Criticism (not a new name to any humanist)." His investigations led him to the conclusion that "most of the writings of the Hebrews have passed through several hands." He took for granted that all the supernatural events related in the Old and New Testaments were explicable on natural principles. He sought to judge them from the standpoint of the ancient world, and to account for them by the superstitious beliefs which were then generally in vogue. He did not perceive in the biblical books any religious ideas of much importance for modern times; they interested him merely historically and for the light they cast upon antiquity.

He regarded many books of the Old Testament as spurious, questioned the genuineness of the [[First Epistle of Peter|First]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|Second]] letters of Peter and the [[Epistle of Jude]], denied the [[Paul of Tarsus|Pauline]] authorship of the [[First Epistle to Timothy|First]] and [[Second Epistle to Timothy|Second]] letters to Timothy and to [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]]. He suggested that the canonical gospels were based upon various translations and editions of a primary [[Aramaic]] gospel, but did not appreciate as sufficiently as [[David Strauss]] and the T<U+00FC>bingen critics the difficulties which a natural theory has to surmount, nor did he support his conclusions by such elaborate discussions as they deemed necessary.
