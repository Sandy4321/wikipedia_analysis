Several styles of traditional '''[[Venezuela]]n music''', such as [[salsa music|salsa]] and  [[Venezuelan merengue|merengue]] are common to its Caribbean neighbors. Perhaps the most typical Venezuelan music is [[joropo]], a rural form which originated in the [[llanos]], or plains. This [[joropo|musica llanera]] was developed by creative artists such as [[Juan Vicente Torrealba]], [[Ignacio Figueredo]] and [[<U+00C1>ngel Custodio Loyola|Angel Custodio Loyola]], who helped to popularize the music throughout the country. Since then a slick, contemporary form of pop-llanera has developed which has earned the scorn of some purists who perceive it as stale and watered-down. Some singers, such as [[Sim<U+00F3>n D<U+00ED>az|Simon Diaz]] and [[Reynaldo Armas]] have maintained a huge following over the years. In a similar vein, there is also neo-folklore, which takes traditional music and arranges it in an electronic style, for electronic instruments.

Another very popular music in Venezuela is the ''[[gaita (music style)|gaita]]''. This genre originated from the region of [[Zulia|Zulia state]] and is very popular during the Christmas season. The gaita united to the [[Aguinaldo]], conforms the national representation of the Venezuelan Christmas.

Other forms of Venezuelan folk music are extensively recorded and researched due to the work of [[Caracas]]-based [[Fundaci<U+00F3>n Bigott]]. [[Africa]]n-derived [[percussion instrument|percussion]] (including multiple rhythms, such as [[sangeo]], [[Ful<U+00ED>a|fulia]] and [[parranda]]) is perhaps the best documented musical form. Fundacion Bigott has also produced groups such [[Un Solo Pueblo]], [[Hurac<U+00E1>n de Fuego]] and [[Grupo Madera]]. These more experimental fusion artists combine [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[Latin jazz]], [[joropo]], [[salsa music|salsa]] and other forms of [[Latin America]]n music.

Venezuelan [[calypso music]], imported from [[Trinidad]] in the [[1880s]] by immigrants arriving during a [[gold rush]], has its own distinctive rhythms and lyrical style. 
 
Another imported genre is [[Cuba]]n-[[United States|American]] [[salsa music|salsa]], which has produced several domestic superstars, including [[Oscar D'Le<U+00F3>n|Oscar D'Leon]]. 
[[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Merengue music|merengue]] and Latin pop acts such as [[Billo Fr<U+00F3>meta|Billo's Caracas Boys]], [[Porfi Jim<U+00E9>nez|the Porfi Jim<U+00E9>nez Orchestra]] and [[Los Mel<U+00F3>dicos]].

Juana Maria de la Concepcion, commonly referred to as [[Conny M<U+00E9>ndez]], born April 11, 1898 in [[Caracas]], was a composer, singer, writer, caricaturist and actress who produced more than 40 compositions, such as: ''Yo soy venezolana'', ''Chucho y Ceferina'', 'La Negrita Marisol'', ''Venezuela Habla Cantando'', and many others.

[[Aldemaro Romero]] is a prolific Venezuelan composer, he has created a wide range of music, such as Caribbean, jazz, Venezuelan waltzes and symphonic works, which helped to modernize Venezuelan folk music.

Pop and rock music are very popular too, and several bands have had considerable success over the years. Venezuelan pop musicians such as [[Ricardo Montaner]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Luis Rodr<U+00ED>guez "El Puma"]], [[Franco DeVita]], and [[Ilan Chester]] have gained popularity in other Latin American countries. On the other hand, same history for a lot of well known bands like [[Desorden P<U+00FA>blico|Desorden Publico]] ([[Ska]]/[[Pop music|Pop]]), [[Caramelos de Cianuro]] ([[Pop music|Pop]]/[[Rock music|Rock]]), [[Los Amigos Invisibles]] ([[Acid Jazz]]) and [[Devendra Banhart]] ([[Naturalismo]]/[[Folk]]) (this last two the most successful internationally), and the now extinct but influential groups Sentimiento Muerto[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimiento_Muerto] ([[Post-Punk]], Zapato 3[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapato_3] ([[Pop music|Pop]]/[[Rock music|Rock]]) and Dermis Tat<U+00FA>[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis_Tat%C3%BA] ([[Rock music|Rock]])

In the late 90's a very strong electronic music movement spread through the country.  Several big multimedia festivals took place, such as "Caracas No Duerme," "AX," "Petaquire," and "Mare Nostrum."  These events combined music with the video and performance art of Venezuelan artists such as Luis Poleo, Frank Wow, and Sony.  The main bands/DJ's of this era are [[Ojo Fatuo]], [[DJ Oddo]] and [[DJ Wyz]]. 

From 2000 until present, a lot of Venezuelan artists have made a strong movement into different underground music styles. The most significative ones are: Masseratti 2lts[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseratti_2lts] ([[Downtempo]]), [[KP-9000 ([[Trip-Hop]]), Cardopusher ([[Breakcore]]), Nuuro ([[IDM]]), [[Todosantos]] ([[Nu Rave]]/Indietronica), Jimmy Flamante ([[Breakbeat]]), Las Americas ([[Shoegaze]]), Retrov<U+00E9>rtigo ([[Post-rock]]), Lis ([[Instrumental Rock]]), Panasuyo (Neo-folcklore), Pacheko ([[Dubstep]]) and Los Javelin ([[Surf-rock]]/[[Rockabilly]]).

Venezuela has also produced classical composers such as: [[Antonio Lauro]], [[Mois<U+00E9>s Moleiro]], [[Teresa Carre<U+00F1>o]] (who was also a world-renowned pianist), [[Gustavo Dudamel]] and [[Eduardo Marturet]] (who are primarily international conductors), [[Antonio Est<U+00E9>vez]], [[Federico Ruiz]] (who also works with other genres) and [[Vicente Emilio Sojo]] (known for his contributions to Venezuelan musicology and music education). [[Roberto Ruscitti]] followed in their footsteps.

Other Venezuelan musicians of note are: [[Alberto Naranjo]], [[Cheo Hurtado]], [[Hern<U+00E1>n Gamboa]], [[Gualberto Ibarreto]], [[Juan Carlos Salazar]], [[Hu<U+00E1>scar Barradas]], [[Cecilia Todd]], [[Vidal Colmenares]], [[Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Chac<U+00ED>n]], [[Luis Silva (singer)|Luis Silva]] as well as the groups [[Serenata Guayanesa]], [[Guaco (band)|Guaco]] and [[Ensamble Gurrufio]].
