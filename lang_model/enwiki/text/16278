== Biography ==
Clayton is the eldest child of Brian and Jo Clayton, born on [[13 March]], [[1960]] in Oxfordshire, England. When Clayton was five years old, his family moved from Oxfordshire to Malahide, near Dublin, where Clayton's sister Sarah and his brother Sebastian were born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family, with their sons [[Dick Evans|Dick]] and Dave (more commonly known as [[The Edge]]), who were both in the original group, Feedback, that spawned U2.<ref name="book1">{{cite book |last=McCormick |first=Neil |coauthors=Adam Clayton, [[Bono]], [[The Edge]], [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] |title=U2 by U2 |year=2005 |publisher=HarperEntertainment |location=New York |isbn=0060776757 }}</ref>

Clayton attended boarding school at [[St. Columba's College, Dublin|St. Columba's]] in [[Rathfarnham]].<ref name="book1" /> He later changed school to [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin, where he met fellow bandmates Paul "[[Bono]]" Hewson and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], and was reunited with this boyhood friend Dave "[[The Edge]]" Evans. Mullen had posted an advertisement on the school bulletin board for musicians to form a band with him; Clayton showed up at the first practice, which also included Dick Evans, Dave Evans's older brother, Ivan McCormick, and Peter Martin, who were two of Mullen's friends. McCormick and Martin left the band soon after its conception. While the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, The Edge, Mullen, Evans, and Clayton), it was known as Feedback. The name was subsequently changed to The Hype, but changed to "U2" soon after Evans left the band.<ref name="bio1">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/band/bio.html |title=U2 Biography from @U2 |accessdate=2007-09-10 |author=Matt McGee |last=McGee |first=Matt}}</ref> Clayton also served as the band's first manager before [[Paul McGuinness]], a more experienced manager, was hired, because Clayton had left school earlier. 

In [[1981]], around the time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, ''[[October (album)|October]]'', a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock -and-roll with their spirituality.<ref name="bio1" /> However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider, until Bono's wedding to Alison Hewson (Ne<U+00E9> Stewart), in which Clayton was the best man.<ref name="adambio">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/band/adam/ |title=Adam Clayton Biography from @U2 |accessdate=2007-09-10 |author=David Lineage |last=Lineage |first=David}}</ref>

In August [[1989]], Clayton made newspapers around the world when he was arrested in Dublin carrying a small amount of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and has later been regretful, saying "It was my own fault. And I'm sure I was out of my head -- emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal."<ref name="adambio" /> Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head on [[26 November]], [[1993]] when he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night's show in [[Sydney]]. However he gave up alcohol after that incident.<ref name="book2">{{cite book | last = Flanagan | first = Bill | title = U2 : at the End of the World | publisher = Delta | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 0385311575 }}</ref> 

In [[1996]], after the groundbreaking [[Zoo TV Tour]] and ''[[Zooropa]]'' album, Clayton headed to [[New York]] with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught.<ref name="book2" /> During that period, he worked on U2's experimental album, released under the [[pseudonym]] "Passengers", entitled ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. That album featured is one of the few instances that Clayton appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of "[[Your Blue Room]]", the album's second single. While in New York, he collaborated with Mullen to re-record the ''[[Mission:Impossible]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="wand">{{cite web |url=http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/movie07.html |publisher=U2wanderer.com|title=Mission:Impossible Soundtrack Album |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=U2 Wanderer}}</ref>

Clayton was the only bachelor member of U2 for many years. During the early [[1990s]] he was involved in a relationship with, and at one point engaged to, British supermodel [[Naomi Campbell]]. More recently, he was engaged to marry Suzanne Smith, whom  he was planning to marry in the summer of [[2007]], but broke up in February [[2007]].<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.u2france.com/spip.php?article10122 |title=U2<U+2019>s Adam splits up with fiancee Susie (U2France) |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Barry Egan |last=Egan |first=Barry}}</ref>

==Style==

As a bass player, Adam Clayton is recognized for his unique playing style and rhythms that are apparent in many songs, most notably "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]", which evolved out of an attempt to play [[Visage]]'s song "[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]", and "[[With or Without You]]".<ref name=book1 /><ref name="interview1">{{cite web |url= http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id94.html |title= Reluctant Rock Star: How U2's Adam Clayton Learned to Play -- and Conquer the World Onstage (Bass Player, November 11, 2000) |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Gregory Isola |last=Isola |first=Gregory}}</ref> His style has been influenced by many different styles, such as [[Motown]] and [[reggae]], and has evolved over his years in U2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bass-soup.com/articles.asp?id=5&title=U2s-Adam-Clayton-Bass-sound-and-technique. |title=Adam Clayton's Bass Sound and Technique |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Bass Soup}}</ref> He cites artists such as [[Paul Simonon]] of [[The Clash]] as influences on his musical style.<ref name="interview1" /> When Clayton first joined the fledgling U2, he did not have any formal training in the bass. <ref name=book1 /> Consequently, his style developed without any formal training whatsoever until 1995. <ref name=book1 />In the early years of U2, his bass was generally a simple part in [[4/4 time]].<ref name=interview1 /> However, as the group grew and evolved, his bass became more complicated, as is the case on [[1987]]'s ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and [[1988]]'s ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.<ref name="interview1" /> He has continued to use these simple parts over the years, for example, 2000's "[[Beautiful Day]]", with a simple 8th-note part. <ref name="interview1" />

Clayton has sung on several occasions, for example, on the song "Endless Deep", the B-side to the single "[[Two Hearts Beat As One]]" from [[1983]], he made an appearance singing. He also spoke the last verse of the aforementioned "[[Your Blue Room]]". Clayton can be heard speaking on "Tomorrow ('96 Version)" (a rerecording of "Tomorrow" that he arranged) a song from U2's [[1981]] album ''[[October (album)|October]]''.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web |url=http://www.u2online.org/u2-adam.php |title=Adam Clayton Biography |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=U2 Online}}</ref> He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song "[[40 (song)|40]]", where he and guitarist [[The Edge]] switch instruments. He also plays the introduction to "[[City of Blinding Lights]]" on the keyboard.

== Musical equipment ==

Clayton has used many different basses, but his most-often used basses are listed:
*[[Fender]] Precision Bass
*Fender Jazz Bass
*[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] Thunderbird Bass
*[[Gibson Les Paul]] Triumph Bass
*Gibson Les Paul 70's Recording Bass, unknown model
*[[Lakland]] Joe Osborne Signature Bass

*Auerswald Custom Bass

Throughout his career, Clayton has used both Precision and Jazz basses. His first bass, however, was a dark brown [[Ibanez]] copy. <ref name="book1" /> He uses Ashdown amplifiers and blue Herdim picks, as does bandmate [[The Edge]].<ref name="bio2" /> Clayton's Precision bass is modified with a Fender Jazz neck; in an interview with ''Bass Player'' magazine, he said that he prefers the Jazz bass neck because it is more "lady-like" and is a better fit in his left hand.<ref name="interview1" />

== Solo projects ==
Clayton has worked on several solo projects throughout his career.  He played on [[Robbie Robertson]]'s [[Robbie Robertson (album)|self-titled album]] from 1987, and has also performed with [[Maria McKee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/robbie_robertson.html |author=theband.hiof.no|publisher=theband.hiof.no|title=Robbie Robertson:Robbie Robertson |accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2boy.nl/u2/u2_biography.php?id=u2_adam_clayton_bio |author=u2boy.n|publisher=u2boy.n|title=U2 Biography: Adam Clayton |accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> He joined U2 producer [[Daniel Lanois]] and bandmate [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] on Lanois's [[1989]] album ''[[Acadie (album)|Acadie]]'', playing the bass on the songs "Still Water" and "Jolie Louise".<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/coll25a.html |publisher=U2wanderer.com|author=U2wanderer.com|title=Acadie Album (Daniel Lanois) |accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> In [[1994]], Clayton played bass along with bandmate Larry Mullen Jr. on [[Nanci Griffith]]'s album ''[[Flyer]]'', playing on the songs "These Days in an Open Book", "Don't Forget About Me", "On Grafton Street" and "This Heart".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nancigriffith/albums/album/186920/review/5943520/flyer |title=Flyer review from Rolling Stone |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Peter Galvin |last=Galvin |first=Peter }}</ref> Clayton and Mullen also re-recorded the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' soundtrack for the [[1996]] movie remake, including the theme song, which was changed from the original 5/4 time signature to the simpler [[4/4]] signature.<ref name="wand" /> They recorded the soundtrack while both Mullen and Clayton were in [[New York City]] for musical training.<ref name=book1 /> The "Theme from Mission: Impossible" was nominated for the "Best Pop Instrumental Performance" [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in [[1997]], also reaching #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Billboard chart]].<ref name="wand" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Theme-Mission-Larry-Mullen-Clayton/dp/B00000E5GV |publisher=Amazon.com|author=Amazon.com|title=Amazon product overview and reviews of "Theme from Mission:Impossible" |accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/adam.html |author=U2wanderer.com|publisher=U2wanderer.com|title= Adam Clayton solo discography |accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>
