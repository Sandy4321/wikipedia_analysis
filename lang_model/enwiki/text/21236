'''Duce Staley''' (born February 27, 1975 in [[Lexington, South Carolina]]) is a former [[American football]] [[running back]] in the [[National Football League]] best known for his tenure with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  He works as a [[sideline reporter]] for football radio broadcasts of the [[University of South Carolina]] on the Gamecock Sports Radio Network.  Staley also hosts a daily sports talk program called "The Halftime Show" from 1 to 4 PM on 107.5 the Game, WNKT FM, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].

==Early years==
Staley attended [[Airport High School]] in [[West Columbia, South Carolina]] and was an All-State [[wide receiver]], as he did not play running back until college.

==College career==
As a senior at the [[University of South Carolina]] in 1996, Staley was ranked 13th in the nation in rushing with 1,116 rushing yards.  In his South Carolina years, he attempted 345 rushes for 1,582 yards (4.58 per average).  He also caught 59 passes for 489 yards and two touchdowns. 

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles===
Staley was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[1997 NFL Draft]] and played for the Eagles through the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]].  After his rookie season and the departure of [[Ricky Watters]], Staley became the starter in a tumultuous 3-13 season which led to the dismissal of head coach [[Ray Rhodes]].  Under [[Andy Reid]], Staley developed into the team's perennial leading receiver through Reid's screen-heavy West Coast offense.  However, he played in only five games of the 2000 season due to a serious [[Lisfranc fracture]].  Staley also missed some playing time in 2001 due to a shoulder injury.  Entering the 2003 season, Staley held-out of training camp in an attempt to bargain for a new contract, as he was in the last year of his deal.<ref>{{cite web |author=O'Rourke, Larry |title=Eagles sign their top pick McDougle |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/all-eaglesaug01,0,545925.story |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |date=August 1, 2003 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref>  With [[Correll Buckhalter]] coming back from a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) and [[Brian Westbrook]] entering his second season, the Eagles decided not to budge.  This resulted in shared playing time between the three, as Westbrook became the premier back by season's end. They were known as the "Three Headed Monster".  Consequently, the Eagles decided to not re-sign Staley.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
Staley signed a five-year, $14 million contract with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on March 9, 2004. Staley had rooted for the Steelers when he was growing up.<ref>{{cite web |author=Blass, Eileen |title=Steelers sign free-agent Duce Staley |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/steelers/2004-03-09-staley_x.htm |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=March 9, 2004 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> He instantly became the number one running back for his new team. However, he scored few touchdowns as handoffs in the redzone went to veteran back [[Jerome Bettis]]. After Staley was injured in mid-[[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004]], Bettis took over the starting job.

In [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2005]], after both he and Bettis were injured, [[Willie Parker]], an [[undrafted free agent]], had a stellar season, and Staley, in another injury plagued season, was dropped to third-string, managing only 148 yards in five games, with a 3.9 yard per carry average.

Despite a preseason in which he ran for just 92 yards on 42 carries, Staley made the Steelers' 53-man roster in 2006.  After week one, the Steelers signed former Packers' running back [[Najeh Davenport]] to replace him as the Steelers' power back.  The true signal of Staley's demise was when third-down back [[Verron Haynes]] went down with a season-ending injury, and the Steelers promoted [[John Kuhn]] from the practice squad instead of activating Staley.  On December 3, 2006, the Steelers released Staley.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steelers Release Staley, Place Reid on Injured List; Sign Familiar Faces |url=http://news.steelers.com/article/72484/ |publisher=Steelers.com |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> In his three year tenure with the team, Staley played in just 16 games.  

===Retirement===
Staley officially retired as a [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagle]] during the Eagles-Giants game on December 9, 2007.  At halftime, Staley was escorted onto the field by former teammates for his retirement celebration featuring a brief ceremony and two highlight videos.<ref>{{cite web |title=DUUUUUCE!!!!

He annually holds The Duce Staley Football Camp at West Chester (PA) University, which benefits several charities, including First Steps Program in South Carolina, the Variety Club and Direct Care for Kids.  He launched Catch 22 Foundation to help single mothers.
