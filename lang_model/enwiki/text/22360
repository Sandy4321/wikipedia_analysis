'''Eulabee Dix''' (1878 &ndash; June 14, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], who favoured the medium of [[watercolour]]s on [[ivory]] to paint [[portrait miniatures]]. During the early 20th century, when the medium was at the height of fashion, she painted many prominent figures, including [[Europe]]an nobility and famous actresses of the day.

==Early life==
Dix was born in [[Greenfield, Illinois]], to Mary Bartholomew and Horace Wells Dix,<ref name=encyc>Hirshorn, Anne Sue. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16453900.html "The portrait miniatures of Eulabee Dix"]. ''Antiques'' (November 1, 1994). Accessed at Encyclopedia.com on 2008-01-03.</ref> She had an early interest in art, and her talents and love of reading were encouraged from an early age.<ref name=askart>{{cite web| url=http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?artist=62854| title=Eulabee Dix | work=Ask Art| accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> Her family moved several times during her early years due to financial setbacks.<ref name=nmwa>{{cite web| url=http://www.nmwa.org/collection/profile.asp?LinkID=200| title=Eulabee Dix | work=National Museum of Women in the Arts| accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> During her teens, Dix went to live with wealthy family members in [[St. Louis]], where she attended [[Washington University]], and spent a year studying oil painting and life drawing at the [[St. Louis School of Fine Art]].<ref name=askart/> Her work there was recognised with two medals.<ref name=encyc/> Dix returned to her parents in 1895, when they set up home in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].<ref name=askart/> There she taught art classes, and was inspired by the daughter of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] minister to paint portrait miniatures.<ref name=askart/>

==New York studies==
In 1899 Dix moved to [[New York City]], where she first studied with [[William Merritt Chase]], however she left after one week, partly due to Chase's focus on [[oil painting]], and also because she disagreed with his philosophy of colour.<ref name=encyc/><ref name=askart/> She went on to continue her studies at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] with [[George Bridgman]], of whom she did approve.<ref name=askart/> She also underwent tuition with [[William J. Whittemore]], who taught her the technique of painting on ivory.<ref name=askart/> Whittlemore was a founder of the recently established [[American Society of Miniature Painters]] (ASMP), where she exhibited some of her work.<ref name=askart/> She also studied under [[Isaac A. Josephi]], who was the first president of the ASMP.<ref name=encyc/>  

Dix took a tiny [[studio apartment]] at 152 West 57th Street, on the 15th floor of one of the [[Carnegie Hall]] towers.<ref name=encyc/><ref name=askart/> Here she worked on commissions for many prominent New Yorkers, including the actress [[Ethel Barrymore]] and photographer [[Gertrude K<U+00E4>sebier]]. By coincidence her neighbour, [[Frederick S. Church]], was also from Grand Rapids, and he helped her make contacts within New York artistic circles.<ref name=askart/> Miniaturist [[Theodora Thayer]], whom Dix associated with and admired, also had a studio nearby.<ref name=encyc/><ref name=askart/>

==Gaining recognition==
Even with a limited income, Dix made a conscious effort to dress fashionably, and held regular Friday afternoon gatherings at her home,<ref name=askart/> where she showed off her work to potential buyers.<ref name=encyc/>

In 1904 Dix met Minnie Stevens Paget, a close friend of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], and wife of [[Arthur Henry Fitzroy Paget|Arthur Paget]], a high-ranking officer in the British Army, who later reached the rank of General, and was knighted.<ref name=askart/> They became close friends, and it was to be near Paget that Dix began to divide her time between New York and [[London]]. When in London, she took up residence in an up-market residential hotel near [[Stanhope Gardens]], in [[Kensington]].<ref name=askart/> Through her connection with Paget, Dix received commissions from many prominent figures, including the Holywood actress [[Ethel Barrymore]], whom she painted in [[Philadelphia]] in around 1905, fashion designer [[Countess Fabricotti]], as well as several from Paget herself.<ref name=askart/>

In 1906 Dix held her first exhibition, ''Exhibition of Portrait Miniature by Miss Eulabee Dix'',<ref name=papers>{{cite web| url=http://www.nmwa.org/library/Guide_EulabeeDix_papers.pdf| title=Guide to Eulabee Dix Papers| work=NMWA| accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> at the [[Fine Art Society]] on [[London]]'s [[New Bond Street]], where she exhibited 24 works. That same year she also held shows at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London, and the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref name=encyc/>

In New York Dix had the opportunity to paint writer [[Mark Twain|Samuel Langhorne Clemens]], better known by his [[pseudonym]] Mark Twain. In 1908 she did the last painting of him from life.<ref name=askart/>

==Dix as a subject==
[[File:Eulabeedix2.jpg|''Lady in Black Velvet''. Portrait of Eulabee Dix by [[Robert Henri]], 1911|thumb|upright]]
Dix herself was the subject of two portraits by renowned artist [[Robert Henri]], to whom she was introduced in 1910 by prominent [[Ireland|Irish]] artist [[John Butler Yeats]].<ref name=askart/> For one of these, she posed for a full length portrait in her wedding dress.<ref name=encyc/>
She was also photographed on at least four occasions by her friend [[Gertrude Kasebier]].<ref name=encyc/>

==Marriage==
On December 22, 1910 Dix married Alfred Leroy Becker, a New York [[lawyer]],<ref name=encyc/> after a three year engagement.<ref name=askart/> The marriage produced two children, Philip and Joan.<ref name=encyc/>

John Butler Yeats, referring to Eulabee Dix's strong personality, wrote to his daughter Lily the day after the wedding:
:''I once told her [Dix] I would not envy the man that she married, for she would be sure to devour him. She has a clinging way like ivy, which we know always kills the tree to which it attaches itself''<ref name=encyc/>

The marriage ended in 1925, after 15 years. It had been a strained marriage,<ref name=encyc/> partly because both of them had pursued successful careers in their chosen field.<ref name=askart/> The situation was made worse when Dix aborted a pregnancy against her husband's wishes.<ref name=askart/> Becker ended the marriage by declaring his love for another woman.<ref name=askart/>

==Changing fortunes==
Following her divorce in 1925, Dix sailed with her children to France, and divided her time between Europe and New York.<ref name=askart/>
She won a medal at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1927,<ref name=nmwa/> and also in New York and Philadelphia in 1929<ref name=encyc/>

Unfortunately, the [[Wall Street Crash|stock market crash]] of 1929, and the resulting [[Great Depression|Depression]] was to affect Dix's work, as many of her former clientele had seen their fortunes wiped out.<ref name=askart/> Frustrated with her stagnant career, she became estranged from her son, Philip, who went to live with his father.<ref name=askart/> 

Dix moved to East 57th Street, where she lived for around seven years.<ref name=askart/> Despite now living in a working-class neighbourhood, she continued to dress in extravagant outfits, always wearing a hat and carrying a cane.<ref name=askart/> When miniaturism went out of favour in the 1930s, she gave lectures on the art of miniature painting. She also adapted her techniques, turning to floral still life paintings, and large oil works.<ref name=askart/><ref name=nmwa/>

In 1937, with her daughter now married, Dix moved to [[Southern California]], where at first she lived on a ranch near [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref name=askart/> In an attempt to find emotional stability, she briefly joined a community of monks led by [[Ananda Ashrama]], who preached religious tolerance and simple living. Despite her impatience, the experience reportly had a calming effect on her.<ref name=askart/>

==Declining years==
During [[World War II]] Dix took a job with the [[Plas-Tex Corporation]] painting [[radium]] on [[airplane]] parts. During this time she suffered from exposure to [[radiation]], which resulted in a small pension.<ref name=askart/>
Following this, she worked in a laundry, and joined the [[International Association of Machinists]], drilling holes in airplane parts.<ref name=askart/>
She was justifiably proud of her part in helping the war effort, but her painting all but stopped. Despite this, she exhibited in the miniature division of the [[California Art Club]].

Her last portrait commission, in 1951, was from [[Kaufman Thuma Keller]], who at the time was Chairman of the Board of the [[Chrysler Corporation]]. However deteriorating eyesight meant she was unable to finish the painting.<ref name=askart/>

In 1956, aged 78, Dix sold her possessions and moved to [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]<ref name=askart/><ref name=nmwa/> where in 1958 an exhibition spanning her life's work was held at [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]].<ref name=nmwa/> It was her last exhibition, and newspapers in New York and Portugal carried articles.<ref name=askart/>

Dix returned to the United States in 1961, moving in with her son and his wife in [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]], [[Connecticut]]. On June 14, 1961, the day before she was due to be moved to a care home, Eulabee Dix died. She was interred at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] in [[St. Louis]].<ref name=askart/>

==Legacy==
Dix<U+2019>s work hangs in several institutions including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]], Lisbon; the [[National Museum of American Art]], Washington DC; and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]], Washington DC. 

The [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] has in its permanent collection over 86 of her paintings. They also hold an archive of letters, journals and other manuscripts relating to Dix's life, as will as her palette and brush, her awards, and a pencil sketch by [[John Butler Yeats]]. The archive, known collectively as the Eulabee Dix Papers, was entrusted to the museum in 1989 by Joan Becker Gaines, Dix's daughter.<ref name=nmwa2>{{cite web| url=http://www.nmwa.org/library/eulabee.asp| title=Eulabee Dix Papers | work=National Museum of Women in the Arts| accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>
