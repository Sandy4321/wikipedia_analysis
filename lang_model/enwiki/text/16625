'''Anglo-American relations''' widely encompass and span four centuries, beginning in 1607 with England's first permanent colony in North America called [[Jamestown Settlement|Jamestown]], to the present day, between the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The United Kingdom as well as the United States, formerly a part of the [[British Empire]] itself, are bound by shared history, a common language and legal system, culture, and kindred, ancestral blood lines in [[British American|British Americans]] which can be traced back hundreds of years. Through times of war and rebellion, peace and estrangement, as well as becoming friends and allies, the United Kingdom and the United States have cemented these deeply rooted links into what became known as the [[Special Relationship]]. Today, [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|British foreign policy]] as well as [[Foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]] affirm each other as their most important bi-lateral partnership and alliance in the world, as evidenced in aligned political affairs as well as joint military operations closely carried out between the two nations.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Trumbull]], depicting the British surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops at Yorktown, 1781. Oil on canvas, 1820.]]
{{see also|British America}}
The first attempt of English colonization was the [[Roanoke Colony|Lost Colony]] in 1585. Led by [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] who represented [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]], the colony would ultimately fail by 1587, due to an unsustainable supply of food and the alleged disappearance and abandonment by the colonists. The first successful English settlement in mainland North America was the [[Jamestown Settlement]], founded in 1607 for [[James I|King James I of England]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]] had limited self government. Prefaced by the [[French and Indian War]], tensions escalated from 1765 to 1775 over issues of taxation without representation and control, leading to the [[American War of Independence]]. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of 1776 was an internally controversial decisive break. British military efforts under the command of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Lord Cornwallis]] failed to defeat the American colonials, French, and Spanish in 1781 at the [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Hence, the formal recognition of the [[United States of America]] as a sovereign nation was finalized in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783. In 1785, [[John Adams]] was appointed the first American minister, now known as an ambassador, to the [[Court of St. James's]]. In 1791, Great Britain sent its first diplomatic envoy, [[George Hammond (diplomat)|George Hammond]], to the United States. When Great Britain and France went to war again in 1793, relations verged on war. The United States and Great Britain signed the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794, which established a decade of peace and prosperous trade relations. That broke down in 1805.<ref>Perkins (1955)</ref>

===War of 1812===
{{main article|War of 1812}}
After relations were on the verge of war in 1805, the United States imposed several [[trade embargo|trade embargoes]] such as the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], and the Royal Navy boarded American ships and impressed sailors. The [[War of 1812]] was instigated by causes made by the British and it was further initiated by the United States under [[James Madison|President James Madison]] as a means to protect American trading rights and freedom of the seas for neutral countries. Other motivations included anger at alleged British military support for Native Americans defending their tribal lands from encroaching American pioneers; and a desire for United States territorial expansion. The initial American winter action, a planned invasion of [[British North America]], including the successful destruction of the colonial capital of [[Toronto|York]], was eventually repelled, and in 1814 the British successfully raided Washington D.C., burning the [[White House]]. After the United States gained complete naval control of the Great Lakes by defeating the Royal Navy in numerous engagements, which prevented a total British attack from the north, negotiations led to the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the war by restoring the ''status quo ante bellum''. No territorial gains were made on either side, with the exception of Carleton Island which was annexed by the United States. Consequently, before word could be sent to both American and British military commanders that the war was over, the British suffered a major defeat and handed the Americans a victory at the [[Battle of New Orleans (1815)|Battle of New Orleans]].

===Disputes 1815<U+2013>1860===
The international slave trade was gradually suppressed after the United Kingdom passed the [[Slave Trade Act|Abolition of the Slave Trade Act]] in 1807, and the United States passed a similar law in 1808. All slaves in the British Empire were emancipated in 1833, with compensation to the slave owners. The [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, a unilateral response to a British suggestion of a joint declaration, expressed American hostility to further European encroachment in the Western hemisphere, but enjoyed British approval and was made effective by the Royal Navy.

After the [[Panic of 1837]], numerous states in the United States defaulted on bonds owned by British investors. During the [[Caroline Affair]] in 1837, [[British North America|British North American]] rebels fled to New York and used a small American ship called the ''Caroline'' to smuggle supplies into British North America after a failed rebellion there. In late 1837, militia from British North America burned the ship, leading to diplomatic protests, an unquenched sense of [[Anglophobia]], and other incidents. Additional conflicts on the [[Maine]]-[[New Brunswick]] border involved rival teams of lumberjacks in the "[[Aroostook War]]."  The [[Webster-Ashburton]] treaty of 1842 resolved these issues and finalized the border.<ref name="Allen 1954">Allen (1954)</ref> In 1859, the [[Pig War]] determined the question of where the border should be in the [[San Juan Islands]] and [[Gulf Islands]].

===American Civil War===
{{See also|Britain in the American Civil War}}
In the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] assumed that the British would prove sympathetic, despite their firm view on slavery. Though their first attempt to provoke British intervention by using an embargo of cotton exports was a failure, the [[Trent Affair]], when a U.S. ship stopped a British civilian vessel and took off two Confederate diplomats, almost provoked a third war between the United States and the United Kingdom. However, [[Abraham Lincoln|President Abraham Lincoln]] was against fighting on two fronts and U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] was able to smooth matters over. Despite intense American protests, the British allowed the [[CSS Alabama]] to leave port as a commerce raider. After the war, Great Britain abode by the arbitration of an international tribunal and paid compensation to the United States for the activities of the Alabama as part of the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref>Adams (1925)</ref>

===Venezuelan and Border disputes===<!-- This section is linked from [[Rudyard Kipling]] -->
[[File:The Great Rapprochement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uncle Sam]] embracing [[John Bull]], while [[Britannia]] and [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]] hold hands and sit together in the background in The Great Rapprochement.]] 
In 1895, [[Grover Cleveland|President Grover Cleveland]] intervened in a [[Schomburgk Line|dispute over the border]] between [[British Guiana]] and [[Venezuela]] by demanding arbitration, which was agreed to and resolved by arbitration in Great Britain's favor.  Disputes over the [[Alaska boundary dispute|Alaska-British North America border]] were resolved by arbitration in 1903, as a British judge sided with the Americans against their northern neighbors--- who were outraged to be sacrificed for the benefit of Anglo-American harmony.<ref>Campbell, ''Anglo-American Understanding 1898-1903'' (1957), p. 340.</ref>

===The Great Rapprochement===
[[The Great Rapprochement]], a term usually attributed to [[Bradford Perkins]], is used to describe the convergence of social and political objectives between the United States and the [[British Empire]] in the two decades before World War I. Since the [[American War of Independence]], the United States and the British Empire's relationship had been troubled. However, the differences that had separated an agrarian and anti-imperialist United States and the industrialized British Empire had rapidly diminished in the decades preceding the Great War. With the gradual decline of [[Anglophobia]] and the rise of the United States as a great power with its own imperial possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Great Britain was also desirous of a long-term ally that would prevent an upset in Britain's balance of power, which the [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]] appeared to threaten.

===World War I===
After victory in the [[Spanish-American War]], the United States acquired numerous overseas possessions-- Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and many others, and had begun to build the [[Great White Fleet]] as a newfound symbol of its enormous power projection. And because of this, both the United Kingdom and the [[German Empire]] engaged in propaganda campaigns designed to win over a potential World War I alliance with the United States. The British were able to guarantee a price for American cotton producers, who were the most affected by the loss of trade with Germany and Central Europe. [[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]] then opted to allow the munitions trade to continue, despite disputes over [[freedom of the seas]] because of the British blockade of Germany and complaints of a 'navalism' like German 'militarism'. This policy meant that the United States would supply only the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers. However, at the start of the war, the unrestricted activities of German agents against British interests, as well as the U.S. Federal Government's refusal to check the [[Ghadar Conspiracy|Indian sedetionist movement]] was a major concern for the British Government that triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916. The British Far-Eastern fleet's activities, especially the SS ''China'' and SS ''Henry S'' incidents drew strong responses from the U.S. Federal Government, prompting the U.S. Atlantic fleet to dispatch Destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels. However, this dispute did not calm down before November 1916.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dignan|1971|p=}}</ref>
As evidence of German complicity in public incidents, including the [[Black Tom explosion]], and conspiracies in and against the United States such as the [[Zimmerman Telegram]] became more obvious, American public opinion was strongly influenced. When Germany responded in 1916 with a submarine blockade of the United Kingdom, the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' by a German [[U-boat]] led to a protest by the United States and a strong swing in public opinion against Germany.

Germany returned to unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917 in the belief that the United Kingdom would be decisively weakened before the United States could mobilize, but the United States declared war on Germany. The United States joined the Allies, and sent hundreds of thousands of troops under the command of [[John Pershing|General John J. Pershing]], though initially slowly, to the Western front and were instrumental in hastening the end of the war.

Though President Wilson had wanted to wage war for cause of humanity, the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] made plain that his diplomatic position had weakened with victory. The borders of Europe were redrawn on the basis of [[national self-determination]] with the exception of those of Germany. Financial reparations were imposed on Germany, despite British reservations and American protests, largely because of the French desire for a punitive peace.<ref name="Allen 1954"/>

===Inter-war years===
[[Image:Wallis and Edward.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor on their wedding day.]]
{{see also|Abdication Crisis}}
The Great War was the end of the Royal Navy's superiority, an eclipse acknowledged in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], when the United States and the United Kingdom were allocated equal tonnage quotas. U.S. policies on immigration and trade fostered a Pacific rivalry with Japan rather than an Atlantic rivalry. During the [[Great Depression]], the United States was preoccupied with its own economic recovery and, espousing an [[isolationism|isolationist]] policy, was only sporadically active in foreign affairs. After the Americans imposed a high [[Smoot-Hawley]] tariff in 1930, the United Kingdom, Canada and the Empire built up imperial trade preferences, thereby diverting trade internally and away from the United States. The United Kingdom engaged in [[appeasement]] with Nazi Germany while pursuing limited rearmament. The [[Abdication Crisis]], while absorbing popular interest in both nations, did not become a foreign relations issue. At the insistence of [[Stanley Baldwin|Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin]], the ultimatum was given to [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] of retaining his throne as head of the [[Church of England]], or renouncing his birth right as king and marrying an American divorcee named [[Wallis Simpson]], the latter of which he finally did choose. Tensions over the [[Irish question]] declined with the independence of Ireland, and with the successful ambassadorship of [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] in the late 1930s.<ref>Allen (1954); Hollowell; ''Twentieth-Century Anglo-American Relations'' (2001)</ref>

===World War II===
{{see also|lend-lease}}
[[Image:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] during church services aboard HMS Prince of Wales.]]
Though much of the American public was sympathetic to the United Kingdom and France and their dangerous confrontation with [[Nazi Germany]], there was widespread demand for American neutrality. [[Franklin Roosevelt|President Franklin Roosevelt's]] [[cash-and-carry]] policy allowed the United Kingdom and France to order munitions from the United States. [[Winston Churchill|Prime Minister Winston Churchill]], whose mother was American, had become prime minister after the Allies' failure to prevent the [[German invasion of Norway]], and after the [[fall of France]], Roosevelt gave the United Kingdom and later the [[Soviet Union]] all aid short of war, including the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] of 1940 and [[Lend-lease]] in the form of [[Sherman tank|Sherman tanks]], fighter airplanes, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the a Congressional declaration of war on [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Empire of Japan]], two United States Navy destroyers had already been torpedoed on convoy duties in the North Atlantic. The United States then became heavily involved in the war in Europe. It was during this period of extremely close co-operation that the [[Relationship between the United States and United Kingdom|special relationship]] was created.<ref>Charmley. ''Churchill's Grand Alliance: The Anglo-American Special Relationship 1940-57'' (1996); Hollowell; ''Twentieth-Century Anglo-American Relations'' (2001)</ref>  Millions of American servicemen based in England led to some friction and to this relationship being explored in art and film, most particularly [[A Matter of Life and Death (film)#Anglo-American relations|''A Matter of Life and Death'']] and ''[[A Canterbury Tale#Anglo-American (mis)understandings|A Canterbury Tale]]''. As a part of their military collaboration throughout the war, scientists and physicists from both the United States and the United Kingdom, headed by American [[Robert Oppenheimer]], worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] in total secrecy, which eventually achieved the objective of building an [[atomic bomb]] before the Nazi's could obtain such a weapon.

===Cold War===
{{see also|Anglo-American loan}}
Immediately following World War II, the United Kingdom found itself in virtual financial ruin. Due to many hardships during and after the toll of war, the [[British Empire]] went into decline as several of its overseas colonies began the process of de-colonization, most notably, the independence of India which happenned in 1947. Furthermore, the United Kingdom found itself at the mercy of American economic policy. This fact was highlighted by the [[Anglo-American loan]] made to the United Kingdom by the United States in 1946. At a 2% interest rate, the terms of this loan were $586m (<U+00A3>145m in 1945) and $3,750m in line of credit (<U+00A3>930m in 1945) which was to be paid off in 50 annual installments. The last payment occurred on December 31, 2006. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4757181.stm|title=What's a little debt between friends?|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> By the end of World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom became founding members of the [[United Nations]], as well as two of the five permanent members of the [[Security Council]]. They were suspicious of the motives of their former ally, the [[Soviet Union]], under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Rising tensions between the capitalist and communist powers led to the [[Cold War]] and an era of close cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom which included the formation of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], a mutual-defense alliance. As the British Empire dissolved throughout the world, the [[United States]] became one of two world [[superpowers]] along with the [[Soviet Union]], while the [[United Kingdom]] became the most important partner with the United States on the Western side of the Cold War. Through the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]] the United States assisted the United Kingdom in [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapon development]].

Forces from both countries were involved in the [[Korean War]], fighting under United Nations command. The United States had become the undisputable leading Western power and pursued a mixed anti-colonial and anti-communist policy, resulting in the demand that the United Kingdom and France end their invasion of Egypt in 1956 during the [[Suez Crisis]], or otherwise risk economic sanctions. This threat made by [[Dwight Eisenhower|President Dwight Eisenhower]] led to an immediate British and French pull out of their military occupation as well as the resignation of [[Anthony Eden|Prime Minister Anthony Eden]].

The United States became involved in the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1960s, but received no support this time from the United Kingdom. [[Anti-Americanism]] due to Vietnam and its lack of support for France and Britain over the Suez Crisis weighed heavily on the minds of many in Europe, and this sentiment extended in the United Kingdom by [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] refusal to send British troops to Indochina.

Protests against the introduction of medium-range weapons which might have allowed a nuclear war to be confined to Europe became a fixture of British politics in the eighties, which in the end, the U.S. eventually began sending missiles to.<ref name="Hollowell, 2001">Hollowell, ''Twentieth-Century Anglo-American Relations'' (2001)</ref> <ref>Robert M. Hendershot, ''Family Spats: Perception, Illusion, and Sentimentality in the Anglo-American Special Relationship'' (2008)</ref>

[[File:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Margaret Thatcher]] with close ally and personal friend, [[Ronald Reagan]], 1981.]]
Throughout the 1980s, [[Margaret Thatcher]] was strongly supportive of [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan's]] unwavering stance towards the Soviet Union. During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], both the Americans and the British provided arms to the anti-Soviet [[Mujahadeen]] rebels in Afghanistan. Often described as 'political soulmates' and a high point in the [[Special Relationship]], both President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher met with Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on numerous occasions.

On July 29, 1981, [[Nancy Reagan|First Lady Nancy Reagan]] attended what is often called the 'wedding of the century,' the nuptials of Charles and Diana, The Prince and Princess of Wales at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London.

In the [[Falklands War]], the United States initially tried to mediate between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982, but ultimately ended up supporting the United Kingdom's counter-invasion. The [[United States Defense Department]] under [[Casper Weinberger]] supplied the British military with equipment.<ref>Simon Jenkins, "American Involvement In The Falklands"  ''The Economist,'' 3rd March 1984</ref>

In October of 1983, the United States and a coalition of Caribbean nations undertook [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the invasion of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] island nation of [[Grenada]]. Grenada had seen a bloody Marxist coup and neighboring countries asked the United States to intervene militarily, which it did successfully despite earlier having made assurances to a deeply concerned British government.

===Post Cold War===
When the United States became the world's lone [[superpower]] after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, new threats emerged which confronted the United States and its [[NATO]] allies. In 1991, the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, provided the two largest forces respectively for the coalition army which liberated Kuwait in the [[Persian Gulf War]].

In 1997, the [[British Labour party]] were elected to office for the first time in eighteen years. The new prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], and [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] both used the expression [[Third way (centrism)|'Third Way']] to describe their center-left ideologies. Forces from both countries were again used to impose peace during the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name="Hollowell, 2001"/>

In August of 1997, the American people expressed solidarity with the British nation, sharing in its grief and sense of shock on the tragic death of [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana, Princess of Wales]], who perished in a car crash in Paris, France. [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton]] attended the funeral at [[Westminster Abbey]] on September 6, 1997.

===War on Terror===

[[File:Blair Bush Whitehouse (2004-11-12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tony Blair]] and [[George W. Bush]] shake hands after their press conference in the East Room of the White House on November 12, 2004.]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], there was an enormous outpouring of sympathy from the United Kingdom for the American people, and Tony Blair was one of [[George W. Bush|U.S President George W. Bush's]] strongest international supporters. With permission by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Star Spangled Banner|American National Anthem]] was played in the forecourt of [[Buckingham Palace]] during [[Guard Mounting]] in the presence of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] and then United States Ambassador to the United Kindgom, [[William Farish]]. The United States declared a [[War on Terror]] following the attacks. British forces participated in the United States-led [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]] and unlike [[France]], [[Germany]], [[China]], and [[Russia]], the United Kingdom, as well as [[Commonwealth]] nations, mainly [[Australia]], supported the United States-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The United States, followed closely by the the United Kingdom, contributed the most troops to the coalition that entered Iraq.<ref>Shawcross (2004)</ref>

The [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7, 2005 London bombings]] emphasized the difference in the nature of the terrorist threat to both nations. The United States concentrated primarily on global enemies, like the [[al-Qaeda]] network and other Islamic extremists from the Middle East. The London bombings were carried out by homegrown extremist Muslims, and it emphasized the United Kingdom's threat from the radicalization of its own people. By 2007, British support among the public for the Iraq war had plummeted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/13/ftyank12.xml |title=Sometimes, I pretend I am Canadian |accessdate=2007-07-13 |format=HTML |work=Helen Kirwan-Taylor}}</ref>

Despite Prime Minister Tony Blair's historically low approval ratings with the British public, mainly due to allegations of faulty government intelligence of [[Iraq]] possessing [[weapons of mass destruction]], his unapologetic and unwavering stance for the United Kingdom's alliance with the United States can be summed up in his own words. He said, "We should remain the closest ally of the US... not because they are powerful, but because we share their values." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3264169.stm#btp|title=US and UK: A transatlantic love story?|accessdate=06/09/2009|format=HTML |work=BBC}}</ref>

===Present status===
Present British policy is that the relationship with the [[United States]] represents the United Kingdom's "most important bilateral relationship" in the world.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f845cfdc-3bd8-11dc-8002-0000779fd2ac.html FT.com / Home UK / UK - Ties that bind: Bush, Brown and a different relationship<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] paid tribute to the relationship in February 2009 by saying, "it stands the test of time."<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7866859.stm</ref>

On March 3, 2009, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] made his first visit to the Obama White House. During his visit, he presented the President a gift, a pen holder carved from the HMS Gannet, which served anti-slavery missions off the coast of Africa. [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama<U+2019>s]] gift to the Prime Minister was a box of 25 DVDs with movies including [[Star Wars]] and [[E.T.]]--all of which were Region 1 disks, unplayable on machines made outside the United States. The wife of the Prime Minster, Sarah Brown, gave the Obama daughters, Sasha and Malia, two dresses from British clothing retailer, [[Topshop]], and a few unpublished books that have not reached the United States. [[Michelle Obama|First Lady Michelle Obama]] gave the sons of the Prime Minister two [[Marine One]] helicopter toys.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama's Blockbuster Gift for Brown: 25 DVDs

On a personal level, both [[First Family of the United States|America's First Family]] and [[British Royal Family|Britain's Royal Family]] have clearly developed a fond closeness. This was illustrated by the recent breach of protocol between [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]], who in gestures of good will and friendship, publicly put their arms around each other during a party held at [[Buckingham Palace]] in conjunction with the London G20 summit. <ref>{{cite news|title=Michelle Obama's warm touch with queen draws gasps|Web site=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/04/02/michelle.obama.queen/index.html}}</ref> On June 13, 2009, First Lady Michelle Obama and her two children, [[Sasha Obama]] and [[Malia Obama]] were privately received by Queen Elizabeth II, where access was granted for a rare and unprecedented three-hour tour of the State rooms at Buckingham Palace.

==Common memberships==
{{UKUSA}}
The United States and the United Kingdom are both founding as well as common members of several [[List of international organizations|international organizations]] and global institutions. For obvious political reasons and despite both nations being in the [[Anglosphere]], the United States, unlike the United Kingdom, is not a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].
*[[United Nations]]
*[[United Nations Security Council]] (Both nations are two of five permanent members-- UK, USA, China, Russia, and France, each with a veto power.)

==Heritage==
Because thirteen U.S. states are historical remnants of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]], the United States and the United Kingdom retain significant shared threads of cultural heritage, many of which are common to all [[Anglosphere]] countries. The English-speaking peoples of the United States and United Kingdom are historically [[Christian]], although increasingly secular and diverse in the modern era. The legal systems of both nations are based on [[common law]]. Likewise, the [[United States Constitution]], created by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], was influenced by the [[Magna Carta]].

Since [[English language|English]] is the ''de facto'' language of both nations, the United States and the United Kingdom are members of the [[Anglosphere]]. However, the common language which binds the peoples of the United Kingdom and the United States does come with significant [[American and British English differences|differences in spelling, pronunciation, and the meaning of words]].

[[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], a federal holiday celebrated in the United States on the fourth Thursday of every November, is a traditional family gathering in remembrance of the [[Pilgrims]], settlers who sailed from [[England]] to the [[New World]], and their first seasonal harvest and feast in 1621.

[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], a federal holiday celebrated in the United States every 4th of July, is a national celebration which commemorates the July 4, 1776 signing of the [[Declaration of Independence]], the birth of the American republic, the dissolution of ancestral links and the modern renewal of good relations with the mother country, [[Great Britain]].

==Popular Culture==
===Literature===
Literature also crosses over the Atlantic Ocean, as evidenced by, the appeal of British authors such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[J.K. Rowling]] in the United States, and American authors such as [[Stephen King]] and [[Michael Crichton]] in the United Kingdom. [[T.S. Eliot]], a poet and playwright who moved to England in 1914 and became a British subject in 1927, was a leading American author who greatly influenced the Modern period of British literature.

===Print Journalism===
British Sunday [[broadsheet]] newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' includes a condensed copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/pressoffice/pressrelease/story/0,,2013032,00.html THE OBSERVER TO FEATURE NEW YORK TIMES WEEKLY SUPPLEMENT | Press office | guardian.co.uk<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

===Film===
[[File:Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|In [[The Prince and the Showgirl]] (1957), British actor [[Sir Laurence Olivier]] starred alongside the American icon, [[Marilyn Monroe]].]]
There is much crossover appeal in the modern entertainment culture of the United States and the United Kingdom. For example, [[Hollywood films|Hollywood]] blockbuster movies made by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] have had a gigantic effect on British audiences in the United Kingdom, while the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]] series of films have attracted high interest in the United States. [[Walt Disney|Walt Disney's]] films have continued to make an indelible mark and incredible impression on British audiences for almost 100 years. Production of films has often been shared between the two countries{{ndash}} whether it be a concentrated use of British and American actors or use of film studios from both nations.

===Theatre===
The [[Broadway theatre]] district in New York City has toured London's [[West End theatre]] district over the years, with notable performances such as [[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]], [[Grease (musical)|Grease]], [[Mamma Mia (musical)|Mamma Mia!]] and [[Rent (musical)|Rent]]. In contrast, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Andrew Lloyd Webber's]] theatrical scores such as [[Cats (musical)|Cats]] and [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] have found instant success on Broadway. For many years, [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] histories, comedies, and tragedies have also proven to be popular in American theatres.

===Television===
Both countries' television shows are similar, as many American and British television series are either carried by the other nations' networks, or are re-created for distribution in their own nations. Some popular British television shows that were re-created for the American market are ''[[The Office]]'', ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (as ''[[Sanford and Son]]''), ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', ''[[Pop Idol]]'' (''[[American Idol]]''), ''[[Queer as Folk]]'', and ''[[Til Death Us Do Part]]'' (''[[All in the Family]]''). Some American shows re-created in the United Kingdom are ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right]]''. Popular American shows that are also popular in the United Kingdom include ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' series. Many British actors appear on American television and vice-versa, for example:
* [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' francise]] - [[Patrick Stewart]] (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''), [[Marina Sirtis]] (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''), [[Dominic Keating]] (''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'')
* ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' <U+2013> [[Henry Ian Cusick]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Rebecca Mader]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Marsha Thomason]], [[Sonya Walger]]

* Other <U+2013> [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] (''[[Without a Trace]]''), [[David McCallum]] (''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''), [[Santiago Cabrera]] (''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''), [[Ashley Jensen]] (''[[Ugly Betty]]''), [[John Oliver]] (''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''), [[Damian Lewis]] (''[[Life (US TV series)|Life]]''), [[Anna Friel]] (''[[Pushing Daisies]]''), [[Sophia Myles]] (''[[Moonlight (TV series)|Moonlight]]''), [[Michelle Ryan]] (''[[Bionic Woman]]''), [[Zuleikha Robinson]] (''[[New Amsterdam (TV series)|New Amsterdam]]'').

The [[BBC]] airs two television networks in the United States, [[BBC America]] and [[BBC World]].  Also, the BBC and PBS share many collaborations and rebroadcasts, such as ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Nova]]'', and ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]''. The BBC also frequently collaborates with US network HBO, showing American documentaries in the United Kingdom including ''[[Rome (tv series)|Rome]]'', ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]'', ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', and ''[[The Gathering Storm (2002 film)|The Gathering Storm]]''. [[C-Span]], the U.S. Federal Government's channel, weekly rebroadcasts [[Prime Minister's Questions]] on Sundays.

On some British digital television platforms, it is also possible to watch American channels direct from the United Kingdom, such as [[Fox News]], as well as American channels setup for British audiences such as [[CNBC Europe]], [[CNN]], [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]], [[Comedy Central (UK TV channel)|Comedy Central]], and [[FX (UK)|FX]]. The [[Super Bowl]], the [[National Football League]] final tournament which occurs every February, has been broadcast in the United Kingdom since 1983, and was aired on free television on [[Five]] in 2003. London was also the venue for the first competitive NFL game ever to be played outside North America in October of 2007.

===Music===
{{see also|British Invasion}}
{{see also|Anglo-American music}}
American singers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Britney Spears]] are popular in the United Kingdom, and British artists such as [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Leona Lewis]], and [[Coldplay]] have achieved success in the large American market. Undoubtedly, the popular music of both nations has had a strong sway on each other. In the United Kingdom, many [[Hollywood films]] are closely associated and identified with the musical scores and soundtracks composed by famous American musicians such as [[John Williams]], [[Alan Silvestri]], [[Jerry Goldsmith]], and [[James Horner]]. 

The [[Celtic music]] of the United Kingdom has had a dynamic effect upon American music. In particular, the [[old-time music|traditional music]] of the [[Southern United States]] is descended from traditional Celtic music and [[Folk music of England|English folk music]] of the colonial period, and the musical traditions of the South eventually gave rise to [[country music]] and, to a lesser extent, [[American folk music revival|folk]].

The birth of [[jazz]], [[swing]], [[big band]], and especially [[rock n roll]], which in itself originated in the United States by famous American entertainers such as [[Bill Haley]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Elvis Presley]], had greatly influenced the later development of [[rock music]] in the United Kingdom, particularly British bands such as [[The Beatles]] and the [[Rolling Stones]], while it's American precursor, the [[blues]], greatly influenced many of the British electric rock.
