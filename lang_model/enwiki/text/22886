==History==
The "Research School for Pacific Studies" (RSPacS) began as one of the foundation schools
of the Institute of Advanced Studies at ANU. Its name was changed to the Research School of
Pacific ''and Asian'' Studies in 1994, to reflect "the balance of research activity in the
School which has shifted significantly from the Pacific towards Asia in recent years and
will continue to do so."<ref>ANU heritage, [http://heritage.anu.edu.au/site1/_includes/Files/429_RSPAS.pdf "RSPS," p. 3] citing "Minutes of the 251st meeting of the Board of the Institute of Advanced Studies," 18 November 1993; retrieved 2011-05-16</ref> 

RSPAS developed along multidisciplinary lines, encompassing [[anthropology]],
[[archaeology]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[international relations]], [[linguistics]],
[[political science]],<ref>[http://www.auspsa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=16  Australian Political Studies Association] (APSA); retrieved 2011-05-16</ref> [[resource management]] and [[strategic defence studies]].<ref>ANU heritage, [http://heritage.anu.edu.au/site1/_includes/Files/429_RSPAS.pdf "RSPS," p. 1]</ref>
