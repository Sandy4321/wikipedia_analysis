}}'''Charles (Charlie) James Fane Preedy''' ([[11 January]] [[1900]] <U+2013> February 1978) was an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. 

One of six children, Preedy was born in [[Neemuch]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], where his father was serving with the [[Royal Artillery]]. The family returned to [[Eltham, London]], in 1907 where he attended Gordon School.  He began playing football as a youth, turning professional in 1924 with [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], where he became the club's regular keeper and made 131 league appearances in four seasons. Preedy moved to [[Wigan Borough F.C.|Wigan Borough]] in 1928 and spent a single season there, playing 41 league matches, before moving to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in May 1929.  He was not initially the Gunners' first team goalkeeper, instead mainly playing as understudy to [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]], Arsenal's regular keeper. Preedy made his Arsenal debut on [[September 7]] [[1929]], against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], and kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2-0.

Preedy kept his place after that match but was dropped after a 2-5 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in November. After that, he was often left out of the team in favour of Lewis, but after Lewis was injured in a 6-6 draw against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], Preedy was picked to play in the [[FA Cup]] Final against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].  Preedy kept a clean sheet and Arsenal won the match 2-0 in front of 100,000 spectators, the first of Arsenal<U+2019>s many successes over the years. He was presented with his winner<U+2019>s medal by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].

Arsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] was never happy with any of his goalkeepers and in an attempt to fill the role signed both [[Gerard Keizer]] and [[Bill Harper]] in the 1930 close season, and then [[Frank Moss (goalkeeper)|Frank Moss]] a year later. Despite intense competition for the goalkeeper's place, Preedy made 25 appearances in the [[1930-31 in English football|1930-31]] and [[1931-32 in English football|1931-32]] seasons, but not enough to win a [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] medal in the former. After an entire season spent as Moss's understudy, Preedy left Arsenal for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in 1933, having played 40 matches for the Gunners. After a season with Rovers he moved to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and finished his career with non-league [[Margate F.C.|Margate]] in 1935. He then followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Jack, and became a London [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver. He died in 1978.
