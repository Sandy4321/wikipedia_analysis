[[File:Vancouver-gmplace3.jpg|thumb|General Motors Place, now [[Rogers Arena]], was the Vancouver Grizzlies' home arena]]
The '''Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis''' was a successful effort by the ownership group of the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] the basketball team from the Canadian city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], to the US city of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The team began play as the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in the [[2001<U+2013>02 Memphis Grizzlies season|2001<U+2013>02 season]]. It was the first of three [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) franchise moves between 2001 and 2008, and the third of four major league teams to relocate from Canada to the United States between 1995 and 2005.

The Grizzlies had been created as an [[expansion team]] along with the [[Toronto Raptors]] in 1995. For the six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies performed poorly; it only once finished better than last in the [[Midwest Division (NBA)|Midwest Division]] and never reached the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. The Grizzlies were owned by [[Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment]], who also owned the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). In 1999, [[Bill Laurie]], owner of the NHL team [[St. Louis Blues]], attempted to buy the Grizzlies, with the intent to move it to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. After interference by the NBA, the Grizzlies were sold to [[Michael Heisley]]. He immediately started the process to relocate the team, and seven US cities were candidates for the team<U+2014>[[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], Memphis, [[New Orleans]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[San Diego]]<U+2014>before settling on the move to Memphis at the end of the season.

The first four Grizzlies seasons had given average attendance in the middle third of the league. However, the last two seasons saw a reduction to among the league's lowest attendances; participating reasons were the teams poor performance and the [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA lockout]]. Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak [[Canadian dollar]], unwillingness of some US players to live in Canada, and lack of local ownership. As of 2011, the current Canucks owners have announced interest to relocate another NBA team to Vancouver.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

==Background==
Memphis has previously had a different major basketball team, in the NBA predecessor [[American Basketball Association]]. Founded as the [[New Orleans Buccaneers]] in 1967, the franchise moved to Memphis in 1970, becoming the [[Memphis Pros]]. The team changed its name to the Memphis Tams and then the Memphis Sounds, before folding in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MMS/ |title=Memphis Sounds Franchise Index |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Mike Bibby Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mike Bibby]] was [[1998 NBA Draft|drafted in 1998]] and remained with the Grizzlies as long as they were in Vancouver.]]
The Grizzlies were created as an expansion team for the [[1995<U+2013>96 Vancouver Grizzlies season|1995<U+2013>96 season]] which, along with the creation of the Toronto Raptors, saw the NBA expand into Canada. The Grizzlies were owned by Vancouver Canucks owner [[Arthur Griffiths]]. His company was in the process of building [[Rogers Arena|General Motors Place]] (GM Place) for the Canucks, and saw the Grizzlies as an additional tenant.<ref name=north>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/history/history_north.html |title=The NBA Settles North of the Border |publisher=[[Memphis Grizzlies]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000916094006/http://nba.com/Grizzlies/00400478.html#1 |archivedate=16 September 2000}}</ref> Both Canadian teams (the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors) were hampered by the NBA's decision to deny them one of the top five picks in the [[1995 NBA Draft|first draft]], and the teams would not be allowed a top draft pick in the following three seasons, even if they should win [[NBA Draft Lottery|the lottery]]. The teams were also hindered from using their full [[salary cap]] the first two seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/01/12/2003-01-12__new__charlotte_gets_fast_br.html |title='New' Charlotte gets fast break |last=Lawrence |first=Mitch |date=12 January 2003 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GwGgo8t}}</ref> For all six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies had a terrible record. They finished seventh of seven in five seasons, and claimed one sixth place in the Midwest Division, never close to reaching the playoffs. The team won 101&nbsp;games and lost 359, giving a [[winning percentage]] of .220.<ref name=MEM>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/ |title=Memphis Grizzles Franchise Index |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GwJIaTP}}</ref>

==Change of ownership==
On 7 March 1995, the majority of the holding company was sold from Griffiths to [[Seattle]]-based [[John McCaw, Jr.]]<ref name=north /> On 12 November 1996, McCaw bought the rest of company. He stated that he was committed to retaining the team in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/McCaw+Agrees+to+Purchase+Griffiths%27+Shares+in+Orca+Bay+Sports+%26...-a018852274 |title=McCaw Agrees to Purchase Griffiths' Shares in Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment |publisher=[[Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment]] |date=12 November 1996 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GwNIMdX}}</ref> Griffiths was forced to sell the Canucks and Grizzlies following the [[cost overrun]]s that occurred on GM Place, and the expansion fees to start the Grizzlies had made his company illiquid.<ref name=rekindled />

In 1999, McCaw started attempts to sell either Orca Bay or the Grizzlies, and at first negotiated an agreement with [[Dennis Washington]], owner of [[Seaspan]], who had a large portion of his operations in Vancouver. Washington initially agreed to purchase 50&nbsp;percent of Orca Bay, with the intent of keeping the teams in Vancouver. Instead, McCaw used Washington's bid to leverage a higher sales price with Bill Laurie, who offered US$148&nbsp;million for the Grizzlies, and a US$52&nbsp;million bonus if the team ultimately relocated to St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/BasketballVancouverArchive/oct20_daniels.html |title=Grizzlies sale stinks for 52 million reasons  |last=Daniels |first=Craig |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=20 October 1999 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GwPW3L2}}</ref> The announcement was made in September&nbsp;1999, one month after Laurie had bought the NHL team [[St. Louis Blues]] and their home venue Kiel Center (now [[Scottrade Center]]).

After the deal was announced, [[Commissioner of the NBA]] [[David Stern]] stated that he was opposed to a relocation, showing to that no NBA franchise had moved since the mid-1980s. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue. On 21 January 2001, Laurie announced that he had paid McCaw an undisclosed amount to walk away from the deal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/BasketballVancouverArchive/jan21_van.html |title=Vancouver Grizzlies back up for sale |date=21 January 2001 |work=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GwXww0N}}</ref>

Four days later, on 25 January, it was announced that the Grizzlies was sold to Chicago-based [[Michael Heisley]] for US$160&nbsp;million. At a press conference, he stated that he had the support of Stern, that he was committed to keeping the franchise in Vancouver, to making it a winning team, and that he was an owner that was committed to the market.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chicagoan Buys Grizzlies, Says They'll Stay In Vancouver |last=Shapiro |first=Mark |date=25 January 2001 |page=2 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>

==Reasons for relocation==
[[File:David Stern.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Commissioner of the NBA]] [[David Stern]]]]

Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' president of basketball operations, stated in the final Vancouver season that the company was losing US$40&nbsp;million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a [[salary cap]] of US$48&nbsp;million.<ref name=financial>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/13/vancouvergrizzlies010213.html |title=Grizzlies a financial failure |last=Morris |first=Jim |date=22 March 2001 |work=[[CBC Sports]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61Gwx5cnb}}</ref> Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87&nbsp;million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30&nbsp;million relocation fee to the NBA.<ref name=rekindled>{{cite news |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/dreams+rekindled+years+after+Grizzlies+demise/4315895/story.html |title=NBA dreams rekindled, 10 years after Grizzlies<U+2019> demise |last=Beamish |first=Mike |date=19 February 2011 |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |accessdate=20 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:URMUKipbqZwJ:www.canada.com/topics/sports/basketball/story.html%3Fid%3D4315895&cd=1&hl=no&ct=clnk&gl=no&client=firefox-a&source=www.google.no |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref> Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, [[University of Victoria]] professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.<ref name=financial />

[[Stu Jackson]], general manager for the first five seasons, made several non-optimal player selection decisions. This included selecting [[Bryant Reeves]] in the [[1995 NBA Draft|1995 Draft]], and signing him to a US$65&nbsp;million six-year contract extension in 1997, putting the Grizzlies in a salary cap squeeze. From then he consequently drafted point guards, including [[Antonio Daniels]], who failed to develop. Jackson traded a 2003 first-round pick for [[Otis Thorpe]], who "hated Vancouver". He signed free agent [[Tony Massenburg]] for US$1.5&nbsp;million, just to sign [[Isaac Austin]] for US$5.5&nbsp;million and leave Massenburg on the bench.<ref name=financial /> Griffiths retrospectively stated that the draft conditions from the NBA did not allow the franchise to build a winning team in years, and that the NBA had asked too high a price for not providing the means of a suitable income.<ref name=rekindled /> On the other hand, the Raptors succeeded in drafting [[Vince Carter]], reached the playoffs in the [[1999<U+2013>2000 Toronto Raptors season|1999<U+2013>2000 season]] and played for a sell-out crowd.<ref name=financial />

The location of the team in Canada was a major contributor; at the time the [[exchange rate]] was 67&nbsp;[[United States dollar|US cents]] to the Canadian dollar. Because revenue was collected in Canadian dollars but player and coach salaries were paid in US dollars, the team ended up spending an undue amount of its revenue on salaries.<ref name=rekindled /> The 1998<U+2013>99 lockout was the pivoting point for home game attendance. While the whole league experienced a drop in attendance after the lockout, Vancouver experienced an even larger fall.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1968768 |title=NHL's future buoyed by die-hard fanbase |last=Rovell |first=Darren |date=8 February 2005 |work=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxAeBMy}}</ref> The average attendance in [[1997<U+2013>98 Vancouver Grizzlies season|1997<U+2013>98]] was 16,108, ranking 16th in the league,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/VAN/1999.html |title=1998-99 Vancouver Grizzlies Schedule and Results |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxAeBMy}}</ref> while it fell to 13,899 in [[1999<U+2013>2000 Vancouver Grizzlies season|1999<U+2013>00]], ranking 27th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/VAN/2000.html |title=1999-00 Vancouver Grizzlies Schedule and Results |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61Gx4RH4u}}</ref>

Retrospectively, Griffiths stated that Heisley intentionally ran the team financially aground by alienating people, running insufficient marketing, and claiming basketball did not work in Vancouver. While running the team, Griffiths had not lost "millions and millions" and he stated that Vancouver had a better fan base than most NBA teams. The statements were denied by Heisley.<ref name=rekindled />

==Proposed cities==
[[File:Memphis Pyramid HDR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pyramid Arena]] would become the home venue for the Grizzles from 2001 to 2004]]
With the public announcement in mid-February of the possible relocation of the team, Heisley and representatives for the Grizzlies set out on a road trip to consider several US cities which wanted to have the franchise relocate to their city.<ref name=lasvegas>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/01/sports/sp-31788 |title=Owner of Grizzlies Tours Las Vegas |last=Shaikin |first=Bill |date=1 March 2001 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxGaJhb}}</ref> Originally Heisley had until 1 March to apply to the NBA for a relocation,<ref name=neworleans /> but the deadline was later extended to 26&nbsp;March. A similar deadline was also awarded to the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Charlotte Hornets]], who were also considering a relocation.<ref name=lasvegas />

In February&nbsp;2001, the Louisville Board of Aldermen contacted the Grizzlies in an attempt to relocate the team to [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The city lacked a suitable venue, but state and local officials agreed to build a new US$200&nbsp;million arena if the NBA franchise relocate to the city. In addition, Tricon Global Restaurants (now [[Yum! Brands]]) would offer Heisley US$5 million per year for 20&nbsp;years to locate the team in Louisville.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wlky.com/news/546369/detail.html |title=Stakes Raised In Grizzlies Bidding War |date=March 2001 |work=[[WLKY]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxJKGl7}}</ref>

The Memphis relocation effort was led by [[AutoZone]] founder [[Pitt Hyde]], who promised to purchase 50% of the team. The city had a 1991 venue, [[Pyramid Arena]], which could be used as a temporary home until a new US$250 million venue was ready for use in 2004. The venue would be publicly financed through sales tax rebates, government-backed bonds and hotel and car rental taxes. The Memphis efforts to get an NBA team had started in 1997, following the relocation of the [[Tennessee Titans]] of the [[National Football League]] to [[Nashville]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/04/sports/sp-18655 |title=NBA Approves Grizzlies' Move |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=4 July 2001 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxLHyuX}}</ref>

[[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] mayor [[Marc Morial]] stated that he had approached Heisley in an attempt to attract the Grizzlies to his city. The city had opened the US$114&nbsp;million [[New Orleans Arena]] in 1999, and offered it as a home to the franchise. Metrovision, the area's economic development chamber, stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing [[luxury box|suites]], [[season ticket]]s and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was a waiting list for suites. Also a relocation to St. Louis, under the same conditions as with Laurie, was considered.<ref name=neworleans>{{cite news |url=http://www.wdsu.com/news/484347/detail.html |title=City Charms NBA's Grizzlies  |date=February 2001 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Honda Center in Anaheim California on 22-03-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Honda Center|Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]], home of the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], was considered as a relocation site]]
Another option was to relocate to [[Anaheim, California]], in [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Greater Los Angeles]]. The [[Houston Rockets]] had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now [[Honda Center]]) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, [[The Walt Disney Company]], although Disney stated they were willing to negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], which would make the media market small and limit revenue.<ref name=anaheim>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/13/sports/sp-24823 |title=Anaheim Interested in Landing Grizzlies |last=Shaikin |first=Bill |date=13 February 2001 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxNYXhI}}</ref>

[[Buffalo, New York]] announced interest in attracting the Grizzlies. The city had an appropriate venue in HSBC Arena (now [[First Niagara Center]]), home of the NHL team [[Buffalo Sabres]]. Mayor [[Anthony Masiello]], a former college basketball star, stated that the attempt was "a long shot", but worth the try.
The city previously had an NBA franchise in the [[Buffalo Braves]], which was relocated to become the [[San Diego Clippers]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20010221/ctvnews84210?hub=OttawaHome |title=Buffalo joins cities trying to lure Grizzlies out of Vancouver |date=21 February 2001 |work=[[Canadian Television Network]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxR5kIb}}</ref> The Clippers moved to Los Angeles in 1984, and San Diego was also mentioned as a potential site for the Grizzlies, although the city lacked a suitable venue.<ref name=anaheim/> Las Vegas, Nevada was visited by Hainsley, where he negotiated with Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]]. The city offered the team free land for a new arena, but would not pay for construction. The other issue was Stern's demand that casinos stop accepting bets on NBA games as a precondition of placing a team in Las Vegas.<ref name=lasvegas />

The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As the latter two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have to play in a sub-optimal location for several seasons. However, the construction of a new venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/24/sports/sp-42144 |title=Anaheim, Pond Still Not Ready to Concede Defeat |last=Shaikin |first=Bill |date=24 March 2001 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxTGpoB}}</ref> A 2000 report from [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] concluded with small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity.

==Relocation==
[[File:FedExForum.jpg|thumb|left|[[FedExForum]] has been the Grizzlies' home venue since 2004]]

In Vancouver, the organization Save the Grizzlies was established to find a local investor to purchase the team.<ref name=lasvegas /> Led by among others [[Peter Ufford]], they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, they may have been able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30&nbsp;percent discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town.<ref name=rekindled />

On 26 March 2001, Heisley announced that he had selected Memphis.<ref name=looking>{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/833255/Memphis-Grizzlies-Its-looking-that-way.html |title=Memphis Grizzlies?

The NBA Relocation Committee gave its approval for the move to Memphis in late June, and on 4 July the Board of Governors unanimously approved the relocation. This also permitted Hyde to purchase a minority share of the franchise. By then the team administration had already relocated, and the day before the final decision, the team set up its rookie camp at [[Rhodes College]]. A relocation party was held on 7 July. A week before the move, the Grizzlies traded away two of the top players, [[Shareef Abdur-Rahim]] and guard [[Mike Bibby]], who therefore never played for the Memphis Grizzlies.<ref name=ok>{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/851482/NBA-officially-OKs-team-transfer-to-Memphis.html |title=NBA officially OKs team transfer to Memphis |first=Woody |last=Baird |work=[[Deseret News]] |date=4 July 2001 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61GxZrbAP}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The move to Memphis did not solve the Grizzlies' financial problems, and as of 2011 the team's cumulative loss was US$100&nbsp;million.

In 2011, the ownership group of the Canucks, now owned by [[Francesco Aquilini]], announced they were considering purchasing the Hornets. In December 2010, the Hornets were bought by the league, and there was potential for relocation due to the club's financial difficulties. However, a Hornets move was effectively taken off the table in 2012 when [[Tom Benson]], a New Orleans native who already owned the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[New Orleans Saints]], purchased the team.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/nba_sale__the_hornets__tom_2012_06_15.html |title=NBA Sale of New Orleans Hornets to Tom Benson Is Finalized |publisher=New Orleans Hornets |date=June 15, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref> The city of Vancouver also attempted to purchase the [[Sacramento Kings]] from the Maloof family, but to no avail. In a major change from 2001<U+2014>when one unnamed former NBA executive stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime<U+2014>Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with [[Pittsburgh]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Reasons for considering Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which has been roughly at par with the U.S. dollar since early 2010; the influx of international players who would be more willing to play in Canada; sell-outs for pre-season [[exhibition game]]s at Rogers Arena (the new name of GM Place); Vancouver having a state-of-the-art venue; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly because of lack of interest for basketball in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theprovince.com/technology/Perfect+storm+turns+favour+Vancouver+team/4291165/story.html |title=Perfect storm turns in favour of Vancouver NBA team |last=Tsumura |first=Howard |date=16 February 2011 |work=[[The Province]] |accessdate=20 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3G_m7Ei3KSMJ:www.theprovince.com/story_print.html%3Fid%3D4291165%26sponsor%3D&cd=1&hl=no&ct=clnk&gl=no&client=firefox-a&source=www.google.no |archivedate=17 July 2011}} Note also that the NBA executive who stated that the league would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime was still alive at the time of this story.</ref> The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports, with the creation of the [[Vancouver Giants]] in junior hockey, the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] joining [[Major League Soccer]]. However, the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences, such as skiing, hunting, fishing and golf, which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports.<ref name=rekindled />
