==Biography==
Ben Okri is a member of the [[Urhobo people]]; his father was Urhobo, and his mother has half-[[Igbo people|Igbo]].<ref name=britishcouncil/> He was born in [[Minna]] in west central Nigeria to Grace and Silver Okri in 1959.<ref name=freespirit><U+201C>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/aug/11/fiction.benokri Free spirit],<U+201D> Maya Jaggi, ''The Guardian'', 10 August 2007.</ref> His father Silver moved his family to London when Okri was less than two years old<ref name=mo/> so that Silver could study law.<ref><U+201C>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/26/ben-okri-family-values Ben Okri: My family values],<U+201D> Juliet Rix, ''The Guardian'', 25 June 2010.</ref> Okri thus spent his earliest years in London, and attended primary school in Peckham.<ref name=guardian-profile/> In 1968 Silver moved his family back to Nigeria where he practiced law in [[Lagos]], providing free or discounted services for those who could not afford it.<ref name=freespirit/> His exposure to the [[Nigerian civil war]]<ref name=sethi>[http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/ben-okri-novelist-as-dream-weaver "Ben Okri: novelist as dream weaver"], Anita Sethi, ''TheNational'', 1 September 2011.</ref> and a culture in which his peers saw visions of spirits<ref name=mo/> at this time later provided inspiration for Okri's fiction.

At the age of 14, after being rejected for admission to a university program in physics because of his youth, Okri claimed to have had a revelation that poetry was his chosen calling.<ref name=scotsmaninterview/> He began writing articles on social and political issues, but these never found a publisher.<ref name=scotsmaninterview/> He then wrote short stories based on those articles, and some were published in women's journals and evening papers.<ref name=scotsmaninterview/> Okri claimed that his criticism of the government in some of this early work led to his name being placed on a death list, and necessitated his departure from the country.<ref name=mo/> In the late 1970s, Okri moved back to England to study comparative literature at [[Essex University]] with a grant from the Nigerian government.<ref name=scotsmaninterview/> But when funding for his scholarship fell through, Okri found himself homeless, sometimes living in parks and sometimes with friends. He describes this period as "very, very important" to his work: "I wrote and wrote in that period... If anything [the desire to write] actually intensified."<ref name=scotsmaninterview/>

Okri's success as a writer began when he published his first novel ''Flowers and Shadows'', at the age of 21.<ref name=britishcouncil/> Okri then served ''[[West Africa (magazine)|West Africa]]'' magazine as poetry editor from 1983 to 1986, and was a regular contributor to the [[BBC World Service]] between 1983 and 1985, continuing to publish throughout this period.<ref name=britishcouncil/> His reputation as an author was secured when he won the Booker Prize for Fiction for his novel ''[[The Famished Road]]'' in 1991.<ref name=britishcouncil/>

==Literary career==

Since he published his first novel, ''Flowers and Shadows'' (1980), Okri has risen to an international acclaim, and he is often described as one of [[Africa]]'s leading writers.<ref name=guardian-profile/><ref name=mo/> His best known work, ''The Famished Road'', which was awarded the 1991 [[Booker Prize]], along with ''Songs of Enchantment'' and ''Infinite Riches'' make up a trilogy that follows the life of Azaro, a spirit-child narrator, through the social and political turmoil of an African nation reminiscent of Okri's remembrance of war-torn Nigeria.<ref name=britishcouncil/>

Okri's work is particularly difficult to categorize. Although it has been widely categorized as [[Postmodern literature|post-modern]],<ref name=higher-realities>Douglas McCabe. <U+201C><U+2018>Higher Realities<U+2019>: New Age Spirituality in Ben Okri<U+2019>s ''The Famished Road''.<U+201D> ''Research in African Literatures'', vol. 36, no. 4 (2005), 1-21.</ref> some scholars have noted that the seeming realism with which he depicts the spirit-world challenges this categorization. If Okri does attribute reality to a spiritual world, it is claimed, then his "allegiances are not postmodern [because] he still believes that there is something ahistorical or transcendental conferring legitimacy on some, and not other, truth-claims."<ref name=higher-realities/> Alternative characterizations of Okri's work suggest an allegiance to [[Yoruba people|Yoruba folklore]],<ref>Ato Quayson, ''Transformations in Nigerian Writing'' (Oxford: James Currey, 1997).</ref> [[New Age|New Ageism]],<ref name=higher-realities/><ref name=spiritual-realism>[[Anthony Appiah|Anthony K. Appiah]], <U+201C>Spiritual Realism.<U+201D> Review of ''The Famished Road'', by Ben Okri. ''The Nation'', 3<U+2013>10 August 1992, 146-148.</ref> spiritual realism,<ref name=spiritual-realism/> [[magic realism|magical realism]],<ref name=dreams-of-freedom/> visionary materialism,<ref name=dreams-of-freedom/> and [[existentialism]].<ref>Ben Obumselu, <U+201C>Ben Okri<U+2019>s ''The Famished Road'': A Re-Evaluation.<U+201D> ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde'', vol. 48, no. 1 (2011), 26-38.</ref>

Against these analyses, Okri has always rejected the categorization of his work as magical realism, claiming that this categorization is the result of laziness on the part of critics and likening this categorization to the observation that "a horse ... has four legs and a tale. That doesn<U+2019>t describe it."<ref name=mo/> He has instead described his fiction as obeying a kind of "dream logic,"<ref name=sethi/> and stated that his fiction is often preoccupied with the "philosophical conundrum ... what is reality?"<ref name=scotsmaninterview/> insisting that:

:"I grew up in a tradition where there are simply more dimensions to reality: legends and myths and ancestors and spirits and death ... Which brings the question: what is reality? Everyone's reality is different. For different perceptions of reality we need a different language. We like to think that the world is rational and precise and exactly how we see it, but something erupts in our reality which makes us sense that there's more to the fabric of life. I'm fascinated by the mysterious element that runs through our lives. Everyone is looking out of the world through their emotion and history. Nobody has an absolute reality."<ref name=sethi/>

Okri's short fiction has been described as more realistic and less fantastic than his novels, but these stories also depict Africans in communion with spirits,<ref name=britishcouncil/> while his poetry and nonfiction have a more overt political tone, focusing on the potential of Africa and the world to overcome the problems of modernity.<ref name=britishcouncil/><ref>Ben Okri, <U+201C>[http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2011/a-time-for-new-dreams A Time for New Dreams]<U+201D> an interview with Claire Armitstead, ''RSA''. London, 4 April 2011.</ref>

Okri was made an honorary Vice-President of the English Centre for the [[International PEN]] and a member of the board of the [[Royal National Theatre]].<ref name=britishcouncil/> On 26 April 2012 Okri was appointed the new vice-president of the [[Caine Prize for African Writing]], having been on the advisory committee and associated with the prize since it was established 13 years previously.<ref>[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/okri-made-caine-prize-vice-president.html Katie Allen, "Okri made Caine Prize vice-president", '';The Bookseller'', 26 April 2012.]</ref>

==Influences==

Okri has described his work as influenced as much by the philosophical texts in his father's book shelves as it was by literature,<ref name=scotsmaninterview><U+201C>[http://nigeria.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=408&x=1 Interview: Ben Okri - Booker prize-winning novelist and poet],<U+201D> ''Scotsman.com'', March 5, 2010.</ref> and Okri cites the influence of both [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]] on his ''A Time for New Dreams''.<ref><U+201C>[http://www.granta.com/New-Writing/Interview-Ben-Okri Interview: Ben Okri],<U+201D> Saskia Vogel, ''Granta Magazine'', 7 April 2011.</ref> His literary influences include ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'',<ref name=sethi/> and Coleridge's "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]."<ref name=scotsmaninterview /> Okri's 1999 epic poem, ''Mental Fight'', is also named for a quote from the poet [[William Blake]]'s "[[And did those feet in ancient time|And did those feet ...]],"<ref>Ben Okri, ''Mental Fight: An Anti-Spell for the 21st Century'' (London: Phoenix House, 1999), 1.</ref> and critics have noted the close relationship between Blake and Okri's poetry.<ref name=dreams-of-freedom>Matthew J. A. Green, <U+201C>Dreams of Freedom: Magical Realism and Visionary Materialism in Okri and Blake,<U+201D> ''Romanticism'', vol. 15, no. 1 (2009), 18-32.</ref>

Okri was also influenced by the oral tradition of his people, and particularly his mother's storytelling: "If my mother wanted to make a point, she wouldn't correct me, she'd tell me a story."<ref name=sethi/> His first-hand experiences of civil war in Nigeria are said to have inspired many of his works.<ref name=sethi />
