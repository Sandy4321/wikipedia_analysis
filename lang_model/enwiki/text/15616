In the [[United Kingdom]], the roll-out of '''digital radio''' is proceeding since test transmissions were started by the [[BBC]] in 1990. The UK currently has the world's biggest [[digital radio]] network, with 103 transmitters, with two national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] [[DAB ensemble|ensembles]] and forty eight local and regional DAB ensembles broadcasting over 250 commercial and 34 BBC [[radio station]]s across the UK. In the [[Capital|capital city]] of [[London]] there are already more than 51 different digital stations available. In addition to DAB, radio stations are also broadcast on [[digital television]] platforms, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] on [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]] [[frequency|frequencies]] as well as [[internet radio]] in the UK. Digital radio ensemble operators and stations need a broadcasting licence by the UK's media regulator [[Ofcom]] to broadcast.

Digital Radio in the United Kingdom is being sold by radio stations and the industry to consumers as having more choice of radio stations, ease of use, resistance to [[interference]] and the price of radios being reduced to allow mass mainstream uptake of digital radio through various platforms.<ref name="RadioAndTelly">{{cite web|url=http://www.radioandtelly.co.uk/dab.html|title=A look at DAB|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=Radio and Telly}}</ref> There has been concerns from individual users and the industry over the sound quality of radio stations broadcast digitally<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/freq_find/DAB_sound.html|title=Does DAB give better sound quality?|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=Frequency Finder UK}}</ref> as well as coverage of DAB digital radio in the UK.<ref name="RadioAndTelly" />

19.5% of the UK population own a digital radio and 58% of people have access to digital radio either through a [[Receiver (radio)|radio set]], [[television]] or [[Internet radio|online]].<ref name="percentage">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/radio/a46373/digital-radio-owners-up-43-percent.html|title=Digital radio owners up 43%|accessdate=2007-05-12|date=2007-05-10|last=Oatts|first=Joanne|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref> The industry trade body, the Digital Radio Development Bureau, expects the number of people owning one digital radio to rise to 28.7% and the digital radio industry is expected to be valued at <U+00A3>500 million by 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3723138.stm|title=Digital radio sales 13m 'by 2008'|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2004-10-07|publisher=BBC Radio}}</ref>

=== Growth and benefits of DAB in the UK ===
[[Image:UK digital radio listening.png|right|thumb|350px|Listeners of digital television and Internet radio and owners of DAB radio share]]
In the United Kingdom, the uptake of DAB has increased since the launch of the BBC national DAB ensemble in 1995. Lower prices, new radio stations and marketing have increased the uptake of DAB radio in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1641|title=DAB radio sales pass 3m landmark|accessdate=2007-06-10|date=2006-05-03|publisher=Lovelace Consulting|work=Digital TV Group}}</ref> Digital radios were first sold as car radios in 1997, priced around <U+00A3>800, with hi-fi tuners costing up to <U+00A3>2000 being released two years later.<ref name="BBCDCMS" /> In 2001, Digital One invested in Frontier Silicon to produce a new processing chip which would allow cheaper portable radios to be produced. [[Roberts]], [[Goodmans]] and in 2002, [[Pure Digital]]'s award winning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pure.com/Releases/Release.asp?ID=277|title=PURE EVOKE SERIES AWARDED GET CONNECTED <U+201C>PRODUCT OF THE YEAR<U+201D>|accessdate=2007-06-10|date=2007-02-13|publisher=Pure Digital}}</ref> Evoke series of radios broke the <U+00A3>100 price barrier, and DAB take up has increased since.<ref name="BBCDCMS" /> As the result of the increase of uptake of DAB, electrical retailer [[Dixons (UK)|Dixons]] announced in 2006 that it would discontinue selling analogue radios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/technology/s/220/220898_dixons_turn_off_analogue_radio_supply.html|title=Dixons turn off analogue radio supply|accessdate=2007-06-10|date=2006-08-16|publisher=Manchester Evening News}}</ref>

The BBC and other DAB broadcasters have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting a number of features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefits of DAB is that due to the use of multiplexing technology and [[encoding]] technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside existing their analogue radio stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio/listen/which.shtml|title=How to listen to digital radio|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emapdigitalradio.com/edr/index.shtml|title=Emap Digital Radio|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=EMAP}}</ref> Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that is more noticeable through analogue radio.<ref name="Benefits">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio/about/benefits.shtml|title=What is DAB digital radio?|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=BBC}}</ref> DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, telling listeners information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.<ref name="Benefits" />

DAB has also been marketed with having two major advantages over analogue radio broadcasting in that using [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] [[Audio compression (data)|lossy audio compression]] technology, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as [[multiplexing]] technology allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpapers.com/whitepapers/paper_loader.cfm?pid=420|title=THE USE OF MORE EFFICIENT AUDIO COMPRESSION TO PROVIDE LOW BIT-RATE SPECIALIST SERVICES OVER DAB|accessdate=2007-06-12|author=I.P. Duncumb, A.L. Bridgen and J. L. Alty|publisher=Loughborough University}}</ref>

National, local and regional DAB ensembles use the same frequency for the area they cover. Using a [[single-frequency network]], an ensemble broadcasting a number of stations can cover the same area as a number of FM frequencies which would be required to cover the same area for one station. The BBC carried out tests in London of a single-frequency network with success prior to launching its national DAB ensemble. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_261-maddocks.pdf|title=Field trials with a high power VHF single frequency network for DAB|accessdate=2007-06-12|year=2004|publisher=European Broadcasting Union}}</ref>

=== Criticisms of DAB in the UK ===

UK broadcasters have used lower [[bit rate]]s to vastly increase the choice & variety of radio stations available to the public from each multiplex, leading to some criticism of reduced audio fidelity. 98% of stereo stations on DAB in the UK use a bit rate level of 128 kbps<ref>http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/dab/worldwide_dab.htm</ref> with the [[MP2]] audio codec. Some music stations (for example, [[theJazz]]) are transmitting in mono.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/articles/Mono-is-the-new-stereo-on-national-DAB.php|title=	
Mono is the new stereo on national DAB|date=2006-12-15|accessdate=2007-05-21|publisher=Digitalradiotech}}</ref> However, a recent OFCOM survey demonstrated that 94% of DAB Digital Radio listeners were satisfied with the quality of audio they were receiving.<ref>http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/summary/|title=OFCOM - The Future Of Radio - DAB Sound Quality</ref>
At the Westminster Media Forum in June 2007, [[National Grid Wireless]]' general manager for broadcasting, Tony Moretta, dismissed concerns about DAB audio quality. He stated that "DAB is perfectly good enough".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/radio/story/0,,2096010,00.html|title=DAB too pricey to go nationwide, warns BBC exec|accessdate=2007-06-06|date=2007-06-05|last=Plunkett|first=John|publisher=Media Guardian}}</ref> Indeed, [[bit rate]]s used by the radio stations on other platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite is higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/dab/digital_radio_bit_rates.htm|title=	
Digital Radio Platform Bit Rates|accessdate=2007-05-21|publisher=Digitalradiotech}}</ref> For example, all of the [[BBC]] stations use higher bit rates on the [[digital TV]] platforms than on DAB apart from the [[BBC World Service]] on [[Freeview]].

In addition, [[Ofcom]] has said that even after extra [[spectrum]] has been allocated to DAB, it estimates that around 90 local radio stations will either be unable to transmit on DAB because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. However, Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded ([[Digital Radio Mondiale]]) (DRM) as being an option for the local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/radio_reviewp2/p2.pdf|title=

Roll-out of DAB has also not reached some areas of the UK yet. In June 2007, the BBC controller for multimedia and interactive, Mark Friend, warned that some areas of the UK may never get DAB services due to the expense of building new transmitters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/radio/a59556/dab-too-expensive-for-national-rollout.html|title= DAB 'too expensive' for national rollout|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=2007-06-05|last=Oatts|first=Joanne|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref>

=== DAB frequency plan ===

DAB radio stations in the United Kingdom are broadcast on a number of frequency blocks on [[VHF]] [[Band III]]. The original plan devised in [[Wiesbaden]] for the framework of DAB in Europe was to allocate frequency blocks 11B to 12D for UK DAB broadcasting. However, as part of its Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for DAB and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10A to 10D and 11A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/radio_reviewp2/appendix_d.pdf|title=Radio <U+2013> Preparing for the Future - Appendix D: Options for DAB replanning <U+2013> A report to the DRDB - Analogue Radio Switchover Group|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Ofcom, Arqiva|page=9-10format=pdf}}</ref>

Under a Maastricht plan in 2002, the UK also has [[L band]] allocations for local terrestrial DAB,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wohnort.org/DAB/uklband.html|title=L-band Allocations|accessdate=2007-04-21|Publisher=DAB Ensembles Worldwide}}</ref> though there are no plans to broadcast any digital radio stations on L band, as Ofcom are currently proposing to auction the capacity in L band in the Autumn of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radiocomms/spectrumawards/awardspending/award_1452/260307/design.pdf|title=Award of available spectrum1452 <U+2013>1492 MHz: Auction design|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2007-03-26|last=Louth|first=Graham|publisher=Ofcom}}</ref>

==== BBC National DAB ====
{{main|BBC DAB National}}
The BBC's national DAB ensemble broadcasts on frequency block 12B (225.648 [[Hertz|MHz]]) across the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-now.co.uk/national.htm|title=National radio stations in the United Kingdom|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=radio-now.co.uk}}</ref> with coverage currently at 85%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/freq_find/DAB_reception.html|title=Does DAB give better reception?|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=Frequency Finder UK and Ireland}}</ref> The multiplex is owned and operated by the BBC and is transmitted from a number of transmitter sites across the country. The BBC's national multiplex only carries BBC national [[radio station]]s. [[BBC Local Radio|Local BBC radio]] stations are carried on the relevant local DAB ensemble where commercial DAB licences are operating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/reception/transmitters/radio/digital_local_radio.shtml|title=BBC local radio on DAB - transmitter information|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

==== Commercial DAB multiplexes ====

There are a number of commercial DAB multiplexes operators in the UK who run 48 local and regional DAB multiplexes across the United Kingdom. operators include the national operator, [[Digital One]], regional operator MXR and local multiplexes operators including NOW Digital, [[EMAP]], [[UTV]] and Switch Digital.

== DAB+ ==

[[Digital Audio Broadcasting#DAB+|DAB+]], a new digital radio standard using the [[HE-AAC]] encoding standard and announced by the WorldDAB organisation in 2006, is being considered for digital radio broadcasting in the UK. HE-AAC encoding is more efficient than the MPEG-2 Layer II encoding standard currently used for DAB in the UK. DAB+ will either allow stations to broadcast at higher sound quality than currently possible with DAB, or allow more stations at the same quality currently broadcast on an ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/dab/dab_vs_dab+.htm|title=DAB vs DAB+ technology|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=Digital Radio Tech}}</ref>

The Digital Radio Development Bureau released a [[News release|press statement]] in January that it is likely that the UK will add the DAB+ standard between 2010 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/documents/DRDB_UK_DAB+_policy.pdf|title=Optional high efficiency audio codec in the UK|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Digital Radio Development Bureau|work=Digital Radio Tech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/articles/UK-DAB-industry-admits-DAB+-will-be-used-in-the-UK.php|title=

== Digital television ==
[[Image:EmleyMoorMastSpring2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Transmitters including [[Emley Moor transmitting station|Emley Moor]] (pictured) broadcast digital radio via DAB and digital terrestrial television]]
In the United Kingdom, 41% of digital radio users listen to digital radio through a television platform.<ref name="percentage" />

=== Digital terrestrial ===
{{seealso|Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom}}
Digital radio on the digital terrestrial platform started on October 30, 2002<ref>Although not strictly classed as a digital radio service, [[BBC Parliament]] broadcast on digital terrestrial in audio only up until the launch of Freeview on October 30, 2002</ref> with the launch of the BBC's digital only radio services, [[BBC 1Xtra]], [[BBC Five Live Sports Extra]], [[BBC 6 Music]], [[BBC 7]] and the [[BBC Asian Network]] as well as existing stations [[BBC Radio Five Live]] and the [[BBC World Service]]. All the stations broadcast on the BBC's [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] B.

On the same day, [[EMAP]] launched three radio stations, [[Smash Hits]], [[Kerrang!]] and [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss]]. Two other [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial radio]] stations also launched, [[oneword]] and [[102.2 Jazz FM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/10_october/03/freeview_launchdate.shtml|title=Freeview to launch on 30 October|accessdate=2007-04-15|date=2002-10-03|publisher=BBC Press Office}}</ref>

The BBC later launched [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4 FM]] on multiplex A on [[February 14, 2003]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a10361/freeview-launch-for-radio-1-4.html|title= Freeview launch for Radio 1 - 4|accessdate=2007-04-15|date=2003-02-12|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref>

Currently, the digital terrestrial platform has twenty seven radio stations broadcasting from broadcasters including the BBC, EMAP, [[GMG Radio]] and [[Virgin Radio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freeview.co.uk/channels/radio|title=Freeview - Radio|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=DTV Services Limited}}</ref>

=== Digital satellite ===

Radio stations broadcasting via [[Satellite]] to the United Kingdom usually use the [[SES Astra]] 2 series of satellites at 28.2<U+00B0>E or the [[Eutelsat]] [[Eurobird 1]] satellite at 28.5<U+00B0>E. Radio stations broadcast [[free-to-air]] via the [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky Digital]], [[Freesat from Sky]], the planned [[Freesat]] platforms and any [[DVB-S]] compliant [[set-top box]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/satellite/freesatepg/|title=Sky Digital - Freesat: Channel Lineup|accessdate=2007-04-16|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref>

=== Second national ensemble ===

Ofcom announced in 2005 that they would be advertising for the second national digital ensemble. As a result, [[GCap Media|GCap]] threatened to take Ofcom to court after being told by the Radio Authority that there would not be another national ensemble. The court action was dropped after Ofcom assured GCap that none of the stations on the second ensemble would compete with existing stations on the Digital One ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/articles/GCap-bottle-out-of-taking-Ofcom-to-court.php|title=
