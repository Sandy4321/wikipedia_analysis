The [[PlayStation Portable]] can connect with the PlayStation 3 in many ways, including in-game connectivity. For example, ''Formula One: Championship Edition'', a racing game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/705/705926p1.html |title=E3 2006: Formula One 06 Resurfaces |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=2006-05-08 |publisher=IGN PlayStation 3 }}</ref> In addition, it is possible to download PlayStation 1 games to the PlayStation 3 from the PlayStation Store.  These games were not originally playable on the PS3. They could only be sent to a PSP, and played using the PSP's PlayStation Emulator. Sony added support for playing downloaded PlayStation titles on PS3 on April 18, 2007, with the update to firmware revision 1.70.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/downloadable-ps1-games-hit-the-psp-provided-you-have-a-ps3-220164.php |title=Downloadable PS1 Games Hit The PSP (Provided You Have a PS3) |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Deleon |first=Nicholas |date=2006-12-07 |publisher=Gizmodo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154561 |title=Phil Harrison Talks Downloadable PS1 Games on PS3 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |last=Kennedy |first=Sam |date=2006-10-20 |publisher=1up.com }}</ref>

Sony has also demonstrated the PSP playing back video content, including [[1080p]] content from the PlayStation 3 [[hard disk]] across an [[Mobile ad-hoc network|ad-hoc]] wireless network. This feature is referred to as [[Remote Play]] located under the browser icon on both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable. Remote play has since expanded to allow remote access to the PS3 via PSP from any wireless access point in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/740/740689p1.html |title=PSP and PS3 Play Together |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Nix |first=Marc |date=[[2006-10-20]] |publisher=IGN PSP }}</ref>
