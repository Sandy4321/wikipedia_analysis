'''Heinrich Theodor B<U+00F6>ll''' ({{IPA-de|b<U+0153>l|lang}}; 21 December 1917 <U+2013> 16 July 1985) was one of Germany's foremost post-[[World War II]] writers. B<U+00F6>ll was awarded the [[Georg B<U+00FC>chner Prize]] in 1967 and the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1972.{{Sfn|Conard|1992|p=xviii}}

== Biography ==

B<U+00F6>ll was born in [[Cologne]], Germany, to a [[Catholic]], pacifist family that later opposed the rise of [[Nazism]]. He refused to join the [[Hitler Youth]] during the 1930s.<ref name="KATERKater2006">{{cite book|author1=Michael H. KATER|author2=Michael H Kater|title=Hitler Youth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IlIOP1O7H4wC&pg=PA24|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=30 April 2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01991-1|pages=24<U+2013>}}</ref> He was apprenticed to a bookseller before studying German at the [[University of Cologne]]. In 1942 he married [[Annemarie Cech]] with whom he was ultimately to have three sons; she later acted as his collaborator on a number of different translations of English and American literature into German that he produced over the years. Conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht]], he served in France, [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and was wounded four times (as well as contracting [[typhoid]] fever) before being captured by Americans in April 1945 and sent to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]].{{Sfn|Conard|1992|pp=xvi<U+2013>xvii}}. 

After the war he returned to Cologne and began working in his family's cabinet shop and, for one year, worked in a municipal statistical bureau, an experience which he did not enjoy and which he left in order to take the risk of becoming a writer instead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Harry|title=Deutsche Erz<U+00E4>hlungen|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520050541|page=423|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a_ll4XkchPMC&pg=PA421&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+biography&hl=en&sa=X&ei=j83LU7y4K6OM7Qbnp4DoCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20biography&f=false|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>

B<U+00F6>ll became a full-time writer at the age of 30. His [[first novel]], ''Der Zug war p<U+00FC>nktlich'' (''[[The Train Was on Time]]''), was published in 1949. He was invited to the 1949 meeting of the [[Group 47]] circle of German authors and his work was deemed to be the best presented during the year 1951.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magill (ed)|first1=Frank N.|title=The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 7|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136593349|page=349|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nq1GU6I5umQC&pg=PA349&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+%22biography&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rT2wU-yDIceSONDEgMgL&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20%22biography&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> 

Many other novels, short stories, [[radio play]]s and [[essay]] collections followed, and in 1972 he received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. He was the first German-born author to receive this award since [[Nelly Sachs]] in 1966.

B<U+00F6>ll was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers and the oldest human rights organisation, between 1972-1973.

==Works==

His work has been translated into more than 30 languages, and he remains one of Germany's most widely read authors. His best-known works are ''[[Billiards at Half-past Nine]],'' ''[[And Never Said a Word]],''  ''[[The Bread of Those Early Years (novel)|The Bread of Those Early Years]],'' ''[[The Clown (novel)|The Clown]],'' ''[[Group Portrait with Lady (novel)|Group Portrait with Lady]],'' ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum]]'', and ''[[The Safety Net]].''

He wrote a number of different works with different themes and content but there are certain recurring patterns: a large proportion of his oeuvre are intimate and personalised works constructed against the wider background of war, terrorism, political conflict and profound economic and social transition. In a number of his books there are protagonists who are stubborn and eccentric individualists opposed to the mechanisms of the state or of public institutions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Draugsvold (ed)|first1=Ottar G.|title=Nobel Writers on Writing|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786406291|page=121|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dTObt85SNvkC&pg=PA121&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+life&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MFSwU8HzFoOEOLm7gWg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20life&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref>

== Media scandals ==
The 1963 publication of ''[[The Clown (novel)|The Clown]]'' was met with polemics in the press for its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church and the CDU party.<ref name="Magill2013p350">Frank N. Magill (2013) The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 7, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Nq1GU6I5umQC&pg=PA350 p.350]</ref> B<U+00F6>ll was devoted to Catholicism but also deeply critical of aspects of it (particularly in its most conservative incarnations). In particular, he was unable to forget the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] of July 1933 between the Vatican and the Nazis, signed by the future [[Pope Pius XII]], which helped confer international legitimacy on the regime at an early stage in its development.<ref>{{cite book|title=Und Sagte Kein Einziges Wort|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134986823|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z8XSJpyo2nkC&pg=PT12&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+1970s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iUywU--aCMbYPfT4gZAL&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%201970s&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> 

B<U+00F6>ll's liberal views on religion and social issues inspired the wrath of conservatives in Germany.<ref name="Magill2013p350"/><ref name="Finlay1996p8">Frank Finlay (1996) ''On the Rationality of Poetry: Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll's Aesthetic Thinking'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=nzsnzwmIFGoC&pg=PA8 p.8]</ref> His 1972 article ''[[Soviel Liebe auf einmal]]'' (''So much love at once'') which accused the tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' of falsified journalism, was in turn retitled, at the time of publishing and against B<U+00F6>ll's wishes, by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', and the imposed title was used as a pretext to accuse B<U+00F6>ll of sympathy with terrorism.<ref name="WerkeV18p454">Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll: [http://books.google.com/books?id=gHUHAQAAMAAJ ''Werke ''], Volume 18: 1971-1974. K<U+00F6>ln : Kiepenheuer und Witsch, 2003, ISBN 3-462-03260-7, pp.454-ff.</ref> This particular criticism was driven in large part by his repeated insistence upon the importance of due process and the correct and fair application of the law in the case of the [[Baader-Meinhof Gang]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Bernard A.|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0815340575|page=135|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&pg=PA135&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+1970s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mdDLU9b5BY2h7Aax_YGQBQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%201970s&f=false|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>

The conservative press even attacked B<U+00F6>ll's 1972 Nobel prize award, arguing that it was awarded only to "liberals and left-wing radicals."<ref name="Magill2013p350"/>

==Influences==

B<U+00F6>ll was deeply rooted in his hometown of Cologne, with its strong [[Roman Catholic]]ism and its rather rough and drastic sense of humour. In the immediate post-war period, he was preoccupied with memories of the War and the effect it had<U+2014>materially and psychologically<U+2014>on the lives of ordinary people. He made them the heroes in his writing.

He was deeply affected by the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s' takeover of Cologne, as they essentially exiled him in his own town. Additionally, the destruction of Cologne as a result of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Allied bombing during World War II]] scarred him for life; he described the aftermath of the bombing in ''The Silent Angel''. Architecturally, the newly-rebuilt Cologne, prosperous once more, left him indifferent. (B<U+00F6>ll seemed to be a pupil of [[William Morris]] <U+2013> he let it be known that he would have preferred [[Cologne Cathedral]] to have been left unfinished, with the 14th-century wooden crane at the top, as it had stood in 1848). Throughout his life, he remained in close contact with the citizens of Cologne, rich and poor. When he was in hospital, the nurses often complained about the "low-life" people who came to see their friend Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Heinrich_B%C3%B6ll.html|website=Princeton|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>

His villains are the figures of authority in government, business, and in the Church, whom he castigates, sometimes humorously, sometimes acidly, for what he perceived as their conformism, lack of courage, self-satisfied attitude and abuse of power. His simple style made him a favourite for German-language textbooks in Germany and abroad.

==Analysis==

His works have been dubbed ''[[Tr<U+00FC>mmerliteratur]]'' (the literature of the rubble). He was a leader of the German writers who tried to come to grips with the memory of [[World War II]], the [[Third Reich|Nazis]], and the [[Holocaust]] and the guilt that came with them. Because of his refusal to avoid writing about the complexities and problems of the past he was labelled by some with the role of 'Gewissen der Nation', in other words a catalyst and conduit for memorialisation and discussion in opposition to the tendency towards silence and taboo. This was a label that he himself was keen to jettison because he felt that it occluded a fair audit of those institutions which were truly responsible for what had happened.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sargeant|first1=Maggie|title=Kitsch & Kunst: Presentations of a Lost War|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3039105124|pages=171-2|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LUM0XLuvDlQC&pg=PA171&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+%22biography&hl=en&sa=X&ei=70WwU7uoBszUPNuRgPAC&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20%22biography&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> 

He lived with his wife in Cologne and in the [[Eifel|Eifel region]]. However, he also spent time on [[Achill Island]] off the west coast of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. His cottage there is now used as a guesthouse for international and Irish artists. He recorded some of his experiences in Ireland in his book ''Irisches Tagebuch''  (''Irish Journal'').

He was the president of the then West German [[P.E.N.]] and subsequently of the [[International P.E.N.]] organizations. He travelled frequently as a representative of the new, democratic Germany. His appearance and attitude were in complete contrast to the boastful, aggressive type of German which had become infamous all over the world during [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] rule. B<U+00F6>ll was particularly successful in [[Eastern Europe]], as he seemed to portray the dark side of [[capitalism]] in his books; his books were sold by the millions in the [[Soviet Union]] alone.<ref>Peter Bruhn and Henry Glade:[http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/projboll.htm ''Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll in der Sowjetunion, 1952<U+2013>1979] Einf<U+00FC>hrung in die sowjetische B<U+00F6>ll-Rezeption und Bibliographie der in der UdSSR in russischer Sprache erschienenen Schriften von und <U+00FC>ber Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll'', Berlin 1980, ISBN 3-503-01617-1</ref>

When [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] was expelled from the Soviet Union, he first took refuge in Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll's Eifel cottage. This was in part the result of B<U+00F6>ll's visitation to the Soviet Union in 1962 with a cultural delegation, which was the first of several trips he made to the country, during which he made friendships with several writers and connections with many producers of dissident literature. B<U+00F6>ll had also previously recommended Solzhenitsyn for the Nobel Prize for Literature, under the auspices of his position in the West German P.E.N. When Solzhenitsyn was awarded the prize in 1976, he quoted from B<U+00F6>ll's writing to the reception committee.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Frank|title=On the Rationality of Poetry: Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll's Aesthetic Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9051839898|pages=179-184|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nzsnzwmIFGoC&pg=PA180&dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+Solzhenitsyn&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gpDBU6HgEfOw7Ab23oHgBg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20Solzhenitsyn&f=false|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>

In 1976, B<U+00F6>ll demonstratively left the [[Catholic church]], "without falling away from the faith".<ref><U+201E>vom Glauben abgefallen<U+201C></ref>

Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll died in 1985 at the age of 67. His memory lives on, among other places, at the [[Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll Foundation]]. A special Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll Archive was set up in the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|Cologne Library]] to house his personal papers, bought from his family, but much of the material was damaged, possibly irreparably, when the building collapsed in March 2009.
