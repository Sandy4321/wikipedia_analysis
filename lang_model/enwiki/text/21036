'''Jerry Espenson''' is a fictional character in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[Boston Legal]],'' played by [[Christian Clemenson]]. He first appeared in the 2005 episode "Legal Deficits", in which he was nicknamed "Hands" because of his awkward habit of keeping his hands stiffly attached to his thighs in front of him. Other bizarre characteristics include purring under his breath when he feels slighted and bouncing straight up when surprised. When he makes an incalculable or grievous error, he begins to "whoop" uncontrollably, almost to the point of hyperventilating. Originally a recurring character, he became a regular cast member as of the beginning of the fourth season (2007<U+2013>08).

Jerry is a brilliant [[lawyer]] who has [[Asperger syndrome]], and possibly also [[Tourette syndrome]], which interferes with his ability to interact socially with other people, but also makes him a masterful interpreter of the law and its language. His expertise is in financial law. Jerry has both a [[Juris Doctor]] and an [[MBA]] from [[Harvard Law School]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He is a walking [[lie-detector]], and a talented painter.

==Early life==

Little is known about Jerry's life prior to the series, but he reveals that he was distant from both of his parents, who never hugged him as a child.  His father was a "man of firm handshakes" while he had a somewhat tense relationship with his mother. He implies that his father had Asperger syndrome, since he was a brilliant Cornell math professor who constantly asked people if they had toast. His older sister Joy used to throw rocks at Jerry to try to get him to lift his hands off his thighs to defend himself.  Before working at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, Espenson worked in an undisclosed profession where he had so little contact with other people that he dialed an information number just to hear a person's voice.  He revealed that at one point during this period of isolation, he considered suicide.

==Crane, Poole, and Schmidt==

Prior to his first appearance, Jerry's Asperger syndrome had gone undiagnosed. He makes his first appearance in the second season, when he is called in to help [[Alan Shore]] on a case. Jerry is introduced by [[Denny Crane]] as "Hands" due to Jerry's hands never leaving his thighs. Shortly afterward, he is passed up for partnership for the third and final time by [[Shirley Schmidt]] despite fifteen years of loyal and exemplary service, due to "awkward social behavior". He subsequently loses control at an office party and holds a knife to Shirley's throat. Alan persuades Jerry to let Schmidt go on the condition that he represent him after he is charged. It is only after Jerry is on trial for the incident that his condition is diagnosed; Alan convinces Schmidt to drop the charges if Espenson agrees to receive treatment, which he does. Fired from [[Crane, Poole & Schmidt]], Jerry opens his own law firm.  Eventually, he is rehired by Schmidt.

In the third season, Jerry acquires through therapy a wooden stick shaped like a cigarette (though he does not smoke) that he describes as "a [[proprioception|proprioceptive tool]]". Previously his awkward personality led to difficulties in negotiating in a courtroom, and even merely talking to others, but when the stick is in his mouth, he becomes a completely different person: He uses it as a tool to mask his social deficiencies with an uncharacteristic decorum of rude, abrasive, yet glib arrogance. Many attempts to rid him of this brilliant but annoying psychological crutch are usually met with intelligent and summary refusals.  Katie Lloyd has often deftly removed the cigarette from Jerry's mouth when he uses it during inappropriate times.  In the fifth season, Jerry gives a patriotic, pro-gun closing argument during Denny's trial for carrying a concealed firearm at Denny's request.  Denny rewards Jerry by presenting him with a wooden cigar. Incidentally Jerry's cigarette persona will arise whenever he puts a cigar, cigarette or pipe in his mouth, as evidenced by later episodes in the third season. 

Jerry becomes close personal friends with Alan, who is the first colleague to see beyond his eccentricities and who on several occasions helps him out of difficult situations, such as defending him against a charge of attempted murder, introducing him to a [[sexual surrogate]],<ref name="Can't We All Get a Lung?">{{cite episode

However, in the episode "The Good Lawyer", Alan and Jerry's friendship is damaged when Alan finds Jerry's newfound confidence stressful. Alan comes to a breaking point, and harshly berates Jerry.  The stress Jerry experiences from this event is compounded by his Asperger syndrome, and Jerry loses his ability to cope. 

During "Guise 'n Dolls", Jerry continues to use his arrogant, offensive persona against lawyers "like [Alan Shore]": The two compete in the courtroom when Alan pursues a case against a toy manufacturer that Jerry represents. After repeated pleas from Alan to drop the persona, Jerry does so when delivering his closing statement; ultimately, Jerry wins. While Alan acknowledges that Jerry's [[alter ego]] was "brilliant", he reveals Jerry's real self is "one of the best lawyers" he's ever seen; Jerry then happily forgives Alan for berating him earlier.

In "Guantanamo By The Bay", Jerry broke the "[[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|fourth wall]]" on ''Boston Legal'': When Shirley admits him back into the Crane, Poole & Schmidt firm, he mentions that there is a "happy song" he cannot get out of his head. Shirley asks him to hum a few bars in the song, and he sings the ''Boston Legal'' theme song as the opening credits roll. Further breach of the "[[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|fourth wall]]" by Jerry is when he alludes to the [[Effect of the 2007<U+2013>08 Writers Guild of America strike on television|Writers Strike]] to explain the sudden occurrence getting into a serious relationship.  Jerry becomes a regular character in season four, sharing an office with [[Katie Lloyd]].

In "The Bad Seed" Jerry is reunited with Joy, and they are still shown to have an awkward relationship.  She is controlling, brash, and rude, and Jerry still tries hard to impress her.  At her request, he sues the fertility clinic where she had her son - and by extension Jerry's nephew - Henry Espenson, to see if Henry and his girlfriend Fiona have the same sperm donor.  They turn out to have the same anonymous donor father, making Henry and Fiona half siblings, to their dismay.

Throughout the fifth season Jerry has become more confident, and twirls the wooden cigarette in his hand instead of sucking on it.  He also makes fewer popping and purring noises.  Katie has said she is glad to see Jerry coming out of his shell, but hopes he doesn't altogether abandon the old Jerry.  When Jerry comes up for partner, Katie takes offense at Paul Lewiston's probing questions and accuses the entire board of being unreasonable.  Jerry then gives a passionate speech and ultimately makes partner, making Jerry happy enough to cry.

Jerry's newfound confidence gets him into trouble again when he and Katie are in a coffee shop.  Jerry accidentally bumps into an obnoxious, bullying businessman, who insults Jerry and Katie.  An angered Jerry hurls his muffin at the man's face, and when the man tries to attack Jerry, Jerry breaks the man's nose and knocks him unconscious with a single punch before dancing victoriously around the cafe.  During his subsequent trial for aggravated assault, he tries to represent himself but winds up damaging his own case.  After a candid talk with Katie he gives a passionate closing about standing up to a bully for the first time in his life, and is acquitted.  This trial suggests that Jerry is beginning to display some of Alan's characteristics, as Alan acted in a similar fashion after paying bar patrons to beat up a man who punched him.  Alan and Jerry both tried to smugly represent themselves and required a candid talk with Tara Wilson and Katie respectively to see their errors.

==Romantic interests==

At one point, Jerry had an on and off relationship with a client named Leigh Swift, who also has Asperger syndrome.  Leigh has "[[Object sexuality|objectophilia]]", a sexual attraction to objects.  Jerry briefly dates Leigh before she leaves him for a smart phone. Leigh later returns when she is fired from her teaching job for hugging a student in distress and asks Jerry to represent her when she sues the school to get her job back. They lose but end up hugging at the end. Jerry and Leigh begin dating again, but Leigh becomes increasingly paranoid of Katie, whom she wrongfully believes is trying to steal Jerry. Katie exposes that Leigh has been threatening her and they again break up, leaving Jerry heartbroken.

Jerry soon begins a new relationship with an attractive, younger girl named Dana Strickland but she sues him for sexual assault after she discovers Jerry is using a hormone inducing chemical drug which causes couples to become more trustworthy with each other and to bond easier. Under advice from Katie, Jerry apologises for using the drug and persuades Dana to drop the case and the two restart their relationship,<ref name="The Mighty Rogues">{{cite episode

In "The Court Supreme", it is revealed that Dana is in fact a high priced [[call-girl]] in the employment of [[Lorraine Weller]].  An upset Jerry ends their relationship and refuses to speak to her, refusing to date an escort. In "The Gods Must Be Crazy" Dana returns and seeks Jerry's help after she is arrested for prostitution.  Dana asks Jerry if there was any chance of getting back together, to which he answered no.  A heartbroken Dana then bid him goodbye, and towards the end of the episode it is revealed she has disappeared; her current whereabouts are unknown.

Jerry is attracted to Katie Lloyd, the associate with whom he shares an office.  She originally told him she never considered him more than a friend, but appreciated his honesty regarding his feelings toward her.  They remained close friends, and Katie often helped Jerry deal with his shyness around women.  In "Thanksgiving" Jerry admitted to Katie that he loved her, although he assured her that her friendship would be a "consolation prize".  In the two part finale Katie asks Jerry for a date, and in the final episode she and Jerry kiss, indicating that they are pursuing a romantic relationship.
