'''''Arular''''' is the debut album by British musician [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]], released in March 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]).  Originally set for a September 2004 release, the album faced months of delays due to [[sampling (music)|sample]] issues. ''Arular'' was finally released in the [[United States]] on 22 March 2005 and a month later in the UK, where it had a slightly different track listing.  The album's release was preceded in 2004 by the release of two singles and a [[mixtape]].

The album was mainly written by M.I.A. and recorded by her, using a [[Roland MC-505]] [[music sequencer|sequencer]]/[[drum machine]] given to her by long-time friend [[Justine Frischmann]].  A number of collaborators worked on the album, including [[Switch (DJ)|Switch]], [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] and [[Richard X]].  The album's title is the political code name used by her father, [[Arul Pragasam]], during the [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|Tamil independence]] movements, and themes of conflict and revolution feature heavily in the lyrics.  Musically, the album incorporates a variety of styles ranging from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electroclash]] to [[funk carioca]] and [[reggaeton]].  

''Arular'' was hailed by critics for its blending of styles and integration of political lyrics into [[Dance music|dance tunes]].  It was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2005 and included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.  Although it only reached number 98 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number 190 on the [[Billboard 200]] in the United States, it was named one of the best albums of the year by several publications at the end of 2005.  By mid-2007, the album had sold 129,000 copies in the US.  ''Arular'' spawned the singles "[[Galang]]", "[[Sunshowers]]", and "[[Bucky Done Gun]]". 

==Composition and recording==
Prior to 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the fields of film-making and visual arts.  While filming a documentary on [[Elastica]]'s 2001 tour of the United States, however, she was introduced to the [[Roland MC-505]] [[music sequencer|sequencer]]/[[drum machine]] by [[electroclash]] artist [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], whose minimalistic approach to music also served as a source of inspiration for her.  She found the concept of an artist performing without any additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and said that she felt it "[put] the emphasis on the artist.<U+201D><ref name="remixmagmia05">{{cite web | last=Moayeri|first= Lily | title= And Interview ''(sic)'' with Maya Arul a.k.a.

Ultimately she chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying "I just quietly got on with it....I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. I felt it was much better to prove that I could be an individual."<ref name="stylusmiaarularreview"> {{cite web | url= http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=2772 | title =M.I.A. &ndash; Arular &ndash; Review &ndash; Stylus Magazine | dateformat=dmy|accessdate= 23 December 2007 | work= [[Stylus magazine]]}} </ref> She borrowed studio time and completed all recording for the album at [[Miloco Studios]] in London.

==Music and lyrics==
''Arular'' takes its title from the political code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, [[Arul Pragasam]], during his involvement with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], popularly known as the Tamil Tigers, and she contends that her father's "revolutionary ideals" are its thematic base.<ref name="cbcmia05"/><ref name="miapw">{{cite article | title= What's Up With...

She cited as particular influences [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[London Posse]], whom she described as "the best of [[British hip hop]]<U+201D>.  Punk band [[The Clash]] and music from other genres such as [[Britpop]] and [[electroclash]], to which she was exposed during her time studying at [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]], also influenced her work on the album.<ref name="fusedmia05" /><ref name="timeoutmia08">{{cite web | last=Todd|first= Bella | title= MIA: Interview| url= http://www.timeout.com/london/timeout-40/features/5781/MIA-interview.html | work = [[Time Out]] | date=22 September 2008| accessdate=6 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref>  Living in West London, she met many musicians who to her defined an era of British music that was "actually credible".<ref name="MIAAntics"/> In an interview with Antics TV, she elaborated on the importance of the [[West London]] [[punk subculture|punk scene]], citing acts such as [[The Slits]], The Clash, and [[Don Letts]], and stated that in her view [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Malcolm McLaren]] had a similar cultural impact in England to that which Public Enemy would have in America.<ref name="MIAAntics">{{cite web | url = http://www.uptheantics.com/antics-tv/music_entry/mia_in_new_orleans_3_of_3/ | title = Antics TV: M.I.A. in New Orleans |publisher[[Filter (magazine)|Filter Creative Group]]|work=Antics TV| date = 2008 | accessdate=1 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

It works on a few basic human principles, in terms of what stimulation buttons to push...It had content and struggle behind it... and because I was able to adapt to it, hip-hop gave me a home, an identity.

Prior to the album's release, in a 2004 interview with the magazine ''Nirali'', M.I.A. stated that audiences found it hard to dance to [[music and politics|political songs]].  This made her keen to produce music which sounded like pop music but addressed important issues while making it "sound like nothing".<ref name="MIANirali04">{{cite web | last= Mangla|first=Ismat | title= Not-So Missing in Action | work= Nirali Magazine | url=http://niralimagazine.com/2004/10/not-so-missing-in-action/ | date= 4 October 2004 | dateformat=mdy | accessdate=24 May 2008}}</ref>  The song "[[Sunshowers]]", with its lyrical references to snipers, murder and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], was written in response to the fact that the Tamil Tigers are considered terrorists in some quarters. She elaborated that, in her view, "you can't separate the world into two parts like that, good and evil. America has successfully tied all these pockets of independence struggles, revolutions and extremists into one big notion of terrorism."<ref name="tamilnation">{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060107225155/http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_01.27.05/beat/mia.html|first=Joshua|last=Ostroff|title=Tiger, tiger, burning bright|work=[[Eye Weekly]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]| accessdate=28 January|accessyear=2009|date=27 January 2005}}</ref>  The lyrics caused controversy when [[MTV]] refused to broadcast the song's [[music video|video]] unless a disclaimer was added disavowing the reference to the PLO.<ref name="PLO">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091500697_pf.html|title=M.I.A.: No Loss for Words|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=16 September, 2005| accessdate=29 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref>  The [[BBC]] described the lyrics of the album as a whole as "always fluid and never too rhetorical<U+201D> and sounding like <U+201C>snatches of overheard conversation.<U+201D>  The songs deal with topics ranging from sex to drug dealing.<ref name="MIAbbcworldmusic">{{cite web | last=Cartwright|first=Garth|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/worldmusic/a4wm2006/a4wm_mia.shtml | title = MIA &ndash; Awards for World Music &ndash; 2006 | date = 2006 |publisher=[[BBC]]| accessdate=1 October 2008|date format=dmy}}</ref>

Musically, the album incorporates elements of baile funk, [[Grime (music)|grime]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[ragga]], and "anything as long as it has a beat".<ref name="timesmia" /><ref name="MIAbbcworldmusic" />  Some tracks drew on the [[soundtrack]]s of [[Music of Tamil Nadu|Tamil film music]] which M.I.A. grew up listening to.<ref name="remixmagmia05" />  ''[[The Times]]'' described her music as a "multi-genre pile-up" and likened it to her [[graphic art]], calling it "vivid, gaudy, [[lo-fi]] and deceptively candyfloss."<ref name="timesmia" />  In an interview with ''[[Exclaim!]]'' in 2005, when asked on the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained <U+201C>Influences are crossing over into each other<U+2019>s puddles.

==Artwork==
M.I.A. produced all the album's artwork herself, using what ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' called a "guerilla" style. The CD booklet features motifs of tanks, bombs and machine guns,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.spin.com/spin/200812/?pg=65| title=M.I.A. Pow!|first=Lorraine|last=Ali | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC| date=December 2008| page=65}}</ref> as well as depictions of tigers, which writers connected with the Tamil Tigers.<ref name="rsmia05gg" />  Leading critic [[Robert Christgau]] connected the album's imagery with the artist's "obsession" with the organisation, but claimed that its use was purely artistic and not propaganda.  In his view the images were only considered controversial because "rock and roll fans are assumed to be stupid" and would not be expected to ascertain their true significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-02-22/music/burning-bright/| title=Burning Bright|first=Robert|last=Christgau | work = [[The Village Voice]]| date=22 February 2005| dateformat=dmy|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref>  Similarly, [[PopMatters]] observed that tiger imagery "does predominate M.I.A.'s vision of the world", but noted that the tiger has a more wide-ranging association with [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalism]] and that the singer's use of such imagery did not necessarily indicate her support for the Tamil Tigers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/mia-0505064.shtml| title=London Calling &ndash; For Congo, Columbo, Sri Lanka....part four |first=Robert|last=Wheaton | work = [[PopMatters]]| date=6 May 2005| dateformat=dmy|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref>

==Release==

The album was initially intended to be released in September 2004, but the release was delayed, apparently due to issues with the clearance of samples.  Revised dates in December 2004 and February 2005 were publicised,<ref name="stylusmiaarularreview"/> but the album remained unreleased and at one point it was announced that it had been shelved indefinitely.<ref name="release" />  It was eventually released on 22 March 2005, when [[XL Recordings]] made it available in the United States, albeit with the track "U.R.A.Q.T." omitted as the issues with a sample had not been resolved.
