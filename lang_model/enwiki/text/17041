'''Pax Hill''', near [[Bentley, Hampshire]], [[England]], was the family home of [[Robert Baden-Powell]], founder of the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]], and his wife, Olave, for over twenty years during the [[20th century]]. It is located at the end of a half-mile drive, off the main [[A31 road|A31]] road. 

Pax Hill is a red-bricked house fronting south with higher ground behind. In the Baden-Powell family's time, there was a [[rose]] garden with [[dovecote]] at one side of the front of the house. Elsewhere, there were two summer houses, a [[shrubbery]] and a [[tennis court]]. Scouts and [[Girl Guides|Guides]] camped on either side of the drive. The Baden-Powells added two wings. The west wing was designed by Robert Baden-Powell himself and he also modelled the frieze for the new bathroom, depicting fish in the [[River Wey]]. 

The house was originally called "Blackacre" and was purchased with a gift from [[Olave Baden-Powell]]'s father in [[1918]]. In [[1929]], it was burgled and a number of souvenirs were stolen. They moved to [[Kenya]] in [[1939]] and Robert Baden-Powell died in [[1941]]. The following year, due to [[World War II]] Pax Hill was occupied by [[Canada|Canadian]] military troops and by way of recompense, Olave Baden-Powell was awarded a 'grace and favour' apartment in [[Hampton Court Palace]].

After World War II, Olave Baden-Powell gave Pax Hill to the Girl Guides Association (now [[Girlguiding UK]]) to be used as a centre for members from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The house became a [[Family and consumer science|Domestic Science]] Training School run on Guiding principles. The interest from <U+00A3>40000 in the [[B.P. Memorial Fund]] was used to fund its upkeep. In April 1953, Pax Hill was sold with the consent of Olave Baden-Powell. It has been a nursing home since [[1988]].
