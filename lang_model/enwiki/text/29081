'''''His Band and the Street Choir''''' is an [[album]] by [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Van Morrison]], released in 1970. The album was originally to be called ''Virgo's Fool''.<ref>Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p.119</ref> It includes the hit single, "[[Domino (Van Morrison song)|Domino]]". Morrison's then wife, Janet Planet, sang on the album. 

According to [[Rolling Stone]] magazine, production of the album started in June 1970.  In September, it was reported that [[Van Morrison]] was unsatisfied with some of the recordings, most notably, the "Street Choir."  Morrison re-entered the studio to re-record portions and complete the album.

==Songs==
"[[Domino (Van Morrison song) |Domino]]" is a punchy affair, with words that mean little, though threatening the whole feelgood thrust of the album. "Crazy Face" namechecks [[Jesse James]]. This could well be one of the missing songs from ''[[Astral Weeks]]'', a long slow sadness. Van repeats the same strange words, which could be Tombstone or Ulster, perhaps even a young Van playing at [[cowboy]]s. "Give Me a Kiss" has the innocence of the early [[Beatles]], set to a rolling beat. "[[I've Been Working]]" is a hypnotic strut, live in the studio. "[[Call Me Up in Dreamland]]" is about life on the road, with "[[radio]]" as a verb, and laughing [[sax]]. "I'll Be Your Lover, Too" is gorgeous, a slow acoustic wallow with Van's voice drenched in tender emotion. "[[Blue Money]]" seems to be about a top shelf magazine model. The music sounds like [[Georgie Fame]] And the Blue Frames, boozy [[horn section |horns]] and a nonsensical chorus. "Virgo Clowns", Van and [[John Platania |Platania]] duet on [[acoustic guitar]]s, one in each speaker, with a sliding [[bass clarinet]] playing bass lines. Slightly maniacal, stoned laughter follows, like a [[Cheech and Chong]] movie. "Gypsy Queen" is closest to the original concept, with Van singing [[falsetto]], almost like a woman, and the rich vocal chorus. "If I Ever Needed Someone" is sweet and mournful, with Van wringing real need out of the simple words. "Street Choir" starts appropriately with churchy [[Organ (music) |organ]], [[gospel choir]] and heavenly [[trumpets]]. Van proves that he is a sweeter [[harmonica]] player than [[Bob Dylan |Dylan]]. There is a sad, slow majesty to this performence, which hints at better things to come.<ref>Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p.122-123</ref>
