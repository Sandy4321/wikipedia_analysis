'''St Gallgo's Church, Llanallgo''' is a small church near the village of [[Llanallgo]], on the east coast of [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The [[chancel]] and [[transept]]s, which are the oldest features of the present building, date from the late 15th century, but there has been a church on this site since sometime in the 6th or early 7th century, making it one of the oldest Christian sites in Anglesey.<ref name=Anglesey/> Some restoration and enlargement took place during the 19th century.  The church is associated with the 1859 wreck of the ''[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]'' off Anglesey: it was used as a temporary mortuary and 140 of the victims are buried in the churchyard.  [[Charles Dickens]], who wrote about the loss of the ship, noted the care taken by the rector, Stephen Roose Hughes, for the victims and their families.  Hughes died a few years later following the strain of the events and is also buried in the churchyard.

The church is still used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]], as one of four churches in a combined parish. There is a regular pattern of services in English and in Welsh. St Gallgo's is a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]], a national designation given to "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> as a "rural church with strong Perpendicular character", retaining some features from the late 15th century.<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5352|title=Church of St Allgo|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=16 February 2011}} (Cadw has misspelt the church's name.)</ref>  The church contains a late 13th-century bell, with an impression of a coin of [[Edward I|King Edward I]], some memorials from the 17th to 19th centuries, and some church furniture from the early 20th century in an [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Craft]] style.

==History and location==
According to [[Angharad Llwyd]], a 19th-century historian of [[Anglesey]], the first church at this location is said to have been built in 605.<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=105|title=A History of the Island of Mona|origyear=1833|year=2007|publisher=Llyfrau Magma|location=[[Llansadwrn, Anglesey]]|isbn=1872773737}}</ref> Another writer, Geraint Jones, puts it earlier than this, and says in his 2006 guide to the churches of [[Anglesey]] that [[St Gallgo]] himself established the church in the early 6th century; Jones says that it is "one of the oldest Christian sites in Anglesey."<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|pages=45<U+2013>46|isbn=1845270894|publisher=[[Gwasg Carreg Gwalch]]|last=Jones|first=Geraint I. L.|year=2006}}</ref> Gallgo was one of the sons of [[St Caw]], a king from northern Britain, and a brother of [[St Gildas]] and [[St Eugrad]].<ref name=Anglesey/> Llwyd also recorded that there was a well near the church named after Gallgo, and said that "miraculous cures" had been ascribed to the waters, which were "strongly impregnated with sulphate of lime".<ref name=Llwyd/>

The presence of a church here was recorded in the [[Norwich Taxation]] of 1254, but the oldest parts of the structure of the present building (the [[chancel]] and [[transept]]s) date from the late 15th century.<ref name=List/> It was formerly used as a [[chapel of ease]] for [[St Eugrad's Church, Llaneugrad]].<ref name=Anglesey/>  Repair work was carried out in 1831, which included adding a west window, and extensive restoration in 1892 (under Henry Kennedy, the architect of the [[Diocese of Bangor]]) included rebuilding the west walls of the transepts and lengthening the [[nave]].<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|page=139|chapter=Anglesey|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref> In 1934, the [[sanctuary]] was restored in memory of a former [[rector]], Stephen Roose Hughes. The vestry was badly damaged by fire in 2004, but has since been repaired.<ref name=Anglesey/>

[[File:RoyalCharterLlanallgo.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The memorial to victims of the wreck of the ''[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]'']]
The churchyard contains 140 victims of the sinking of the ''[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]'' off Anglesey in October 1859, and an obelisk commemorates the loss.<ref name=Anglesey/> Over 440 passengers and crew died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/hanescymruarmor/e_prog3_royal_loss.shtml|title=The Loss of the Royal Charter|publisher=[[S4C]]|accessdate=17 February 2011|quote=Of the 371 passengers there were 21 survivors; 18 of the 112 crew survived.}}</ref>  Stephen Roose Hughes was the rector at the time of the accident.<ref name=Anglesey/> St Gallgo's was used as a temporary mortuary as bodies were recovered from the sea.<ref name=Wreck/> Hughes and his brother Hugh, who was rector of an adjoining parish, conducted many of the funeral services.  Hughes wrote over 1,000 letters to people enquiring for news of relatives and friends, and comforted many who visited Anglesey. [[Charles Dickens]] stayed with Hughes when he visited Anglesey to write about the sinking; his experiences were published in ''[[The Uncommercial Traveller]]''.  He recorded the care that Hughes took to try and identify victims from their possessions and physical characteristics.<ref name=Wreck/>  Hughes died three years later, with the strain of the events being noted on his gravestone in the churchyard as one of the reasons for his early death. He is remembered in St Gallgo's on the anniversary of his death, 4 February.<ref name=Wreck>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcharterchurch.org.uk/wreck.html| title=The Wreck of the Royal Charter| publisher=St Gallgo's Church, Llangallo|date=2011|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>

St Gallgo's is still used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]].  It is one of four churches in the combined [[benefice]] of [[Llaneugrad]] and Llanallgo with [[Penrhosllugwy]] with [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd]].<ref name=CinW/>  It is within the [[deanery]] of Twrcelyn, the [[archdeaconry]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=Parish>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/bangor/diocese/parish_details/twrcelyn/stgallgo.html|title=Deanery of Twrcelyn: St Gallgo, Llanallgo|publisher=Church in Wales|accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref>  As of 2011, there is a vacancy for the position of rector.<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/ben.php?dosommat=detail&which=111 |title=Church in Wales: Benefices |accessdate=16 February 2011|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref> The pattern of services in 2011 is for a service every Sunday morning, either a communion service or morning prayer, alternating between Welsh and English; there is also a twice-monthly evening service (in English) and a midweek communion service in the church hall in [[Moelfre]].

The church stands to the south west of the village of [[Llanallgo]], near the eastern coast of Anglesey, north Wales.<ref name=List/> It is {{convert|6|mi}} from [[Llangefni]], the county town of Anglesey. The village takes its name from the church: the Welsh word "{{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|llan]]}}" originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and "-allgo" is a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|modified form]] of the saint's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

==Architecture and fittings==
[[File:The nave and sanctuary of Eglwys St Gallgo, Llanallgo - geograph.org.uk - 1191385.jpg|thumb|left|The interior, looking towards the east end]]
The church is built in the [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular style]] from [[rubble masonry]]; the roof is made of slate with a stone [[bellcote]] at the west end and stone cross [[finial]]s. The church is [[cruciform|built in a cross shape]], with transepts to the north and south of the chancel. Entrance is through a porch on the north side of the nave, where the doorway has been built reusing older stones. The interior walls of the nave and transepts are lined with painted bricks. The supporting timber braces of the nave roof can be seen from inside the church; the roof trusses in the chancel and transepts are covered by barrel-shaped boarded ceilings. The chancel floor is made from local limestone.  The east window of the chancel dates from the 15th century, although the [[tracery]] is more recent.<ref name=List/> It has stained glass portraying Christ walking on the water giving a blessing and the word "It is I, be not afraid".<ref name=Anglesey/><ref name=List/> The east windows in both the north and south transepts are each topped with a [[cinquefoil]]. The nave windows date from the late 19th century.<ref name=List/>

The bell is one of the oldest in the diocese, dating from the late 13th century.  It bears the imprint of a penny from the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] (reigned 1272<U+2013>1307) and the Latin inscription ''{{lang|la|AVE MARIA GRACIA PLENA}}'' ("Hail Mary full of grace").  Restoration of the bell in 2000 cost <U+00A3>3,000.<ref name=Anglesey/><ref name=List/> The [[reredos]], altar, communion rail, pulpit and reading desk (all from the early 20th century) are made from [[limed oak]] in an [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style, with floral decorations. The north transept has a stone memorial on the north wall to a former rector, Lewis Owen, and his grandson, who both died in 1771. The font is modern.<ref name=List/> A 1937 survey by the [[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]] noted a 1726 communion table and a number of memorials from the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=34|chapter=Llanallgo}}</ref>

The chancel measures 12 by 12&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (3.65 by 3.8m); the north transept is 17 by 14&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (5.2 by 4.4m); the south transept is slightly smaller, at 17 by 14&nbsp;feet (5.2 by 4.25m); and the nave after its 1892 extension is now twice as long as the chancel, at {{convert|24|by|12|ft}}.<ref name=RC/>

==Assessment==
The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 12 May 1970, and has been listed as "a rural church with strong Perpendicular character".<ref name=List/> [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that it retains some features from the late 15th century.<ref name=List/>

Angharad Llwyd, writing shortly after the 1831 restoration, described the church as "a small and handsome structure", and she recorded the presence of some "ancient" stained glass in the east window.<ref name=Llwyd/> Writing in 1859, the clergyman and antiquarian [[Harry Longueville Jones]] said that the church, although small, was one of the "better kind" in Anglesey.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|date=1859|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|volume=V|series=3rd|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=123<U+2013>124|title=Mona Mediaeva No. XXII|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam13assogoog#page/n133/mode/2up|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> He thought that the walls had been lowered after being built, because the top of the east window was too close to the roof, which in his view could not have been the original intention. At the time he wrote, there was the remains of a screen between the nave and the chancel, but this is no longer present. Overall, he commented, "the workmanship of this church is more careful than usual, and shows that it was erected by some person of munificent disposition."<ref name=Jones/>

The Welsh politician and church historian [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]] visited the church in 1868.  He noted that the church had not been altered as much as most of the other churches in Anglesey. He thought that the west window was "modern and bad", but that the east window of the chancel was "very good".<ref name=Glynne>{{cite journal|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam08assogoog#page/n102/mode/2up|accessdate=17 February 2011|title=Notes on the Older Churches of the Four Welsh Dioceses|page=90|first=Sir Stephen|last=Glynne|authorlink=Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|journal=[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]|year=1900|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|volume=XVII|series=5th}}</ref> He added that the church needed repair, as the interior was "very rough".<ref name=Glynne/>
