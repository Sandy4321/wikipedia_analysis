'''Samuel Mendel''' (1811<U+2013>1884) the ''Merchant Prince'' was one of the leading merchants in Manchester during its rise to industrial prominence. He was born in Liverpool, but at an early age moved to Manchester with his father, Emmanuel Mendel. Emmanuel had a rope, twine, and pitch-paper business and established a hotel, the Manchester and Liverpool, subsequently known as Mendel's Hotel. Samuel's first job was in a warehouse on Bow Street belonging to Mr. B. Liebert, in the course of which he travelled widely. Building on his experience he began his own business, and rapidly became one of Manchester's leading textile merchants. He built a large warehouse, Chepstow House, in central Manchester and a substantial mansion, [[Manley_Hall,_Manchester|Manley Hall]], in Whalley Range. He filled this house with an impressive collection of art (much of it acquired with the aid of the noted art dealers [[Thomas Agnew & Sons]]).  Due to difficulties with his business, caused by the alterations to trade arising from the opening of the [[Suez canal]], he was in 1875 forced into bankruptcy. His later years were spent in reduced circumstances in  Chislehurst. He died in Balham in 1884.<ref>[http://ia700303.us.archive.org/12/items/annalsofmanchest00axon/annalsofmanchest00axon.pdf [[William Axon|William E. A. Axon]] ed.
