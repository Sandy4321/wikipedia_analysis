'''Augustus Th<U+00E9>baud''' (b. at [[Nantes]], France, [[20 November]][[1807]]; d. at [[St. John's College, Fordham]], [[New York]], [[17 December]][[1885]]) was a French-American [[Jesuit]] educator and publicist.

==Life==
Th<U+00E9>baud studied at first in the preparatory seminary at Nantes, then entered the grand s<U+00E9>minaire and was ordained to the secular priesthood at the usual age. After three years of parochial work in his native city, he entered the Society of Jesus in Italy, on 27 November, 1835, whence he returned to France in 1837 to pursue a course of scientific studies at the [[Sorbonne]] under [[Amp<U+00E8>re]] and others. 

He landed in the United States on 18 December, 1838, and was called to the chair of chemistry at [[St. Mary's College, Kentucky]], where he became rector in 1846. Before the end of that year however the Jesuits left Kentucky to take charge of St. John's College, Fordham, New York, which had been transferred to them from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Diocese of New York]] by [[John Hughes (archbishop)|Bishop Hughes]]. Father Th<U+00E9>baud was the first Jesuit President of St. John's, a position which he held from 1846 to 1851 and again from 1860 to 1863. 

In the interval he taught the sciences for two years, 1851- 52, under [[Father Larkin]], and the following eight years he spent as the pastor of[[ St. Joseph's Church, Troy]]. To this charge he returned after his second rectorship at Fordham and filled the position from 1863-69, and again from 1873-74. The intervening years we find him at first in [[Montreal]] and then at St. Joseph's Church, Hudson City, New Jersey. After spending another year at Fordham, he was assigned to St. Francis Xavier's parish, New York, where he passed the rest of his days.

==Works==

Th<U+00E9>baud wrote a series of books on religious and historical subjects and published, besides numerous articles in the "Catholic World" and the "Catholic Quarterly Review", two novels, "Louisa Kirkbridge, A Tale of New York" (1879), and "Twit Twats, An Allegorical Story of Birds" (1881). 

His more important works are: 

* ''The Irish Race in the Past and in the Present'' (1873); 
* ''The Church and the Gentile World'' (2 vols., 1878); 
* ''The Church and the Moral World'' (1881). 

From 1875 to his death, he also prepared his reminiscences in three volumes. Of these the United States Catholic Historical Society published volume III (1904), giving an account of his American experiences, and volume I (1911), containing the recollections of his life in France.
