'''Edwin Stephen Goodrich''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1947.0013}}</ref> ([[Weston-super-Mare]], 21 June 1868 &ndash; [[Oxford]], 6 January 1946), was an English [[zoologist]], specialising in [[comparative anatomy]], [[embryology]], [[paleontology]], and [[evolution]]. He held the [[Linacre Chair of Zoology]] in the [[University of Oxford]] from 1921 to 1946. He served as editor of the ''[[Journal of Cell Science|Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science]]'' from 1920 until his death.<ref name="Hardy">{{cite pmid| 20286258 }}</ref>

== Life ==
When Goodrich was two weeks old his father died, and his mother took her children to live with her mother at [[ Pau, Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es-Atlantiques|Pau, France]], where he attended the local English school and a French lyc<U+00E9>e. In 1888 he entered the [[Slade School of Art]] at [[University College London]]; there he met [[E. Ray Lankester]], who interested him in zoology.<ref name="frs"/>

On coming to Oxford from London, Goodrich entered [[Merton College, Oxford]] as an undergraduate in 1892 and, while acting as assistant to Lankester, read for the final honour school in Zoology; he was awarded the [[George Rolleston|Rolleston]] Memorial Prize in 1894 and graduated with first-class honours the following year.<ref name="Hardy"/>

In 1913 Goodrich married Helen Pixell, a distinguished [[protozoology|protozoologist]], who helped greatly with his work. His artistic training always stood him in good stead. He drew diagrams of  beauty and clarity whilst lecturing (students used to photograph the blackboard before it was erased), and in his books and papers. He also exhibited his [[watercolor]] [[landscapes]] in London. Goodrich was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1905 and received its [[Royal Medal]] in 1936. He was honorary member of the [[New York Academy of Science]] and of many other academies, and awarded many honorary doctorates. In 1945 [[Lev Berg]] of [[Leningrad]] sent a message through [[Julian Huxley]]: <U+201C>Please tell [Goodrich] that... we all regard ourselves as his pupils.<U+201D> A small, dapper, thin man with a dry sense of humor, he always complained that, when traveling by air, he was not weighed with his luggage, since his own weight was only half that of an average passenger.<ref name="frs"/>

== Career ==
When Lankester became [[Linacre Chair of Zoology|Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy]] at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], he made Goodrich his assistant in 1892; this marked the start of the researches which during half a century made Goodrich the greatest comparative anatomist of his day. In 1921 Goodrich was appointed to his mentor's old post, which he held until 1945.

From the start of his researches, many of which were devoted to marine organisms, Goodrich made himself acquainted at first hand with the marine fauna of [[Plymouth]], [[Roscoff]], [[Banyuls]], [[Naples]], [[Helgoland]], [[Bermuda]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Canary Islands]]. He also traveled extensively in Europe, the United States, North Africa, India, [[Ceylon]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and [[Java]]. He worked out the significance of the tubes connecting the centres of the bodies of animals with the outside. There are [[nephridia]], developed from the outer layer inward and serving the function of [[excretion]]. Quite different from them are coelomoducts, developed from the middle layer outward, serving to release the [[germ cell]]s. These two sets of tubes may look similar, when each opens into the body cavity through a funnel surrounded by cilia which create a current of fluid. In some groups the nephridia may disappear (as in vertebrates, where the nephridia may have been converted into the [[thymus gland]]), and the coelomoducts then take on the additional function of excretion. This is why man has a [[genitourinary]] system. Before Goodrich's analysis, the whole subject was in chaos.

Goodrich established that a [[motor nerve]] remains linked to its corresponding segmental muscle, however much it may have become displaced or obscured in development. He showed that organs can be [[homology (biology)|homologous]] without arising from the same [[Segment (biology)|segment]]s of the body. For example, the fins and limbs of vertebrates; and the [[Occipital bone|occipital arch]] (the back of the skull), which varies in vertebrates from the fifth to the ninth segment. 

He distinguished between the scale structures of fishes, living and fossil, by which they are classified and recognized. This is important because different [[stratum|strata]] may identified by fossil fish scales. Goodrich's attention was always focused on [[evolution]], to which he made notable contributions, firmly adhering to Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]].<ref name="frs"/>

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May 1905.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf|title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=17 July 2010|location=London}}</ref>

On his seventieth birthday, in 1938, his colleagues and pupils published a [[festschrift]]<ref>a volume of essays in his honour</ref> edited by Gavin de Beer: ''Evolution: essays on aspects of evolutionary biology''.
