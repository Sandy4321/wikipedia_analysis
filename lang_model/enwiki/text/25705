'''State Route 212''' ('''SR 212''') is a two-lane east&ndash;west [[State highway#United States|state highway]] that runs within [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark]], [[Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Tuscarawas]], [[Carroll County, Ohio|Carroll]], and [[Harrison County, Ohio|Harrison]] Counties in eastern [[Ohio]].  The western terminus of SR 212 is at [[U.S. Route 250 in Ohio|U.S. Route 250]] near [[Beach City, Ohio|Beach City]], and its eastern terminus is at [[Ohio State Route 151|SR 151]] in [[Bowerston, Ohio|Bowerston]]. The route passes through rural areas but passes through small villages including Beach City, [[Bolivar, Ohio|Bolivar]], [[Zoar, Ohio|Zoar]], [[Sherrodsville, Ohio|Sherrodsville]], and [[Leesville, Ohio|Leesville]]. It largely follows the valleys formed by the [[Tuscarawas River]] and [[Conotton Creek]].

==Route description==
[[File:Conotton Valley High School.jpg|thumb|left|SR 212 as it passes Conotton Valley High School in Harrison County]]
SR 212 begins at a [[Three-way junction|Y-intersection]] with US 250 in rural [[Sugar Creek Township, Stark County, Ohio|Sugar Creek Township]] in the southernmost portion of Stark County. The route heads northeast and almost immediately enters the village of Beach City as Redwood Avenue. In the center of the village, it intersects [[Ohio State Route 93|SR 93]] (3rd Avenue) at a [[stop sign|stop]]-controlled intersection. After exiting the village, the route passes the Beach City Airport before it begins to follow the Stark<U+2013>Tuscarawas county line for about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}. While on the county line, SR 212 intersects [[Ohio State Route 21|SR 21]]. The entire right-of-way of SR 212 briefly reenters Stark County before fully entering Tuscarawas County. In this area, the route crosses the Tuscarawas River twice. The route enters Bolivar on Poplar Street and travels through a residential neighborhood before coming to an intersection with Park Avenue. SR 212 heads south along Park Avenue heading through more residential areas before making a left turn onto an unnamed road south of the downtown area. Just past this intersection, SR 212 has an interchange with [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|Interstate 77]] at its exit 93. After crossing the Tuscarawas River again, the route heads southeast paralleling the river. After passing through the village of Zoar, SR 212 reaches a T-intersection with [[Ohio State Route 800|SR 800]] in [[Fairfield Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Fairfield Township]].<ref name=GM/>

The two routes form a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] and together head northeast into [[Sandy Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Sandy Township]]. While the Tuscarawas River heads south towards [[Dover, Ohio|Dover]], SR 212 now begins to follow the Conotton Creek which it will for the remainder of the route. After {{convert|0.4|mi|km}}, SR 212 breaks off of the SR 800 concurrency, the latter heads north towards [[Mineral City, Ohio|Mineral City]]. SR 212 crosses the Conotton Creek and parallels it through Fairfield and [[Warren Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Warren]] townships. In Warren Township, the route passes over the top of the [[Atwood Lake]] dam and intersects the marina entrance to the lake. It crosses into Carroll County and intersects [[Ohio State Route 542|SR 542]] at its southern terminus. SR 542 heads north and provides access to small resorts along the lake's shoreline. {{convert|1/4|mi|km|spell=In}} later, SR 212 comes to an intersection with [[Ohio State Route 39|SR 39]]. SR 39 heads northeast towards [[Dellroy, Ohio|Dellroy]] and [[Carrollton, Ohio|Carrollton]] while SR 39 and SR 212 form a concurrency south into Sherrodsville on Church Street. In the geographic center of the village, SR 39 curves to the west but SR 212 branches off to the southeast on Sherrod Avenue, makes many curves, and passes through the business district of Sherrodsville. Now in [[Orange Township, Carroll County, Ohio|Orange Township]], the route (also named Cumberland Road) heads southeast still paralleling the Conotton Creek. After passing the [[Conotton Valley High School]], SR 212 enters Leesville on Union Street. In the center of the village, there is a [[traffic circle]] with Market Street (Carroll County Route 22). Two blocks south of the circle, SR 212 curves to the east on Green Street. At the southern village limits of Leesville, SR 212 intersects the southern terminus of [[Ohio State Route 164|SR 164]] which travels east from this point. Traveling in a more south-southeast direction, SR 212 exits Carroll County and enters Harrison County for the last {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} of the route. After clipping [[Monroe Township, Harrison County, Ohio|Monroe Township]], SR 212 enters the village of Bowerston. The route ends at a T-intersection with SR 151 which bypasses the center of Bowerston to the north.<ref name=GM>{{google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-250+E&daddr=40.5670939,-81.3587173+to:Boyce+Dr&hl=en&sll=40.542605,-81.39154&sspn=0.448746,0.891953&geocode=Fc85bAIdQ_8i-w%3BFTUBawIdg5Am-ynFAgOqE-Y2iDENY0uz9qqTVg%3BFTbiaAIdfSEp-w&mra=dpe&mrsp=1&sz=11&via=1&t=m&z=11 |accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
Though within the same area of SR 212's current southern terminus, SR 212 was first designated in 1923 along a different route than where it travels today. The original 1923 route ran from the community of Station 15 (within Monroe Township, Harrison County) at [[List of former state routes in Ohio (1<U+2013>49)#SR 13 (1923<U+2013>1926)|SR 13]] (modern-day US 250) to SR 151 in Bowerston.<ref name=ODOT1923_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Routes |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1923a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Division of Highways |year=1923 |cartography=L.A. Boulay, Director |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> At this time, the only portion of modern-day SR 212 that was part of the state highway system was between Sherrodsville and Bowerston; this segment was signed as the westernmost portion of SR 151.<ref name=ODOT1923_map/> In 1928, SR 151 and SR 212 switched routes, SR 212 now ran from Sherrodsville and Bowerston and SR 151 traveled west to Station 15.<ref name=ODOT1927_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Routes |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1927a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=ODOH |year=1927 |cartography=G.F.
