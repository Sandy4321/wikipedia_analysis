A '''school counselor''' is a counselor who works in [[school]]s. It is a practice most common in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Most school counselor occupations or equivalent occupations are comparable to the U.S. high school counselor in terms of duties and services. Historically, the need for high school counselors has been emphasized more so than school counselors in lower grades. Many countries vary as to whether  counseling services is provided outside a school setting, or not provided at all. 

==History==
===United States===
[[Image:Educator_eff.jpeg.jpg|left|thumb|Some elementary school counselors use books and other media to facilitate the counseling process.]]

In the [[United States]], the '''school counseling''' profession began as a vocational guidance movement at the beginning of the 20th century.  [[Jesse B. Davis]] is considered the first to provide a systematic school guidance program.  In [[1907]], he became the principal of a high school and encouraged the school English teachers to use compositions and lessons to relate [[career interests]], develop character, and avoid behavioral problems.  Many others during this time did the same.  For example, in [[1908]], [[Frank Parsons]], "Father of Vocational Guidance" established the [[Bureau of Vocational Guidance]] to assist young people in making the transition from school to work.

From the [[1920]]s to the [[1930]]s, [[school]] counseling and guidance grew because of the rise of progressive education in schools.  This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development.  Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education.  This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in school counseling and guidance.  In the [[1940]]s, the U.S. used [[psychologists]] and [[Mental Health Counselor|counselors]] to select, recruit, and train [[military]] personnel.  This propelled the counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs.  Schools accepted these military tests openly.  Also, [[Carl Rogers]]' emphasis on helping relationships during this time influenced the profession of school counseling.  In the [[1950]]s the [[government]] established the Guidance and Personnel Services Section in the Division of State and Local School Systems.  In [[1957]], the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik I]]. Out of concern that the [[Russians]] were beating the U.S. in the space race, which had military implications, and that there were not enough [[scientists]] and [[mathematicians]], the American government passed the [[National Defense Education Act]], which spurred a huge growth in [[vocational]] guidance through large amounts of funding.  Since the [[1960]]s, the profession of school counseling has continued to grow as new [[legislation]] and new professional developments were established to refine and further the profession and improve education (Schmidt<ref name=schmidt>Schmidt, J.J. (2003) Counseling in schools: Essential services and comprehensive programs.  4th ed.  Boston: Allyn & Bacon.</ref>, 2003). On January 1, [[2006]], congress officially declared February 6-10 as National School Counseling Week.

==Theoretical framework and services==
Professional School Counselors implement a comprehensive school counseling program that promotes and enhances student achievement through a guidance curriculum, individual planning strategies, responsive services and comprehensive school counseling program support/advocacy. A fully-implemented district-wide comprehensive school counseling program meets the needs of 100% of the students -- just as the district's mathematics program is for 100% of the students.  Professional School Counselors, in most states, have earned a Master's degree in guidance and counseling with an emphasis in school counseling.  They are employed in elementary, middle/junior high and high schools and in district supervisory, counselor education and post-secondary settings. Their work is varied, with attention focused on developmental stages of student growth, including the needs, tasks, and student interests related to those stages. 
{{psychology}}
Professional School Counselors meet the needs of student in three basic domains: [[academic development]], [[career development]], and [[personal/social development]].  Knowledge, understanding and skill in these domains are developed through [[classroom]] [[teaching|instruction]], [[appraisal]], [[consultation]], [[psychotherapy|counseling]], [[coordination]], and [[collaboration]].  For example, in appraisal, school counselors may use a variety of [[personality]] and vocational assessment methods to help students explore vocation needs and interests. Classroom guidance lessons are designed to be preventive in nature and include self-management and self-monitoring skills. The Responsive Services component of the Professional School Counselor's role provides individual and/or small group counseling for students.  For example, if a student's behavior is interfering with his or her achievement, the Professional school counselor will observe that student in a class, provide consultation to teachers and other personnel to develop (with the student) a plan to address the behavioral issue(s), and then work together (collaboration) to implement the plan. They also help by providing consultation services to family members. 

Additionally, professional school counselors may lead classroom guidance on a variety of topics within the three domains such as personal/social issues relative to student needs, or establish groups to address common issues among students, such as divorce or death.  Often counselors will coordinate outside groups that wish to help with student needs such as academics, or coordinate a state program that teaches about [[child abuse]] or [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], through on-stage [[drama]] (Schmidt<ref name=schmidt/>, 2003)

===Elementary/Primary===
[[elementary education|Elementary]] Professional school counselors adapt counseling to meet the developmental needs of young children. To faciliate the counseling process, they use a variety of media such as [[crayons]], [[paint]], [[puppets]], [[clay]], [[children's literature|children's books]], and [[toys]]. The elementary school counseling career is an opportunity for Americans and Canadians who are interested in the field of [[play therapy]] versus community and private agencies. Elementary professional school counselors also spend 35-40% of their time in classroom guidance. Though not ideal, they are sometimes on a rotating schedule with "special area" teachers such as [[music education]] teachers, [[art education]] teachers, or [[physical education]] teachers.

===Middle School===
In [[middle school]] counseling the professional school counselor typically is engaged in less classroom instruction and more engaged in Individual Planning (for high school and beyond). Individual and small group responsive services (e.g. counseling) continue. Also, the counselor usually spends more time on vocational assessment with eighth grade students as they prepare for high school.

===High School/Secondary===
In [[high school]], the American professional school counselor continues to provide Responsive Services and provides fewer classroom guidance strategies. The high school counselor provides large group guidance units and lessons on post-secondary options. For example, the high school counselor helps students prepare for post-secondary education and/or training options (e.g. [[college]], [[trade school]]) by engaging students in finding accurate and meaningful information on entrance requirements, [[financial aid]], recommendation letters, test-preparation and so forth. Professional School Counselors at the high school level spend much of their helping students monitor their progress toward graduation and being adequately prepared for post-secondary options.  While some high school counselors spend time developing the school's class schedule, this is considered a non-guidacne task and takes valuable time away from direct work with students. (see the American School Counselor Website for additional information about Comprehensive School Counseling Programs and the role of the Professional School Counselor http://www.schoolcounselor.org )

==Education and training==
The Professional School Counselor is a certified/licensed educator trained in school counseling with unique qualifications and skills to address all students<U+2019> academic, personal/social and career development needs.

According to the [[Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs]]  (CACREP), a school counseling program should meet several standards such as the professional identity of school counseling (history, organizations, so on), cultural diversity courses, [[human development]] and growth, and [[career development]].  Additionally, it has to have core components for helping relationships (consultation, counseling, so on), group work, assessment, research and program evaluation, knowledge and requirements for school counselors, contextual dimensions of school counseling, and foundations of school counseling.  In programs that are, CACREP accredited, a school counseling student must have 600 hours of [[internship]] under a highly qualified school counselor (master's degree or higher, and appropriate licenses and certifications) (CACREP<ref>Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). (2001)  The 2001 Standards.  Retrieved on November 25, 2003, from http://www.counseling.org/
cacrep/2001standards700.htm</ref>, 2001). 

Lastly, according to CACREP, a school counseling program must be a master level (or higher) graduate program. Each state has its own certification or licensure requirements, and at least one state, California, merely requires a bachelor's degree, causing concern about competence of school counselors in that state (National Clearinghouse<ref>National Clearinghouse, [school counselor] n.d. National Clearinghouse for professions in Special Education. (n.d.)  School counselor.  Retrieved on February 26, 2005 from http://www.special-ed-careers.org/pdf/schcoun.pdf</ref>.  However, California does have a Pupil Personnel Services credential (PPS) that requires completion of 48 semester hours in a Commission approved program specializing in school counseling (California Commisssion on Teacher Creditionaling<ref>California Commisssion on Teacher Creditionals. (August 2004). ''Pupil Personal Services Creditial''. California Leaflet 606. retrieved on June 27, 2006 from http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/cl606.pdf</ref>
, 2004).

School Counselors may opt for national (American) certification through two different boards. The [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]] (NBPTS) requires a two-to-three year process of performance based assessment, and demonstrate (in writing) content knowledge in human growth/development, diverse populations, school counseling programs, theories, data, and change and collaboration. As of February, 2005, 30 states offer financial incentives for this certification.

[[The National Board of Certified Counselors]] (NBCC) requires passing the National Certified School Counselor Examination (NCSC), which includes 40 multiple choice questions and seven simulated cases which assess school counselors abibilities to make critical decisions on the spot. Additionally, a master's degree and three years of supervised experience are required. NBTS also requires three years of experience, however a master's degree is not required, but only state certification (41 of 50 require a master's degree). At least four states offer financial incentives for the NCSC certification (McLeod<ref>Mcleod, K. (March/April 2005). Certification by the books. ''ASCA School Counselor''. Alexandria, VA: American School Counseling Association</ref>, 2005). Both certifications have benefits and costs that a school counselor would want to consider for national certification.

==Job growth and earnings==
According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook<ref>United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos067.htm|Occupational Outlook Handbook]</ref> (OOH) the [[median]] [[salary]] for school counselors in May 2004 was $45,570. The middle 50 percent earned between $25,840 and $40,130. Also, school counselors could earn additional money working summer jobs as counselors for schools or community agencies, and among all counseling fields, are currently (2004) paid the highest salary. Overall employment for counselors is faster than average, and school counselors should find a favorable job market because demand is higher than the graduation rates of school counseling programs.

==International School Counseling==
In Korea, school counselors must teach a subject besides counseling, and not all school counselors are appointed to counseling positions. even though Korean law has required school counselors in all middle and high schools, according to Professor  Kim, Kay-Hyon at [[Seoul National University]]<ref>Kim, Kay-Hyon.
