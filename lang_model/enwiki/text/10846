The '''Battle of Fairfield''' was a [[cavalry]] engagement during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]]. It was fought July 3, 1863, near [[Fairfield, Pennsylvania]], concurrently with the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], although it was not a formal part of that battle. While a minor fight by the small number of troops deployed, strategically, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] victory secured the important Hagerstown Road, which [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] would use on July 5 to return to [[Maryland]] and then on to safety in [[Virginia]].

==Background==
Fairfield had been the site of combat on June 21, when the 14th Virginia Cavalry of Brig. Gen. [[Albert Jenkins]]'s mounted infantry brigade had used [[Monterey Pass]] to conduct a raid near [[Fairfield, Pennsylvania]], with the [[First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry]] that resulted in the Confederates withdrawing into the [[Cumberland Valley]].<ref name=Miller>{{cite web |last=Miller |first=John A. |url=http://emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/civil_war/the_battle_of_monterey.htm |title=History of the Battle of Monterey Pass |publisher=Emmitsburg Historical Society |accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref>

Much of the cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia had accompanied [[Major General (CSA) | Maj. Gen.]] [[J.E.B. Stuart]] on his ride around the [[Union Army | Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]] through Maryland]and south-central [[Pennsylvania]]. Lee had retained several brigades to guard the mountain passes as he advanced through the [[Shenandoah Valley|Shenandoah]] and [[Cumberland Valley]]s and to scout Federal positions. Among the latter brigades was that of [[Brigadier General (CSA) | Brig. Gen.]] [[William E. Jones|William E. "Grumble" Jones]]&mdash;the celebrated "Laurel Brigade" that had once been commanded by [[Turner Ashby]]. Jones had detached one of his best commands, the 35th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, to accompany the infantry of [[Jubal Early]], but retained the bulk of his command. Jones's Brigade had been raiding the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] in [[West Virginia]] and Maryland before being recalled by Lee. They hastened to Pennsylvania, crossing the [[Potomac River]] on July 1 (where Jones detached the 12th Virginia to guard the ford) and camping at [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] the following night. Jones's force had been reduced to the 6th, 7th, and 11th Virginia Cavalry and [[Preston Chew]]'s Battery of [[horse artillery]]. Jones reached Fairfield on July 3 in response to Lee's orders to secure the vital Hagerstown Road. 

Reports of a slow moving Confederate wagon train in the vicinity had attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brig. Gen. [[Wesley Merritt]], who ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Maj. [[Samuel H. Starr]] to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons. Once in Fairfield, Major Starr learned that a wagon train had just rolled out of town and was heading to Cashtown. He divided his 400 men into three detachments and began to search for the wagons. 

==Battle==

One party soon encountered the pickets of Jones's 7th Virginia Cavalry and withdrew when additional Confederates rode up. Informed of the presence of the enemy, Starr rode to a small ridge and dismounted his men in fields and an orchard on both sides of the road. He threw back a mounted charge of the 7th Virginia, just as Chew's Battery unlimbered and opened fire on the Federal cavalrymen. Supported by the 6th Virginia, the 7th Virginia charged again,<ref>Longacre, p. 236, indicates that the 6th Virginia conducted the second charge alone.</ref> clearing Starr's force off the ridge and inflicting heavy losses. Jones pursued the retreating Federals for three miles to the Fairfield Gap, but was unable to catch his quarry. 

==Aftermath==

Federal losses were 6 killed, 28 wounded, and 208 unaccounted for&mdash;primarily prisoners. The losses for the Confederates were 8 killed, 21 wounded, and 5 missing.

Jones camped near Fairfield and kept the road open for Lee's retreat, then guarded the rear as the Army of Northern Virginia slogged through the Fairfield Gap in a driving rainstorm on July 5.

[[Private (rank)|Pvt.]] George C. Platt, an Irish immigrant serving in Troop H of the 6th U.S. Cavalry, was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] on July 12, 1895, for his actions at Fairfield. His citation reads, "Seized the regimental flag upon the death of the standard bearer in a hand-to-hand fight and prevented it from falling into the hands of the enemy."
