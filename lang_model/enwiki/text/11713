The '''Chochenyo'''  (also called Choche<U+00F1>o, Chocenyo) are one of the divisions of the indigenous [[Ohlone|Ohlone (Costanoan)]] people  of [[Northern California]]. The Chochenyo resided on the east side of the [[San Francisco Bay]] (the "East Bay"), primarily in what is now [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], and also [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]], inland to the [[Mount Diablo]] coastal mountains.  

''[[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]]'' (also called ''Choche<U+00F1>o'' and ''East Bay Costanoan'') is also the name of their spoken language, one of the Costanoan dialects in the [[Utian languages|Utian family]].<!--to be verified: ...and as the language spoken at the San Jose Mission?--> Linguistically, Chochenyo, [[Tamyen]] and [[Ramaytush]] are thought to be close dialects of a single language.

The Ohlone tribes were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who moved into the San Francisco Bay Region around 500 AD, displacing earlier [[Esselen]] people.<ref>Teixeira, 1997.</ref> In Chochenyo territory, recent datings of the ancient [[Emeryville Shellmound]]s and Newark Shellmounds attest to people residing in the Bay Area since the [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]].<ref>Stanger, F. M. Editor ''La Peninsula'' Vol. XIV No. 4, March 1968, pg.</ref> 

Chochenyo territory was bordered by the [[Karkin]] to the north (at [[Mount Diablo]]), the [[Tamyen]] to the south and southwest, the San Francisco Bay to the west, and overlapped a bit with the [[Bay Miwok]] and [[Yokuts]] to the east.

During the California Mission Era, the Chochenyos moved en masse to the [[Mission San Francisco de As<U+00ED>s]] (founded in 1776) in San Francisco, and [[Mission San Jos<U+00E9> (California)|Mission San Jos<U+00E9>]] of Fremont (founded in 1797). Most moved into one of these missions and were baptized, lived and educated to be Catholic ''neophytes'', also known as [[Mission Indians]], until the missions were discontinued by the Mexican Government in 1834. Then the people found themselves landless.  A large majority of the Chochenyo died from disease in the missions and shortly thereafter, only a fragment remaining by 1900. The speech of the last two native speakers of Chochenyo was documented in the 1920s in the unpublished fieldnotes of the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] linguist [[John Peabody Harrington]].

Today, the Chochenyo have joined with the other San Francisco Bay Area Ohlone people under the name of the [[Ohlone#Present day|Muwekma Ohlone Tribe]]. As of 2007, Muwekma Ohlone were petitioning for U.S. federal recognition.<ref>{{Cite news
