The '''Maryland<U+2013>Virginia rivalry''' is the [[college football]] rivalry between the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and the [[University of Virginia]]. The Maryland Terrapins (also officially, "Terps") and the Virginia Cavaliers (colloquially, "Wahoos") first played in 1919 and the series has been uninterrupted since 1957. Maryland currently leads with an all-time record of 41<U+2013>30<U+2013>2. The two longest streaks in the series are held by Maryland (16 games, from 1972 to 87) and Virginia (9 games, from 1992 to 2000). Since [[Ralph Friedgen]] and [[Al Groh]] took over as head coaches in 2001, no school has won the series for more than two consecutive years.<ref>[http://football.stassen.com/ Stassen College Football Statistics], accessed 18 November 2008.</ref>

==Background==
Several factors contribute to this school rivalry. The two states and their eponymous flagship universities, share close historical and cultural ties. The schools are located in relatively close geographic proximity, separated by about 129 miles. Both institutions enjoy high academic standing, with each considered a [[Public Ivy]]. The two are both members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], with Maryland becoming a founding member in 1953 and Virginia joining less than a year later. When the conference re-organized in 2005, it saw fit to place Maryland and Virginia in separate divisions as cross-divisional rivals. This leaves open the possibility that the two teams may someday meet in the [[ACC Championship Game]] and play twice in the same season. The intensity of the rivalry is increased by a long history in the series of comeback victories, shutouts, and spoilers that prevented a conference title or bowl game.

[[Image:TerpsO.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Maryland lines up in an [[I formation]] against Virginia in 2008.]]It should be noted that, while designated as Maryland's cross-divisional rival by the ACC, Virginia has a far more vehement rivalry with [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], the [[Commonwealth Cup]]. Maryland, on the other hand, does not possess one sole arch-rival. The teams with which the Terrapins have or have had important rivalries all have more intense traditional opponents (e.g. [[Backyard Brawl|West Virginia has Pittsburgh]], [[Army-Navy Game|Navy has Army]]). Virginia head coach [[Al Groh]] stopped short of calling the game with Maryland a 'rivalry', but said that "it is a very important game to our team and it is our annual game. So that certainly designates it as being different from the other games."<ref>Eric Prisbell, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/terrapins-insider/2008/10/groh_on_acc_teleconference.html Groh on ACC Teleconference], Terrapins Insider, ''Washington Post'', 1 October 2008.</ref> Maryland head coach [[Ralph Friedgen]] conceded that "[Virginia has] Virginia Tech as an in-state rivalry, but I think we're their out-of-state rivalry."<ref>Jeff Barker, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/football/bal-sp.terpsfoot03oct03,0,2201024.story Even counting Virginia, Terrapins are unrivaled], ''Baltimore Sun'', 3 October 2008.</ref>

It is the most-played game in the Atlantic Coast Conference not involving a [[Tobacco Road]] team, after the Virginia<U+2013>Virginia Tech series. It has been played continuously longer than the Commonwealth Cup and is Virginia's fourth most-played game after the [[South's Oldest Rivalry (UNC-Virginia)|South's Oldest Rivalry]] against North Carolina (103 games), Virginia Military Institute (76 games), and Virginia Tech (89 games). It is Maryland's all-time most-played game.<ref>Jerry Ratcliffe, [http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/sports/cavalier_insider/ci_football/article/virginia_maryland_rivalry_one_of_accs_best/28666/ Virginia-Maryland rivalry one of ACC<U+2019>s best], ''Charlottesville Daily Progress'', 1 October 2008.</ref><ref>Jeff Barker, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/football/bal-sp.terpsfoot03oct03,0,2201024.story Even counting Virginia, Terrapins are unrivaled], ''Baltimore Sun'', 3 October 2008.</ref>

==Notable games==

===2007===
'''Virginia: 18, Maryland: 17'''

Reserve sophomore running back [[Mikell Simpson]] racked up 152 rushing yards as a 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds remaining, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown in a questionable call and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach [[Ralph Friedgen]] said "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." Simpson himself stated, "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [before] they hit it out." With the victory, the Wahoos reached seven wins in a row for the first time since 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272930120 Simpson's late TD caps all-around day in Virginia's comeback win], ESPN, 20 October 2007, accessed 15 November 2008.</ref> That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being [[2007 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]], [[2007 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team|Middle Tennessee]], [[2007 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]], and [[2007 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]].<ref>[http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/2007_d1_football_records_book8205c0e9-8be5-47e9-8f95-ebb50bf991fe.pdf Football Bowl Subdivision Records], National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2008, p. 111.</ref>

===2006===
'''Maryland: 28, Virginia: 26'''

After giving up 255 yards, the Terps trailed 20<U+2013>0 at halftime. Cavaliers punt returner Emmanuel Byers [[muffed punt|muffed]] a third-quarter punt to give Maryland possession on the Virginia one-yard line. [[Lance Ball]] rushed for a touchdown on the next play, and the Terps went on to score another 21 points in the final quarter to include a 56-yard breakaway by [[Keon Lattimore]] and a 45-yard [[interception#Interception returned for touchdown|pick-six]] by linebacker [[Erin Henderson]]. With 2:37 left on the clock, the Cavaliers responded with a 44-yard touchdown pass to [[Kevin Ogletree]], to pull to 28<U+2013>26. Virginia attempted a two-point conversion to send the game into overtime. Cornerback [[Josh Wilson (American football)|Josh Wilson]], who was scored on twice earlier, broke up the pass to clinch the win for the Terps.<ref>[http://umterps.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/101406aaa.html Maryland overcomes 20-point deficit for 28<U+2013>26 win at Virginia], University of Maryland Terrapins football official website, Associated Press, 14 October 2006, accessed 14 November 2008.</ref>

===2003===
'''Maryland: 27, Virginia: 17'''

With leading rusher [[Bruce Perry]] out due to a sprained ankle, Terps running back Josh Allen eagerly filled his shoes, and racked up 257 yards and two touchdowns. 'Hoos quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] threw for a touchdown and ran for another, but his second-half comeback attempt ultimately fell short. In the game, Schaub reached 186 career passing yards overtaking [[Shawn Moore]]'s school record. There was also some excitement even before the game started. Maryland assistant coach James Franklin and Virginia head coach [[Al Groh]] had a heated exchange after a Cavaliers player interrupted the Terps' warm up drills. Then, after Virginia won the coin toss, Al Groh infamously elected to kick off to start ''both'' halves. Immediately after the decision, the entire Maryland team rushed the field in celebration and was given a 15-yard [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty before the opening kickoff. The win kept the Terps' ACC title hopes alive, but Florida State narrowly beat N.C. State 50<U+2013>44 to win the conference outright. Maryland finished second-place in the ACC.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=233170120 Allen rushes for 257 yards, two TDs], ESPN, 13 November 2003.</ref><ref>Jeff Barker, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/football/bal-sp.terpsfoot03oct03,0,2201024.story Even counting Virginia, Terrapins are unrivaled], ''Baltimore Sun'', 3 October 2008.</ref>

===2002===
'''Virginia: 48, Maryland: 13'''

After Terps head coach Ralph Friedgen stated Maryland expected to "beat teams like Duke and Virginia", the Cavs sought vindication for the comparison to ACC football's perpetual underdog. While Maryland's [[Scott McBrien]] passed for a touchdown in the first series, Virginia went on to score 20 unanswered points in the second quarter with two Matt Schaub passes and a field goal. In the second half, the Wahoos delivered four more touchdowns: another Schaub pass, a pass by receiver [[Billy McMullen]], and two short rushing scores. The Terps only managed to use [[Nick Novak]] to make good two field goals. The loss broke Maryland's eight-game winning streak, and prevented them from sharing a piece of the ACC championship. Instead, Florida State finished with a better conference record (7<U+2013>1), and secured the title outright.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=223270258 Schaub throws three TDs, Lundy scores three in upset], ESPN, 23 November 2002, accessed 15 November 2008.</ref>

===1999===
'''Virginia: 34, Maryland: 30'''

After starting the season 5<U+2013>2, Maryland had suffered a devastating three-game losing streak before their finale at [[Scott Stadium]]. The Terps (5<U+2013>5) needed to beat the Wahoos to finish with a winning season and likely secure a berth in the [[Aloha Bowl]] or [[Oahu Bowl]]. At the end of the first quarter, Virginia led 17<U+2013>0. Maryland's freshman quarterback [[Latrez Harrison]] was pulled and replaced by former safety Randall Jones. Jones along with Heisman prospect running back [[LaMont Jordan]] led the Terps to tie it at 17<U+2013>17 before halftime. In the third quarter, Jordan ran 90 yards to bring it to 24<U+2013>17, but the Cavaliers equalized shortly thereafter. With 5:18 remaining, Terps kicker Brian Kopka made a field goal to bring it to 30<U+2013>27. In the next series, the Wahoos went for it on fourth down but a Dan Ellis pass was incomplete. The Terps took over on downs with 1:40 left on the clock. Victory seemed assured, but Maryland failed to convert a first down and the inexperienced Randall Jones ran out of bounds on third down, which stopped the clock when Virginia had no time-outs. The Wahoos got the ball on their own 24-yard line. In nine plays and just 46 seconds, Dan Ellis led a 76-yard drive that culminated with a touchdown pass to Billy McMullen to clinch the game with 26 seconds left. The 33<U+2013>30 final result evaporated the Terrapins' hopes for their first bowl game in nine years.<ref>David Ginsburg, [http://umterps.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112099aaa.html Cavs rally to knock off Terps, 34<U+2013>30], AP Sports, University of Maryland Terrapins official athletic website, 20 November 1999, accessed 16 November 2008.</ref>

===1990===
'''Maryland: 35, Virginia: 30'''

Besieged Maryland head coach [[Joe Krivak]], with a 17<U+2013>25 record, led his Terps (5<U+2013>5) to a sold-out Scott Stadium in Charlottesville for their final regular season game. [[George Welsh]]'s eighth-ranked Virginia (8<U+2013>1) had spent three weeks atop the AP poll at number-one until a loss against [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]]. At halftime, Maryland trailed 21<U+2013>7. Then freshman reserve running back Mark Mason put the Terps back in the game with a 59-yard touchdown breakaway, and a team best run for the year. Maryland quarterback [[Scott Zolak]] threw for two more touchdowns and Mason scored the go-ahead with an 8-yard rush to put the Terps ahead 35<U+2013>30. With the win, Maryland secured a bowl berth for the first time since [[Bobby Ross]] left four seasons prior.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD71331F93BA25752C1A966958260&scp=88&sq=maryland%20football&st=cse Virginia upset by Maryland 35-30], ''New York Times'', 18 November 1990, accessed 14 November 2008.</ref>  Virginia took a nose-dive in the AP rankings to 17th, and after another loss to Virginia Tech settled for the [[Sugar Bowl]] where they were edged by Tennessee, 23<U+2013>22.<ref>Bob Boyles and Paul Guido, ''50 Years of College Football: A Modern History of America's Most Colorful Sport'', pp. 1255, Skyhorse Publishing, 2007.</ref>

===1988===
'''Virginia: 24, Maryland: 23'''

In the final minutes of the game, with the Terps trailing the Wahoos 24<U+2013>17, Maryland quarterback [[Neil O'Donnell]] was injured and taken out of the game. He was replaced by a young second-stringer Scott Zolak. Zolak led a drive which culminated with a three-yard option run for a touchdown narrowing the deficit to a point. With 69 seconds remaining on the clock, Maryland attempted the two-point conversion. Zolak threw into the endzone to running back Ricky Johnson. Johnson appeared to catch the ball before being hit by defensive back Keith McMeans, knocking the ball loose. An official in the endzone immediately signaled for a catch, before others waved it as incomplete. After the game, the usually level-headed Terps head coach Joe Krivak ran to the official who made the initial call, following him to the locker room, and then ran over to yell at referee Don Safrit. Several witnesses claim that Krivak said to the officials that "If it takes every ounce of energy, I'm going to get you out of this league." Due to the loss, Maryland (5<U+2013>6) failed to achieve a winning season for the third year in a row. Virginia (7<U+2013>4) broke a 16-game losing streak in the series and ranked second in the conference. However, the Wahoos failed to secure a bowl game berth, while N.C. State with a worse record went on to the [[Peach Bowl]].

===1961===
'''Virginia: 28, Maryland: 16'''

[[Tom Nugent]]'s Terps entered their last season game boasting a 7<U+2013>2 record that included a win over a seventh-ranked [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] with [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Ernie Davis]] and the only victory over [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] in school history. They faced a Virginia team that started off their season by breaking a three-year, 28-game losing streak against [[William & Mary Tribe|William & Mary]]. The Wahoos had lost the last three meetings against Maryland by an average of 38 points. With a win against Virginia, the Terps would secure the ACC title and a trip to the [[Gator Bowl]]. After Maryland scored for an early lead, 'Hoos quarterback [[Gary Cuozzo]] tossed three short touchdown passes to third-string receiver John Hepler. Defensive back [[Ted Rzempoluch]] returned an interception 95 yards for a touchdown, and sealed the Terps' fate to go bowl-less. The other three-loss team in the ACC, Duke, won the conference.<ref>Mervin Hyman, [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1073283/index.htm Football's Week], ''Sports Illustrated'', 4 December 1961, accessed 14 November 2008.</ref>
