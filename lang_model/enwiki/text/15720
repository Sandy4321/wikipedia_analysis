'''Conference USA''', officially abbreviated '''C-USA''', is a [[list of college athletic conferences|college athletic conference]] whose member institutions are located within the [[Southern United States]]. The conference participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I in all sports. C-USA's offices are located in the [[Las Colinas]] business district of the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] suburb of [[Irving, Texas]].

C-USA was founded in 1995 by the merger of the [[Metro Conference]] and [[Great Midwest Conference]], two Division I conferences that did not sponsor football. To even out at 12 members (because [[University of Dayton|Dayton]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University|VCU]], and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] were left out of the merger<ref>[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950210/02100647.htm WITH EYE ON BIG EAST, TECH JOINS ATLANTIC 10 HOKIES REJECT THE COLONIAL, WHICH GRABS VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) the conference invited the [[University of Houston]], but UH could not start C-USA play for a year due to committing to being in the [[Southwest Conference]] in its final year. The conference immediately started competition in all sports, except football which started in 1996.

== Sports sponsored ==
Members participate in [[baseball]], men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's [[cross country running|cross country]], [[American football|football]], men's and women's [[golf]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] (women's), men's and women's [[soccer]], [[softball]], men's and women's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], men's and women's [[tennis]], men's and women's indoor and outdoor [[track and field]], and [[volleyball]].

In men's soccer, only six of the member schools participate &ndash; Marshall, Memphis, Southern Methodist, Tulsa, UAB, and UCF.  For this sport, the conference makeup consists of three other schools from other conferences &ndash; [[Florida International University|Florida International]] from the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the only two [[Southeastern Conference]] schools which sponsor the sport &ndash; [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina]] (which rejoined C-USA for the sport; it had been part of the Metro (the reunification of the Metro and Great Midwest in 1995 led to C-USA) in 1983-90 and 1993-94 for the sport) and [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] (which joined with its SEC mate in 2005).

[[Colorado College]], normally an NCAA Division III school in all sports except men's ice hockey, competes in women's soccer as a Division I school in C-USA.

The conference saw radical changes for the 2005<U+2013>06 academic year. The stage for these changes was set in 2003, when the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] successfully lured [[University of Miami|Miami]] and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] to make a move from the [[Big East Conference]] in 2004. [[Boston College]] would later make the same move, joining the ACC in 2005. In response to that series of moves, which depleted the Big East football conference, the Big East looked to Conference USA to attract replacements. Five C-USA members departed for the Big East, including three football-playing schools ([[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]], [[University of Louisville|Louisville]], and [[University of South Florida|USF]]) and two non-football schools ([[DePaul University|DePaul]] and [[Marquette University|Marquette]]). Another two schools ([[University of North Carolina at Charlotte|Charlotte]] and [[Saint Louis University|Saint Louis]]) left for the [[Atlantic Ten Conference|Atlantic 10]]; [[Texas Christian University|TCU]] joined the [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]]; and a ninth member, [[United States Military Academy|Army]], which was C-USA football-only, opted to become an independent in that sport again.

With the loss of these teams, C-USA lured six teams from other conferences: [[University of Central Florida|UCF]] and [[Marshall University|Marshall]] from the [[Mid-American Conference|MAC]], as well as [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]], [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]], and later [[University of Texas at El Paso|UTEP]] from the [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]]. Note that UCF played in the MAC for football only; for all other sports, it was a member of the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].

With C-USA's membership now consisting of 12 schools, all of which sponsor football, the conference has adopted a two-division alignment.

Notably, C-USA's membership includes the [[List of largest United States universities by undergraduate enrollment|largest university campus in the United States by undergraduate enrollment]] in UCF, and the two smallest schools in Division I FBS by undergraduate enrollment in Tulsa and Rice.

===Soccer-only members===

Because men's soccer is not sponsored by all NCAA Division I conferences, three schools from other conferences are C-USA members for men's soccer only: 

[[Sun Belt Conference]] Members

*[[Florida International University]] (FIU)

[[Southeastern Conference]] Members

*[[University of Kentucky]]
*[[University of South Carolina]]

NOTE:  South Carolina had remained in the Metro for men's soccer shortly after departing the conference for the SEC in 1991, and left after the 1994-95 season when they were not permitted to join the reunified Conference USA for the sport only.  The school was invited to rejoin the reunified conference in 2005, after which fellow SEC member Kentucky, the only other school that sponsors the sport, left the [[Mid-American Conference]] in that sport.

Additionally there is one women's soccer only member: [[Colorado College]], which sponsors women's soccer and men's ice hockey as Division 1 sports and participates in the Division 3 [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] in all other sports.

===Rowing-only members===

Because rowing is not sponsored by all NCAA Division I conferences, two schools from the [[Southeastern Conference]] are C-USA members for rowing only<ref>[http://conferenceusa.cstv.com/genrel/041210aaa.html Conference USA to Host Women's Rowing Championship in May]</ref><ref>[http://www2.kusports.com/news/2010/may/06/uncharted-waters-kansas-jumping-ship-join-c-usa/ Kansas rowing jumping ship to join C-USA]</ref>: 

[[Southeastern Conference]] Members:

*[[University of Alabama]]
*[[University of Tennessee]]

== Commissioners ==
*[[Michael Slive]] 1995-2002
*[[Britton Banowsky]] 2002<U+2013>present

== Television ==
In 2005, C-USA began a long-term television contract with [[CBS College Sports Network]] (then known as CSTV) to carry a variety of sports. The deal largely replaced the one it had with [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN Plus]], though some C-USA football and men's basketball games are still carried by the ESPN networks. The college basketball men's championship game can be seen on [[CBS Sports]].
Beginning in 2011-12, CBS College Sports will be joined by FSN for football and select men's & women's basketball games.  Some games, including the C-USA Football Championship game may be moved to Fox or FX.
