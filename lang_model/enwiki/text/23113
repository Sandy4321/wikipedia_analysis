'''Josef "Sepp" Wurmheller''' (4 May 1917 <U+2013> 22 June 1944) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[military aviation|military aviator]] during [[World War II]], a [[fighter ace]] credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down in over 300 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], with nine claims over the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Of his 93 aerial victories achieved over the [[Western Allies]], at least 18<U+2013>20 were [[Heavy bomber|four-engined bombers]] and 56 were against [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters.

Born in [[Hausham]], Wurmheller, who was a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] pilot in his youth, volunteered for military service in the ''Luftwaffe'' of the [[Third Reich]] in 1937. Following flight training he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53<U+2014>53rd Fighter Wing) in 1939. He claimed his first aerial victory on the Western Front on 30 September 1931, a phase of World War II dubbed the [[Phoney War]]. He then served as a flight instructor before returning to JG 53 for the [[Battle of Britain]]. In June 1941 he participated in [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 4 September 1941 after 32 aerial victories. Following another tour as fighter pilot instructor, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] "Richthofen" (JG 2<U+2014>2nd Fighter Wing) operating on the Channel Front. Wurmheller claimed seven aerial victories during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942 and after his 67th aerial victory he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 1 October 1942.

In April 1943, Wurmheller was appointed ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (squadron leader) of the 9. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933<U+2013>1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (9th squadron) of JG&nbsp;2 "Richthofen". On 8 June 1944, two days after the Western Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]], he was given command of the III. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd group) of JG&nbsp;2 "Richthofen". He and his wingman were killed in a [[mid-air collision]] during combat near [[Alen<U+00E7>on]], France on 22 June 1944. Wurmheller, who had been credited with 102 aerial victories, was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] on 24 October 1944.

==Early life and career==
Wurmheller was born on 4 May 1917 in [[Hausham]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], a state of the [[German Empire]]. He was the son of a [[miner]]. He grew up on his uncles' farm at [[Schliersee]] at then worked four years as a miner like his father. In his youth, he was also an enthousiasitic [[gliding|glider pilot]]. He volunteered for military service in the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' in 1937. Following training as a fighter pilot Wurmheller, who held the rank of ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (sergeant) at the time, was posted to the 2. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933<U+2013>1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (2nd squadron) of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] (JG 53<U+2014>53rd Fighter Wing) in 1939.<ref name="Stockert p184">Stockert 1997, p. 184.</ref><ref group="Note">For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933<U+2013>45)|Organisation of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].</ref>

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. On 30 September 1939, elements of I. ''[[Luftwaffe Organization#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (1st group) of JG 53 encountered a formation of five [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Fairey Battle]] single-engined bomber in the vicinity of [[Saarbr<U+00FC>cken]]. Wurmheller claimed his first victory during this encounter.<ref name="Stockert p184"/> His opponent was ''K9283'' of [[No. 150 Squadron RAF|No. 150 Squadron]] flown by [[Squadron Leader]] Macdonald which crash-landed at [[<U+00C9>cury-sur-Coole]].<ref>Air Pictorial 1989, vol. 51, p. 352.</ref><ref>Shores, Foreman & Ehrengardt 1992, p. 73.</ref> Wurmheller received the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{Lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse''}}) on 19 October 1939. He was posted to the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) at [[Werneuchen]] as an instructor in November 1939.<ref name="Stockert p184"/>

===Battle of Britain and Eastern Front===
Following his tour as an instructor at the fighter pilot school, Wurmheller returned to 5. ''Staffel'' of JG 53 in June 1940. In the [[Battle of Britain]], he flew combat missions as a fighter pilot and as a [[fighter bomber]] pilot. He claimed four further victories in this campaign and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{Lang|de|''Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse''}}) on 16 October 1940. Three times he was shot down himself by RAF fighters and had to [[parachute|bail out]]. The third time he was shot down in [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] E-4 (''Werknummer'' 5242<U+2014>factory number) at approximately 5:10 pm on 23 November 1940 over the [[English Channel]] and had to swin for four and a half hours before he was rescued by a ''[[Schnellboot]]'' (E-boat) of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (Navy).<ref>Prien 1997, p. 201.</ref> Hospitalized until March 1941, he returned to combat duty and claimed two [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s shot down on 7 May 1941, his 9th and 10th victory.<ref name="Stockert p184"/>

His unit was then transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War 2)|Eastern Front]] in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union which began on 22 June 1941. Here he was deployed in the southern sector of the German advance. He added nine victories in this theater of operations which included eight bombers and one [[Polikarpov I-16]] "Rata". His last on the Eastern Front, his 19th overall, was claimed on 15 July 1941.<ref name="Stockert p184"/>

===Channel Front===
[[File:JG 2.svg|thumb|right|upright|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2 "Richthofen" Emblem]]
Wurmheller was transferred back to the Channel Front on 20 July 1941. He was assigned to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'' (headquarters unit) of the II. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 2]] "Richthofen" (JG 2<U+2014>2nd Fighter Wing), named after the after [[World War I]] fighter ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]]. At the Channel Front, he claimed his 20th aerial victory on 24 July 1941. Over a period of four weeks he claimed 12 further victories, all over Spitfires, including five on one day, making him an "[[ace in a day]]".<ref name="Stockert p184"/>

On 30 August 1941 Wurmheller was awarded the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe]] ({{Lang|de|''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe''}}) and on 4 September he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes''}}) for 32 aerial victories. His former 5. ''Staffel'' of JG 53 had nominated him for Knight's Cross. The nomination however was not approved until he was assigned to JG&nbsp;2 "Richthofen".<ref name="Stockert p184"/> On the same day, his fellow II. ''Gruppe'' pilot ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Kurt B<U+00FC>hligen]] also received the Knight's Cross.<ref>Weal 2000, p. 80.</ref> At the time he flew a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#F-0, F-1, F-2|Bf 109 F-2]] from the airbase at [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|St Pol-Bryas]].<ref>Weal 1999, p. 10.</ref>

Following a minor injury, he was again posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon his return to front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to the 1. ''Staffel''. Wurmheller claimed 10 victories during May 1942 and further 12 victories the following month. Among these claims were four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942.<ref name="Stockert p185">Stockert 1997, p. 185.</ref> Most of these missions were flown with [[Rudolf Pflanz]] as his [[wingman]].<ref name="Obermaier p38">Obermaier 1986, p. 38.</ref>

His most successful day as a fighter pilot was during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942. On that day, the Allies unsuccessfully attacked the German-occupied port of [[Dieppe]]. Over 6,000 [[infantry]]men, predominantly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian [[Armoured fighting vehicle|Armored]] regiment and a strong force of [[Royal Marines]] and smaller RAF landing contingents. Wurmheller, whose right foot was plastered in an [[orthopedic cast]], during the course of four combat missions claimed seven victories that day, six Spitfires and a [[Bristol Blenheim]] bomber.<ref name="Stockert p185"/> The Blenheim most likely was a misidentified [[Martin Baltimore]].<ref>Weal 2000, p. 90.</ref> He had to abort his first mission due to engine trouble, suffering a minor concussion in the forced landing. He returned from his second mission claiming two Spitfires and a Blenheim shot down. His third mission resulted in the destruction of three further Spitfires, his 56th to 58th victories. Wurmheller claimed another Spitfire shout down on his fourth combat mission. The next day, on 20 August, he claimed his 60th aerial aerial victory which earned him the [[German Cross]] in Gold ({{Lang|de|''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold''}}), awarded on 21 August.<ref name="Stockert p185"/>

Wurmheller was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) for bravery in the face of the enemy on 1 October 1942. Following his 67th aerial victory, achieved in about 150 combat missions, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub''}}) on 14 November 1942. He was the 146th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored.<ref name="Stockert p185"/>

The [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), in particular the [[Eighth Air Force]], began regular combat by the [[VIII Bomber Command]] on 17 August 1942 attacking the [[Rouen]]-Sotteville [[marshalling yards]] in France. Wurmheller claimed four [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers shot down on 3 January 1943. On 1 April 1943 he was appointed ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (squadron leader) of 9. ''Staffel'' of JG 2 "Richthofen".<ref name="Stockert p186">Stockert 1997, p. 186.</ref> He thus succeeded ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) [[Siegfried Schnell]] in this command position who was transferred to III. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG 54<U+2014>54th Fighter Wing).<ref>Weal 1996, p. 47.</ref> He claimed his 70th victory on 17 May when he shot down a B-17 bomber.<ref name="Stockert p186"/>

On 23 September, he was wounded by bomb splinters while making an emergency landing in his [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-6]] during a bombing raid at [[Vannes]]-[[Meucon]].<ref>Weal 2000, p. 102.</ref> "Sepp", as he was named by his comrades, was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) on 1 August 1943 and to ''Hauptmann'' on 1 November 1943.<ref name="Stockert p186"/> Wurmheller claimed his first [[heavy bomber]] in [[Defense of the Reich]] on 8 February 1944 in the vicinity of [[Le Tr<U+00E9>port]].<ref>Weal 2011, p. 58.</ref> On 8 March 1944, he claimed his 90th victory.<ref name="Stockert p186"/>

===Group commander and death===
Wurmheller was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the III. ''Gruppe'' of JG 2 "Richthofen" on 8 June 1944. He succeeded ''Hauptmann'' [[Herbert Huppertz]] who was [[killed in action]] near [[Caen]] that day. Wurmheller claimed further aerial victories following the Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]] on 6 June 1944. Three victories claimed on 16 June 1944, his 100th to 102nd victory, were his last before he was killed six days later.<ref name="Stockert p186"/>

Wurmheller was killed in his [[List of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 variants#A-8|Fw 190 A-8]] (''Werknummer'' 171 053) on 22 June 1944 during aerial combat with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) Spitfire fighters near [[Alen<U+00E7>on]] when he collided with his wingman ''[[Feldwebel]]'' (Staff Sergeant) Kurt Franzke.<ref name="Florian Berger">Berger 2000, pp. 386, 387.</ref> He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''}}) and promoted to the rank of ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) on 24 October 1944, which was back-dated to 1 June 1944.<ref name="Obermaier p38"/> Wurmheller and Franzke were buried side by side at the War Cemetery Champigny-St. Andr<U+00E9>, near [[Saint-Andr<U+00E9>-de-l'Eure]], in plot 9, grave 1704 and 1705 respectively.<ref>Stockert 1997, p. 187.</ref>
