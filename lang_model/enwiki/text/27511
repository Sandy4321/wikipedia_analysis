'''SMS ''Kaiser Karl der Grosse''''' (His Majesty's Ship "[[Charlemagne|Karl the Great]]") was a German [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the {{sclass|Kaiser Friedrich III|battleship|4}}, built around the turn of the 20th Century for the German [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]].<ref group=Note>In German, the ship's name was rendered with an [[eszett]], as ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e''. Most English-language sources replace the eszett.</ref> ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was built in [[Hamburg]], at the [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm and Voss]] shipyard. She was laid down in September 1898, and completed in February 1902, at the cost of 20,385,000 [[German gold mark|Mark]]s. The ship was armed with four {{convert|24|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} guns in two twin [[gun turret]]s and had a top speed of {{convert|17.5|kn|lk=on}}.

''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' served with the active fleet until 1910, by which time the new "all-big-gun" [[dreadnought battleship]]s were entering service. As the ship was completely obsolete, she was withdrawn from active service and placed in the Reserve Fleet. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the ship was placed back in active duty as a [[coastal defense ship]], though by February 1915 she was again placed in reserve. ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' ended her career as a prison ship in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. Following the German defeat in November 1918, the ship was sold to ship-breakers and scrapped in 1920.

==Construction==
{{main|Kaiser Friedrich III class battleship}}
[[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the emperor of Germany, believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside of continental Europe. As a result, he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four {{sclass|Brandenburg|battleship|4}} ships. These were immediately followed by the five {{sclass|Kaiser Friedrich III|battleship|6}}s, of which ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was a member.<ref>Herwig, pp. 24&ndash;26</ref> The ship's keel was laid in 1898 at the [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm and Voss]] in [[Hamburg]] under construction number 136. She was ordered under the contract name "B" as a new ship of the fleet.<ref name=G15>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 15</ref> The new battleship was launched on 18 October 1899 and commissioned on 4 February 1902.<ref name=G16>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 16</ref>

The ship was {{convert|125.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.89|m|ftin|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|8.25|m|ftin|abbr=on}} aft. The vessel was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight cylindrical coal-fired boilers. ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e''{{'}}s powerplant was rated at {{convert|13000|ihp|lk=on}}, which generated a top speed of {{convert|17.5|kn}}.<ref name=G15/>

The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24&nbsp;cm (9.4&nbsp;in) SK L/40 guns in twin [[gun turret]]s,<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun quick firing, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 40 as times long as it is in diameter.</ref> one fore and one aft of the central [[superstructure]].<ref name=Hore>Hore, p. 67</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns and twelve 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six 45&nbsp;cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts.<ref name=G15/>

==Service history==
''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' joined the German fleet in February 1902.<ref name=G16/> On 31 August 1902, the fleet conducted the annual summer training maneuvers. ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was assigned to the "[[Opfor|hostile]]" force, as were several of her sister-ships. The "hostile" force was first tasked with preventing the "German" squadron from passing through the [[Great Belt]] in the Baltic. ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the [[Elbe River]], where the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]] and [[Hamburg]] could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days.<ref>''German Naval Manoeuvres'', pp. 91&ndash;96</ref>

In 1903, the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of battleships, was reorganized as the "Active Battle Fleet." ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' remained in the I Squadron along with her sisterships and the newest {{sclass|Wittelsbach|battleship|6}}s, while the older {{sclass|Brandenburg|battleship|4}} ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt.<ref name=H45>Herwig, p. 45</ref> 

In 1905 the fleet was rearranged; ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' and her sister {{SMS|Kaiser Wilhelm II}} remained in the I Squadron, while their sisters were moved to the II Squadron. The German Navy in 1905 consisted of four squadrons of three battleships each, with two squadrons per division. This was supported by a cruiser division, composed of two [[armored cruiser]]s and six [[protected cruiser]]s.<ref>''The British and German Fleets'', p. 335</ref> In September 1906, ''Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' and the rest of the fleet conducted major training maneuvers in the Baltic. During the exercises, the fleet traveled to [[Swinem<U+00FC>nde]] to conduct a goodwill operation with the British [[Channel Fleet]], which was anchored in the port at the time.<ref>''Germany'', p. 197</ref>

In 1908, the ship was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, along with three of her sister-ships.<ref>''Naval Notes: Germany'', p. 709</ref> The ships of her class were rebuilt between 1908 and 1910, though ''Kaiser Karl der Grosse'' did not receive this treatment.<ref name=G15/> However, in 1910, the new [[dreadnought battleship]]s were beginning to come into service with the fleet. Thoroughly obsolete compared to the new "all-big-gun" battleships, ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was then decommissioned and placed into reserve.<ref name=C141/> By 1914, the ship had been assigned to the V Squadron of the Reserve Fleet, alongside her four sisterships and the battleship {{SMS|Wettin||2}}.<ref>''European War Notes: Organization of the German Fleet'', p. 1564</ref>

===World War I===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' and her sisters were brought back to actice service and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. They were assigned to coastal defense in the Baltic, though they served in this capacity for a very short time. In February 1915, they were again withdrawn from service and placed in reserve.<ref name=C141>Gardiner & Gray, p. 141</ref> In 1916, ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was employed as a prison ship in Wilhelmshaven.<ref name=G16/> According to [[s:Treaty_of_Versailles/Part_V#Section_II._Naval_Clauses|Article 181]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the "{{sclass|Deutschland|battleship|5}} or [[Braunschweig class battleship|''Lothringen'']] types."<ref>See: [[s:Treaty_of_Versailles/Part_V#Section_II._Naval_Clauses|Treaty of Versailles]] Section II, Article 181</ref> On 6 December 1919, the ship was struck from the naval list and sold to ship-breakers. The following year, ''Kaiser Karl der Gro<U+00DF>e'' was broken up for scrap metal in [[R<U+00F6>nnebeck]].<ref name=G16/>
