'''Alfred Emanuel "Al" Smith''' ([[December 30]], [[1873]] &ndash; [[October 4]], [[1944]]) was [[List of Governors of New York|Governor of New York]], and Democratic [[United States presidential election, 1928|U.S. presidential candidate in 1928]]. He lost the election to [[Herbert Hoover]].  He was a prominent Catholic and a leading [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].

==Early life==
Smith was born to Alfred Emanuel Smith and Catherine Mulvihill and initially grew up in the multiethnic [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], on Oliver Street, [[New York City]]. His four grandparents were [[Irish-American|Irish]], [[German-American|German]], [[Italian-American|Italian]], and [[English American|English]], but Smith, a devout Catholic, identified with the [[Irish Catholic]] community and became its leading spokesman in the 1920s.  He was thirteen when his father Alfred, a Civil War veteran who owned a small trucking firm, died; at fourteen he had to drop out of parochial school, St. James School, to help support the family. He never attended high school or college, and claimed that he learned about people by studying them at the Fulton Fish Market, a job for which he was paid $12 per week to support his family. An accomplished amateur actor, he became a notable speaker.  On May 6, 1900, Alfred Smith married Catherine A. Dunn, with whom he had five children.<ref> Slayton 2001</ref>


==Political career==
In his political career, he emphasized his lowly beginnings, identified himself with immigrants, and campaigned as a man of the people.  Although indebted to the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]], particularly to its boss, [[Charles Francis Murphy | "Silent" Charlie Murphy]], he remained untarnished by corruption and worked for the passage of progressive legislation. <ref> Slayton 2001</ref>

Smith's first political job was as a clerk in the office of the ''Commissioner of Jurors'' in [[1895]]. In [[1903]] he was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]]. He served as vice chairman of the commission appointed to investigate factory conditions after a hundred workers died in the disastrous [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911. Smith crusaded against dangerous and unhealthy workplace conditions and championed corrective legislation. In [[1911]] the Democrats obtained a majority of seats in the state Assembly, and Smith became chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. In [[1912]] he became the majority leader, and in 1913 he was elected as Speaker of the Assembly.  By now he was a leader of the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]] in New York City and state.  His campaign manager and top aide was [[Belle Moskowitz]], daughter of Prussian-Jewish immigrants.<ref> Slayton 2001</ref>

After serving in the patronage-rich job of sheriff of [[New York County, New York|New York County]] beginning in 1915, Smith was elected governor of New York in 1918. In [[1919]] he gave the famous speech, "A man as low and mean as I can picture", making an irreparable break with [[William Randolph Hearst]].  Newspaperman Hearst was the leader of the left-wing of the Democratic party in the city, and had combined with Tammany Hall in electing the local administration; he had been attacking Smith for "starving children" by not reducing the cost of milk. 

Smith lost his bid for reelection in 1920, but was reelected as governor in 1922, 1924 and 1926.  As governor he became known nationally as a progressive who sought to make government more efficient and more effective in meeting social needs. His young assistant, [[Robert Moses]], constructed the nation's first state park system and reformed the civil service system; Smith later appointed him New York State Secretary of State. During his term New York strengthened laws governing workers' compensation, women's pensions, and child and women's labor with the help of [[Frances Perkins]], soon to be FDR's Labor Secretary, and ahead of many states.  In 1924 he unsuccessfully sought the [[U.S. presidential election, 1924|Democratic nomination for president]], advancing the cause of civil liberty by decrying [[lynching]] and racial violence. Roosevelt made the nominating speech in which he saluted Smith as "the Happy Warrior of the political battlefield."<ref> Slayton 2001</ref>

=== The 1928 election ===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1928}}
[[Image:AlSmithWaves.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Al Smith waves to crowds, 1928]]
The Republican Party was riding high on the economic boom of the [[1920s]], which their presidential candidate [[Herbert Hoover]] vowed to continue.  Historians agree that the prosperity made Hoover's election inevitable, although he had never run for office. He defeated Smith by a landslide in the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 election]].

Al Smith finally secured the Democratic presidential nomination in 1928.  He was the first Catholic to win a major-party presidential nomination.<ref>Hostetler, (1998). </ref>  (See also [[John F. Kennedy]], the first Catholic elected U.S. President.)  A major controversial issue was the continuation of [[Prohibition]]. Smith was personally in favor of relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws, despite its status as part of the nation's Constitution, but the Democratic Party split north and south on the issue. During the campaign Smith tried to duck the issue with noncommittal statements.<ref> Lichtman (1979)</ref>

Smith was an articulate exponent of good government and efficiency<U+2014> and so was Hoover.  But as Smith became known for saying in his campaign, "Let's look at the record."  Neither man was touched by corruption.  Smith swept the entire Catholic vote, which had been split in 1920 and 1924, and brought millions of Catholic ethnics to the polls for the first time, especially women.  He lost important Democratic constituencies in the rural north and in southern cities and suburbs.  He did carry the Deep South, thanks in part to his running mate, Senator [[Joseph Robinson]] of Arkansas. Part of Smith's losses can be attributed to fear that as president, Smith would answer to the Pope rather than to the Constitution, to fears of the power of New York City, to distaste for the long history of corruption associated with [[Tammany Hall]], and to Smith's own mediocre campaigning.   Smith's campaign theme song, "[[Sidewalks of New York (song)|The Sidewalks of New York]]", was not likely to appeal to rural folk, and his city accent on the "raddio" seemed a bit foreign.  Although Smith lost New York state, his ticket-mate [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] was elected to replace him as governor of New York.<ref> Slayton 2001; Lichtman (1979)</ref>
===Voter realignment===
In long-term perspective Al Smith started a voter realignment &mdash; a new coalition &mdash; based among ethnics and big cities that spelled the end of classless politics of the [[Fourth Party System]] and helped usher in the [[Fifth Party System]] or [[New Deal coalition]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref>Degler (1964)</ref>   As one political scientist explains, "The election of 1896 ushered in the Fourth Party System.... [but] not until 1928, with the nomination of Al Smith, a northeastern reformer, did Democrats make gains among the urban, blue-collar, and Catholic voters who were later to become core components of the New Deal coalition and break the pattern of minimal class polarization that had characterized the Fourth Party System."<ref>Lawrence (1996) p 34.</ref>

===Opposition to Roosevelt===
Smith felt slighted by Roosevelt during Roosevelt's governorship. They became rivals for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932 Democratic presidential nomination]], but Smith's old enemy Hearst used his influence to swing the nomination in favour of Roosevelt. After losing the nomination, Smith begrudgingly campaigned for Roosevelt in 1932. When President Roosevelt began pursuing the liberal policies of his [[New Deal]], Smith began to work with the opposition. Smith felt that Roosevelt's liberalism was a betrayal of good-government Progressive ideals, and ran counter to the goal of close cooperation with business.  Along with other prominent conservative Democrats, in 1934 he became a leader of the [[American Liberty League]], the focus of political opposition to Roosevelt's [[New Deal]]. Smith supported the Republican presidential candidates, [[Alfred M. Landon]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|the 1936 election]] and [[Wendell Willkie]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1940|the 1940 election]].<ref> Slayton 2001</ref>

==Civilian life==

After the 1928 election, he became the president of Empire State, Inc., the corporation which built and operated the [[Empire State Building]]. Smith cut the ribbon when the world's tallest skyscraper opened in May 1931, built in only 13 months.  As with the Brooklyn Bridge, which Smith witnessed being built from his Lower East Side boyhood home, the Empire State Building was a vision and an achievement constructed by combining the interests of all rather than being divided by interests of a few.  Smith, like most New York City businessmen, enthusiastically supported World War Two, but was not asked by Roosevelt to play any role in the war effort.<ref> Slayton 2001</ref>

Smith died on October 4, 1944, at the age of 70, broken-hearted over the death of his wife from cancer five months earlier. He is interred at [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York]].
