[[Image:Ericzeisl.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Zeisl]]'''Erich Zeisl''' ([[May 18]], [[1905]] <U+2013> [[February 18]], [[1959]]) was an [[Austria]]n composer.

==Life and music==
Born to a middle class family in [[Vienna]], Zeisl's musical precocity enabled him to gain a place at the Vienna State Academy (against the wishes of his family) at the age of 14, at which age his first song was published. He won a state prize for a setting of the [[Requiem mass]] in [[1934]], but his Jewish background made it difficult to obtain work and publication. After the [[Anschluss]] in [[1938]]  he fled, first to [[Paris]], where he began work on an opera based on [[Joseph Roth]]'s ''Job'', and then to [[New York]]. Eventually he went to [[Hollywood]] where he worked on film music but increasingly felt isolated and ill-at-ease with the production-line demands of his employers. Amongst the films for which he wrote music were ''[[Lassie Come Home]]'' ([[1943]]), ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' ([[1946]]) and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' ([[1951]]). He obtained success, (for which however he despised himself), with his music for a highly inaccurate stage show about the life of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]],'' Song without Words''.

Nonetheless he was able eventually to find academic appointments and time to compose in his own style. These works included a variety of [[chamber music]], a [[piano]] [[concerto]],  a concerto for [[cello]] (written for [[Gregor Piatigorsky]]) and a setting for choir, soloists and orchestra of [[Psalm]] 92 in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], which he entitled ''Requiem Ebraico'', written in 1944-5 in memory of his father. His opera ''Job'' was never completed.

Zeisl died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] whilst teaching in [[Los Angeles]].

Zeisl's style was essentially very conservative and he was perhaps rather better fitted for film music composition than he would have liked to believe. His status as a [[Degenerate music|proscribed musician]] under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime has led to a revival of interest in his music, some of which is now available on CD. Premiere performances of the ''Requiem Ebraico'' were held in [[Israel]] (under the baton of [[Zubin Mehta]]) and in [[London]] in [[2006]].
