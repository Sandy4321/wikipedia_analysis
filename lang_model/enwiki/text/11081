'''William IX''' ({{lang-oc|Guilh<U+00E8>m de Peitieus}}; {{lang-fr|Guillaume de Poitiers}}) (22 October 1071 <U+2013> 10 February 1126), called '''the Troubador''', was the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] and [[Duke of Gascony|Gascony]] and [[Count of Poitou]] (as '''William VII''') between 1086 and his death. He was also one of the leaders of the [[Crusade of 1101]]. Though his political and military achievements have a certain historical importance, he is best known as the earliest [[troubadour]]<ref>Joseph Anglade, ''Grammaire de l'ancien proven<U+00E7>al ou ancienne langue d'oc'', 1921, Part I, Chapter 1, p. 33: ''... les po<U+00E9>sies du premier troubadour, Guilhem de Poitiers ...'' ("the poems of the first troubadour, Guilhem de Poitiers").</ref> <U+2014> a [[vernacular]] [[lyric poet]] in the [[Occitan language]] <U+2014> whose work survived.

==Ducal career==
William was the son of [[William VIII of Aquitaine]] by his third wife, Hildegarde of Burgundy. His birth was a cause of great celebration at the Aquitanian court, but the Church at first considered him illegitimate because of his father's earlier divorces and his parents' [[consanguinity]]. This obliged his father to make a pilgrimage to [[Rome]] soon after his birth to seek [[Papal]] approval of his third marriage and the young William's legitimacy.

===Early career, 1088&ndash;1102===
William inherited the duchy at the age of fifteen upon the death of his father. In 1088, at the age of only sixteen, William married his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)|Ermengarde]], the daughter of [[Fulk IV of Anjou]]. She was reputedly beautiful and well-educated, but also suffered from severe mood-swings, vacillating between vivacity and sullenness. She was considered a nag, and had a habit of retiring in bad temper to a cloister after an argument, cutting off all contact with the outside world until suddenly making a reappearance at court as if her absence had never occurred. Such behaviour, coupled with her failure to conceive a child, led William to send her back to her father and have the marriage dissolved (1091). 

In 1094 he remarried to [[Philippa of Toulouse|Philippa]], the daughter and heiress of [[William IV of Toulouse]]. By Philippa, William had two sons and five daughters, including his eventual successor, [[William X of Aquitaine|William X]]. His second son, [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], eventually became the [[Prince of Antioch]] in the [[Holy Land]], and his daughter [[Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon|Agnes]] married firstly Aimery V of Thouars and then [[Ramiro II of Aragon]], reestablishing dynastic ties with that ruling house. 

William invited [[Pope Urban II]] to spend the [[Christmas]] of 1095 at his court. The pope urged him to "take the cross" (i.e. the [[First Crusade]]) and leave for the Holy Land, but William was more interested in exploiting the absence on Crusade of [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]], his wife's uncle, to press a claim to Toulouse.  He and Philippa did capture Toulouse in 1098, an act for which they were threatened with [[excommunication]].  Partly out of a desire to regain favor with the religious authorities and partly out of a wish to see the world, William joined the Crusade of 1101, an expedition inspired by the success of the First Crusade in 1099.  To finance it, he had to mortgage Toulouse back to [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]], the son of Raymond IV. 

The Duchess was an admirer of [[Robert of Arbrissel]] and persuaded William to grant him land in Northern Poitou to establish a religious community dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] <ref> {{cite book | title=Eleanor of Aquitaine, a Life | last=Weir | first=Alison | authorlink=Alison Weir | pages=11<U+2013>12 | year=1999 | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-345-40540-4 }}</ref>. This became [[Fontevraud Abbey]], which would enjoy the patronage of William's granddaughter [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and would remain important until its dissolvement during the [[French Revolution]]. 

William arrived in the Holy Land in 1101 and stayed there until the following year.  His record as a military leader is not very impressive.  He fought mostly skirmishes in [[Anatolia]] and was frequently defeated.  His recklessness led to his being ambushed on several occasions, with great losses to his own forces.  In September 1101, his entire army was destroyed by the [[Seljuk Turks]] at [[Heraclea Cybistra|Heraclea]]; William himself barely escaped, and, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]], he reached [[Antioch]] with only six surviving companions.

===Conflict with Church and wife, 1102&ndash;1118===
William, like his father and many magnates of the time, had a rocky relationship with the Church. He was excommunicated twice, the first time in 1114 for an alleged infringement of the Church's tax privileges. His response to this was to demand absolution from Peter, Bishop of Poitiers. As the bishop was at the point of pronouncing the [[anathema]], the duke threatened him with a sword, swearing to kill him if he did not pronounce absolution. Bishop Peter, surprised, pretended to comply, but when the duke, satisfied, released him, the bishop completed reading the anathema, before calmly presenting his neck and inviting the duke to strike. According to contemporaries, William hesitated a moment before sheathing his sword and replying, "I don't love you enough to send you to paradise." 

William was excommunicated a second time for "abducting" the Viscountess [[Dangereuse de Ch<U+00E2>tellerault|Dangereuse]] (''Dangerosa''), the wife of his vassal Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of [[Ch<U+00E2>tellerault]]. The lady, however, appears to have been a willing party in the matter. He installed her in the Maubergeonne tower of his castle in Poitiers (leading to her nickname ''La Maubergeonne''), and, as related by [[William of Malmesbury]], even painted a picture of her on his shield. 

Upon returning to Poitiers from Toulouse, Philippa was enraged to discover a rival woman living in her palace. She appealed to her friends at court and to the Church; however, no noble could assist her since William was their feudal overlord, and whilst the [[Papal legate]] Giraud (who was bald) complained to William and told him to return Dangereuse to her husband, William's only response was, "Curls will grow on your pate before I part with the Viscountess." Humiliated, Philippa chose in 1116 to retire to the Abbey of Fontevraud, where she was befriended, ironically, by Ermengarde of Anjou, William's first wife. While in residence she may have had direct conversations or correspondence with Countess Adela of Blois, who was in constant contact with Fontevrault from Marcigney abbey. Philippa did not remain there long, however: the abbey records state that she died on the 28 November 1118.

===Later career, 1118&ndash;1126===
Relations between the Duke and his elder son William also became strained&mdash;although it is unlikely that he ever embarked upon a seven-year revolt in order to avenge his mother's mistreatment, as [[Ralph of Diceto]] claimed, only to be captured by his father. Other records flatly contradict such a thing. Ralph claimed that the revolt began in 1113; but at that time, the young William was only thirteen and his father's liaison with Dangereuse had not yet begun. Father and son improved their relationship after the marriage of the younger William to Aenor of Ch<U+00E2>tellerault, Dangereuse's daughter by her husband, in 1121. 

William was readmitted to the Church around 1120, after making concessions to it. However, he was after 1118 faced with the return of his first wife, Ermengarde, who had, upon the death of Philippa, stormed down from Fontevrault to the Poitevin court, demanding to be reinstated as the Duchess of Aquitaine&mdash;presumably in an attempt to avenge the mistreated Philippa. In October 1119, she suddenly appeared at the [[Council of Reims]] being held by [[Pope Calixtus II]] and demanded that the Pope excommunicate William (again), oust Dangereuse from the ducal palace, and restore herself to her rightful place. The Pope "declined to accommodate her"; however, she continued to trouble William for several years afterwards, thereby encouraging him to join the [[Reconquista]] efforts underway in Spain. 

Between 1120 and 1123 William joined forces with the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n|Le<U+00F3>n]]. Aquitanian troops fought side by side with Castilians in an effort to take [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. During his sojourn in Spain, William was given a [[rock crystal vase]] by a Muslim ally that he later bequeathed to his granddaughter [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eleanor]]. The vase probably originated in [[Sassanid]] [[Persia]] in the seventh century. 

In 1122, William lost control of Toulouse, Philippa's dower land, to [[Alfonso Jordan]], the son and heir of Raymond IV, who had taken Toulouse after the death of William IV. He did not trouble to reclaim it. He died on 10 February 1126, aged 55, after suffering a short illness.

==Poetic career==
[[File:Vil<U+00E9>m9.jpg|thumb|right|William from a 13th-century [[chansonnier]].]]
William's greatest legacy to history was not as a warrior but as a troubadour <U+2014> a [[lyric poet]] employing the Romance vernacular language called Proven<U+00E7>al or Occitan.

He was the earliest troubadour whose work survives. Eleven of his songs survive (Merwin, 2002). The song traditionally numbered as the eighth (''Farai chansoneta nueva'') is of dubious attribution, since its style and language are significantly different (Pasero 1973, Bond 1982). Song 5 (''Farai un vers, pos mi sonelh'') has two significantly different versions in different manuscripts. The songs are attributed to him under his title as Count of Poitou (''lo coms de Peitieus''). The topics vary, treating sex, love, women, his own sexual and literary prowess, and feudal politics.

An anonymous 13th-century ''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vida]]'' of William remembers him thus:
{{Quote|text=The Count of Poitiers was one of the most courtly men in the world and one of the greatest deceivers of women. He was a fine knight at arms, liberal in his womanizing, and a fine composer and singer of songs. He traveled much through the world, seducing women.}}

It is possible, however, that at least in part it is not based on facts, but on literal interpretation of his songs, written in first person; in Song 5, for example, he describes how he deceived two women.

His frankness, wit and vivacity caused scandal and won admiration at the same time. He is among the first Romance vernacular poets of the [[Middle Ages]], one of the founders of a tradition that would culminate in [[Dante]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Villon]]. [[Ezra Pound]] mentions him in ''Canto VIII'':

<poem>
And Poictiers, you know, Guillaume Poictiers,
had brought the song up out of Spain
with the singers and viels...
</poem>

In ''Spirit of Romance'' Pound also calls William IX "the most 'modern' of the troubadours":

{{quote|For any of the later Proven<U+00E7>als, i.e., the high-brows, we have to... 'put ourselves into the Twelfth Century' etc. Guillaume, writing a century earlier, is just as much of our age as of his own.|Ezra Pound|''cited in Bond 1982, p. lxxvi''}}

William was a man who loved scandal and no doubt enjoyed shocking his audiences. In fact, William  granted large donations to the church, perhaps to regain the [[pope]]'s favour. He also added to the [[Palace of Poitiers|palace of the counts of Poitou]] (which had stood since the [[Merovingian]] era), later added to by his granddaughter [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and surviving in Poitiers as the Palace of Justice to this day.

One of William's poems, possibly written at the time of his first excommunication, since it implies his son was still a minor, is partly a musing on mortality: ''Pos de chantar m'es pres talenz'' (''Since I have the desire to sing,/I'll write a verse for which I'll grieve''). It concludes: 

<poem>
I have given up all I loved so much:
chivalry and pride;
and since it pleases God, I accept it all,
that He may keep me by Him.

I enjoin my friends, upon my death,
all to come and do me great honor,
since I have held joy and delight
far and near, and in my abode.

Thus I give up joy and delight,
and squirrel and grey and sable furs.
</poem>

[[Orderic Vitalis]] refers to William composing songs (c. 1102) upon his return from the [[Crusade of 1101]]. These might be the first "Crusade songs":<blockquote>Then the Poitevin duke many times related, with rhythmic verses and witty measures, the miseries of his captivity, before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies.<ref>Translation based on [[Marjorie Chibnall]], in Bond, p. 240.</ref></blockquote>
