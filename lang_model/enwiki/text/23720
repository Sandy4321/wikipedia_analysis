'''''X2''''', also known as '''''X2: X-Men United''''', '''''X-Men 2: X-Men United''''' and '''''X-Men 2''''', is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character]]s the [[X-Men]]. Directed by [[Bryan Singer]], it is the second film in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. It stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aaron Stanford]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[James Marsden]], [[Halle Berry]] and [[Kelly Hu]]. The plot, inspired by the [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'', pits the X-Men and their enemies, the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]], against the [[genocide|genocidal]] Colonel [[William Stryker]] ([[Brian Cox]]). He leads an assault on [[Professor X|Professor Xavier's]] school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]], in order to destroy every mutant on Earth.

Development phase for ''X2'' began shortly after ''X-Men''. [[David Hayter]] and [[Zak Penn]] wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris]] were eventually hired for rewrite work, changing characterizations of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]]. [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and the [[Danger Room]] were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November. Most of the filming took place at [[Vancouver Film Studios]], the largest soundstage in North America. [[Production designer]] [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] adapted similar designs of [[John Myhre]] from the previous film. ''X2'' was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 and became both a critical and financial success, earning eight nominations at the [[Saturn Awards]] and grossing approximately $407 million worldwide.

==Plot==
<!---This is sufficient detail for the article.  Haphazard additions compromise readability---->
[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], a [[Teleportation|teleporting]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], attempts to assassinate the [[President of the United States]] in the [[White House]], but he fails and escapes. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] reappears after discovering nothing at Alkali Lake, while [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey|Jean]] find Nightcrawler with the help of [[Professor Xavier]] and [[Cerebro]]. [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and the Professor visit [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in his plastic prison to see if he had any part in the attack on the president. Reading Magneto's mind, the Professor discovers that a covert government operative, [[William Stryker]], has been extracting information from Magneto. A trap is sprung and Cyclops and the Professor are captured by Stryker and his assistant [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama]]. A [[Raid (military)|military raid]] of the [[X-Mansion]] begins, with the soldiers sedating every student they find. Wolverine confronts Stryker, who fails to shed any light on his past.

Impersonating [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] and Yuriko, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] gains information about Magneto's prison and provides a means for him to escape. Wolverine, along with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], head to Iceman's (Bobby Drake's) parents' home in [[Boston]]. After a [[9-1-1]] call the police arrive just as the group is about to leave. The [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] arrives to pick them up and the X-Men team up with Magneto and Mystique. Magneto has learned Stryker orchestrated the attack on the president and has been experimenting on mutants, using a drug injected directly into the back of the neck to control them. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is located at Alkali Lake, inside the [[dam]] where he plans to kill the world's mutants by building a second Cerebro.

Through his son, Jason, Stryker gains control over the Professor. His son is able to project powerful visions in the mind, blinding a person to reality and through this the Professor is brainwashed  to use Cerebro to find and kill all mutants. Mystique is able to infiltrate Stryker's base by impersonating Wolverine; the X-Men enter and Storm and Nightcrawler search for the kidnapped students. Jean, Magneto, and Mystique are attacked by a brainwashed Cyclops while trying to rescue the Professor and in the process cause damage to the generators that keep the dam from collapsing. The force of Jean's [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] blast awakens Cyclops from his brainwashing and at the same time Wolverine finds Stryker in an [[adamantium]] smelting room along with [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Wolverine manages to defeat Deathstrike and then finds Stryker on a landing pad, where Stryker attempts to bargain Wolverine for his life with stories of his past. However, Wolverine refuses and returns to save his friends from the collapsing dam, leaving Stryker chained to the helicoptor.

While disguised as Stryker, Mystique uses Jason to convince the Professor to kill all humans and Magneto and Mystique use Stryker's helicopter to escape Alkali Lake, chaining Stryker to concrete rubble. Meanwhile, Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside of Cerebro where she creates a snowstorm to free the Professor from his telepathic illusion. The dam bursts but a malfunction aboard the X-Jet prevents it from taking off.  As the flood gets stronger, and Jean leaves the jet and creates a telekinetic wall in order to stop the wave and raises the jet above the flood waters. Jean activates the X-Jet's primary engines, before releasing the torrent of water down on herself.

The X-Men are able to supply the president with files from Stryker's private offices, and the Professor warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace or they will destroy each other through war. The film ends with a [[voiceover]] by Jean Grey on the process of evolution (a speech originally made by the Professor in the introduction of the first film). The camera floats over Alkali Lake, showing a vague shape of a [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] in the lake.

==Cast==
* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan/Wolverine]]: A mutant who lost all memory of his life before he was grafted with an indestructible [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] skeleton. Wolverine is a gruff loner, but is in love with Jean Grey and acts as a father figure to Rogue. He wields three blades that come out of each of his fists, has keen animal-like senses, the ability to heal rapidly from virtually any injury, and is a ruthless and aggressive fighter.
* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]: A powerful [[telepathic]] mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for "Gifted Youngsters", Xavier is a [[pacifist]] who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony. He uses the [[Cerebro]] device, designed by Magneto and himself, to track and locate mutants across the world. A natural genius, Xavier is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation.
* [[Sir Ian McKellen]] as [[Magneto (comics)|Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto]]: Once Xavier's ally, Magneto now believes mutants are superior to humans. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, as well as the power to create magnetic fields and fly. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's powers and all related telepathic powers. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information over Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering. The character's helmet was slightly redesigned as McKellen found wearing it uncomfortable in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591281/s Louise Mingenbach], United Colors of ''X2'', 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref>
* [[Famke Janssen]] as [[Jean Grey|Dr. Jean Grey]]: A teacher at Xavier's school and the X-Mansion's doctor, Jean has begun to experience a growth in her [[telepathy]] and [[telekinetic]] powers since the X-Men's battle with Magneto. She is in love with Cyclops, even though she is attracted to Wolverine.
* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe/Storm]]: An African mutant and teacher at Xavier's School who can manipulate the weather. Storm befriends Nightcrawler. Berry dropped out of [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s role in ''[[Gigli]]'' to reprise the role.<ref>{{cite news | author=Lew Irwin| url=http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2001-10-31#celeb4| title=Lopez Ousts Berry From ''Gigli''| publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=2001-10-31 | accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref>
* [[James Marsden]] as [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers/Cyclops]]: Jean's fiance, field leader of the X-Men, and a teacher at Xavier's Institute, he shoots uncontrollable beams of concussive force from his eyes and wears a visor to control them. Cyclops is taken prisoner by Stryker.
* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme/Mystique]]: Magneto's henchwoman, she is a [[shapeshifter]]. Mystique is blue, naked and covered in scales, and she acts as a spy. She injects a prison guard with metal, with which Magneto makes his escape, and also sexually tempts Wolverine. Romijn's makeup previously took nine hours to apply, however, the make-up department was able to bring it down to six hours for ''X2''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Rob Worley | title = Bryan Singer's Mutant Agenda | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2003-04-21 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2135 | accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>
* [[Anna Paquin]] as [[Rogue (comics)|Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue]]: A girl who can absorb any person's memories and abilities by touching them. As she cannot control this power, Rogue can easily kill anyone and thus is unable to be close to people.
* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake/Iceman]]: Rogue's boyfriend, he can freeze objects and create ice. His family is unaware that he is a mutant and simply believe he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he actually is, much to his brother's derision.
* [[Aaron Stanford]] as [[Pyro (comics)|John Allerdyce/Pyro]]: A friend of Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies and has the ability to control (although not create) fire. Magneto tells him that "You are a God amongst insects; never let anyone tell you different." The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were impressed with his performance in ''[[Tadpole (film)|Tadpole]]''.<ref name=writers/producers/>
* [[Brian Cox]] as [[William Stryker|Colonel William Stryker]]: A human military scientist who plans a worldwide [[genocide]] of mutants using Xavier and Cerebro. Stryker has experimented on mutants in the past, including Wolverine, and uses a serum to control them. Singer opted to cast Cox in the role as he was a fan of his performance as [[Hannibal Lector]] in ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]''.<ref name=singeraudio/>
* [[Alan Cumming]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler]]: A kindly German mutant with a strong [[Catholic]] faith, yet ironically he has the appearance of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. On his body are many tattoos, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but Cumming could not accept the part due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name=introducing/> [[Ethan Embry]] had been reported to be in contention for the role,<ref>{{cite news|author=Stax|title=Nightcrawler Cumming This Way|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-05-30|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/361/361096p1.html| accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> but the film labored in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part.<ref name=introducing/> Singer also felt comfortable in casting Cumming since he is fluent in the [[German language]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rob Worley|title=That's Why They Call It The Blues: Stamos and Cumming Talk ''X2''|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=2003-04-23|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2147|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> The drawings of [[Adam Kubert]] were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design,<ref name=Legacy/> which took four hours to apply.<ref name=X2/> For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours.<ref name=introducing>[[Alan Cumming]], Introducing the Incredible Nightcrawler, 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref> To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.<ref name=X2>{{cite news | author = Rob Worley | title = ''X-Men 2'' | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date=2002-10-30 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=comics2film&article=1475 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>
* [[Kelly Hu]] as [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama/Lady Deathstrike]]: A woman, has a healing ability like Wolverine, and is controlled by Stryker. She wields long adamantium fingernails. Only her first name is mentioned in dialogue.
* Michael Reid McKay as [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Stryker/Mutant 143]]: William Stryker's son. He was sent to Xavier's school in an attempt to "cure" his ability to create illusions. Returning home, Jason tortured his parents until his mother committed suicide. His father lobotomized him and uses a fluid from his brain to control mutants. Xavier's mind is too strong for the fluid, however, and Jason is instead used in order to manipulate him in Stryker's genocidal scheme.

Although the character of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] was killed in the first film, [[Bruce Davison]] reprised the role for scenes where Mystique uses his persona to infiltrate the government. In other [[cameo appearances|cameos]], [[Katie Stuart]] appeared as [[Kitty Pryde]], a girl who can walk through walls, Bryce Hodgson as [[Artie (comics)|Artie]], [[Kea Wong]] as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Shauna Kain]] as [[Siryn]], who is able to emit loud screams that alert the students to Stryker's attack. Also in the final scene with Xavier, a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket, as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue, played by [[Layke Anderson]]. These were confirmed to be [[Danielle Moonstar]] and [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]].<ref name=writers/producers>[[Michael Dougherty]], [[Dan Harris]], [[David Hayter]], [[Lauren Shuler Donner]], [[Ralph Winter (producer)|Ralph Winter]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref> [[Daniel Cudmore]] appeared as [[Colossus (comics)|Peter Rasputin / Colossus]]. Cudmore was set to use a [[Russian language|Russian accent]], but Singer dropped the idea for unknown reasons, and onset rewrites minimized the character's importance to a cameo.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tim Nydell|title=Interview with Daniel Cudmore|publisher=Rock Bottom|date=2006-07-28|url= http://www.hitrockbottom.org/danielcudmore.html|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

Jubilee, [[Psylocke]] and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] were to have cameos for the scene when Stryker and his troops storm the X-Mansion. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] were to have appearances during the Dark [[Cerebro]] sequence. Gambit's cameo was actually shot, but the footage was not used in the final cut. Beast's scene was to show Dr. Hank McCoy transforming into his notable blue fur while Marrow was to be seen lying on a ground in [[New York City]].<ref name=writers/producers/> [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris]], the film's writers, cameo in scenes of Wolverine's Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons.<ref>{{cite news | author = Heather Newgen |title = ''Superman Returns'' Screenwriters Dougherty and Harris  | publisher = [[Superhero Hype!]] | date = 2006-06-16 | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4393 | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}</ref> [[Shaquille O'Neal]] wanted a role in the film but was ignored by the filmmakers.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117851683.html?categoryid=2&cs=1 | title = Touchy topic addressed in upcoming pix | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2001-08-23 | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}</ref>

The financial and critical success of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' persuaded [[20th Century Fox]] to commission a sequel instantly.

[[Image:Danger room.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Concept art of the Danger Room before the setpiece was stored due to budgetary concerns]]

[[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris]] were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn's script in February 2002,<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin A.

Dr. Hank McCoy, however, can be seen on a television interview in one scene. Beast's appearance was to resemble [[Jim Lee]]'s 1991 artwork of the character in the series ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]''.<ref name=Legacy/> Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by [[William Stryker]], transforming into Archangel.<ref name=writers/producers/> A homage to Dougherty's and Harris' efforts of Angel remains in the form of an X-ray on display in one of Stryker's labs.<ref name=next/> [[Tyler Mane]] was to reprise as [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] before the character was deleted.<ref>{{cite news|author=KJB|title=Tyler Mane Not in ''Rollerball'' Just Yet|publisher=[[IGN]]|date= [[2000-08-10]]|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034623p1.html|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> In Hayter's script, the role eventually filled by [[Lady Deathstrike]] was Anne Reynolds, a character who appeared in ''God Loves, Man Kills'' as Stryker's personal assistant/assassin. Singer changed her to Deathstrike, citing a need for "another kick-ass mutant".<ref name=second/uncanny/> There was to be more development on [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Professor X]] being brainwashed by Stryker. The scenes were shot, but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications. Hayter was disappointed, feeling that [[James Marsden]] deserved more screentime.<ref name=writers/producers/>

Rewrites were commissioned once more, specifically to give [[Halle Berry]] more screentime. This was because of her recent popularity in ''[[Monster's Ball]]'', earning her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref>{{cite news | title = The ''X-Men 2'' panel | publisher = [[JoBlo]] | date = [[2002-07-30]] | url = http://www.joblo.com/sandiegocon2002/con12.htm | accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> A budget cut meant that the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]<ref name=next/> and the [[Danger Room]] were dropped. [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, "The control room [of the danger room] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up [in that control room] and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can't connect."<ref name=X2/> Dyas and sculptor James Jones merged several Sentinel designs into a final maquette of an almost hollow robot who could compress into a disk shape. Animating the Sentinel would have cost $7 million.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Jones|title=Realized Art|url=http://www.realized-art.com/|accessdate=2008-11-18}} Click "Portfolio" and then "Movies" to find the Sentinel maquette.</ref>

Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and Singer credited ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' as a visual influence. Though Sigel filmed ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' in the [[anamorphic format|anamorphic]] 2.40:1 format, he opted to shoot ''X2'' in [[Super 35]]mm 2.35:1. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, "If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it.

[[Visual effects supervisor]] Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film, despite the fact it nearly received an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Academy Award nomination]]. Up to 520 shots were created for ''X-Men'', while ''X2'' commissioned roughly 800. A new [[computer program]] was created by [[Rhythm and Hues]] for the [[dogfight]] [[tornado]] scene. [[Cinesite]] was in charge of scenes concerning [[Cerebro]], enlisting a 20-man crew.

==Reception==
===Release===
The first cut of ''X2'' was [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|rated R]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to more violent scenes concerning [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] when Stryker's army stormed the [[X-Mansion]]. Very few seconds were cut to secure a PG-13 rating.<ref>{{cite news | author = Rob Worley | title = ''X''-Producers: Lauren Shulder-Donner and Ralph Winter Talk About ''X2'' | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-04-28]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2181 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>

''X2'' opened in America on May 2, 2003, accumulating $85,558,731 in its opening weekend in 3,749 theaters. The film grossed $214,949,694 in North America, while earning $192,761,855 worldwide, coming at a total of $407,711,549. ''X2'' was a financial success since it recouped its production budget three times.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|title=X2: X-Men United (2003) |publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=x2.htm |accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> ''X2'' debuted simultaneously in ninety-three countries, the largest North American and international opening ever at the time.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Linder|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/400/400483p1.html|title= This Weekend at the Movies: ''X2'' Debuts|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2003-05-02]]|accessdate= 2008-03-09}}</ref> In addition, the film is the fifth highest grossing [[List of films based on Marvel Comics|film based on a Marvel Comic book]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel Comics Movies| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url= http://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=marvelcomics.htm|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> and was the sixth highest of 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=2003 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2003&p=.htm|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> also earning $107 million in its first five days of DVD release.<ref name=update/>

''X2'' had a video game tie-in on ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'', which has nothing to do with the events of the film, although [[Patrick Stewart]] voiced [[Professor X]]. ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' bridges the storyline between ''X2'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Specifically, it explains [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s absence from ''The Last Stand''. [[Chris Claremont]] wrote a [[novelization]] of the film, which left out its secretive cliffhanger.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Chris Claremont]] | title = X-Men 2 | publisher = [[Del Ray Books]] | month = March | year = 2003 | pages = 416 | url = http://www.randomhouse.com/delrey/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345461964 | isbn = 978-0-345-46196-4}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote the storyline did not live up to its potential and was critical of plot holes. He was impressed, however, by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film. In addition, Ebert wrote that the film's closing was perfect for a future installment, giving ''X2'' three out of four stars.<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Roger Ebert]]|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030502/REVIEWS/305020306/1023 | title=X2: X-Men United | publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=[[2003-05-02]]|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than [[X-Men (film)|its predecessor]].
