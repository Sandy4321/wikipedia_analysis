==Gameplay==

[[Gameplay]] consists of text-based scenarios presented to the player through the narration of the main character, Serge. As the narrative progresses, the game presents a list of possible actions and the player must choose his or her course. Depending on the choices made, the player may enter a new area, be presented with a new situation or character, or have to choose again if the previous selection was incorrect.<ref name="hotud" /> In combat with enemies, the player must select from options such as "Fight", "Magic", "Run", and often more complex situational commands like "Run my knife into the [[goblin]]'s chest!" or "Quickly slash at its hand!".<ref name="combatchoices">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': Not a single moment after I leap back, the iron ball smashes into the stone floor! I can't rely on this little knife to parry those huge morning stars. There's no way I'll survive, fighting like that! / Run my knife into the goblin's chest! / Quickly slash at its hand!}}</ref> Some decisions must be made before an invisible timer runs out; in combat, hesitation results in injury or death. Serge's health is tracked by an invisible point count, restored by various events (such as finding a potion). The game also tracks Kid's affection for Serge, influenced by battles and scripted events.<ref name="lovepointsystem">{{cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Radical Dreamers Love / Point System | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Radical_Dreamers_Love_/_Point_System.html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=25 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref> Her feelings determine whether Serge survives the story's climactic fight. 

''Radical Dreamers'' features minimal graphics and animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and sounds. Like other ''Chrono'' games, ''Radical Dreamers'' contains a variant of [[New Game Plus|New Game +]] mode. Only one scenario is available on the first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to ''Chrono Trigger''.<ref name="easteregg" />

==Characters and story==
''Radical Dreamers'' features three protagonists<U+2014>Serge, Kid, and Gil<U+2014>who seek out treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance three years ago in a remote town.<ref name="serge-intro">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': It's been something like three years since Kid and I met. Back then I was a drifter, wandering wherever my music led me. During my stay in the remote town of Regiorra, I ended up running into a girl who later joined me, leading to the beginning of all this.}}</ref> Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude.<ref name="serge-intro2">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': I take a good look at myself and wonder if I've got any of that adventurer's spirit still left in me. I sit and look at my trusty knife collecting dust on the mantle above my fireplace, and think to myself, my days of traveling can't be over just yet. That old, familiar feeling of wonderment ensnares me as I vow to pack my bags tomorrow and set out for some new, exotic land, letting fate once again guide me wherever it wishes.}}</ref> Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior.<ref name="kid-intro">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': Not even seventeen years old, already she's widely renowned as a top professional. To make matters worse, she's cute, devilishly stylish, and has a sparkling  personality. And boy, can she cook... if you ask her, that is. Well, to be completely honest, she has her share of problems as well. She likes to think of herself as a kind of Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but that's just not the case.}}</ref> Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of [[Robin Hood]]. Gil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will.<ref name="magus-intro">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': The top half of his face is covered with a mask at all times. I've never even seen what he really looks like. At times, it seems as though I'm hanging around someone from another world<U+2014>traveling with this pack is definitely an interesting experience. Kid's quiet about her past too, but it's like I know her entire life story compared to how little I know about Magil.}}</ref> Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Gil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group.<ref name="gilslooks">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': This is the first time I've ever seen his true face. Even for a guy like me, I'm taken aback by his looks. His hair sways in the moonlight, as his piercing blue eyes survey the environment below. His beauty is different than a woman's... there's some sort of a fierce, intrepid quality about him.}}</ref> They seek the [[Lavos#Frozen Flame|Frozen Flame]], a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish.<ref name="flamedescription">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Serge''': Tonight, our goal is Lord Lynx's most prized possession, a scarlet jewel known as the Frozen Flame. Besides being priceless, some say this beautiful stone harbors some sort of mystical power. They say many people have sought after the Flame, but none have been victorious in stealing it. Viper Manor has claimed many lives...}}</ref> It is hidden in Viper Manor<U+2014>the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]], who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.<ref name="acacians">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Magil''': The Acacia Dragoons. They were once an elite force serving General Viper, a powerful man who used to rule the western territory of Gerzbuehle. They were defeated more than ten years ago, by the very hands of Lord Lynx. By the looks of things, we have apparently found their resting place.}}</ref>

[[Image:Radical Dreamers Frozen Flame.png|thumb|left|220px|The party confronts Lynx near the Frozen Flame]]
Following Kid, the group infiltrates Viper Manor on the night of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while unraveling the history of the manor and its occupants. Gil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as [[Lavos]], splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core.<ref name="frozenflamefragment">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Magil''': The Frozen Flame is more than just an object. It's not of this world. It descended from the heavens long ago, part of a huge meteorite. Once, there lived a people who sought to harness its power, hoping to tap into their yet unknown potential. And so, it became a treasure of great importance and dreams.}}</ref> The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the [[Kingdom of Zeal]]<U+2014>an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality.<ref name="zeal">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English | quote='''Magus:''' Behold.

But I was another person then. ... / '''Magus:''' Unimaginable is the power of Lavos. Anyone who dares to oppose...it...meets certain doom.}}</ref> Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, [[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]]. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Gil, who accompanied her thereafter.

The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains the upper hand after trapping Gil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca<U+2014>a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger.<ref name="time-egg">{{cite video game | title=Radical Dreamers | developer=[[Square Co.]] | publisher=Demiforce (fan translation) | date=2005 | platform =[[Satellaview]] | language=English |quote='''Lynx''': Surely you remember, the one you received from your sister, all those years ago... the priceless keepsake you carry with you dearly, even now...The Chrono Trigger!}}</ref> With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess [[Schala]] of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power.<ref name="coercion">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System | language=English | quote='''QUEEN:''' Schala, raise the power of the Mammon Machine to its limit! / '''SCHALA:''' ...... / '''QUEEN:''' Schala! You dare to disobey me?! / SCHALA: All right, mother...}}</ref> As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt for her role in the incident.

Running from her past and fearing her future, she wanted nothing more than to be swallowed up in the surging waves of the vortex of time...Hating what she'd done, refusing what she'd said or heard, to simply continue living was her curse. But the stone, It had other plans for her...Turning back the hands of her clock, scattering her memories, she was granted another chance.

==Music==

The music of ''Radical Dreamers'' was written by [[composer]] [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], the artist who scored ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.<ref name="crossost" /> The soundtrack includes several ambient pieces, including the sound of water running in a fountain and wind accompanied by strings. Players can listen to the game's songs by accessing a hidden menu in the ''Gil: Caught Between Love and Adventure'' scenario.<ref name="eastereggmenu">{{cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Easter Eggs (Radical Dreamers) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Easter_Eggs_%28Radical_Dreamers%29.html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=25 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref> The tracks include:

==Development==

Masato Kato wrote ''Radical Dreamers'' after ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, feeling that ''Trigger'' concluded with "unfinished business".<ref name="ultimania">{{cite book | date=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Ultimania_Developer_Interviews.html | pages=476<U+2013>477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-925075-73-X}}</ref> He composed the main story and drafted the concepts for the sub-scenarios, leaving them to be completed by his peers.<ref name="easteregg" /> He allowed Makoto Shimamoto to write the entire ''Kid and the Sunflower'' segment, later joking that he "avoided having any part in that episode."<ref name="easteregg" /> Kato remarked that his "savage feelings" from ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hectic development manifested in Kid's "unusually nihilistic attitude".<ref name="easteregg" /> He explained his approach towards the project in 1999:

{{cquote2|...due to the fact that this was a text-based game, the contents of the game ended up being rather serious and emotional. The game itself was a real life-or-death kind of survival adventure game. I think there was a feeling somewhere deep in my heart that said, 'I wanna try making a horror game!' But soon after that, they came out with Biohazard, so I quickly got over that phase (laughs). 

...the comical sub-scenarios were written to be extremely comical beyond any measurement, so I think it sorta' balances out...But I can say that since this game wasn't expected to be widely sold on the market, and also since there wasn't any profit on our part, there was a feeling that I wanted to make this game out of my sole interest. In a way, I think that 'Radical' helped me to find my own path...But then again, I guess you could say that I strayed away from the paths of normal people.<ref name="easteregg" />}}

Kato's team completed ''Radical Dreamers'' in only three months under a rushed production schedule, prompting him to label the game "unfinished" in an interview for the ''[[Ultimania]]'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' guide.<ref name="ultimania"/> He regretted that the schedule hampered the quality of his work, and explained that the connections to ''Chrono Trigger'' were evoked towards the end of the project:

{{cquote2|When I originally started working on Radical Dreamers, I never thought that it would have such an ending. We only had three months for development, and I was just making up the story while inputting data. When I finally realized the connection of the identities of Kid and Magil near the final stage of development, I even amazed myself, saying, 'So, that's who they were!?' (laughs) Also, since there were issues with the media, the connections between Radical Dreamers and Chrono Trigger were intentionally left blurred in the background so that it'd only be recognizable by those who would understand.<ref name="ultimania"/>}}

==Fan translation and notability==

In April 2003, the [[ROM hacking]] group Demiforce released a [[Fan translation of video games|fan translation]] rendering ''Radical Dreamers'' in English.<ref name="hotud" /> The patch works by modifying the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] image of ''Dreamers'' used for playing console-based video games on personal computers through [[emulator|emulation]]. The ability to save games was not enabled with the first patch, and some minor typos were left in, later remedied by successive releases.<ref name="fantranslation" /> On [[Christmas Day]] 2005, Demiforce and Radical R released the final version (1.4) of the translation, which fixed remaining minor bugs.<ref name="final-patch">{{cite web | date=2006 | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Patches (Radical Dreamers) | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Patches_(Radical_Dreamers).html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=2 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The French team Terminus Traduction made a French translation patch soon after.<ref name="french-translation">{{cite web | date=2004-09-06 | author=Terminus Traduction | title=French Translation | url=http://terminus.romhack.net/index.php?page=jv&projet=radical | work=[http://terminus.romhack.net/ Terminus Traduction] | accessdate=2 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

A reviewer for [[Home of the Underdogs]] lauded the game's excellent writing and the "superb" English translation patch, noting that the "interesting plot" would appeal to fantasy fans if they could stomach the limited interactivity.<ref name="hotud" /> Having never played a ''[[Chrono series]]'' game prior, the reviewer stated, "I was still able to follow the story and be drawn into the world of colorful characters."<ref name="hotud" /> While praising the [[replay value]] afforded by the extra scenarios, the critic derided the random battles of ''Radical Dreamers'', writing that "RPG-style random combat doesn't translate well to [a] text-only medium."<ref name="hotud" /> The website awarded ''Dreamers'' "Top Dog" status, and the game maintains a voter score of 8.95 out of 10.<ref name="hotud" />

''Radical Dreamers'' preceded ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', a full [[console role-playing game|role-playing game]] sequel to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''. Masato Kato cited the desire to "redo ''Radical Dreamers'' properly" as the genesis of ''Cross'', attributing the latter's serious atmosphere to the influence of ''Dreamers''.<Ref name="radicaldreamers" /><Ref name="easteregg" /> ''Chrono Cross'' borrowed certain thematic elements, story points, characters, music, and objects introduced in ''Radical Dreamers''<U+2014>including the infiltration of Viper Manor, the Frozen Flame, the name ''Radical Dreamers'' for Kid's thievery, and the characters of Kid, Lynx, and Serge (who became a [[silent protagonist]]).<ref name="ccc1">{{cite web | author=Chrono Compendium staff | title=Serge | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Serge.html | work=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/ Chrono Compendium] | accessdate=17 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref><ref name="gamespotrd">{{cite web | date=1999-07-20 | author=Yukiyoshi Ike Sato | title=Radical Dreamers - The Real Chrono Trigger 2? | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/chronocross/news.html?sid=2450838 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot] | accessdate=17 January | accessyear=2008}}</ref> Though these characters and items were not presented in the same context, their general traits survived the transition.<ref name="gameprointerview" /> Gil, confirmed by Kato to be [[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]], was also going to be featured in ''Chrono Cross''. This idea was scrapped due to difficulties in representing the story of Magus among the game's numerous other characters; the unrelated, enigmatic magician Guile was created instead.<ref name="gameprointerview" /> Since the release of ''Chrono Cross'', ''Radical Dreamers'' is no longer part of the official continuity of the ''Chrono series''.<ref name="radicalcontinuity" /> ''Chrono Cross'' addressed this through an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] hinting that ''Radical Dreamers'' took place in a different [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimension]].
