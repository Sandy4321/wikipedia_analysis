'''''Hellraiser''''' is a [[1987 in film|1987]] [[Great Britain|British]] [[horror film]] exploring the themes of [[sadomasochism]], pain as a source of pleasure, and morality under duress and fear. It is based on the critically acclaimed novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]'' by [[Clive Barker]], who also wrote the screenplay and directed the film. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the film was titled ''Clive Barker's Hellraiser''. It is the first film in the ''[[Hellraiser (film series)|Hellraiser]]'' series, having spawned seven sequels as of [[2006]].  This movie was number 19 on the cable channel Bravo's list of the "100 Scariest Movie Moments".

==Summary==
{{plot}}
{{spoiler}}

''Hellraiser'' stars Sean Chapman as Frank Cotton, [[Andrew Robinson]] as Larry Cotton, Clare Higgins as Julia Cotton, and [[Ashley Laurence]] as Kirsty Cotton. It also introduces an unnamed character dubbed [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] by fans, as his head is etched out in a grid of incisions with large pins inserted at the intersections. He is the lead [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobite]], played by [[Doug Bradley]]. The Cenobites are presented as distorted humanoid beings, "explorers of the further regions of experience; demons to some, angels to others," from a dimension where death can be suspended indefinitely. Their existence is an eternal exploration of all that the body and mind can experience. Their world is a realm of endless sensuous experience, though this takes the form of endless experiments in pleasure and pain without the possibility of death as a release. Of the Cenobites' mission, Pinhead famously says, "We will tear your soul apart".

The beginning of the film revolves around a legendary antique [[puzzle box]] (otherwise known as the Lament Configuration) rumored to be the key to a mystical realm of unimaginable sensual pleasure.  The gilded box is in fact a gateway to the Cenobites' world. When the puzzle is solved it summons the Cenobites, who seize the opener of the box and remove him to their realm of endless experience.

Frank Cotton, an impulsive and violent man who, having become weary of the various earthly pleasures, searches for the legendary box, which he hopes can lead him to sadistic pleasure beyond what life can provide. He realizes too late that the Cenobites' idea of sensuality may not be perfectly aligned with his, as he is condemned to an eternity of torture. His body is ultimately reduced to a flesh and blood residue in the attic floorboards of his parent's house.

Some time after Frank's disappearance, his brother Larry and family move into the old abandoned house, and a drop of blood from a relatively minor 
accident causes Frank's body to begin regenerating from the residue in the floor boards. His heart reforms and begins beating, and the bone and organs of his body return, but he lacks skin and flesh. Julia, who was
his lover while engaged to the mild-mannered Larry, succumbs to 
Frank's entreaties, and agrees to help him. A large portion of the plot focuses on the moral tensions resulting from Frank using his previous relationship with Julia to persuade her to commit murder for his rejuvenation. She begins seducing men, luring them up back to her house and up to the empty attic room where Frank hides, and kills them, providing the blood needed for his body to regenerate and his spirit to escape from the Cenobites. Frank consumes their bodies, regenerating more of his own flesh each time. Kirsty learns of the grisly scheme, but is too late to save her father, whose skin Frank steals and wears. Kirsty recovers the puzzle box and accidentally solves it, summoning the Cenobites. She begs them to spare her, and offers to lead them to Frank in exchange for her freedom. Pinhead is eager to recapture the one who has escaped them, and tepidly agrees. Kirsty entices Frank into stabbing Julia -- and manages to deliver Frank to the Cenobites. As the hundreds of hooks from the torture devices tear his skin once more, Frank dryly remarks, "[[Jesus wept]]." 

Still unsated, the Cenobites seek to take Kirsty as well, despite
their deal with her. But Kirsty solves the box again, and uses it to return the Cenobites to hell. She then attempts to burn the box, but it is taken from the fire by a mysterious flying skeletal figure that disappears into the night. In the next scene, the box is shown in the hands of the merchant (who originally sold it to Frank), asking a prospective customer, "What's your pleasure?".

==Soundtrack==

Clive Barker originally commissioned a soundtrack for ''Hellraiser'' 
from the [[industrial music|industrial]] band [[Coil (band)|Coil]]. 
But the music they supplied was rejected, and [[Christopher Young]] provided a more traditional orchestral score for the finished movie. Coil's score, which was apparently described by Barker in a complimentary manner as being "bowel churning",<ref>http://undergroundmusiclibrary.blogspot.com/2005/11/coil-interview.html</ref> has been released in isolation as [[The Unreleased Themes For Hellraiser]] and as part of the compilation ''Unnatural History II'' (CD) (1995).

Christopher Young went on to contribute the soundtrack to the first sequel, ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'', for which he won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]]. Subsequent movies in the series used music by different composers.

The Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] recorded a cover version of Young's score (along with sample quotes from the film) and released it on their [[EP]] ''[[Hollowman]]''.
