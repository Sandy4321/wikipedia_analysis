==Career==

===Manchester United===
Born in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]], Chester began his career with his local club, Winwick Athletic, where, at the age of five, he was already playing in the club's Under-9s team. At the age of eight, he joined Manchester United, and signed a trainee contract at the age of 16 in July 2005. He went straight into the club's under-18 team, making 17 appearances in the 2005<U+2013>06 season. He also got his first taste of reserve team football on 21 February 2006, when he was named as an unused substitute for a 4<U+2013>1 away win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He continued in the under-18 side in 2006<U+2013>07, and scored his first goal in a Manchester United shirt on 9 December 2006, scoring the opening goal in a 3<U+2013>1 away defeat by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He made his debut for the reserve team on 15 February 2007, helping to hold [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] to a goalless draw. At the end of the season, he played in the teams for both the FA Youth Cup and Manchester Senior Cup finals. However, the teams lost both finals, losing to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on penalties in the former and to Manchester City in the latter.

In 2007<U+2013>08, Chester cemented his place as a regular in the reserve team, making 24 appearances in all competitions as the team won both the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] and the [[Lancashire Senior Cup]], and finished in third place in the [[Premier Reserve League]] North. His consistent performances and on-field leadership earned him the reserve team captaincy for 2008<U+2013>09. At the start of the season, he was given a first team squad number&nbsp;<U+2013> 39. After being named as a substitute for the first team's 1<U+2013>0 win over Bolton Wanderers on 17 January 2009,<ref>{{cite news |first=Nabil |last=Hassan |title=Bolton 0<U+2013>1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7815605.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 January 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> Chester was again selected as a substitute for the [[Football League Cup 2008<U+2013>09|League Cup]] semi-final second leg against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].

Although Derby pulled two goals back, United ended up winning the match 4<U+2013>2, meaning that they won the tie 4<U+2013>3 on aggregate and qualified for the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 League Cup Final]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Man Utd 4<U+2013>2 Derby (4<U+2013>3 agg) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7824155.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref>
