The '''Griffon Lionheart''' is an [[United States|American]] single-engined, six-seat [[biplane]] designed and produced in kit form for [[Homebuilt aircraft|home building]] by [[Griffon Aerospace]] of [[Harvest, Alabama]].

==Design and development==
The Lionheart is based on the [[Beechcraft Staggerwing]] biplane of the 1930s;<ref name="GLH" /> but unlike the steel tube, wood and fabric construction of the Staggerwing it has a [[composite material|composite structure]].<ref name="Janes" />  The Staggerwing has [[strut]]-braced wings but the Lionheart has [[cantilever]] wings with a total area about 20% less than the wings of the Staggerwing.<ref name="GLH" /> It is powered by a 450hp (336kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior]] radial engine with a three-bladed propeller. It has a retractable [[conventional landing gear]] with a tailwheel.<ref name="Janes" /> The enclosed cabin is slightly longer than the Staggerwing's cabin to allow room for the pilot and five passengers, and it has a split [[airstair]] access door on the port side.<ref name="Janes" /><ref name="Pirep" />

The Lionheart first flew on 27 July 1997 and was first displayed in public at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] a few days later.<ref name="GLH" /><ref name="FI" /> Five kits were sold by April 1998, and two of the kits were completed by 2001, with another almost complete.<ref name="GLH" /><ref name="Janes" /><ref name="Pirep" /> As of August 2011, three Lionhearts are registered in the United States, with another example on display in an aviation museum at [[Tullahoma Regional Airport]] in [[Tullahoma, Tennessee]].<ref name="Ldgs" /><ref name="BHM" /> Kits are no longer being produced.<ref name="GLH" />
