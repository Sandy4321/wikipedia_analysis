The '''1936 FA Cup Final''' was a [[Association football|football]] match between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 25 April 1936 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. The showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the FA Cup), it was the 64th Cup final, and the fourteenth at the national stadium.

Each team received a bye to the third round of the tournament, and then progressed through five rounds before reaching the final. Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting to emulate the success of their rivals [[Sheffield Wednesday]] in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first half was followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by [[Ted Drake]] in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in [[autogyro]]s to see the match and the [[BBC]] experimented with [[sports commentator]]s for the first time during its live broadcast of the final.

Being from the [[Football League First Division|First]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]s respectively, both Arsenal and Sheffield United were seeded into the third round of the FA Cup.<ref name=facup193536>{{cite web|last=Reyes Padilla|first=Macario|title=England FA Challenge Cup 1935<U+2013>1936|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engcup1936.html|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref> In the third round itself, Arsenal was drawn away against [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] team [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. Arsenal missed a penalty, and the third Division team went a goal up in the first half; Arsenal were playing so poorly that it seemed they would struggle even for a draw. The turnaround in the match occured when [[Cliff Bastin]] took over from [[Bobby Davidson]] at the inside left position. Arsenal equalized in the 65th minute, and scored further four times over the course of the following fourteen minutes to win the game by five goals to one, with a single goal from Bowden and two each from [[Ted Drake|Drake]] and Bastin.<ref name=bastinsaves>{{cite news|last=Sarl|first=J.M.|title=Bastin Saves The Arsenal|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article4919.ece/BINARY/Bristol+Rovers+1-5+Arsenal|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|publisher=Cecil King|page=26|date=13 January 1936}}</ref> 

They followed this in the fourth round with a 2<U+2013>0 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]]. The match was played seven days after the death of King [[George V]], with both teams wearing black armbands. The crowd of 60,000 stood to sing [[Abide with Me]] and [[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]] before the kickoff.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal Regain Command|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=4|date=27 January 1936}}</ref> In the fifth round they were drawn against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], in a rematch of the [[1932 FA Cup Final|1932 final]].<ref name=newcastlefirstmatch>{{cite news|title=An Exciting Game at Newcastle|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=5|date=17 February 1936}}</ref> Newcastle had already knocked out the current cup holders, [[Sheffield Wednesday]], in an earlier round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Draw for Fifth Round|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=31 January 1936}}</ref> On the day, the gates to [[St James' Park]] needed to be closed before the match started to keep additional spectators out, some 64,484 fans already being inside the ground. The match resulted in a 3-3 draw, Arsenal having gone a goal ahead each time, but Newcastle coming back and equalizing. The reason being according to the report in ''[[The Times]]'' was because "Whenever the lead was gained, the side concentrated entirely on defense."<ref name=newcastlefirstmatch/> In the replay at home, Arsenal won the game 3<U+2013>0. They had gone a goal up in the first half from a penalty scored by Bastin after the Newcastle centre half [[David Davidson (footballer)|David Davidson]] handled the ball in the box. Newcastle were unlucky not to draw level, and only [[Eddie Hapgood]] clearing a shot off the line prevented the scoreline being equal once more. The second goal came during an advance by Arsenal, where the Newcastle goalkeeper, [[Norman Tapken]], cleared the ball directly to Arsenal midfielder [[Pat Beasley]], who shot the ball into the back of an empty net. The final goal was another penalty, caused when Bastin was brought down in the box, who then promptly took and scored the shot himself.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcastle Well Beaten|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=20 February 1936}}</ref> 

In their quarter final, they defeated Second Division [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] 4<U+2013>1, having outplayed them right from the start, the first goal coming in the fourth minute from Beasley in an attacking move. Bowden scored the second goal, and the third came from a penalty scored by Bastin. The fourth and final Arsenal goal was Beasley's second, with Barnsley's consolation goal coming a couple of minutes from the end of the match.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal's Misery|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=2 March 1936}}</ref> In the semi final, played at Huddersfield Town's [[Leeds Road|ground]], beating [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 1<U+2013>0 in a match that was described by reporters as completely one sided, with the goal coming from Bastin five minutes before half time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal in the Final|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=23 March 1936}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Sheffield United's third round match at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] ended in a 0<U+2013>0 draw, before winning 2<U+2013>1 in the replay at home on a snow-covered pitch in a game that was marred by heavy fog at the start. [[Harold Barton]] scored for United, before [[Ted Hancock]] equalized for Burnley. [[Bobby Barclay]] scored United's second goal before the break. An additional goal by [[Jock Dodds]] for United was disallowed in the second half due to the player being ruled offside.<ref>{{cite news|title=Last of the Replays|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=5|date=17 January 1936}}</ref> 

The fourth round saw them drawn away again, this time at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] again drawing 0<U+2013>0 in the initial match, the return match at home on 30 January this time resulting in a 2<U+2013>0 victory after playing the entire second half with only ten men in front of a crowd of 34,259 supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheffield United Win|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=31 January 1936}}</ref> In comparison, a record crowd of 68,287 at [[Bramall Lane]] saw Sheffield United defeat [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] 3<U+2013>1, the first time in the tournament they won without going to a replay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shefield Utd v Leeds Utd|newspaper=News of the World|publisher=News International Trading Limited.|page=81|date=9 March 2003}}</ref> They repeated that scoreline against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the quarter final on a marshy pitch in driving snow. United were up by half time thanks to a goal by Barclay. In the second half, Spurs came back strongly, but two goals from Dodds won the game for United, with Tottenham scoring a consolation goal late on.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheffield United Beat Tottenham|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=2 March 1936}}</ref>

Sheffield United was drawn against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the semi final, which guaranteed that a Second Division team would make it through to the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wembley in Sight|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=5|date=21 March 1936}}</ref> The match was held at Wolverhampton Wanderers' [[Molineux Stadium]] on 21 March, where United won 2<U+2013>1.<ref name=facup193536 /> The two teams faced each other again a week later in a league match, where Fulham won 1-0 thanks to a [[Penalty shot|penalty]], ending a unbeaten run of 22 games for United.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fulham's Revenge|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=27 March 1936}}</ref>

Arsenal had most recently appeared in the final in [[1932 FA Cup Final|1932]], being defeated by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], while their most recent FA Cup victory came two seasons earlier in [[1930 FA Cup Final|1930]] against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

Both teams had provided players to the [[England national football team]] earlier in the month for a match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], with Arsenal providing [[George Male]], [[Jack Crayston]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], while Sheffield United gave [[Bobby Barclay]]. [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]], despite being Arsenal's captain and having previously played for the Scottish international team, was not chosen for that match,<ref name=internationalapril1936>{{cite news|title=England's Chances at Wembley|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=4 April 1936}}</ref> which resulted in a 1<U+2013>1 draw, enabling Scotland to win the [[1936 British Home Championship]].<ref name=scotlandraw>{{cite news|title=Scotland Draw at Wembley|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=6|date=6 April 1936}}</ref>

Wembley bosses were in dispute with [[newsreel]] companies over the broadcast rights for the 1936 final.<ref name=motson/> [[Gaumont British|Gaumont British Film Company]] initially had offered <U+00A3>900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of <U+00A3>1,500.

It was the first year that [[Sports commentator|commentator]]s were used in the broadcast of an FA Cup final, with the [[BBC]] describing it as an "experiment".<ref name=commentators/> The first commentators were [[Ivan Sharpe]] and [[Norman Creek (footballer)|Norman Creek]], who broadcast from 2:30&nbsp;pm onwards before the game to take in the pre<U+2013>match entertainment.<ref name=commentators>{{cite news|title=The Cup Final Broadcast|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=12|date=21 April 1936}}</ref> 

Arsenal played in red and white shirts in an FA Cup final for the first time, on previous occasions in 1930 and 32 they wore fully red shirts. Additionally, before the 1967/68 season, Arsenal only wore team badges on their shirts on special occasions, such as FA Cup Finals. The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn.<ref name=shirts>{{cite web|title=The Arsenal shirt badge|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/the-arsenal-shirt-badge|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> Sheffield United also wore crested red and white shirts, their vertical stripe design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheffield United 1936 F.A Cup Final|url=http://www.toffs.com/Sheffield-United-1936-FA-Cup-Final/productinfo/1207/|publisher=Toffs.com|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>

[[image:Barclay1933.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bobby Barclay, inside forward for Sheffield United|alt=A man standing with his arms crossed, while wearing a vertical striped shirt and long dark shorts.]]
More than 93,000 spectators attended the match, with fans from Sheffield travelling from the north on specially laid-on trains.<ref name=arsenalsuccess>{{cite news|title=Arsenals' Success at Wembley|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=14|date=27 April 1936}}</ref> Changes to the teams were made before the match, with [[Ted Drake]] available for Arsenal following an injury. Sheffield United replaced [[Don Bird]] with [[Bertie Williams]] on the outside left,<ref name=arsenalchances /> and [[Charlie Wilkinson]] was brought back into the team to replace [[Albert Cox]] who had played in the semi final against Fulham while Wilkinson was injured.<ref name=albertcox>{{cite news|title=United mourn 1936 FA Cup star Albert Cox|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/united_mourn_1936_fa_cup_star_albert_cox_1_238848|newspaper=The Star|publisher=Johnson Press|date=9 April 2003|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>

While the weather was fine, the wind whipped up to such an extent at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion.<ref name=arsenalvictory/> In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper [[Alex Wilson (footballer born 1908)|Wilson]] dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players [[Bobby Barclay|Barclay]] and [[Jock Dodds|Dodds]] both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the opportunity into a goal.<ref name=mirrorreport2>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Lainson|title=Massed Defence That Baffled United|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article6167.ece/BINARY/Arsenal+1-0+Sheffield+United|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|publisher=Cecil King|page=30|date=27 April 1936}}</ref> During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe.<ref name=arsenalvictory>{{cite news|title=Arsenal's Victory at Wembley|newspaper=The Times|publisher=John Jacob Astor|page=5|date=27 April 1936}}</ref> Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with [[Jack Crayston|Crayston]] and [[Wilf Copping|Copping]] stepping up for their team.<ref name=arsenalvictory/>

During the match, the attacks of Arsenal were mostly held at bay by Sheffield United's backs, with [[Ray Bowden|Bowden]] and [[Cliff Bastin|Bastin]] both performing poorly, although it was Bastin who set up the move that resulted in the only goal of the game. Arsenal's attacking tactics had favored these two players, with not much play going through to Drake. The standout player was [[Joe Hulme]] who managed to cut inside repeatedly, threatening United with a extra yard or two of speed over his marker. [[Alex James (footballer)|James]] also performed well, getting in more attacks on goal than usual.<ref name=arsenalvictory/> [[Jack Smith (footballer born 1910)|Smith]], in goal for the Blades, had a particularly steady game and their forwards [[Bobby Barclay|Barclay]] and [[Jack Pickering|Pickering]] played particularly well with their attacks only prevented by the work of [[George Male|Male]] who was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as having the "game of his life".<ref name=arsenalvictory/> United's attacks were mostly restricted by the Arsenal defense to long range shooting. The first half of the match finished at a 0<U+2013>0 draw, with the attacks spread equally between the two teams.<ref name=arsenalvictory/>

The second half started off with Crayston briefly taking on the role of a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's forwards followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past [[Harry Hooper (footballer born 1910)|Hooper]] before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot.<ref name=arsenalvictory/> Moments after the goal United were on the attack, [[Harold Barton|Barton]] broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar.<ref name=arsenalvictory/> Dodds later said in an interview, "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up behind me and, in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself in the back of the net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different."<ref name=scotsmandodds>{{cite news|title=Ephraim 'Jock' Dodds|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/european/ephraim_jock_dodds_1_684012|newspaper=The Scotsman|publisher=Johnston Press|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls,<ref name=arsenalvictory/> although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.<ref name=mirrorreport>{{cite news|last=Russell|first=W.E.|coauthor=Bryan, T.G.; Spiers, E.H; Musther, W.|title=Stop-Go, Safety-First Final|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article6167.ece/BINARY/Arsenal+1-0+Sheffield+United|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|publisher=Cecil King|page=30|date=27 April 1936}}</ref>
