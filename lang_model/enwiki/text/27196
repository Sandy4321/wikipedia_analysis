March 17 is '''Evacuation Day''', a [[Public holiday|holiday]] observed in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] (which includes the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]])<ref name="LegalHoliday">[[#LegalHolidy|List of Massachusetts holidays]]</ref> and also by the [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]<ref name="Cambridge">[[#CambridgeSchoolCalendar|Cambridge School Calendar]]</ref> and [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].<ref name="Somerville">[[#SomervilleSchoolCalendar|Somerville School Calendar]]</ref> The holiday commemorates the [[withdrawal (military)|evacuation]] of [[United Kingdom|British]] forces from the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] following the [[Siege of Boston]], early in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Schools and government offices (including some<ref>For example, the RMV offices are all open.</ref> [[Massachusetts]] state government offices located in Suffolk County) are closed.  If March 17 falls on a weekend, schools and government offices are closed on the following Monday in observance. It is the same day as [[Saint Patrick's Day]], a coincidence that played a role in the establishment of the holiday.<ref name="wbur" />

==Historical background==
{{See|Siege of Boston}}
The 11-month [[siege of Boston]] ended when the [[Continental Army]], under the command of [[George Washington]], [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortified Dorchester Heights]] in early March 1776 with [[cannon]]s [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured at Ticonderoga]]. British General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], whose garrison and navy were threatened by these positions, was forced to decide between attack and retreat. To prevent what could have been a repeat of the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], Howe decided to retreat, withdrawing from Boston to [[Nova Scotia]] on March 17.

The British evacuation was Washington's first victory of the [[American Revolutionary War|war]]. It was also a huge morale boost for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], as the city where the rebellion began was the first to be liberated.

==Establishment of the holiday==
While [[Saint Patrick's Day]] parades have been held in Boston since 1876, Evacuation Day was not declared a holiday in the city until 1901,<ref name="Vrabel241">[[#Vrabel|Vrabel]], p. 241</ref> amid interest in local history that also resulted in the construction of the [[Dorchester Heights]] Monument. The state made it a holiday in Suffolk County in 1938.<ref name="Vrabel241"/>  The large Irish population of Boston at that time played a role in the establishment of the holiday.<ref name="OConnor124">[[#OConnor|O'Connor]], p. 124</ref>  A 1941 law establishing the holiday in Suffolk County was signed in both black and green ink.<ref name="wbur">{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/2010/03/12/evacuation-day-holiday|title=With A Signature In Green, St. Patrick<U+2019>s Day Became A Holiday|accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

==Observance activities==
Evacuation Day activities in the areas that observe the holiday are limited.  Most events of note, like the annual [[parade]] and politicians' breakfast in [[South Boston]], are dominated by celebrations of Irish culture.  The parade is officially designated the [[Saint Patrick's Day]] and Evacuation Day Parade.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Allied War Veterans of South Boston mark the day with a ceremony on Dorchester Heights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/03/happy_evacuatio.html|accessdate=2009-03-17|title=Happy Evacuation Day!|first=Andrew|last=Ryan|publisher=Boston.com | date=2009-03-17}}</ref>

Another local holiday observing an event in the American Revolutionary War is [[Bunker Hill Day]]. State workers outside Suffolk County are allowed to choose any two days off in lieu of celebrating Evacuation Day and Bunker Hill Day on the observance days.  The two holidays are generally not observed by the general public or private businesses.<ref>http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20100302public_to_chime_in_on_hack_holidays/srvc=home&position=recent</ref>  Some government services remain in operation, such as trash pickup in the City of Boston<ref>http://www.cityofboston.gov/publicworks/RecyclingandSanitation/holiday.asp</ref> and all state Registry of Motor Vehicle offices.  The [[MBTA]] runs a normal schedule but, due to special events, prohibits bicycles on the subway.<ref>http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/bikes/</ref>

==Moves to eliminate holiday==
In 2010, the state legislature debated eliminating Evacuation Day and [[Bunker Hill Day]] as official holidays, citing the expense of giving state and local workers paid days off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/bedford/news/x2102349834/Beacon-Hill-Roll-Call|accessdate=2010-03-15|title=Beacon Hill Roll Call|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Gatehouse Media}}</ref>  The state's FY2011 budget requires all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County be open on both days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts FY2011 Budget, Outside Section 5|url=http://www.mass.gov/bb/gaa/fy2011/os_11/h5.htm|date=2010-07-14|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>
