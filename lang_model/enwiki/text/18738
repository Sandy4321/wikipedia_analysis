'''Cleveland''' is a town in [[Chippewa County, Wisconsin|Chippewa County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 900 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Cleveland is roughly a rectangle, six miles north to south and about nine miles east to west, but with the east end cut off by the Chippewa River. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 56.4&nbsp;square miles (146.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), of which 54.1&nbsp;square miles (140.2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) is land and 2.2&nbsp;square miles (5.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) (3.94%) is water.

==History==
The six mile squares that would become Cleveland were first [[Surveying|surveyed]] in summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In September 1852 a different crew marked all the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section corners]] of the [[survey township|township]], walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with [[Gunter's chain|chain]] and [[Solar compass|compass]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Land Survey Information|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/SurveyNotes/SurveyInfo.html|publisher=Board of Commissioners of Public Lands|accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Field Notes for T31N R7W|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/SurveyNotes/SurveyNotes-idx?type=PLSS&twp=T031NR007W|work=Original Field Notes and Plat Maps, 1833-1866|publisher=Board of Commissioners of Public Lands|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description of the six by six mile square which overlays the middle-east of the modern township:
<blockquote>''This Township contains one large Swamp timbered with [[Larix laricina|Tamarac]] and several [[Thuja occidentalis|Cedar]] & Tamarac Swamps all unfit for cultivation. The soil is generally level and of second & third rate quality and in many places fit for cultivation. The Township is well timbered and is chiefly [[Eastern White Pine|Pine]] [[Tsuga canadensis|Hemlock]] [[Sugar maple|Sugar]] and Lim(?). [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa River]] enters the Township at Section 24 runs a South West course and leaves the Township near the South West corner of Section 35. The River has a swift current & High banks well timbered.''<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=J.
