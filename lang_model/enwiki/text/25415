'''Drift City''', also known as '''Skid Rush''' in Korea, is a [[Korea]]n-developed game published in America on [[August 1]], [[2007]] by [[NHN]]. This game combines the features of an [[Role-playing game|RPG]] with the features of a [[driving game]].

== Plot ==
[[Image:driftcity.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A screenshot of several players at Cras Beach in Drift City.]]
The game takes place in the near future during a worldwide oil shortage. A mysterious material dubbed ''Mittron'' is discovered on an island in the North Pacific. The island was named after the material, and the Organization for Mittron Development (OMD) is set up to manage the island and its resources. This resource quickly became the preferred fuel for all methods of transportation as Mittron-fueled cars ran much longer, cleaner, and faster than traditional gas-powered cars.

Unmanned vehicles dubbed HUVs (High-Tech Unmanned Vehicles) began appearing around the island terrorizing the people. This threat has become so widespread that pedestrians no longer walk the streets for fear of being attacked. As a result, the OMD has started importing professional drivers to assist in destroying the HUVs and uncover the mystery behind their sudden appearance.

== Gameplay ==
Players earn experience points and the in-game currency of Mito for completing missions and deliveries, as well as for bounties when hunting HUVs.

Players can choose from a variety of vehicles in different classes. They can also purchase upgrade parts for their vehicle for increased performance, though many parts require the player to have reached a certain level before they can be equipped. Performance parts can be further enhanced by enhancers for increased stats.

Players can also earn "coupons" to unlock cars for purchase by completing certain in-game requirements, similar to the [[Burnout (series)|Burnout series']] Trophy requirements. The player can also earn items through driving and hunting HUVs. These items can range from fuel for the car to car parts.

Players also have the option to join and form "crews," as well as form impromptu "parties" for extra experience. Each crew has ranks depending on their crew points, you can be rank A, rank B or rank S. B class crews are 3rd class, A class crews are 2nd class and S class (special class) crews are 1st class. For players to tell which rank crews are, the crew names are coloured: white for low class crews, blue for B class crews, yellow for A class crew and red for S class crews. Players can also trade items directly with each other.

Having been released first, ''Skid Rush'' contains a number of features have yet to be implemented in Drift City. These include a wider variety of customization options for the player's car and new cars.

===Mittron Island===
Mittron Island consists of four cities: ''Moon Palace'', ''Koinonia'', ''Cras'', and ''Oros''. Players start in Moon Palace and work their way into Koinonia, Cras, and then Oros by completing storyline missions and reaching certain levels. Once these cities are opened, players can travel between them at any time using the highway system.

Each server hosts a central hub known as the ''Driver Dome'' where drivers can converse with each other. The ''Driver Dome'' contains several buildings, which include the ''Battle Zone'' where drivers can challenge each other on preset courses, the ''Auction House'', where players can purchase items that others have posted for sale through an in-game browser, the ''Dealership'', where players may purchase new vehicles, the ''Parts Shop'', where players may purchase new parts from an NPC, the ''Garage'', where players can switch between each of the vehicles they own, and the ''Crew Center'', where players can create a crew or participate and spectate in crew battles. The Driver Dome also has an underground level only accessible by players who are level 31 and higher which also contains the aforementioned buildings.

====Cities====
* '''Moon Palace''' - The city where rookie OMD drivers are deployed. Moon Palace is a seaside metropolis with a wide open road system. The east of the city also houses a portion of the island's industrial district, where Mittron is refined into fuel. There is an airport on the west side of this city that is shared with Oros.
* '''Koinonia''' - Mittron Island's industrial and commercial center, which also features a seaport.
* '''Cras''' - A hilly city with a little beach that is also home to the facilities where Mittron is mined. The city also has a tunnel that leads the player directly back to Moon Palace without having to pass through Oros or Koinonia.
* '''Oros''' - A desert city that is a hotspot for Mittron development. Its main facilities are a space center based on [[NASA]] and a secret military installation named "Area 71" based on Area 51 in America. Released November 21.

===Cars===
The cars are organized by classes ranging from V1 to V9 with V9 being the highest. Each class requires the player to have reached a certain level, attained a certain amount in mito. Most of the cars also require the player to have previously attained a "coupon" which unlocks it for purchase.

While most of the cars are fictionally branded yet modeled on their real-life counterparts, a number of vehicles from [[Chrysler]] and [[Jeep]] have been licensed for the game, most prominently the 4th-generation {{Fact|date=March 2009}} [[Dodge Viper]] SRT-10 coupe and the 6th-generation {{Fact|date=March 2009}} [[Dodge Charger]].

===Rush Time===
Rush Time is a new feature of Drift City where anyone can join a massive ''"Boss HUV"'' chase, which consists of chasing one of five possible large HUVs, with significantly increased HP and different abilities. The event can begin once at least 10 players are within the Rush Time circle. Larger Rush Time events occur at scheduled times. 

Users gain items by crashing into the boss HUV. The user that deals the fatal blow will receive a big prize: 3 Mittron Enhancers (used for upgrading parts) and some mito, the in-game currency. Except for scheduled Rush Time events, the Boss HUV is rarely defeated within the ten-minute limit. However, participating in Rush Time is the only way to obtain the highest level parts in the game, and many players participate in smaller Rush Times so they can obtain these rare parts to use or sell via the Auction House.  

===Parts enhancing===
Parts can be enhanced (upgraded) by using Mittron Enhancers. All parts are divided into 3 branches, Normal parts (level 1 through level 25 parts), Super parts (level 31 through level 55 parts) and Hyper parts (level 60 through level 80 parts). Since the Stage 2 update, each branch requires a corresponding Mittron Enhancer to enhance the part (e.g. H Mittron Enhancer is needed to enhance Hyper parts). However, the old Mittron Enhancer which has a 24 hour usage period limit can be still obtained by various ways (e.g. Rush Time) and can still be used to enhance any part. The cash item "Mittron Enhancer Booster" can be used to double the effect of Mittron Enhancers. Attempting to enhance has a chance to fail or even break the part. Broken parts can be repaired by using a repair kit that removes all enhancements from the part or the cash item "Restore kit" that keeps the enhancements made to the part.

== New features ==
===Sticker feature===
By uploading up to 5 images per day, players can fully customize their cars. While the stickers themselves are Mito, the adhesive used to apply them to the car costs G Coins.<ref>[http://drift.ijji.com/stage2.nhn?m=newfeatures] Stage 2 new features page</ref> 

===Glossy paints===
Paint with a special, reflective finish that adds stat points. Unlike regular paint, it cannot be removed from the car it was bought for until it expires. New players can choose a free, unlimited glossy paint, but there is no stat bonus. <ref>[http://forums.ijji.com/showthread.php?p=3197090]GM Belegnir post about Stage 2 features</ref>

===Undercity===
Undercity is a dungeon instance where a party of players may participate in multiple HUV chasing events for items and money.<ref>[http://drift.ijji.com/stage2.nhn?m=newfeatures] Stage 2 new features page</ref> Completing one round of Undercity earns the player a coupon for the Monster, a large truck with a high durability stat built to destroy HUVs. 

At the final stage of an Undercity session, the party must defeat a Boss HUV within a time limit.  Each city has a different Boss HUV, and when the Boss HUV is defeated, each player receives up to three items depending on how well they did.  The game mode can give parts from special part sets that give additional stats if all of the parts are equipped, and the part sets available from Undercity also differ between each city.

The currently available Undercity missions are in both Moon Palace and Koinonia.  The Undercity mission in Koinonia is tougher than to the one in Moon Palace.  

===Real Match===
A balanced team race where every player drives the same car, a [[Bugatti Veyron 16.4]] {{Fact|date=March 2009}} look-alike called the Duel. Winning 100 Real Match races earns the player a coupon that they can use to purchase their own Duel. Currently, Real Matches are only available during scheduled times.Although Real Match races rewards a lot of Mito, there is no exp. rewarded.  <ref>[http://drift.ijji.com/stage2.nhn?m=newfeatures] Stage 2 new features page</ref>

===Lap Time===
Similar to the style of racing found in [[Trackmania]]. Players compete for the best time around the track without using gate powerups and may earn parts and part enhancers depending on their position. <ref>[http://drift.ijji.com/stage2.nhn?m=newfeatures] Stage 2 new features page</ref> <!-- Can someone make sure that I got the correct reference? -->
