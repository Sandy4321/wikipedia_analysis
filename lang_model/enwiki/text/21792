The '''Canadian Mathematical Olympiad''' (CMO), is, as the name suggests, the [[national]] [[Olympiad]] of [[Canada]]. It is run by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] and sponsored by the company [[Sun Life Financial]].<ref>http://www.math.ca/Competitions/CMO/</ref> The Olympiad plays several roles in Canadian [[mathematics competition]]s, most notably being Canada's main (and only) team selection process for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. <ref>https://mail.cms.math.ca/pipermail/cmath/2005/000215.html</ref>

==Qualification==
Qualification for the CMO is usually through the [[Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge]], though only "official" participants of that contest can enter. Generally, the cutoff for the CMO on that contest is in the 70s.<ref>http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/english/contests/brochures/2008/COMC2007(E).pdf</ref>

==Awards==
There are several different types of rewards for doing well on the CMO:
*Six people are selected each year for the Canadian International Mathematical Olympiad team, the pinnacle of [[high school]] mathematical competition. <ref>http://imo.math.ca/</ref>
*Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded based the [[percentile]] you scored in.<ref>http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/english/contests/open.shtml</ref>
