'''Centennial Field''' is the name of two sports facilities  at the [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]].  One is used for [[baseball]] and the other is now primarily used for  men's and women's [[soccer]] after once also serving as the home field for the school's football and lacrosse teams. The baseball field is also the home of the [[Vermont Lake Monsters]] [[minor league]] baseball team.<ref name="arango">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/sports/baseball/02vermont.html?ref=sports Arango, Tim. "Where Time Is the Opponent," ''The New York Times'', Sunday, August 2, 2009.]</ref> 

The field takes its name, Centennial Field, from the fact that the land on which it was built was dedicated to its current purpose on July 6, 1904, at the conclusion of the three-day celebration of the 100th anniversary of UVM's first graduating class. It officially opened on [[April 17]] [[1906]] with UVM's 10-4 victory over the [[University of Maine]]. [[Larry Gardner]] was the first batter for UVM.<ref name=Simon>{{cite news | first=Tom| last=Simon| coauthors= | title=Larry Gardner| date=| publisher=[[SABR]] | url =http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1430&pid=4927| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-24 | language = }}</ref> Future-[[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Ray Collins (baseball)|Ray Collins]] started the game for Vermont and threw the first pitch at the ballpark. Gardner and Collins are among 10 former Catamounts to reach the major leagues, the latest being [[Kirk McCaskill]], who hurled for the Angels and White Sox from 1985 to 1995. 

In addition to the baseball field, the adjacent soccer field was home to the University of Vermont [[american football|football]] team until 1974, and UVM's men's and women's lacrosse teams in the 1990s through 2006. The school's men's soccer team has played there since 1975 and the women have played there since 1995. This stadium seats 5,000 and drew America East record crowds during the 1989 postseason when UVM advanced to the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship East Regional Finals. Vermont hosts the long-running Smith Barney Men's Soccer Classic that has featured many national powers including UCLA, Stanford, Old Dominion, San Francisco, New Mexico and North Carolina. It's recent women's soccer tournament has featured Indiana, Notre Dame and Villanova. On occasion, Centennial Field hosts the Vermont boy's and girl's high school soccer championships.

During the era the Catamounts had a football team, Centennial Field had stands on both sides of the gridiron and UVM's game with UMass in 1966 had a record crowd of 10,000 fans. Vermont that season featured Little All-American halfback Bobby Mitchell and UMass had future NFL QB Greg Landry. The football field also was the home to several Vermont high school state championship games. 


The baseball ballpark was part of the sports complex constructed as part of the UVM Centennial celebration. The original wooden baseball bleachers burned on March 12, 1913. The current concrete and steel main grandstand was erected in 1922. Today, it seats 4,415 for baseball. Common treats at Vermont Lake Monsters home games include [[Dippin' Dots]], grilled foods, and [[Rhino Foods]]' Chessters.


The first UVM hockey game was played on Centennial Field. The field's large foul territory comes from the running track that at one time circled the park.<ref name=Kaufman>{{cite journal |last=Kaufman|first=Stuart |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |month=Summer |title=Class A Act: C.J.

On occasion, the University has held its commencement ceremonies at the soccer field. 

Centennial Field in the summer of 2005 was the Vermont stop on ESPN's "50 States in 50 Days" tour. In 2007 it was recognized by ESPN.com's Jim Caple as one of the top 10 ball park destinations in the U.S. It is also featured in the 2008 book, "101 Baseball Places To See Before You Strike Out" by Josh Pahagian (2008, The Lyons Press).

==Centennial Field Baseball==
In addition to the Lake Monsters and collegiate baseball, Vermont high schools also use it a few times during the regular season and also hold the four divisions championships at Centennial.<ref name=Donaghue>{{cite news | first=Mike| last=Donaghue| coauthors= | title=UVM<U+2019>s Centennial Field safe for now| date=2009-02-21| publisher=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | url =http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/200902210415/SPORTS/90221001| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-21 | language = }} </ref> It also hosts American Legion baseball and was home to the Northeast Regional tournament in 2007.

On February 20, 2009, the University announced that it would eliminate the varsity baseball program following the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| coauthors= | title=UVM to eliminate baseball, softball programs after this season| date=2009-02-20| publisher=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | url =http://burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090220/NEWS/90220039| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-21 | language = }} </ref> UVM Athletic Director Dr. Robert Corran announced that he expected that the university would continue to maintain and use the baseball field. <ref name=Donaghue/> The UVM baseball team played its last home game of the 2009 season at Centennial Field on May 12, 2009 when they hosted [[Bryant University|Bryant]].<ref>{{cite news | first=John| last=Curran| coauthors= | title=At Vermont, last baseball home game is bittersweet| date=2009-05-12| publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] | url =http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/baseball/articles/2009/05/12/at_vermont_last_baseball_home_game_is_bittersweet_1242168205/| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-12 | language = }} </ref>

==Professional Franchises==

Centennial Field has been home to minor league baseball teams through the years. 

===Burlington Cardinals===
The semi=professional Northern League (baseball, 1934-1952) Burlington Cardinals played at Centennial Field from 1935 to 1941 and from 1946 to 1952. 

Among the many future major leaguers who played for the Cardinals, [[Johnny Podres]] made his professional debut at Centennial Field in [[1950 in baseball|1950]] pitching for Cardinals. In 2005, the Vermont Expos invited Podres back to Centennial Field to throw out the first pitch in honor of the 50th-anniversary of the [[1955 in baseball|1955]] [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] [[1955 World Series|World Series championship]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bennett|first=Bob|coauthors=John Bennett, Jr., Robert S. Bennett|title=Johnny Podres: Brooklyn's Yankee Killer|publisher=Rooftop Publishing|year=2007 |location=|isbn=1-60008-033-2|pages=174 }}</ref>

===Burlington Athletics===
Clarence Beecher brought the Philadelphia Athletics' Provincial League Class C team to play at Centennial Field in 1955. The Provincial League was founded in 1935 and based in [[Quebec]]. The League was affiliated with the [[Minor league baseball|National Association]] from 1940 to 1943 and 1950 to 1955. Between 1950 and 1955, it was a Class C minor-league; the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] had an affiliate during this time. In 1954, the [[American League]] Athletics were based in Philadelphia and their Provincial League club in [[Drummondville]], [[Quebec]]. 

Dr. Clarence H. Beecher, former Burlington-mayor and dean of the [[University of Vermont College of Medicine|UVM College of Medicine]] is seen to be responsible for bringing the club to Burlington. Dr. Beecher had been president of the Burlington Cardinals during the Northern League's final season and assumed the same position with the new club when the Provincial League Dummondville club became available in the fall of 1954.<ref name=Denaro>{{cite news | first=Dominick| last=Denaro|coauthors= | title=Ralph LaPointe| date=| publisher=[[SABR]] The Baseball Biography Project| url =http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1517&pid=7960| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-23 | language = }}</ref>   

The 1955 Burlington A's attracted 51,267 fans to Centennial Field for the season, the second highest attendance in the League. Burlington went 65 and 64 to finish in third-place, 20.5 games behind the first-place [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec|St. Jean]] [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Canadians]]. Burlington pitcher Jack Hale tied for the league-lead in wins with 17.<ref>{{cite web| last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Burlington A's  | work =   | publisher = BR Bullpen | date =   | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Burlington_A%27s  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-03-03}}</ref> In the playoffs, Burlington beat first-place St. Jean in the first round but lost the championship to the [[Quebec City|Quebec]] [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]], four games to one. The League was not financially sustainable and disbanded prior to the 1956 season. <ref name=Denaro/>

===Vermont Reds===
Minor League baseball returned to Centennial Field in 1984 when Mike Agganis moved his AA [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] [[Lynn Sailors|Lynn Pirates]] from [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] to Burlington. The club had been affiliated with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and Agganis signed a four-year agreement with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The club was renamed the [[Vermont Reds]].<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news | first=| last=|coauthors= | title=Northeast Journal: Burlington's Minor Confusion| date=1988-09-11| publisher=[[New York Times]] | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D9163BF932A2575AC0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-27 | language = }}</ref>  

The club finished in fourth-place in 1984 and 1985, and in second-place in 1986. The Reds excelled in the post-season and won the Eastern League championship each of these three years. Vermont finished fourth again in 1987 but lost in the League finals. [[Barry Larkin]], [[Jeff Montgomery (baseball)|Jeff Montgomery]], [[Rob Dibble]], [[Chris Sabo]], and [[Norm Charlton]] all starred in Burlington and became the core of the [[1990 World Series|1990 World Champion]] [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].

===Vermont Mariners===

After the 1987 season, Cincinnati signed a new affiliation agreement with the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]]. The [[Seattle Mariners]] had themselves been affiliated with Chattanooga and signed with Agganis and the Burlington franchise. The Vermont Reds became the [[Vermont Mariners]]. 

The team finished second in the Eastern League behind the [[Glens Falls Tigers]]. Vermont made the playoffs but lost to the [[Albany-Colonie Yankees]] in the finals. Mariners manager [[Rich Morales]] was named Eastern League Manager of the Year and [[Jim Wilson (first baseman)|Jim Wilson]] and [[Omar Vizquel]] were Eastern League All-Stars. 

[[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] had been [[Major League Baseball Draft|drafted]] by the Mariners with the [[List of first overall Major League Baseball draft picks|first pick]] in 1987. Griffey played for the [[Bellingham Mariners]] in 1987 and spent most of the 1988 season with the Class A [[California League]] [[Rancho Cucamonga Quakes|San Bernardino Spirit]]. Griffey was promoted to Burlington and played at Centennial Field late in the 1988 season. He played in 17-games for the Mariners and hit two home runs. 

By September 1988, with the team in the Eastern League playoffs, Agganis had decided to move the franchise to [[Canton, Ohio]]. Canton was building a brand-new ballpark, [[Thurman Munson Memorial Stadium]], which would have a capacity of 5,700. More so, the Canton metropolitan area offered twice the population of Burlington. Agganis told the [[New York Times]], "Our attendance has averaged out to about 85,000 over five years in Burlington. In Canton, we can probably do between 225,000 and 300,000 attendance."<ref name=NYTimes/> The franchise moved to Canton after the 1988 season, affiliated with [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]], and became the [[Canton-Akron Indians]].

===Vermont Expos & Lake Monsters===
Minor league baseball returned to Centennial Field in 1994. Burlington businessman Ray Pecor, owner of Lake Champlain Transportation Co. in Burlington since 1976,<ref>{{cite news | first=Julia| last=Lynam|coauthors= | title=Uncommon Carrier| date=2004-07| publisher=Business People-Vermont| url =http://www.vermontguides.com/2004/07-july/pecor.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-02 | language = }}</ref> purchased the franchise rights of the [[Jamestown Jammers|Jamestown Expos]] and brought minor league baseball back to Burlington. 

The Vermont Expos debuted at Centennial Field on June 16, 1994. They lost 6 to 5 to the [[Pittsfield Mets]] but more than 5,000 fans attended the game. <ref>{{cite news | first=| last=|coauthors= | title=A million reasons to go to an Expos game | date=2003-03-01| publisher=Vermomt Business Magazine | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-315880491.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-02 | language = }}</ref>

The Expos passed 1,000,000 in cumulative attendance during the 2002 season.<ref name=Kaufman/>

==Historic Marker==
The Vermont Division for Historic Preservation erected a marker at the ballpark in 1997. It reads,

<blockquote>Named to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the University of Vermont's first graduating class, Centennial Field has been the home of UVM athletics since 1906.  The three ballparks that have stood on this site have hosted semi- professional and minor league baseball, as well as exhibitions by visiting Major League and Negro League ballclubs. The current grandstand, constructed in 1922, is one of the oldest still in use.  Among the outstanding players who have graced Centennial's diamond are Larry Gardner, Ray Collins, Tris Speaker, Jesse Hubbard, Robin Roberts, Kirk McCaskill, Barry Larkin and Ken Griffey, Jr.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jimmy| last=Wayne| coauthors= | title=Vermont - Centennial Field Historic Marker| date=2008-06| publisher=Point of Interest Road Signs| url=http://www.pointofinterestroadsigns.com/vermont/centennialfield.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-22 | language = }}</ref></blockquote>
