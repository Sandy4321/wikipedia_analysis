The '''Moscow Kremlin''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+041C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0435><U+043C><U+043B><U+044C>, ''Moskovskiy Kreml''), sometimes referred to as simply '''The Kremlin''',  is a historic fortified complex at the heart of [[Moscow]], overlooking the [[Moskva River]] (to the south), [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] and [[Red Square]] (to the east) and the [[Alexander Garden]] (to the west). It is the best known of [[kremlin]]s ([[Russia]]n citadels) and includes four palaces, four cathedrals, and the enclosing [[Kremlin Wall]] with [[Kremlin towers]]. The complex serves as the official residence of the [[President of Russia|President]] of [[Russia]]. 

The name ''The Kremlin'' is often used as a [[metonym]] to refer to the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|government of the Soviet Union]] (1922<U+2013>1991) and its highest members (such as general secretaries, premiers, presidents, ministers, and commissars), in the same way the name ''[[Whitehall]]'' refers to the British government, or ''[[White House]]'' refers to the executive branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]].  It is still used in reference to the [[Politics of Russia|government of the Russian Federation]]. "[[Kremlinology]]" referred to the study of Soviet policies.

== History ==
===Origin===
[[Image:Plan of Moscow Kremlin.jpg|left|thumb|Plan of Moscow Kremlin, 1917]]
The site has been continuously inhabited since the 2nd millennium BC, and originates from a [[Vyatichs|Vyatich]] [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|fortified structure]] on [[Kremlin Hill|Borovitsky Hill]] where the [[Neglinnaya River]] flowed into the [[Moskva River]]. The Slavs occupied the south-western portion of the hill as early as the 11th century, as testifies a metropolitan seal from the 1090s, which was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists on the spot. 

Until the 14th century, the site was known as the [[grad (geography)|grad]] of Moscow. The word "kremlin" was first recorded in 1331 and its etymology is disputed (see [[Vasmer]] [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&morpho=1&basename=%5Cusr%5Clocal%5Cshare%5Cstarling%5Cmorpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&first=1&text_word=%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BB%D1%8C&method_word=substring&text_general=&method_general=substring&text_origin=&method_origin=substring&text_trubachev=&method_trubachev=substring&text_editorial=&method_editorial=substring&text_pages=&method_pages=substring&text_any=&method_any=substring&sort=word online] (Russian)). The "grad" was greatly extended by Prince [[Yuri Dolgoruky]] in 1156, destroyed by the Mongols in 1237 and rebuilt in oak in 1339.<ref>Michael C. Paul, "The Military Revolution in Russia 1550<U+2013>1682", ''The Journal of Military History'' 68, No. 1 (January 2004), 31.</ref>

===Seat of Grand Dukes===
[[Image:VasnecovA VMoskovskom.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]'s depiction of the Kremlin under [[Ivan III]].]] 
The first recorded stone structures in the Kremlin were built at the behest of [[Ivan Kalita]] in the late 1320s and early 1330s, after [[Peter, Metropolitan of Rus]] was forced to move his seat from [[Kiev]] to Moscow. The new ecclesiastical capital needed permanent churches. These included the Dormition Cathedral (1327, with St. Peter's Chapel, 1329), the church-belltower of St. [[John Climacus]] (1329), the monastery church of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1330), and the Archangel Cathedral (1333)<U+2014>all built of limestone and decorated with elaborate carving, each crowned by a single dome. Of these churches, the reconstructed Saviour Cathedral alone survived into the 20th century, only to be pulled down at the urging of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in 1933.

[[Dmitri Donskoi]] replaced the oaken walls with a strong citadel of white limestone  in 1366<U+2013>1368 on the basic foundations of the current walls;<ref>Paul, "Military Revolution in Russia," 31.</ref> this fortification withstood a siege by Khan [[Tokhtamysh]]. Dmitri's son [[Vasily I]] resumed construction of churches and cloisters in the Kremlin. The newly-built [[Cathedral of the Annunciation|Annunciation Cathedral]] was painted by [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Andrey Rublev]], and [[Prokhor]] in 1405. The [[Chudov Monastery]] was founded by Dmitri's tutor, [[Metropolitan Alexis]]; while his widow, [[Eudoxia of Moscow|Eudoxia]], established the [[Ascension Convent]] in 1397.

===Residence of Tsars===
[[Image:Kremlenagrad.jpg|thumb|250px|left|"Kremlenagrad": the first detailed map of the Kremlin (ca. 1601).]]

[[Ivan III of Russia|Grand Prince Ivan III]] organised the reconstruction of the Kremlin, inviting a number of skilled architects from [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], like [[Pietro Antonio Solari|Petrus Antonius Solarius]], who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and [[Marco Ruffo|Marcus Ruffus]] who designed the new palace for the prince. It was during his reign that three extant cathedrals of the Kremlin, the Deposition Church, and the Palace of Facets were constructed. The highest building of the city and [[Muscovite Russia]] was the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]], built in 1505<U+2013>08 and  augmented to its present height in 1600.  The Kremlin walls as they now appear were built between 1485 and 1495.<ref>Paul, "The Military Revolution in Russia," 31.</ref> Spasskie gates of the wall still bear a dedication in Latin praising Petrus Antonius Solarius for the design.

After construction of the new kremlin walls and churches was complete, the monarch decreed that no structures should be built in the immediate vicinity of the citadel. The Kremlin was separated from the walled merchant town ([[Kitai-gorod]]) by a 30-metre-wide moat, over which the [[St. Basil's Cathedral|Intercession Cathedral on the Moat]] was constructed during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. The same tsar also renovated some of his grandfather's palaces, added a new palace and cathedral for his sons, and endowed the Trinity [[metochion]] inside the Kremlin. The metochion was administrated by the [[Trinity Lavra|Trinity Monastery]] and boasted the graceful [[tent-like church|tower church]] of [[Sergius of Radonezh|St. Sergius]], which was described by foreigners as one of the finest in the country.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], the Kremlin was held by the Polish forces for two years, between 21 September 1610 and 26 October 1612. The Kremlin's liberation by the volunteer army of [[Kuzma Minin]] and [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] paved the way for the election of [[Mikhail Romanov]] as the new tsar. During his reign and that of [[Tsar Alexis|his son Alexis]], the eleven-domed Upper Saviour Cathedral, [[Armorial Gate]], [[Terem Palace]], [[Amusement Palace]] and the palace of [[Patriarch Nikon]] were built. Following the death of Alexis, the Kremlin witnessed the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]], from which [[Peter I of Russia|tsar Peter]] barely escaped, causing him to dislike the Kremlin. Three decades later, Peter abandoned the residence of his forefathers for his new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]].

===Imperial period===
[[Image:Kremlinduran.jpg|thumb|250px|View from across the Moskva River in the 1820s.]]
[[Image:Moscow Kremlin, Teremnoy Palace, 1840s.jpg|thumb|250px|A 17th-century hall in the [[Terem Palace]], as painted in the 1840s.]]

Although still used for coronation ceremonies, the Kremlin was abandoned and neglected until 1773, when [[Catherine the Great]] engaged [[Vasily Bazhenov]] to build her new residence there. Bazhenov produced a bombastic [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] design on a heroic scale, which involved the demolition of several churches and palaces, as well as a portion of the Kremlin wall. After the preparations were over, construction halted due to lack of funds. Several years later, the architect [[Matvei Kazakov]] supervised the reconstruction of the dismantled sections of the wall and of some structures of the Chudov Monastery, and constructed the spacious and luxurious [[Kremlin Senate|offices of the Senate]], since adapted for use as the principal workplace of the President of Russia.

Following [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] in 1812, the French forces occupied the Kremlin from [[2 September]] to [[11 October]]. When [[Napoleon]] fled Moscow, he ordered the whole Kremlin to be blown up. The [[Kremlin Arsenal]], several portions of the Kremlin Wall and several wall towers were destroyed by explosions and fires damaged the [[Palace of Facets|Faceted Chamber]] and churches. Explosions continued for three days, from 21 to 23 October. Fortunately, the rain damaged the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuses]], and the damage was less severe than intended. Restoration works were held in 1816<U+2013>19, supervised by [[Joseph Bov<U+00E9>|Osip Bove]]. During the remainder of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]'s reign, several ancient structures were renovated in a fanciful neo-Gothic style, but many others were condemned as "disused" or "dilapidated" (including all the buildings of the Trinity metochion) and simply torn down.

On visiting Moscow for his coronation festivities, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] was not satisfied with the Grand, or Winter, Palace, which had been erected to [[Rastrelli]]'s design in the 1750s. The elaborate [[Baroque]] structure was demolished, as was the nearby church of St. John the Precursor, built by [[Aloisio the New]] in 1508 in place of the first church constructed in Moscow. The architect [[Konstantin Thon]] was commissioned to replace them with the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]], which was to rival the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg in its dimensions and the opulence of its interiors. The palace was constructed in 1839<U+2013>49, followed by the new building of the [[Kremlin Armoury]] in 1851.

After 1851, the Kremlin changed little until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]; the only new features added during this period were the [[Monument to Alexander II]] and a stone cross marking the spot where [[Grand Duke Sergey Aleksandrovich of Russia]] was assassinated by [[Ivan Kalyayev]] in 1905. These monuments were destroyed by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1918.

===Soviet period and beyond===
[[Image:Spasskaya tower-Feb 2005-Mathew Dodson.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The famous Spasskaya tower, with its ruby star added in 1937. The [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] is in the foreground.]]

The Soviet government moved from [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] to Moscow on 12 March 1918. [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] selected the Kremlin Senate as his residence, and his room is still preserved as a museum. Stalin also had his personal rooms in the Kremlin. He was eager to remove from his headquarters all the "relics of the tsarist regime". Golden eagles on the towers were replaced by shining [[Kremlin stars]], while the wall near [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] was turned into the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. 

The Chudov Monastery and Ascension Convent, with their magnificent 16th-century cathedrals, were dismantled to make room for the military school and [[State Kremlin Palace|Palace of Congresses]]. The Little Nicholas Palace and the old Saviour Cathedral were pulled down as well. The residence of the Soviet government was closed to tourists until 1955. It was not until the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] that the Kremlin was reopened to foreign visitors. The Kremlin Museums were established in 1961 and the complex was among the first Soviet patrimonies inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1990. 

Although the current director of the Kremlin Museums, Elena Gagarina ([[Yuri Gagarin]]'s daughter) advocates a full-scale restoration of the destroyed cloisters, recent developments have been confined to expensive restoration of the original interiors of the Grand Kremlin Palace, which were altered during Stalin's rule. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]] has a suite of rooms in the Kremlin, but divine service in the Kremlin cathedrals is held irregularly, because they are still administrated 
as museums.

==Buildings==

The existing [[Kremlin wall]]s and [[Kremlin towers|towers]] were built by Italian masters over the years 1485 to 1495. The irregular triangle of the Kremlin wall encloses an area of 275,000 square meters (68 acres). Its overall length is 2235 meters (2444 yards), but the height ranges from 5 to 19 metres, depending on the terrain. The wall's thickness is between 3.5 and 6.5 meters. [[Image:Teremnoy palace3.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Terem Palace]].]]

Originally there were eighteen [[Kremlin towers]], but their number increased to twenty in the 17th century. All but three of the towers are square in plan. The highest tower is the Spasskaya, which was built up to its present height of 71 metres in 1625. Most towers were originally crowned with wooden tents; the extant brick tents with strips of colored tiles go back to the 1680s.

[[Cathedral Square in Moscow|Cathedral Square]] is the heart of the Kremlin. It is surrounded by six buildings, including three [[cathedral]]s. The [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] was completed in 1479 to be the main church of Moscow and where all the [[Tsar]]s were crowned. The massive [[limestone]] facade, capped with its five [[gold]]en [[cupola]]s was the design of [[Aristotele Fioravanti]].  Several important metropolitans and patriarchs are buried there, including Peter and [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Makarii]]. The gilded, three-domed [[Cathedral of the Annunciation]] was completed next in 1489, only to be reconstructed to a nine-domed design a century later. On the south-east of the square is the much larger [[Cathedral of the Archangel Michael]] (1508), where almost all the Muscovite monarchs from Ivan Kalita to [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis I of Russia]] are interred. ([[Boris Godunov]] was originally buried there, but was moved to the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Trinity Monastery]].)  [[Image:Cerkov Rizpolozhenia (Kreml).JPG|thumb|[[Church of the Deposition of the Robe|Church of the Deposition]] (1488).]]

There are two domestic churches of the Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow, the [[Church of the Twelve Apostles]] (1653<U+2013>56) and the exquisite one-domed [[Church of the Deposition of the Robe|Church of the Deposition of the Virgin's Robe]], built by [[Pskov]] artisans over the years 1484<U+2013>88 and featuring superb icons and frescoes from 1627 and 1644. 

The other notable structure is the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] on the north-east corner of the square, which is said to mark the exact centre of Moscow and resemble a burning candle. Completed in 1600, it is 81 meters (266&nbsp;ft) high. Until the Russian Revolution, it was the tallest structure in the city, as construction of buildings taller than that was forbidden. Its 21 bells would sound the alarm if any enemy was approaching. The upper part of the structure was destroyed by the French during the Napoleonic Invasion and has, of course, been rebuilt. The [[Tsar bell]], the largest bell in the world, stands on a pedestal next to the tower.

[[Image:Dvenadsatapostolov2.jpg|thumb|left|Church of the Twelve Apostles (1654<U+2013>56).]]

The oldest secular structure still standing is [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]]'s [[Palace of Facets]] (1491), which holds the imperial thrones. The next oldest is the first home of the royal family, the Terem Palace. The original Terem Palace was also commissioned by Ivan III, but most of the existing palace was built in the 17th century. The Terem Palace and the Palace of Facets are linked by the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]]. This was commissioned by Nicholas I in 1838. The largest structure in the Kremlin, it cost an exorbitant sum of eleven million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] to build and more than one billion dollars to renovate in the 1990s. It contains dazzling reception halls, a ceremonial red staircase, private apartments of the tsars, and the lower storey of the Resurrection of Lazarus church (1393), which is the oldest extant structure in the Kremlin and the whole of [[Moscow]]. 

The northern corner of the Kremlin is occupied by [[Arsenal (Kremlin)|the Arsenal]], which was originally built for [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in 1701. The southwestern section of the Kremlin holds the [[Kremlin Armoury|Armoury building]]. Built in 1851 to a [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance Revival]] design, it is currently a museum housing Russian state regalia and Diamond fund.
