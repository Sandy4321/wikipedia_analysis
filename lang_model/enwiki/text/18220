An '''ASW carrier''' ('''Anti-Submarine Warfare carrier''') is a type of small [[aircraft carrier]] whose primary role is to hunt and destroy [[submarine]]s. This type of ship came into existence during the [[Cold War]] as a development of the [[escort carrier]]s used in the ASW role in the North Atlantic during [[World War II]].

==Role==

After World War II, the main naval threat to most western nations was confrontation with the Soviet Union.  The Soviets ended the war with a small navy and took the route of asymmetric confrontation against western surface ship superiority by investing heavily in submarines both for attack and later fielding submarine launched missiles. <ref>[http://www.upi.com/Security_Industry/2008/06/12/Defense_Focus_ASW_dangers_--_Part_1/UPI-74581213308031/ Defense Focus: ASW dangers - Part 1 - UPI.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Several nations who purchased British and US surplus light carriers were most easily able to accommodate slow moving, less expensive, and easy to land antisubmarine aircraft from the 1960s forward such as the [[S-2 Tracker]] which flew from the decks of US, Canadian, Australian, Dutch, Argentine, and Brazilian carriers or [[Breguet Aliz<U+00E9>|Aliz<U+00E9>]] which flew from French and Indian ships and still remain useful especially in the framework of NATO even as newer fighter and strike aircraft were becoming too heavy for the equipment designed for WW-II aircraft.  

Improvement in long range shore based patrol and conventional ship based ASW helicopter capability combined with the increasing difficulty maintaining surplus WW-II carriers lead to most of these ships to be retired or docked by smaller nations from the 1970s to the mid 1980's.  This trend in ASW force draw down only accelerated with the massive reduction in the operational Soviet/Russian submarine fleet which rarely went to sea in large numbers in the 1990s.  Ships that could be called dedicated ASW carriers are now only found with the Japanese navy which operates helicopters and no fixed wing carrier based aircraft of any kind.  Even the United States Navy, the last nation to regularly operate a dedicated fixed wing carrier based ASW aircraft, the [[S-3 Viking]], on its mixed role super carriers had already removed most ASW equipment in the 1990's from this aircraft and has now removed this type from service as of January 2009 without replacement<ref name = "Navy Retires S-3B">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = U.S. Navy Retires Last Lockheed Martin S-3B Viking From Fleet Service | work = | publisher = Lockheed Martin | date =30 January 2009 | url = http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/090130ae_s3b-viking-retirement.html  | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-02-04 }}</ref>.  Interestingly the Argentine Navy currently without much hope of a replacement [[CATOBAR]] carrier its own still trains several times a year landing [[S-2 Tracker|S-2 Turbo Trackers]] aboard the Brazilian carrier [[NAe S<U+00E3>o Paulo|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]].

Much easier to operate from small decks than fixed wing aircraft were ASW helicopters which flew from the decks of nearly all allied conventional carriers to this day and most [[LPH]] or STOVL carriers operated by the Soviet, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British, and Thai navies.  Since the only navy currently building new ASW though-deck helicopter-only ships is Japan, who terms their vessels as helicopter destroyers instead of ASW carriers, it is disputable if a ASW helicopter only vessel is best defined as a ASW carrier or perhaps a new designation.

==List of ASW carriers==

Aircraft carriers and helicopter carriers that had primary ASW duties from the mid 1960's onward.

===ASW aircraft carriers===

;Brazilian Navy
* [[NAeL Minas Gerais|NAeL ''Minas Gerais'']] - one ship (ex-Colossus-class) ASW (retired/scrapped) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters

;French Navy
* [[Arromanches (R 95)|''Arromanches'']] - one ship (ex-Colossus-class) ASW (retired/scrapped) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters

;Italian Navy
* [[Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']] one ship, ASW helicopter carrier 1985-1988, [[STOVL]] fighters and ASW Helicopters carrier 1988-current. 

;[[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]
* [[Hy<U+016B>ga class helicopter destroyer |''Hy<U+016B>ga'']] was commissioned Wednesday, March 18, 2009. It will be stationed in [[Yokosuka]] port, near [[Tokyo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_351718.html |title=Japan gets helicopter carrier |publisher=StraitsTimes.com |date=March 19, 2009}}</ref>

;Spanish Navy
*[[Spanish aircraft carrier D<U+00E9>dalo|''D<U+00E9>dalo'']] - one ship (ex-Independence class) ASW helicopter carrier 1967-1976, STOVL carrier 1976-1989. Strike/ASW (retired/scrapped) [[STOVL]] and Helicopters
*[[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']] one ship [[STOVL]] fighters and Helicopters

;[[Royal Navy]]
* {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}} [[Centaur class aircraft carrier]] In 1979 recommissioned from reserve as a helicopter ASW carrier, due to delays with Invincible. (retired/scrapped)
* {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} [[Centaur class aircraft carrier]]<ref>[http://www.axfordsabode.org.uk/hermdet.htm HMS HERMES - Details<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Converted to helicopter ASW in 1976. (sold to India, renamed [[INS Viraat]])
* [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|Invincible class]] - three ships Strike/ASW/Amphibious Assault [[STOVL]] and Helicopters

The three ships of the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]], were originally designed as through deck cruisers for the ASW role, but ended up also equipped with [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]] STOVL fighters. Following the [[Falklands War]], however, the role of these ships was reconsidered, and they were used as conventional, albeit light, fleet aircraft carriers, in the [[power projection]] role. 

;[[Royal Australian Navy]]
* {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} - one ship (Majestic-class) Strike/ASW (retired/scrapped) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters 

;[[Royal Canadian Navy]]
* {{HMCS|Bonaventure|CVL 22|6}} - one ship (ex-Majestic-class) ASW (retired/scrapped) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters

;Royal Netherlands Navy
* {{HNLMS|Karel Doorman|R81|6}} - one ship (ex-Colossus-class) ASW (retired/sold) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters 

;Soviet/Russian Navy
* [[Moskva class helicopter carrier|''Moskva'' class]] ASW helicopter support ship, rear deck landing pad only(retired/scrapped) Helicopters only
* [[Kiev class aircraft carrier|''Kiev Class'' Cruiser/Carrier]] Guided Missile Cruiser/Limited Air Defense/ASW(retired/sold) [[STOVL]] and Helicopters

;[[United States Navy]]
* [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]] during their careers ships fitted and assigned the CVS designation were ASW carriers with Fixed wing and helicopter anti-submarine aircraft and AEW aircraft, although for a short time some also carried an attack squadron (retired/scrapped) Fixed Wing [[CATOBAR]] and Helicopters
* [[Wasp class amphibious assault ship|''Wasp'' class]], [[Tarawa class amphibious assault ship|''Tarawa'' Class]], and the now retired [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]] [[Amphibious assault ship]]s were given secondary roles of [[Sea Control Ship|Sea Control]] meaning they would deploy with a modified air compliment consisting of Helicopters for ASW coverage and a larger STOVL fighter group for air defense and even limited strike missions.
