'''''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!''''' (abbreviated as '''''SPLGTDP''''') is a 2009 video game based on the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service for the [[Xbox 360]] video game console. The game was developed by [[Doublesix]], in collaboration with South Park Digital Studios and [[Xbox Live Productions]]. ''Let's Go Tower Defense Play'' is a [[tower defense]] game, with the added element of being a fast-paced [[action game]] as well. Thus, players do not only build towers to eliminate destructive forces, but they also have to control multiple characters in order to successfully protect the town of South Park. ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'' is the first [[List of South Park video games|''South Park'' video game]] released after three early titles released between 1998 and 2000. The game costs 800 [[Microsoft Points]].

==Gameplay==
Like in other tower defense games players must destroy waves of enemies using towers strategically placed around a path. In addition players can directly control a character to directly attack the enemies and collect dropped coins in order to buy and place down more towers. In single player, the player switches between each character, whilst multiplayer assigns characters to each player.

==Plot==
The game takes place nine years after the events of [[South Park Rally]] as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] runs over to [[Stan Marsh|Stan's]] house to warn him that 'horrible beings' are attacking South Park. The two are able to defend the household from an army of [[Ginger Kids]] and [[Cow Days|Cows]] before picking up [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and running to their school. Once again, they manage to protect the area, but Cartman receives a phone call from [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who is under attack. After helping Kenny to fight off another horde of enemies, the boys deduce that the one responsible for the mayhem can only be an evil supervillain: [[Butters Stotch|Professor Chaos]].

The boys reach Butters' house and confront Chaos, but he claims that his only evil plan was "to replace all the healthy vitamin water in the pharmacy with boring old regular water". During a battle with another group of enemies, one of Butters' testicles is shattered, so the boys take him to Hell's Pass Hospital and protect it while he is healed. Jimmy runs in to tell the boys to head to Stark's Pond, where they help Jimbo and Ned to stop another group of enemies from destroying the town. Craig directs them to the lair of the [[Pre-School (South Park)|6th Graders]], led by [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|Scott Tenorman]], who have been recruited by the sinister evil that looms over the town.

After defeating Scott and the 6th Graders, Clyde tells the gang to help Mr. Lu Kim to defend the Great Wall of South Park from an army of [[Child Abduction Is Not Funny|Mongolians]]. After a long battle, the boys and Lu Kim are victorious, but only before being redirected once again, this time to the South Park Docks, by Tweek.

The boys defend the Docks from a group of enemies led by [[General Disarray]]. After doing so, Pip attempts to reveal the villain's identity to the boys, but, typically, they reject him before he is able to finish his sentence. The boys head up high into the mountains above South Park to meet Randy, who tells them that they are about to be attacked. They are able to stop [[ManBearPig]] and a mass of Demons from taking over the geology building, before Timmy comes to meet them and they are directed one final time to Downtown South Park. Randy confirms that they must head Downtown to stop the villain, and warns the boys that "he has always been waiting" for them.

The boys stop a huge army of assorted enemies from destroying the town hall before a voice announces 'Game Over' and the game world collapses. After the boys are pulled out into a world beyond the Universe, the villain is revealed to be the Japanese Announcer (who provides voice-overs during gameplay), who has been manipulating South Park and using the boys as pawns. The Announcer then attacks South Park and attempts to storm the town hall himself, but the boys are able to defeat him. Without an ultimate villain controlling South Park, the evil forces disappear and everything returns to normal.

==Development==
After the early success of ''[[South Park]]'', three [[List of South Park video games|video games based on the show]] have been released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]]: ''[[South Park (video game)|South Park]]'' (1998), ''[[South Park: Chef's Luv Shack]]'' (1999), and ''[[South Park Rally]]'' (2000). ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] had little to do with the development of these early titles, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the games.<ref name="sps_mattandtrey_opinion">Question answered by [[Matt Stone]].

''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'' was developed in collaboration with three studios.

As ''South Park'' is often controversial in both [[Subject matter in South Park|its subject matter]] and language use, certain decisions were considered about both the content featured in the game, and its title. While most content was left in the game unaltered, including many short clips from the episodes of the show, some cuts were made specifically for the [[Japan]]ese Microsoft team, for the game to be available for release in Japan.<ref name="dd_legal">{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/games/lgtdp/developer-diaries#358565 |title=''Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'': Developer Diaries: Navigating the Legal Minefield |last=Beeman |first=Ellen |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |publisher=South Park Studios}}</ref> The title for the game went through several iterations.<ref name="comiccon_panel" /><ref name="kotaku_title">{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5323176/south-park-tower-defenses-working-titles-sucked |title=South Park Tower Defense<U+2019>s Working Titles Sucked |last=Fahey |first=Mike |date=July 26, 2009 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref> The original title for the game was ''South Park: Suck My Balls'', but was done away after considering how to censor its title with asterisks on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] service.

After all of these were refused as unacceptable titles for the game, it was decided to name it ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'', which fit in with "the [[Anime|Japanese animation]]-style feel" of the game.<ref name="comiccon_panel" /><ref group="lower-alpha">The occasional usage of incorrect English phrasing in [[Japanese popular culture]], along with the phrase "let's go", were parodied in a song in the Anime-centric ''South Park'' episode "[[Good Times with Weapons]]".</ref> Other problematic issues involved the names of the game's [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]], which are all references to the series. Achievements are publicly visible outside of the game, and there are restrictions on the names and images that can be used in them. Rejected Achievements included the drug-related phrase "[[Chasing the dragon|Chasing the Dragon]]"<ref group="lower-alpha">"Chasing the dragon" refers to the elusive pursuit of the ultimate high in the usage of some particular drug. A gag in the ''South Park'' episode "[[Guitar Queer-O]]" showed an addictive video game called ''Heroin Hero'', in which the character does nothing but inject himself with [[heroin]] while literally chasing a dragon that cannot be caught, only chased. The final version of ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'' does include an Achievement called "Come On. Catch Me.", referring to this scene of the show.</ref> and "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset|Stupid Spoiled Whore]]". Another Achievement was to be titled "[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]", but [[buttocks]] are not allowed to be shown on the service.<ref name="comiccon_panel" />
