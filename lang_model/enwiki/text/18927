'''George Frideric Handel''' (German: '''Georg Friedrich H<U+00E4>ndel'''; {{IPA-de|<U+02C8>h<U+025B>nd<U+0259>l|pron}}; {{birth date|1685|02|23|df=yes}} <U+2013> {{death date|1759|04|14|df=yes}}) was a German-born British [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composer famous for his [[baroque opera|opera]]s, [[oratorio]]s, [[anthem]]s and [[organ concerto]]s. Born in a family indifferent to music, Handel received critical training in Halle, Hamburg and Italy before settling in London (1712) as a naturalized British subject in 1727.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/handel-and-naturalisation/ |title=British Citizen by Act of Parliament: George Frideric Handel |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> By then he was strongly influenced by the great composers of the [[Italian Baroque]] and the middle-German [[polyphony|polyphonic]] choral tradition.

Within fifteen years, Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. In 1737 he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively and addressed the middle class. As ''[[Alexander's Feast (Handel)|Alexander's Feast]]'' (1736) was well received, Handel made a transition to English choral works. After his success with ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) he never performed an Italian opera again. Handel was only partly successful with his performances of English oratorio on mythical and biblical themes, but when he arranged a performance of ''Messiah'' to benefit the [[Foundling Hospital]] (1750) the criticism ended. It has been said that the passion of Handel's oratorios is an ethical one, and that they are hallowed not by liturgical dignity but by moral ideals of humanity.<ref>Bukofzer (2008), p. 337.</ref> Almost blind, and having lived in England for almost fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, with works such as ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' and ''Messiah'' remaining popular. Handel composed more than forty operas in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and [[Authentic performance|original instrumentation]], interest in Handel's [[opera seria|operas]] has grown.

==Early years==
[[File:George Frideric Handel baptismal register.jpg|thumb|left|Handel's baptismal registration (Marienbibliothek in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]])]]

Handel was born in 1685 in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], to [[Georg H<U+00E4>ndel]] and Dorothea Taust.<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|p=1}}</ref> His father, 63 when George Frideric was born, was an eminent barber-surgeon who served the court of [[Saxe-Weissenfels]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>Adams Aileen, K., Hofestadt, B., "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16059526&dopt=Abstract Georg Handel (1622<U+2013>97)]: the barber-surgeon father of George Frideric Handel (1685<U+2013>1759)", Journal of Medical Biography, 2005, Aug; 13(3):142<U+2013>49.</ref> According to Handel's first biographer, [[John Mainwaring]], he "had discovered such a strong propensity to Music, that his father who always intended him for the study of the Civil Law, had reason to be alarmed. He strictly forbade him to meddle with any musical instrument but Handel found means to get a little [[clavichord]] privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep".<ref>{{harvnb|National Portrait Gallery|p=51}}</ref> At an early age Handel became a skilful performer on the harpsichord and pipe organ.<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref>

Handel and his father travelled to [[Weissenfels]] to visit either Handel's half-brother, Carl, or nephew, Georg Christian,<ref>[[Friedrich Chrysander]] states it was not his half-brother but the 10-years older (!) nephew, who had to address George Friedrich as his uncle. [http://www.zeno.org/Musik/M/Chrysander,+Friedrich/G.F.+H%C3%A4ndel/1.+Band/1.+Buch+Jugendzeit+und+Lehrjahre+in+Deutschland/2.+Kindheit zeno.org]</ref> who was serving as valet to [[Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Duke Johann Adolf I]].<ref>Weissenfels is 34 km south of Halle; a one-way trip on foot would have taken them about seven hours. As they went by coach they travelled faster. For more details see: The life of Handel by Victor Schoelcher, [http://books.google.com/books?id=jFNAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false books.google.com]</ref> On this trip, young Handel was lifted onto an organ's stool, where he surprised everyone with his playing.<ref name=GuitarandMandolin>[http://archive.org/details/guitarmandolinbi00bone [[Philip J. Bone]], The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914.]</ref> This performance helped Handel and the duke to convince his father to allow him to take lessons in musical composition and keyboard technique from [[Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow]], the organist of Halle's [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Marienkirche]].<ref name=GuitarandMandolin/> Zachow composed music for the [[Lutheran]] services at the church, and from him Handel learned about [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]], copying and analysing scores, and gained instruction on the [[oboe]], [[violin]], [[harpsichord]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]].<ref name=GuitarandMandolin/> In 1698 Handel played for [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and met [[Giovanni Bononcini]] in Berlin. <!--In 1701 Handel met with Telemann who came to Halle, turning into a life long friend; probably he met [[Attilio Ariosti]] in 1702 -->

==From Halle to Italy==
[[File:Hamburgs Oper.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Opera am G<U+00E4>nsemarkt]] in 1726]]

In 1702, following his father's wishes, Handel started studying law under [[Christian Thomasius]] at the [[University of Halle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keates|1985|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> He earned an appointment for one year as the organist in the former cathedral, by then an evangelical reformed church. Handel seems to have been unsatisfied, and in 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G<U+00E4>nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]]. His first two operas, ''[[Almira]]'' and ''[[Nero (opera)|Nero]]'', were produced in 1705.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=19}}</ref> He produced two other operas, ''[[Daphne (Handel opera)|Daphne]]'' and ''[[Florindo]]'', in 1708. It is unclear whether Handel directed these performances.

According to [[John Mainwaring|Mainwaring]], in 1706 Handel travelled to Italy at the invitation of [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Ferdinando de' Medici]], but Mainwaring must have been confused. It was [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]], whom Handel had met in 1703<U+2013>1704 in Hamburg.<ref>Handel as Orpheus: voice and desire in the chamber cantatas by Ellen T. Harris, [http://books.google.com/books?id=w1z2sDRi4NIC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=Handel+Gian+Gastone&source=bl&ots=FX0gA8_1Tj&sig=qTDH00c4hR7NhSuoF7x-R5cs_5w&hl=nl&ei=Q10IS4GqCYSi4QbQ4pHECw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Handel%20Gian%20Gastone&f=false books.google.com]</ref> Ferdinando tried to make Florence Italy's musical capital, attracting the leading talents of his day. He had a keen interest in opera. In Italy Handel met [[librettist]] [[Antonio Salvi]], with whom he later collaborated. Handel left for Rome and, since opera was (temporarily) banned in the [[Papal States]], composed sacred music for the Roman clergy. His famous ''[[Dixit Dominus (Handel)|Dixit Dominus]]'' (1707) is from this era. He also composed [[cantata]]s in [[pastoral]] style for musical gatherings in the palaces of cardinals [[Pietro Ottoboni (cardinal)|Pietro Ottoboni]], [[Benedetto Pamphili]] and [[Colonna family|Carlo Colonna]]. Two [[oratorio]]s, ''[[La Resurrezione]]'' and ''Il Trionfo del Tempo'', were produced in a private setting for [[Ruspoli#The. first Prince of Cerveteri <U+2013> Francesco Maria Ruspoli|Ruspoli]] and Ottoboni <!--Better, which opera house there?-->in 1709 and 1710, respectively. ''[[Rodrigo (opera)|Rodrigo]]'', his first all-Italian opera, was produced in the [[Theatres in Florence|Cocomero theatre]] in Florence in 1707.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref> ''[[Agrippina (opera)|Agrippina]]'' was first produced in 1709 at [[Teatro Malibran|Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo]], owned by the Grimanis. The opera, with a [[libretto]] by Cardinal [[Vincenzo Grimani]], and according to Mainwaring{{who|date=March 2013}} it ran for 27 nights successively. The audience, thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style,<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|Knapp|1987|p=129}}</ref> applauded for ''Il caro Sassone'' ("the dear Saxon"<U+2014>referring to Handel's German origins).

==Move to London==
[[File:GeorgIvonGro<U+00DF>britannienGeorgFriedrichHaendelHamman.jpg|thumb|George Frideric Handel ''(left)'' and [[George I of Great Britain and Ireland|King George I]] on the [[River Thames]], 17 July 1717, by [[:fr:<U+00C9>douard Jean Conrad Hamman|<U+00C9>douard Jean Conrad Hamman]] (1819<U+2013>88).]]

In 1710, Handel became ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' to German prince George, the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Hanover]], who in 1714 would become [[George I of Great Britain and Ireland|King George I of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=38}}</ref> He visited [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]] and her husband in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] on his way to London in 1710. With his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'', based on ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|La Gerusalemme Liberata]]'' by the Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]], Handel enjoyed great success, although it was composed quickly, with many borrowings from his older Italian works.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|Knapp|1987|pp=173, 180}}</ref> This work contains one of Handel's favourite arias, ''Cara sposa, amante cara'', and the famous [[Lascia ch'io pianga]].

In 1712, Handel decided to settle permanently in England. He received a yearly income of <U+00A3>200 from [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] after composing for her the ''[[Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate]]'', first performed in 1713.<ref>{{harvnb|National Portrait Gallery|p=88}}</ref><ref>There is a tantalising suggestion by Handel's biographer, Jonathan Keates, that he may have come to London in 1710 and settled in 1712 as a spy for the eventual Hanoverian successor to Queen Anne. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7992395.stm news.bbc.co.uk]</ref>

One of his most important patrons was [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork|The 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork]], a young and incredibly wealthy member of an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|National Portrait Gallery|p=92}}</ref> For the young Lord Burlington, Handel wrote ''[[Amadigi di Gaula]]'', a [[Magician (fantasy)|magic]]al opera, about a [[damsel in distress]], based on the tragedy by [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]].

The conception of an opera as a coherent structure was slow to capture Handel's imagination<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|Knapp|1987|pp=286}}</ref> and he renounced it for five years. In July 1717 Handel's ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'' was performed more than three times on the [[Thames]] for the King and his guests. It is said the compositions spurred reconciliation between the King and Handel.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=77}}</ref> <!-- Had they fallen out? -->

===Cannons (1717<U+2013>18)===

[[File:Georg Friedrich H<U+00E4>ndel 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Chandos portrait. [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|The 1st Duke of Chandos]] was an important patron for Handel.]]
In 1717 Handel became house composer at [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]] in [[Middlesex]], where he laid the cornerstone for his future choral compositions in the twelve ''[[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Chandos]] Anthems''.<ref>Bukofzer (2008), pp. 333<U+2013>35</ref> [[Romain Rolland]] stated that these anthems were as important for his oratorios as the cantatas were for his operas.<ref>Rolland, R. (1910) H<U+00E4>ndel, p. 54. Beroemde musici. Deel XVIII.</ref> Another work he wrote for [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|The 1st Duke of Chandos]], the owner of Cannons, was ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'': during Handel's lifetime it was his most performed work. [[Winton Dean]] wrote, "the music catches breath and disturbs the memory".<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|Knapp|1987|p=209}}</ref>

In 1719 the Duke of Chandos became one of the main subscribers to Handel's new opera company, the [[Royal Academy of Music (company)|Royal Academy of Music]], but his patronage of music declined after he lost money in the [[South Sea Company|South Sea bubble]], which burst in 1720 in one of history's greatest financial cataclysms.
Handel himself invested in South Sea stock in 1716, when prices were low<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|pp=70<U+2013>71}}</ref> and sold before 1720.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jkt2z Handel's Finances], BBC</ref>

In May 1719, [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|The 1st Duke of Newcastle]], the [[Lord Chamberlain]], ordered Handel to look for new singers.<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|p=89}}</ref> Handel travelled to [[Dresden]] to attend the newly built opera. He saw ''Teofane'' by [[Antonio Lotti]], and engaged the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded by a group of aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or [[opera seria]]. Handel may have invited John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son [[John Christopher Smith|Johann Christoph Schmidt]], to become his secretary and [[amanuensis]].<!--assistants in what respect? most of the time probably copying his music. It is said Schmidt left his wife behind.--><ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2006|p=226}} According to Dean they could not have reached London before 1716. In 1743, Smith wrote in a letter that he had been in Handel's service for 24 years.</ref> By 1723 he had moved into a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented for the rest of his life.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=387}}</ref> This house, where he rehearsed, copied music and sold tickets, is now the [[Handel House Museum]].<ref>In 2000, the upper stories of 25 Brook Street were leased to the Handel House Trust, and after extensive restoration, the Handel House Museum opened to the public with an events programme of baroque music.</ref> During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three outstanding and successful operas, ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'', ''[[Tamerlano]]'' and ''[[Rodelinda (opera)|Rodelinda]]''. Handel's operas are filled with [[da capo aria]]s, such as ''[[Svegliatevi nel core]]''. After composing ''Silete venti'', he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. ''[[Scipio (opera)|Scipio]]'', from which the regimental slow march of the British [[Grenadier Guards]] is derived,<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|p=194}}</ref> was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of [[Faustina Bordoni]].

In 1727 Handel was commissioned to write four anthems for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] ceremony of [[George II of Great Britain and Ireland|King George II]]. One of these, ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'', has been played at every British coronation ceremony since.<ref>{{cite web | author = Imogen Levy | url = http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations/guide-to-the-coronation-service | title = Guide to the Coronation Service | publisher = Westminster Abbey | date = 2 June 1953 | accessdate =28 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1728 John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' premiered at [[Lisle's Tennis Court|Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]] and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the longest run in theatre history up to that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html|title="Longest running Plays in London and New York", Stage Beauty}}</ref> After nine years Handel's contract was ended but he soon started a new company.

The [[Her Majesty's Theatre|Queen's Theatre]] at the Haymarket (now Her Majesty's Theatre), established in 1705 by architect and playwright [[John Vanbrugh]], quickly became an opera house.<ref>''theatrical monopoly'' in Banham, Martin ''The Cambridge guide to theatre'' pp. 1105 (Cambridge University Press, 1995) ISBN 0-521-43437-8</ref> Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 of Handel's operas premi<U+00E8>red there.<ref>[http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm ''Handel's Compositions''] GFHandel.org, Retrieved 21 December 2007</ref> In 1729 Handel became joint manager of the Theatre with [[John James Heidegger]].

Handel travelled to Italy to engage seven new singers. He composed seven <!--how many? details within a few days--> more operas, but the public came to hear the singers rather than the music.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/889430/Handel-by-Edward-J-Dent Scribd.com]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> After two commercially successful English oratorios ''[[Esther (Handel)|Esther]]'' and ''[[Deborah (Handel)|Deborah]]'', he was able to invest again in the [[South Sea Company]]. Handel reworked his ''Acis and Galatea'' which then became his most successful work ever. Handel failed to compete with the [[Opera of the Nobility]], who engaged musicians such as [[Johann Adolf Hasse]], [[Nicolo Porpora]] and the famous castrato [[Farinelli]]. The strong support by [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]] caused conflicts in the royal family. In March 1734 Handel directed a wedding anthem ''This is the day which the Lord hath made'', and a [[serenata]] ''[[Parnasso in Festa]]'' for [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne of Hanover]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=33}}</ref>

===Opera at Covent Garden (1734<U+2013>41)===
In 1733 the [[William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] received a letter with the following sentence: "Handel became so arbitrary a prince, that the Town murmurs". The board of chief investors expected Handel to retire when his contract ended, but Handel immediately looked for another theatre. In cooperation with [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] he started his third company at [[Covent Garden Theatre]]. Rich was renowned for his spectacular productions. He suggested Handel use his small chorus and introduce the dancing of [[Marie Sall<U+00E9>]], for whom Handel composed ''[[Terpsichore]]''. In 1735 he introduced organ concertos between the acts. For the first time Handel allowed [[Gioacchino Conti]], who had no time to learn his part, to substitute arias.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2006|pp=274<U+2013>284}}</ref> Financially, ''[[Ariodante]]'' was a failure, although he introduced ballet suites at the end of each act.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2006|p=288}}</ref> [[Alcina]], his last opera with a magic content, and ''[[Alexander's Feast (Handel)|Alexander's Feast]] or the Power of Music'' based on John Dryden's ''[[Alexander's Feast (Dryden)|Alexander's Feast]]'' starred [[Anna Maria Strada del P<U+00F2>]] and [[John Beard (tenor)|John Beard]].

In April 1737, at age 52, Handel apparently suffered a stroke which disabled the use of four fingers on his right hand, preventing him from performing.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=395}}</ref> <!--He also complained of difficulties in focussing his eyesight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}--> In summer the disorder seemed at times to affect his understanding. Nobody expected that Handel would ever be able to perform again. But whether the affliction was rheumatism, a stroke or a nervous breakdown, he recovered remarkably quickly .<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2006|p=283}}</ref> To aid his recovery, Handel had travelled to [[Aachen]], a spa in Germany. During six weeks he took long hot baths, and ended up playing the organ for a surprised audience.<ref>For new insights on this episode, see Ilias Chrissochoidis: "Handel Recovering: Fresh Light on his Affairs in 1737", ''Eighteenth-Century Music'' 5/2 (2008): 237<U+2013>44.</ref>

''[[Deidamia (opera)|Deidamia]]'', his last opera, was performed three times in 1741. Handel gave up the opera business, while he enjoyed more success with his English oratorios.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}}

===Oratorio===

''[[Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno]]'', an [[allegory]], Handel's first oratorio<ref>Marx, J.H. (1998) H<U+00E4>ndels Oratorien, Oden und Serenaten, p. 243.</ref> was composed in Italy in 1707, followed by ''[[La Resurrezione]]'' in 1708 which uses material from the Bible. The circumstances of ''[[Esther (Handel)|Esther]]'' and its first performance, possibly in 1718, are obscure.<ref>{{harvnb|National Portrait Gallery|p=157}}</ref> Another 12 years had passed when an act of piracy caused him to take up ''Esther'' once again.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=15}} Handels Messiah. A distinguished authority on Handel discusses the origins, composition, and sources of one the great choral works of western civilization.</ref> Three earlier performances<!-- , the first one held on Handel's 47 birthday, --> aroused such interest that they naturally prompted the idea of introducing it to a larger public. Next came ''[[Deborah (Handel)|Deborah]]'', strongly coloured by the Anthems<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=26}}</ref> and ''[[Athalia (oratorio)|Athaliah]]'', his first English Oratorio.<ref>Marx, J.H. (1998) H<U+00E4>ndels Oratorien, Oden und Serenaten, p. 48.</ref> In these three oratorios Handel laid foundation for the traditional use of the chorus which marks his later oratorios.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=66}}</ref> Handel became sure of himself, broader in his presentation, and more diverse in his composition.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=49}}</ref>

It is evident how much he learned from [[Arcangelo Corelli]] about writing for instruments, and from [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] about writing for the solo voice; but there is no single composer who taught him how to write for chorus.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=40}}</ref> Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists by English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=33}}</ref> Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the performers appeared in a black suit.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=19}}</ref>

[[File:Joseph Goupy, 1754 - GFHandel.jpg|thumb|[[Caricature]] of Handel by [[Joseph Goupy]] (1754)]]

In 1736 Handel produced ''[[Alexander's Feast (Handel)|Alexander's Feast]]''. [[John Beard (tenor)|John Beard]] appeared for the first time as one of Handel's principal singers and became Handel's permanent tenor soloist for the rest of Handel's life.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=37}}</ref> The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works. In ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', Handel was collaborating with [[Charles Jennens]] and experimenting with three trombones, a carillon and extra-large military kettledrums (from the [[Tower of London]]), to be sure "...it will be most excessive noisy".<ref>{{harvnb|National Portrait Gallery|p=165}}</ref> ''Saul'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]'' both from 1739 head the list of great, mature oratorios, in which the da capo and [[dal segno]] aria became the exception and not the rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|pp=16, 39<U+2013>41}}</ref>
''Israel in Egypt'' consists of little else but choruses, borrowing from the ''[[The Ways of Zion Do Mourn / Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline|Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline]]''. In his next works Handel changed his course. In these works he laid greater stress on the effects of orchestra and soloists; the chorus retired into the background.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1972|p=78}}</ref> ''[[L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato]]'' has a rather diverting character; the work is light and fresh.

During the summer of 1741, [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire|The 3rd Duke of Devonshire]] invited Handel to [[Dublin]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], to give concerts for the benefit of local hospitals.<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|pp=40<U+2013>41}}</ref> His ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' was first performed at the New Music Hall in [[Fishamble Street]] on 13 April 1742, with 26 boys and five men from the combined choirs of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals participating.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|1966|p=48}}</ref> Handel secured a balance between soloists and chorus which he never surpassed.

In 1747 Handel wrote his oratorio ''Alexander Balus''. This work was produced at Covent Garden Theatre, on March 23, 1748, and to the aria ''Hark! hark! He strikes the golden lyre'', Handel wrote the acccompaniment for [[mandolin]], [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], and [[violoncello]].<ref name=GuitarandMandolin/>

==Later years==
[[File:Haendel.jpg|thumb|left|George Frideric Handel in 1733, by [[Balthasar Denner]] (1685<U+2013>1749)]]

In 1749 Handel composed ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''; 12,000 people attended the first performance.<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|pp=297<U+2013>98}}</ref> In 1750 he arranged a performance of ''Messiah'' to benefit the [[Foundling Hospital]]. The performance was considered a great success and was followed by annual concerts that continued throughout his life. In recognition of his patronage, Handel was made a governor of the Hospital the day after his initial concert. He bequeathed a copy of ''Messiah'' to the institution upon his death.<ref>{{harvnb |Young|1966|p=56}}</ref> His involvement with the Foundling Hospital is today commemorated with a permanent exhibition in London's [[Foundling Museum]], which also holds the ''Gerald Coke Handel Collection''. In addition to the Foundling Hospital, Handel also gave to a charity that assisted impoverished musicians and their families.

In August 1750, on a journey back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a carriage accident between [[The Hague]] and [[Haarlem]] in the Netherlands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=63}}</ref> In 1751 one eye started to fail. The cause was a [[cataract]] which was operated on by the great charlatan [[John Taylor (oculist)|Chevalier Taylor]]. This did not improve his eyesight, but possibly made it worse.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}} He died eight years later in 1759 at home in Brook Street, at age 74. The last performance he attended was of ''Messiah''. Handel was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Young|1966|p=60}}</ref> More than three thousand mourners attended his funeral, which was given full state honours.

Handel never married, and kept his personal life private. His initial [[Will of George Frideric Handel|will]] bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his niece Johanna, however four [[Codicil (will)|codicil]]s distributed much of his estate to other relations, servants, friends and charities.<ref name=Muller>''The Letters and Writings of George Frideric Handel'' by Erich H. M<U+00FC>ller, 1935 (SBN 8369-5286-3)</ref>

Handel owned an [[George Frideric Handel's art collection|art collection]] that was auctioned posthumously in 1760.<ref name="em.oxfordjournals.com - McGeary">{{cite web|url=http://em.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/4/533.full |title=Handel as art collector <U+2013> Thomas McGeary |publisher=Em.oxfordjournals.org |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The auction catalogue listed approximately seventy paintings and ten prints (other paintings were bequeathed).<ref name="em.oxfordjournals.com - McGeary" />

==Works==
[[File:Senesino.jpg|thumb|[[Senesino]], the famous [[castrato]] from [[Siena]]]]

:''Main articles: [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel]] and [[List of operas by Handel]].
Handel's compositions include 42 operas, 29 oratorios, more than 120 cantatas, trios and duets, numerous arias, chamber music, a large number of ecumenical pieces, odes and serenatas, and 16 organ concerti. His most famous work, the oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with its "Hallelujah" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music and has become the centrepiece of the Christmas season. Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the [[Handel organ concertos Op.4|Organ Concertos Op.4]] and [[Handel organ concertos Op.7|Op.7]], together with the Opus 3 and [[Handel concerti grossi Op.6|Opus 6 concerti grossi]]; the latter incorporate an earlier organ concerto ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'' in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his sixteen keyboard suites, especially ''[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]''.

Handel introduced previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the [[viola d'amore]] and [[violetta marina]] (''Orlando''), the lute (''Ode for St. Cecilia's Day''), three trombones (Saul), clarinets or small high cornetts (''Tamerlano''), [[theorbo]], French horn (''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]''), [[lyrichord]], [[double bassoon]], [[viola da gamba]], [[bell chimes]], [[positive organ]], and harp (''Giulio Cesare'', ''Alexander's Feast'').<ref>Textbook in CD ''Sacred Arias with Harp & Harp Duets by Rachel Ann Morgan & Edward Witsenburg.</ref>

===Catalogues===
Between 1787 and 1797 [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works<U+2014>however it was far from complete.<ref>Winton Dean, ''The New Grove Handel.'' NY: Norton, 1982, p. 116. ISBN 0-393-30086-2.</ref> Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (found by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |title=A short history of editing Handel |author=The Halle Handel Edition |accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>

The 105-volume [[H<U+00E4>ndel-Gesellschaft]] ("German Handel Society") edition was published between 1858 and 1902<U+2014>mainly due to the efforts of [[Friedrich Chrysander]]. For modern performance, the realisation of the basso continuo reflects 19th century practice. Vocal scores drawn from the edition were published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in London, but some scores, such as the vocal score to Samson are incomplete.

The continuing [[Hallische H<U+00E4>ndel-Ausgabe]] edition was first inaugurated in 1955 in the [[Halle (region)|Halle]] region in Saxony-Anhalt, Eastern Germany. It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera Serse was published with the title character recast as a tenor reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}} 

Between 1978 and 1986 the German academic [[Bernd Baselt]] catalogued Handel's works in his ''[[H<U+00E4>ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' publication. The catalogue has achieved wide acceptance and is used as the modern numbering system, with each of Handel's works designated an "HWV" number, for example ''Messiah'' is catalogued as "HWV 56".

==Legacy==
[[File:Masquerade at the King's Theatre Haymarket c1724.jpg|thumb|A Masquerade at the King's Theatre, Haymarket (c. 1724)]]
Handel's works were collected and preserved by two men: [[Sir Samuel Hellier]], a country squire whose musical acquisitions form the nucleus of the Shaw-Hellier Collection,<ref>Best, Terence, ed. ''Handel collections and their history'', a collection of conference papers given by the international panel of distinguished Handel scholars. Clarendon Press, 1993</ref> and the abolitionist [[Granville Sharp]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=obM_AAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PR12#v=onepage&f=false|title=Memoirs of Granville Sharp|editor=Prince Hoare|publisher=Colburn|quote=...he had a voluminous collection of Handel's scores...|year=1820|page=XII}}</ref> The catalogue accompanying the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] exhibition marking the tercentenary of the composer's birth calls them two men of the late eighteenth century "who have left us solid evidence of the means by which they indulged their enthusiasm".<ref>p 239. ''Handel, a celebration of his life and times, 1685<U+2013>1759''. Jacob Simon, National Portrait Gallery (Great Britain), 1985.</ref>

After his death, Handel's Italian operas fell into obscurity, except for selections such as the aria from ''[[Serse]]'', "[[Ombra mai f<U+00F9>]]". The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated a German version of ''Messiah'' and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by enormous choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions.

Since the [[early music revival]] many of the forty-two operas he wrote have been performed in opera houses and concert halls. <!--''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' (1724), ''[[Tamerlano]]'' (1724) and ''[[Rodelinda (opera)|Rodelinda]]'' (1725) each on a libretto by [[Nicola Francesco Haym]], stand out and are considered as [[masterpiece]]s, each in a different style.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}-->

Handel's music was studied by composers such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven

Recent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (music drama)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (oratorio)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes performed onstage by small chamber ensembles. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.

[[File:HandelVA.jpg|thumb|left|A carved marble statue of Handel, created for the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] in 1738 by [[Louis-Fran<U+00E7>ois Roubiliac]], and now preserved in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]].]]

Handel's work was edited by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] (40 vols., London, 1787<U+2013>1797), and by [[Friedrich Chrysander]], for the German [[H<U+00E4>ndel-Gesellschaft]] (105 vols., Leipzig, 1858<U+2013>1902).

H<U+00E4>ndel adopted the spelling "George Frideric Handel" on his naturalisation as a [[British subject]], and this spelling is generally used in [[English-speaking countries]]. The original form of his name, Georg Friedrich H<U+00E4>ndel, is generally used in Germany and elsewhere, but he is known as "Haendel" in France. Another composer with a similar name, Handl or H<U+00E4>ndl, was an Austrian from [[Carniola]] and is more commonly known as [[Jacobus Gallus]].

===Reception===
Handel has generally been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both in his own time and since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/13/composer6.shtml |title=BBC Press Release |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> [[Bach]] attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet with Handel while he was visiting [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=23}}</ref> [[Mozart]] is reputed to have said of him, "Handel understands [[Affekt|affect]] better than any of us.

}}</ref> To [[Beethoven]] he was "the master of us all... the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb".<ref name="YoungMM" /> Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel's music when he said, "Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means".

===Homages===
[[File:Commemoration of Handel 1784.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Handel Commemoration]] in Westminster Abbey, 1784]]
After Handel's death, many composers wrote works based on or inspired by his music. The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, "The Age of Bach and Handel", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on <U+2018>See the conqu<U+2019>ring hero comes<U+2019> from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord. In 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]). Several works by the French composer [[F<U+00E9>lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.

===Veneration===
Handel is honoured with a [[feast day]] on 28 July in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (US)]], with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Henry Purcell]]; in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church]], with J.S. Bach and [[Heinrich Sch<U+00FC>tz]]; and in the calendar of saints prepared by [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]] for the use of [[The United Methodist Church]], with J.S. Bach.<ref>''For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'', ed. by Clifton F. Guthrie (Order of Saint Luke Publications, 1995, ISBN 1-878009-25-7) p. 161.</ref>
