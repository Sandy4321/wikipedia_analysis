==Biography==

Little was born in [[Douglas]], [[Isle of Man]] in 1949. She attended school in the parish of [[Rushen]] and [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]] and was educated there to secondary level. From 1968 to 1971 she read [[social sciences]] at [[Surrey University]] where she graduated with a [[first class honours]] degree. She went to volunteer as a teacher of mathematics with [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] in [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Nigeria]]. Subsequently she attended the [[University of London]] and the University of Sussex to embark on a career in [[education]] and [[international development]].

==Contributions to education and development==

Little is well known in the field of international and comparative education for her approach to [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and [[Actor<U+2013>network theory|actor]] perspectives alongside the [[Social structure|structural]] approaches of [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. This involves questioning conventional behavioural assumptions in the [[social sciences]] used in analysing the processes of policy formulation and implementation, particularly at the levels of international agenda-setting and national adoption. The approach is perhaps best illustrated in her extensive body of work around <U+2018>[[Education For All]]<U+2019> - a goal in whose pursuit Little has invested considerable intellectual and professional endeavour.

Little adopts an inter-disciplinary perspective, drawing concepts from development studies, social psychology, economics and sociology yet rooted in observation, experience and insight at the [[grass roots]] level. Her analyses emphasises [[Structure and agency|agency]] alongside [[Structure and agency|structure]], resisting an approach implicit in much comparative work which subordinates the personal, local and national to the universal and global and assumes North-South conceptual transferability, paying little attention to context. Little views the interactions in the process of learning from the perspective of the learner and those in the process of development from the perspective of the actors and structural forces at the local and national levels. Her 1988 inaugural professorial lecture, ''Learning from Developing Countries'',<ref>[http://edc75y.ioe.ac.uk/pdfs/little.pdf Learning from Developing Countries: An Inaugural Lecture], Institute of Education, University of London, 1988</ref> encapsulates the key tenets of her approach and remains both an influential contribution to the field and a key frame of reference for her own work.

In the 1994 book ''Beyond Jomtien: Implementing Primary Education for All'', Little presents a range of initiatives from the 1970s and 80s which pre-dated the 1990 World Conference on [[Education For All]] (WCEFA) in [[Jomtien]] to universalise access to primary schooling, reminding followers of educational development that donor-led initiatives are only part of the [[Education For All]] story.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Jomtien : implementing primary education for all|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780333594414|editor=Angela Little, Wim Hoppers, Roy Gardner}}</ref> 

Her 1999 book, ''Labouring to Learn: towards a political economy of education and plantations in Sri Lanka'', combines historical perspective with the seldom heard voice of Indian [[Plantation]] [[Tamil people|Tamils]] in [[Sri Lanka]], unravelling their long and painstaking road to [[universal education]]al access over a period of a century and a half.<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Angela W.|title=Labouring to learn : towards a political economy of plantations, people and education in Sri Lanka|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan [u.a.]|location=Basingstoke [u.a.]|isbn=9780333674291|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> 

Little's 2006 book, ''Education for All and Multigrade Teaching: challenges and opportunities'', traces the development of the current form and universal ideal of monograded teaching and argues that the [[de facto]] form of schooling for millions of learners and their teachers worldwide continues to be multigraded. She argues that the [[Education For All]] movement, alongside national governments, have ignored and continue to neglect this reality. Little argues for a radical reorientation of curriculum development and [[teacher education]] in recognition of multigrade systems in the pursuit of [[Education For All]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Angela W.|title=Education for all and multigrade teaching : challenges and opportunities|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9781402066474|edition=[2. pr., softcover]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Professor Angela Little: multigrade schooling] - 2009 recording of Angela Little discussing multigrade schooling - recording on YouTube|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWD4Yar9MK0|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> 

Little challenges assumptions in [[Human Capital Theory]] about [[education]] and [[productivity]] and about motivations for education and learning in her studies of learners and workers in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mexico]], [[Ghana]] and [[Malaysia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Angela|title=Motivating Learning and the Development of Human Capital|journal=Compare|year=2003|volume=33|issue=4|pages=437<U+2013>452}}</ref> She examines approaches to academic success and failure from across the social sciences, setting them against notions held by learners in a comparative study in the [[UK]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Her work on [[motivation theory]] challenges the relationships assumed by the Diploma Disease thesis between [[intrinsic motivation]] and [[extrinsic motivation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Angela|title=Why do students learn? : a six-country study of student motivation|year=1987|publisher=Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex|location=Brighton, England|isbn=0903354772}}</ref>  Little<U+2019>s work on the globalisation of education questions the [[neo-liberal]] orthodoxy and addresses the neglected but central role of context in the determination of costs and benefits, by way of case studies covering [[China]], [[India]], [[Kenya]] and [[Sri Lanka]].
