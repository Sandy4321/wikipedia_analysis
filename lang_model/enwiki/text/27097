'''''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences''''' is an [[academic journal]] published by the Office for History of Science and Technology at [[University of California, Berkeley]] devoted to the study of the intellectual and social history of the physical sciences (including [[history of physics|physics]], [[history of chemistry|chemistry]], and [[history of astronomy|astronomy]]) and the biological sciences (including [[history of biology|biology]], [[biophysics]], and [[history of genetics|genetics]]), from the 17th century to the modern era. 

The journal was founded by Russell McCormmach, who edited its first ten annual volumes, which bore the title '''''Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences'''''.  [[John L. Heilbron]] took over as editor in 1980 and in 1985 added "Biological" to the title in an effort to encourage more disciplinary variety in submissions.  In 2008 Cathryn Carson will take over as head of the editorial committee and the title will change again, this time to ''''[[Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences]]''''.

Its early annual volumes included seminal articles by [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[John L. Heilbron]], and [[Paul Forman]], as well as influential forewords by McCormmach.  It published biannually under Heilbron and beginning in 2008 will become a quarterly.
