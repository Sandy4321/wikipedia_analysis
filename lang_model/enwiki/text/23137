'''George Edwards''' was a Lieutenant with the 57th Regiment, assigned to the [[Brisbane]] Convict settlement in the 1830<U+2019>s. Edwards was born in Hastings, Sussex, England, on the 2nd February, 1795. He joined the British Army, at the age of 24, as an Ensign. In January 1827, Edwards sailed on the convict ship Asia, from Deptford to Sydney, commanding a detachment of 1 sergeant, I corporal and 16 soldiers as guards of the convicts. In October of the same year, Edwards was promoted to Lieutenant, before the ship docked in Sydney in March 1828. 

In October 1828, Edwards was posted to the [[History of Brisbane|Moreton Bay penal settlement.]] Following the death of Captain [[Patrick Logan]] (the Moreton Bay Commandant) Edwards took over the responsibility of the Department of Works at Moreton Bay from the in-coming Commandant James Clunie. It was Edwards who made the official report of Logan<U+2019>s death to his Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel Allan in Sydney.
