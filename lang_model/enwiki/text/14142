'''Antarctica''' ({{Audio-IPA|en-us-Antarctica.ogg|/<U+00E6>n<U+02C8>t<U+0251>rkt<U+026A>k<U+0259>/}}) is  [[Earth]]'s southernmost [[continent]], overlying the [[South Pole]]. It is situated in the [[southern hemisphere]], almost entirely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. At 14.4 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (5.4 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by [[ice]], which averages at least 1.6 kilometres (1.0&nbsp;mi) in thickness. 

On average, Antarctica is the coldest, driest and windiest continent, and has the highest average [[elevation]] of all the continents.<ref>{{cite web | title=National Geophysical Data Center | publisher=National Satellite, Data, and Information Service| url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html | accessdaymonth=9 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Since there is little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], except at the coasts, the interior of the continent is technically the largest [[desert]] in the world. There are no permanent human residents. Only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguin]]s, [[seals]], [[moss]]es, [[lichen]], and many types of [[algae]].

The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanized]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ''<U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE>'' (''antarktik<U+00ED>''), feminine of ''<U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>'' (''antarktikos'')<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 Antarktikos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref>, meaning "opposite to the north"<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek&source=web&ots=ACmVhnUkbo&sig=IbN0OK9FBy29RPzGdDqZevrlylk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result</ref>. Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the Russian expedition of [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev|Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. However, the continent remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation. The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer [[John George Bartholomew]]. Antarctica is considered a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200 mm (8 inches) along the coast and far less inland.<ref>http://www.worldalmanac.com/blog/2007/01/the_world_at_a_glance_surprisi.html</ref>

The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in 1959 by twelve countries; to date, forty-six countries have signed the treaty. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of many nationalities and with different research interests.<ref name="cia">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#People|title=Antarctica - The World Factbook|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>

Belief in the existence of a ''Terra Australis''<U+2014>a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and [[North Africa]]<U+2014>had existed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] (1st century AD), who suggested the idea to preserve the [[symmetry]] of all known [[landmass]]es in the world. Depictions of a large southern landmass were common in maps such as the early 16th century [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Piri Reis map]]. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.

European maps continued to show this hypothetical land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, [[HMS Resolution (Cook)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.<ref>{{cite web | author=The Mariners' Museum | title=Age of Exploration: John Cook | url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php | accessdaymonth=12 February | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Cook in fact came within about {{convert|75|mi|km}} of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.<ref> James Cook, ''The Journals'', edited by Philip Edwards.

Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820, three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the two-ship expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] reached a point within 32 kilometers (20&nbsp;mi) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there. The first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] in [[Western Antarctica]] on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838<U+2013>42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], Australia, into the [[Antarctic Ocean]], as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]". That part of Antarctica was later named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it maintains to this day.

In 1841, explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named for him). He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (also named for him). [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] are named after two ships from his expedition: [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and ''[[HMS Terror (1813)|Terror]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm|title=South-Pole - Exploring Antarctica|accessdate=2006-02-12|publisher=south-pole.com}}</ref>  [[Mercator Cooper]] landed in [[Eastern Antarctica]] on 26 January 1853.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm|title=Antarctic Circle - Antarctic First|date=2005-02-09|accessdate=2006-02-12}}</ref>
[[Image:Shackleton expedition.jpg|left|thumb|[[Endurance (1912 ship)|''The Endurance'']] at night during [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1914.]]
During an [[Exploration|expedition]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1907, parties led by [[T. W. Edgeworth David]] became the first to climb [[Mount Erebus]] and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Douglas Mawson]], who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=6740|title=''Tannatt William Edgeworth David''|publisher=Australian Government Antarctic Division|accessdate=2006-02-07}}</ref> In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 <U+2013> February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the [[Beardmore Glacier]]), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. On 14 December 1911, an [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition]] led by Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] from the ship ''[[Fram]]'' became the first to reach the geographic [[South Pole]], using a route from the [[Bay of Whales]] and up the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000101.htm|title=''Roald Amundsen''|publisher=south-pole.com|accessdate=2006-02-09}}</ref> One month later, the ill-fated [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott Expedition]] reached the pole.

[[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited with implementing mechanized land transport on the continent and conducting extensive geological and biological research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.70south.com/information/antarctic-history/explorers/richardbyrd|title=Richard Byrd|publisher=70South.com|accessdate=2006-02-12}}</ref> However, it was not until 31 October 1956 that anyone set foot on the South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral [[George J. Dufek]] successfully landed an aircraft there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/datesoct.htm|title=Dates in American Naval History: October|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=2006-02-12}}</ref>

The first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the  [[New Zealand]]er [[David Henry Lewis]], in a 10-meter steel sloop ''Ice Bird''.

Centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. It covers more than 14 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (5.4 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times larger than Europe. The coastline measures 17,968 kilometres (11,160&nbsp;mi) and is mostly characterized by [[ice]] formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[West Antarctica|Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet]] of ice averaging at least 1.6 kilometres (1.0&nbsp;mi) thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about 60 metres (200&nbsp;ft).<ref name="howstuffworks">{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2006-02-12}}</ref> In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|sp=uk}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]] the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geological timescale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, [[Ice sheet dynamics|flow]] to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]].

[[East Antarctica]] lies on the [[Indian Ocean]] side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprising [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]] and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]].]]
[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892 metres (16,050&nbsp;ft), is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], both on the main continent and the surrounding islands. Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Mount Erebus]] is known to be active. Located on [[Ross Island]], Erebus is the southernmost active volcano. There is another famous volcano called [[Deception Island]], which is famous for its giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|publisher=British Antarctic Survey|accessdate=2006-02-13}}</ref> In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm Helen Briggs; '''Secret rivers found in Antarctic'''; BBC News; 19 April 2006]</ref> There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|sp=uk}} above the water line, that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. If life is discovered in Lake Vostok, this would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/lvostok.htm|title=Lake Vostok|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=2006-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html|title=Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2006-02-04}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> On 7 February 2008, a NASA team embarked on a mission to [[Lake Untersee]], searching for [[extremophile]]s in its highly-alkaline waters.

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Antarctica}}
===Geological history and paleontology===
More than 170 million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago.

====Paleozoic era (540<U+2013>250 mya)====
[[Image:Survey-Route.jpg|thumb|right|Survey route]]
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian periodic stage]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|mya]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&nbsp;mya), as Gondwana became centered around the [[South Pole]] and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the plant life became dominated by [[fern]]-like plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name="Stonehouse">{{cite book | editor = Stonehouse, B. (ed.) | title = Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans | year = 2002 | month = June | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | isbn = 0-471-98665-8 | author = ed. by B. Stonehouse.}}</ref>

====Mesozoic era (250<U+2013>65 mya)====
[[Image:Bransfield-Strait.jpg|thumb|left|Bransfield Strait]]
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In East Antarctica, the [[seed fern]] became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206<U+2013>146&nbsp;mya), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period, as were reptiles such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146<U+2013>65&nbsp;mya), though [[Nothofagus|Southern beech]] began to take over at the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only two Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'', from the [[Mount Kirkpatrick Formation|Hanson Formation]], and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.<ref>{{cite web| author=Leslie, Mitch| title= The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html| publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]''| month=December | year=2007| accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up.

====Gondwanaland breakup (160<U+2013>23 mya)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise by the continental spread changing the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalizing currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160&nbsp;mya, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the early Cretaceous (about 125&nbsp;mya). About 65&nbsp;mya, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]]. About 40&nbsp;mya Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal current could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and so the first ice began to appear. Around 23&nbsp;mya, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, which resulted in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]]. The ice spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15&nbsp;mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice,<ref name="Trewby">{{cite book | editor = Trewby, Mary (ed.) | title = Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton | year = 2002 | month = September | publisher = Firefly Books | isbn = 1-55297-590-8 | author = edited by Mary Trewby.}}</ref> with the Antarctic ice cap reaching its present extension around 6&nbsp;mya.

===Geology of present-day Antarctica===

[[Image:Port-Lockroy.jpg|thumb|[[Port Lockroy]] Museum.]]
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.<ref name="Stonehouse" /> The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.

East Antarctica is geologically very varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s, [[coal]] and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[Geologic fault|faulting]] has occurred.

The main [[mineral]] resource known on the continent is coal.<ref name="Trewby" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of [[iron ore]]. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the [[Ross Sea]] in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until the year 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Fryxellsee Opt.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
[[Image:AntarcticaSummer.jpg|thumb|Near the coast, December looks fairly temperate.]]

Antarctica is the coldest place on [[Earth]]. At the 3-kilometer (2&nbsp;mi)-high Vostok Station in Antarctica, scientists recorded Earth's lowest temperature: {{nowrap|<U+2212>89 <U+00B0>C}} {{nowrap|(<U+2212>129 <U+00B0>F)}}.<ref name = "weatherquesting-cold">[http://weatherquesting.com/cold-places.htm Coldest spot on Earth]</ref> For comparison, this is {{nowrap|11 <U+00B0>C}} colder than subliming [[dry ice]]. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]; the South Pole itself receives less than 10 centimeters (4&nbsp;in) per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{nowrap|<U+2212>80 <U+00B0>C}} and {{nowrap|<U+2212>90 <U+00B0>C}} {{nowrap|(<U+2212>112 <U+00B0>F}} and {{nowrap|<U+2212>130 <U+00B0>F)}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{nowrap|5 <U+00B0>C}} and {{nowrap|15 <U+00B0>C}} {{nowrap|(41 <U+00B0>F}} and {{nowrap|59 <U+00B0>F)}} near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.<ref name="BAS-weather">{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=''Weather in the Antarctic''|publisher=British Antarctic Survey.|accessdate=2006-02-09}}</ref> Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, [[ice]] there lasts for extended time periods. Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 meters (48&nbsp;in) in 48 hours have been recorded. [[Image:Friesland-St-Boris.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain glaciation.]]
At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are typically moderate.  During summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface during clear days at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.<ref name="cia">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#People|title=Antarctica - The World Factbook|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>  There is some speculation that Antarctica is [[Global warming|warming]]  as a result of human {{co2}} emissions but this has not been proven.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Gillett, Nathan P.| year =  2008| doi = 10.1038/ngeo338 | title =  Attribution of polar warming to human influence | journal =  Nature Geoscience | volume =  1 | pages =  750 }}</ref>

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for two reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3 kilometers (2&nbsp;mi) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. Second, the [[Arctic Ocean]] covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica.

Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full solar winds that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].<ref name="BAS-weather" />

==Population==
{{seealso|Demographics of Antarctica}}
Antarctica has only one permanent resident, Father Georgy, the priest of [[Trinity Church, Antarctica]]{{Fact|date=January 2009}}, but a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer. Many of the stations are staffed year-round.
[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|left|Two researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of [[Grytviken]], Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

[[Image:Fieldwork-Melnik.jpg|thumb|Field work.]]
The first child born in the southern polar region was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbj<U+00F6>rg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of South Georgia. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and of Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 to become the manager of [[Grytviken]], serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.<ref>R.K. Headland, The Island of South Georgia, Cambridge University Press, 1984.</ref>

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born on the Antarctic mainland, at [[Esperanza Base|Base Esperanza]] in 1978; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government to determine if family life was suitable on the continent. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the [[Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva|Frei Montalva Station]], becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060211123941/http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html|archivedate=2006-02-11|title=Questions and answers|publisher=''The Antarctic Sun''|accessdate=2006-02-09}}</ref>

==Flora and fauna==
{{seealso|Antarctic ecozone}}
===Flora===
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit the flourishing of plants. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s. The [[autotroph]]ic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer, and only for a few weeks at most.

There are more than 200 species of lichens and about 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatom]]s are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass) and ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551|title=Antarctic Wildlife|publisher=Australian Government Antarctic Division|accessdate=2006-02-05}}</ref>

===Fauna===
Few terrestrial [[vertebrates]] live in Antarctica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/land_animals/index.php|title=Land Animals of Antarctica|publisher=British Antarctic Survey|accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref> Invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], [[Roundworm|nematode]]s, [[tardigrade]]s, [[rotifer]]s, [[krill]] and [[springtail]]s. The flightless [[midge (insect)|midge]] ''[[Belgica antarctica]]'', just {{convert|12|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in size, is the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica. The [[Snow Petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica. They have been seen at the [[South Pole]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

Due to the extreme cold, the body fluids of tiny mites and midges in Antarctica contain [[glycerol]], an antifreeze liquid that protects them from solidifying when temperatures plummet to as low as {{nowrap|<U+2212>34 <U+00B0>C}} {{nowrap|(<U+2212>30 <U+00B0>F)}}.<ref name = "weatherquesting-cold"/>
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adelie Penguin|Ad<U+00E9>lie Penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[Chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[Gentoo Penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom.  The [[Weddell Seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of [[United Kingdom|British]] sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregates in large [[swarm|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=2006-02-06}}</ref>

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on [[fishing]]. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.<ref name="cia" /> Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&nbsp;[[Metric ton|tonnes]] (35,300&nbsp;short tons) in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=1539|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Government Antarctic Division|accessdate=2006-02-11}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[Image:Logistic-Support.jpg|thumb|left|Resupply by the Uruguayan Navy vessel ''Vanguardia''.]]
Antarctica has no government and belongs to no country.

Since 1959, new claims on Antarctica have been suspended and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 [[Antarctic Treaty]] and other related agreements, collectively called the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. For the purposes of the Treaty System, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60<U+00B0> S. The treaty was signed by twelve countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]] and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction.  Australia claims the largest area.

===Countries interested in participating in a possible territorial division of Antarctica===

[[Nazi Germany]] also maintained a claim to Antarctica, known as [[New Swabia]], between 1939 and 1945. It was situated from 20<U+00B0>E to 10<U+00B0>W, overlapping Norway's claim. The claim was abandoned after the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Antarctic cod.jpg|thumb|left|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests. Pictured here is the [[Antarctic toothfish]], a sister species.]]

Although [[coal]], [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[iron ore]], [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[gold]] and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000<U+2013>01 reported landing 112,934&nbsp;tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm|title=Importance of Antarctica|publisher=Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences|accessdate=2006-02-05}}</ref>

Small-scale "expedition [[tourism]]" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium [[ship]], focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006<U+2013>07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number is predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc|title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting|publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat|accessdate=2007-08-02|format=DOC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=2006-02-05}}</ref> There has been some recent concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors.

Antarctic sight seeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on [[Mount Erebus]], which killed all 257 aboard.  [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Antarctica}}
Transport on the continent has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of Antarctica on foot to a more open area due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport by land and predominantly by air and water. The use of dogs to pull researchers and sledges has been banned on objections that dogs are an alien species to Antarctica.  Electric buggies used in place of the dogs are disadvantaged in that while dogs could sense crevices and thin ice, the buggies can not.

Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.<ref name="cia" /> [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[Biology|biologists]], [[Geology|geologists]], [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[Physics|physicists]], [[Astronomy|astronomers]], [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meterology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[ice sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere, low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built 2 kilometers below Amundsen-Scott station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml|title=Science in Antarctica|publisher=''Antarctic Connection''|accessdate=2006-02-04}}</ref>

Since the 1970s, an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British Scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. In 1998, [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (10 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[Haloalkane#Chlorofluoro compounds .28CFC.2C HCFC.2C HFC.29|chlorofluorocarbons]] emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, it is believed that the ozone hole will close up over the next fifty years.

===Princess Elisabeth Polar Science Station===
On 6 September 2007, [[Belgian]]-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Base|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3 million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of [[International Polar Year]] will be shipped to the [[South Pole]] from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar]] regions. Belgian polar [[explorer]] [[Alain Hubert]] has stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." [[Johan Berte]] is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which will conduct research in [[climatology]], [[glaciology]] and [[microbiology]].<ref>[http://www.belspo.be/belspo/bepoles/science/station/index_en.stm belspo.be] - Princess Elisabeth Station</ref>

===Meteorites===
[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites were found in 1912. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.<ref name="meteorite">{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica |publisher=NASA| accessdate=2006-02-09}}</ref>

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.<ref name="meteorite" />

In 2006, a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the {{convert|300|mi|km|-1|sing=on}}-wide [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250 million years ago.<ref name="crater">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica<U+2014>Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=1 June 2006}}</ref>

===Volcanic eruption===
In January 2008, the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (Bas) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal [[Nature Geoscience]]) that 2,200 years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under Antarctica ice sheet (based on [[airborne]] survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the [[Hudson Mountains]], close to [[Pine Island Glacier]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194579.stm BBC NEWS, Ancient Antarctic eruption noted]</ref>

==Effects of global warming==

Most of the continent's icy mass has so far proven largely impervious to [[climate change]], being situated on solid rock; its deep interior is actually growing in volume as a result of increased precipitation.<ref name = "economist-p78">The icy road to Bali; The UN and climate change, The Economist, 3 November 2007, p. 78 </ref> The Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise has long been uncertain. A recent report by [[CPOM]] suggests that Antarctica has provided, at most, a negligible component of observed sea-level rise - indeed a survey of 72% of the Antarctic ice suggests an attributable short-term lowering of global sea levels by 0.08 mm per year.<ref>'''[[D. J. Wingham]] et al;'''  [http://www.cpom.org/research/djw-ptrsa364.pdf Mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet] [[Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A]] (2006) 364, </ref>  Conversely, a 10 year comparison of the balance between glacier decline and snowfall accumulation found that ice loss had increased 75%. In 2006, Antarctica lost a net 200 billion tonnes of ice.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature

However, Antarctica's periphery has been warming up, particularly on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and in [[Pine Island Bay]], which together are contributing to a rise in sea levels.<ref name = "economist-p78"/>   In 2003 the [[Larsen Ice Shelf#Larsen-B|Larsen-B]] ice shelf collapsed.<ref name="LarsenB">{{cite web | author = Neil Glasser of Aberystwyth University | title = Antarctic Ice Shelf Collapse Blamed On More Than Climate Change | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080210100441.htm}}</ref>  Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 square kilometers of ice from the [[Wilkins Sound|Wilkins Ice Shelf]] in Western Antarctica collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 square kilometers of the ice shelf at risk.

In contrast to the break up of some [[ice shelves]] (ice that formed on land and has now moved so it is floating on the sea) along the peninsula, the amount of [[sea ice]] (ice formed by freezing ocean water) around Antarctica has remained stable, or even increased some, over the past 30 years.<ref name="United Nations Environment Programme">{{cite web | title = Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme | url = http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/regional-changes-in-arctic-and-antarctic-sea-ice}}</ref>  The average extent of Antarctic sea ice in one month can differ by as much as 1 million square kilometers from the long-term average for that month. The area covered by Antarctic sea ice has shown a small increasing trend (0.8% per decade).<ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center">{{cite web | title = All About Sea Ice | publisher = National Snow and Ice Data Center | url = http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html}}</ref>  The sea ice concentration of Antarctica in June 2008 is virtually the same as that in June 1979.

== Antarctic ozone depletion==
{{main|Ozone depletion}}
[[Image:160658main2 OZONE large 350.png|thumb|right|150px|Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever recorded due to CFC accumulation (September 2006).]]
There is a large [[ozone hole]] over Antarctica which was detected by scientists in 1973 and continues to grow to this day. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] or CFCs into the [[atmosphere]], which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.<ref>http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html ''The Antarctic Ozone hole'', NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS)</ref>
