'''Respighi''' is a small [[moon|lunar]] [[impact crater]] that is located to the southeast of the crater [[Dubyago (crater)|Dubyago]], near the eastern limb of the [[Moon]]. To the east is the comparably sized [[Liouville (crater)|Liouville]].

This is a crudely circular crater with inner walls that slope down to the relatively darker (lower [[albedo]]) interior central floor. The rim has not suffered significant erosion from subsequent impacts, but there is a shallower section to the south. Attached to the southern rim of this crater is Dubyago B, a formation that has the appearance of two or more merged craters with a dark, [[lava]]-flooded floor that is elongated to the southeast.
