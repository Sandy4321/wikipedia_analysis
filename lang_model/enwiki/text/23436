The '''menstrual cycle''' is a series of [[physiology|physiological]] changes that can occur in fertile [[female]]s. Overt menstruation (where there is [[blood flow]] from the [[uterus]] through the [[vagina]]) occurs primarily in humans and some animals such as [[chimpanzee]]s.<ref name=strassmann>{{cite journal |author=Strassmann BI |title=The evolution of endometrial cycles and menstruation |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=181<U+2013>220 |year=1996 |pmid=8693059| doi = 10.1086/419369}}</ref> Females of other species of [[Eutheria|placental mammal]] undergo [[estrous cycle]]s, in which the [[endometrium]] is completely reabsorbed by the animal ([[covert menstruation]]) at the end of its [[Biological life cycle|reproductive cycle]].  This article focuses on the [[human]] menstrual cycle.

The menstrual cycle, under the control of the [[endocrine system]], is necessary for [[reproduction]]. It is commonly divided into three phases: the [[follicular phase]], [[ovulation]], and the [[luteal phase]]; although some sources use a different set of phases: [[menstruation]], proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref>{{cite book|title=Exploring the dimensions of human sexuality|first=Jerrold S.|last=Greenberg|coauthors=Clint E.

Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of [[oestrogen]] in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) slow then stop, and the [[Endometrium|lining]] of the [[uterus]] thickens. Follicles in the [[ovary]] begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24<U+2013>36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[Ovum|ovum, or egg]] in an event called ovulation.  After ovulation, the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrium (uterine lining) changes to prepare for potential [[implantation]] of an embryo to establish a [[pregnancy]]. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. These hormone drops cause the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation.

In the menstrual cycle, changes occur in the [[female reproductive system]] as well as other systems (which lead to [[Mastodynia|breast tenderness]] or [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] changes, for example). A woman's first menstruation is termed [[menarche]], and occurs typically around age 12. The end of a woman's reproductive phase is called the [[menopause]], which commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55.

== Terminology ==
The [[menarche]] is one of the later stages of [[puberty]] in girls.
The average age of menarche in humans is 12 years, but is normal anywhere between ages 8 and 16. Factors such as heredity, diet and overall health can accelerate or delay menarche.<!--

The average age of menopause in women is 52 years in industrialised countries such as the UK, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common.  Menopause before age 45 is considered ''premature'' in industrialised countries<ref>{{cite web | title = Clinical topic - Menopause | work = NHS | url = http://www.cks.nhs.uk/menopause#-292420 | accessdate = 2 November 2009 }}</ref>.  The age of menopause is largely a result of genetics; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier.<!--

The length of a woman's menstrual cycle will typically vary, with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles. A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles. It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of less than four days.  Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately [[irregular cycles]]. Variation of 21 days or more between a woman's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular (see [[#Cycle abnormalities|cycle abnormalities]]).<!--

== Phases ==
The menstrual cycle can be divided into several different phases. The average length of each phase is shown below, the first three are related to changes in the lining of the uterus whereas the final three are related to processes occurring in the ovary:

=== Menstruation ===
{{main|Menstruation}}
Menstruation is also called '''menstrual bleeding''', '''menses''', '''catamenia''' or a '''period'''. The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. (However, this cannot be taken as certainty, as a number of factors can cause [[Vaginal bleeding#Pregnant women|bleeding during pregnancy]]; some factors are specific to [[First trimester bleeding|early pregnancy]], and some can cause [[Obstetrical hemorrhage|heavy flow]].)<ref>{{cite web | last = Greenfield | first = Marjorie  | title = Subchorionic Hematoma in Early Pregnancy | work = Ask Our Experts | publisher = DrSpock.com | date = 17 September 2001 | url = http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,8334,00.html | accessdate = 21 September 2008}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Anderson-Berry | first = Ann L | coauthors = Terence Zach | title = Vanishing Twin Syndrome | journal = Emedicine.com  | publisher = WebMD | date = 10 December 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3411.HTM | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Ko | first = Patrick | coauthors = Young Yoon | title = Placenta Previa | journal = Emedicine.com  | publisher = WebMD | date = 23 August 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic427.htm | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref>  During the reproductive years, failure to menstruate may provide the first indication to a [[woman]] that she may have become pregnant.

Painful cramping in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation (most women experience some pain during menstruation). Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as [[dysmenorrhea]], and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females).<ref>Sharma P, Malhotra C, Taneja DK, Saha R (2008). "Problems related to menstruation amongst adolescent girls". Indian J Pediatr 75 (2): 125<U+2013>9. doi:10.1007/s12098-008-0018-5. PMID 18334791</ref> When menstruation begins, symptoms of [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) such as [[mastalgia|breast tenderness]] and irritability generally decrease.<ref name=allmenses/>  Many [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|sanitary products]] are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.

=== Follicular phase ===
[[File:Estradiol and progesterone in menstrual cycle.svg|thumb|right|601px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests|Reference ranges]] for [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] in the menstrual cycle, expressed in mass and molar concentration. The relative concentrations of estradiol and progesterone differ somewhat between the mass and molar scales because of slightly different [[molar mass]]. The scale is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].]]
{{main|Follicular phase}}
This phase is also called the ''proliferative phase'' because a hormone causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

Through the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance.  Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity.  The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it forms the ovum.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

As they mature, the follicles secrete increasing amounts of [[estradiol]], an [[estrogen]].  The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypts]] in the [[cervix]] to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing [[fertility awareness]].<!--

=== Ovulation ===
{{main|Ovulation}}
[[Image:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg.]]

During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses production of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]].  When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which they stimulate production of LH.  These opposite responses of LH to estradiol may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, ''et al.'' |title=Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons |journal=Mol. Endocrinol. |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=2250<U+2013>9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18701637 |doi=10.1210/me.2008-0192 |pmc=2582533}}</ref> In the average cycle this LH surge starts around cycle day 12 and may last 48 hours.

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its [[secondary oocyte]].<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an [[ootid]] and then becomes a mature [[ovum]].  The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gray, Henry David |title=Anatomy of the human body |chapter=The Ovum |publisher=Bartleby.com |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |chapterurl=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |isbn=1-58734-102-6 |accessdate=5 October 2008}}</ref>

After being released from the ovary, the egg is swept into the [[fallopian tube]] by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbria]], which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube.  After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

Fertilization by a [[spermatozoon]], when it occurs, usually takes place in the [[Ampulla of uterine tube|ampulla]], the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> It has usually reached the [[blastocyst]] stage at the time of implantation.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called ''[[mittelschmerz]]'' (German term meaning ''middle pain'').<ref name=allmenses/> The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.65</ref>

=== Luteal phase ===
[[File:LH and FSH in menstrual cycle.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Reference ranges for blood tests|Reference ranges]] for [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] in the menstrual cycle, expressed in [[international unit]]s. The scale is logarithmic.]]
{{main|Luteal phase}}
The luteal phase is also called the ''secretory phase''.  An important role is played by the [[corpus luteum]], the solid body formed in an ovary after the egg has been released from the ovary into the fallopian tube. This body continues to grow for some time after ovulation and produces significant amounts of hormones, particularly [[progesterone]].<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>  Progesterone plays a vital role in making the [[endometrium]] receptive to [[implantation]] of the [[blastocyst]] and supportive of the early pregnancy; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's [[basal body temperature]].<ref name=tcoyf>Weschler (2002), pp.361-2</ref> There is a noted secretion of prolactin towards the end of the secretory phase.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After ovulation, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself.  Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>  Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle.  From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with ten to sixteen days considered normal.  For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>

The loss of the corpus luteum can be prevented by fertilization of the egg; the resulting [[embryo]] produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which can preserve the corpus luteum. Because the hormone is unique to the embryo, most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

== Fertile window ==
The most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from [[sexual intercourse]]) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1<U+2013>2 days after ovulation.<ref>Weschler (2002), pp.242,374</ref> In an average 28 day cycle with a 14-day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week.  However, few cycles are exactly average.  A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle: these systems are called [[fertility awareness]].

Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called [[calendar-based methods]].<ref name=who>{{cite paper |title=Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use:Fertility awareness-based methods | version = Third edition |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2004 |url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/mec/fab.html |accessdate=29 April 2008 }}</ref> Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs ([[basal body temperature]], [[cervical mucus]], and cervical position)<ref>Weschler (2002), p.52</ref> are known as symptoms-based methods.<ref name=who/>  [[Urinalysis|Urine test]] kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs).<ref>{{MedlinePlus|007062|LH urine test (home test)}}</ref>  Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called [[fertility monitors]].

== Effect on other systems ==
Some women with [[Neurology|neurological conditions]] experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger migraines (a neurological syndrome [[Migraines]])[http://www.thedailyheadache.com/2006/04/linking_migrain.html], especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill.

Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of [[sex steroid]] hormones might regulate [[nervous system]] function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of [[Neuron|nerve-cell]] [[GABA A receptor|GABA receptor]] subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.<!--

Among women living closely together, the onsets of menstruation may tend to synchronize somewhat. This [[McClintock effect]] was first described in 1971, and possibly explained by the action of [[pheromone]]s in 1998.<!--

===Cycle abnormalities===<!-- [[Irregular]] refers to here -->
{{main|Menstrual disorder}}
Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called ''oligoovulation''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Galan | first = Nicole | title = Oligoovulation | publisher = about.com | date = 16 April 2008 | url = http://pcos.about.com/od/glossary/g/oligoovulation.htm | accessdate = 12 October 2008}}</ref>  The absence of ovulation is called ''[[anovulation]]''.  Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will form and will stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called ''estrogen breakthrough bleeding''. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called ''estrogen withdrawal bleeding''.<ref name=tcoyf3>Weschler (2002), p.107</ref> Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before [[menopause]] (perimenopause) and in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].<ref name=emed2>{{EMedicine|med|146|Anovulation}}</ref>

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called ''[[hypomenorrhea]]''.  Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are ''[[polymenorrhea]]''; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as ''[[metrorrhagia]]''.  Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed ''[[menorrhagia]]''.<ref name=emed1>{{EMedicine|ped|2781|Menstruation Disorders}}</ref>  Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is ''[[menometrorrhagia]]''.

== Ovulation suppression ==
=== Hormonal contraception ===
{{main|Hormonal contraception}}
[[Image:pillpacketopen.jpg|thumb|right|Half-used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive.  The white pills are [[placebos]], mainly for the purpose of reminding the woman to continue taking the pills.]]
While some forms of [[birth control]] do not affect the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it.  Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<!--

The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives<U+2014>traditional [[progestogen only pill]]s, [[subdermal implant]]s [[Norplant]] and Jadelle, and [[IntraUterine System|intrauterine system]] Mirena<U+2014>inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness.<ref name=glasier>{{cite book |last=Glasier |first=Anna |editor=DeGroot, Leslie J.; Jameson, J.

High dose progestogen-only contraceptives<U+2014>the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat<U+2014>completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.<ref name=glasier/>

Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen.  Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation.  Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular [[breakthrough bleeding]].<ref name=hatcher/><ref name=speroff/><ref name=loose/>  Several combined hormonal contraceptives<U+2014>[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[NuvaRing]], and the [[contraceptive patch]]<U+2014>are usually used in a way that causes regular withdrawal bleeding.  In a normal cycle, [[menstruation]] occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly.<ref name=tcoyf/>  Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed.  If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|taken continuously]], although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.

=== Lactational amenorrhea ===
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).  Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume.<ref name=mcneilly>{{cite journal |author=McNeilly AS |title=Lactational control of reproduction |journal=Reprod.

== Etymological and biological associations ==
=== Nightlighting and the moon ===
{{seealso|Culture and menstruation}}
The word "menstruation" is etymologically related to "moon". The terms "menstruation" and "menses" are derived from the [[Latin]] ''mensis'' (month), which in turn relates to the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mene'' (moon) and to the roots of the English words ''month'' and ''moon''<U+2014> reflecting the fact that the [[moon]]'s period of revolution around the earth (27.32 days) is similar to that of the human menstrual cycle. The synodical [[lunar month]], the period between two new moons (or full moons), is 29.53 days long.

Some authors believe women in traditional societies without nightlighting ovulated with the [[full moon]] and menstruated with the new moon.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cohen | first = Sari  | title = Melatonin, menstruation, and the moon | journal = Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients | date =  February-March 2005 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISW/is_259-260/ai_n10299307/pg_1 | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}<br />
