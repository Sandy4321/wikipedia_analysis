'''''Erased''''' (also known as '''''The Expatriate''''' outside of the US) is a 2012 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by Philipp St<U+00F6>lzl, starring [[Aaron Eckhart]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]].

The story centers on Ben Logan ([[Aaron Eckhart]]) an Ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent and Amy ([[Liana Liberato]]), his estranged daughter who are forced on the run when his employers erase all records of his existence, and mark them both for termination as part of a wide-reaching international conspiracy.<ref>http://www.dvdfr.com/dvd/c154905-expatriate-le-test-complet-du-blu-ray.html</ref>

The movie was released in the US on May 17, 2013, following its acquisition by RaDiUS-TWC, the multiplatform distribution label of [[The Weinstein Company]]. It was retitled "Erased" for the US market.<ref>http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118051685/</ref> The retitling and delayed US release was due to unusually high piracy rates following an early DVD release in France on September 26, 2012 during the first week of the movie's global theatrical roll-out. On October 1, 2012, it ranked number 10 most pirated movie online globally, in a chart otherwise populated by blockbusters from major Hollywood studios.<ref>http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-movies-on-bittorrent-121001/</ref>
