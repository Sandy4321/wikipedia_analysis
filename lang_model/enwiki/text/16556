'''Vera Fyodorovna Panova''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0412><U+0435><U+0301><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0424><U+0451><U+0434><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0301><U+0432><U+0430>}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 20|1905|March 7}} - March 3, 1973) was a [[Soviet]] novelist, playwright, and journalist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Vera was born into the family of an impoverished merchant (later an accountant) in [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia. Her father, Fyodor Ivanovich Panov, built canoes and yachts as a hobby, and founded two yachting clubs in Rostov. When she was five her father drowned in the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]].<ref name="Vera"> Vera Panova, A Little About Myself, from Vera Panova, Selected Works, Progress Publishers, 1976.</ref> After her father's death, her mother worked as a saleswoman.<ref name="History"> A History of Soviet Literature, Vera Alexandrova, Doubleday, 1963.</ref> As a girl she was taught by a family friend, an old school teacher named Anna Prozorovskaya. Vera credited Anna with instilling in her a passion for reading. Unfortunately Anna died after being with Vera for only a year. Prior to the [[October Revolution]] she studied for 2 years at a private [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], before her formal education was stopped because of money problems in her family.<ref name="Vera"/>

From her earliest years Vera was an avid reader, especially of poetry, at which she tried her hand at an early age.<ref name="History"/> Her reading included the works of [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Nikolay Gogol]], and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. She also read numerous textbooks on science, geography, and history as a form of self-education.<ref name="Vera"/> At the age of 17 she started to work as a journalist in a Rostov newspaper ''Trudovoy Don'' (Working Don), publishing articles as V. Staroselskaya (the surname of her first husband Arseny Staroselsky whom she had married in 1925 and divorced 2 years later<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>) and Vera Veltman. She described her first editing job and her first steps in this career in her novel ''Sentimental Romance'' (1958).<ref name="Vera"/> She learned newspaper work by experience, serving in turn as an assistant to the district organizer of labor correspondents, a reporter, and an essayist.<ref name="History"/> 

===Career===
In 1933 she began writing plays. In 1935 her second husband, [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] journalist Boris Vakhtin, was arrested and imprisoned on [[Solovki]] where he died (the exact death date is unknown, probably the later thirties). The [[Gulag]] authorities allowed her only one meeting with Boris, which she described in her story ''Svidanie'' (The Meeting). 

From 1940 she lived in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. The unexpected advance of the [[Nazi]]s on the [[Leningrad Front]] found her in [[Tsarskoe Selo]]. She and her daughter were put in a [[concentration camp]] near [[Pskov]], but they managed to escape to [[Narva]], where they lived illegally in a destroyed [[synagogue]]. She then moved to the village of Shishaki to stay with relatives. There she began her first serious works, the plays ''Ivan Kosogor'' (1939) and ''In Old Moscow'' (1940).<ref name="Encyclopedia"> An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, Volume 1, Taylor & Francis, 1991. </ref> Although these 2 plays won prizes, Vera felt that the dramatic form confined her, and, by her own admission, she was unable to fit all that she wanted to say into its strict framework. She felt that she could work with greater freedom in the novel and story forms.<ref name="History"/> 

In 1943, when the Germans retreated from Ukraine, she moved to [[Perm]] (called Molotov at that time). She worked for a local newspaper and published her first novel ''The Pirozhkov Family'' (later renamed ''Yevdokia'', the source of a Soviet film produced by [[Tatyana Lioznova]] in 1961).<ref name="Vera"/> In 1944, as a journalist, she was embedded for two months with a hospital train about which she wrote the novel ''Sputniki'' (1946; translated as ''The Train'') that brought her a [[Stalin Prize]] in 1947. There was a Soviet Film ''Poezd Miloserdiya'' (Train of mercy, 1961) and another TV-film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198798/ Na vsyu ostavshuyuysya zhizn'] (For the rest of one's life, 1975) based on the novel; the scenario for the later film was written by Panova's son Boris Vakhtin.

In 1945 she married David Yakovlevich Ryvkin (1910-1980), a notable Russian science-fiction writer who wrote under the pseudonym of "David Dar". Together with her husband and his 2 children she returned to Leningrad.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> In 1947 she published the novel ''Kruzhilikha'', translated as ''Looking Ahead'' (Stalin Prize in 1948), about people working in a [[Ural (region)|Ural]] factory. She had began writing the novel in 1944, but had been interrupted by the hospital train assignment.<ref name="History"/> In 1949 she wrote the novel ''Yasny Bereg'' (Bright Shore; Stalin Prize of 1950) about people working in a [[kolkhoz]]. 

With the onset of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] she wrote ''Vremena Goda'' (Span of the Year, 1953) about the relations of "fathers" and "sons" within the Soviet intelligentsia. The novel was immensely popular with the reading public, but Panova was criticized harshly in the press for her "naturalism" and "objectivism". In 1955 she wrote the novel ''[[Seryozha (novel)|Seryozha]]'', one of the best works about children in Soviet literature. She published the stories ''Valya'' and ''Volodya'', also about children, in 1959.<ref name="Vera"/>

Despite her critics she maintained her place among the top Soviet writers. At the Writer's Congresses of 1954 and 1959 she was elected as a member of the Presidium of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]]. She was twice awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] (1955, 1965). As an established writer she was allowed to travel to [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Italy]], and in 1960 she toured the [[United States]]. Her published travel notes and articles, and an epilogue to the Russian translation of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', by [[J.D. Salinger]], show her affinty for Western life and culture.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

===Later life===
In her later life she published many short stories (mostly autobiographical and based on Russian history of the 17th century), plays, and film scripts. She helped many younger writers who later become famous, among them [[Yury Pavlovich Kazakov]], [[Sergei Dovlatov]] (her secretary for many years), Viktor Konetzky, [[Andrei Bitov]], and Viktor Golyavkin. Her son Boris Vakhtin (1930<U+2013>1981) was a notable dissident and Russian writer, the founder of the group Gorozhane.  

In 1967 she suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed. Though incapacitated, she continued to work with the help of her family and a number of secretaries until the day of her death. Vera Panova died in Leningrad in 1973 and is buried in [[Komarovo, Saint Petersburg|Komarovo]] near [[Anna Akhmatova]].<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>
