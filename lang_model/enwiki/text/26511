'''Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central line''' was a railway line in [[West Sussex]], [[East Sussex]] and [[Kent]], [[England]]. It ran between [[Three Bridges railway station|Three Bridges]] (on the [[Brighton Main Line]]) and [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells Central]] (on the [[Hastings Line]]) via [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]] (on the [[Bluebell Railway|Bluebell branch]] of the [[Oxted Line]]) and the [[Cuckoo Line]] / [[Wealden Line]] / [[Oxted Line|Uckfield Branch of the Oxted Line]] <ref name=subbrit>{{cite web|last=Catford|first=Nick|title=Brief History Of The Three Bridges - Tunbridge Wells West Railway|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/g/grange_road/index.shtml|accessdate=[[12 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref>. The line opened on [[9 July]] [[1855]], and the main section closed on [[1 January]] [[1967]] as part of the [[Beeching Axe]] (ironically [[Richard Beeching|Dr Beeching]] himself lived and commuted from East Grinstead), while the section via Tunbridge Wells West was latterly closed on [[6 July]] [[1985]], although it has recently reopened as the [[Spa Valley Railway]], a heritage railway <ref name=subbrit/>.

The railway served the following Surrey communities: [[Three Bridges]], [[Crawley Down]], [[East Grinstead]], [[Forest Row]], [[Hartfield]], [[Withyham]], [[Groombridge]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]].

== History ==

In [[1852]] the '''East Grinstead Railway Company''' was formed and received parliamentary approval ([[8 July]] [[1853]]) to build a 6<U+00BE> mile branch from [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR)'s main line at [[Three Bridges railway station|Three Bridges]] to East Grinstead <ref name=subbrit/>. The line opened on the [[8 July]] [[1855]] with only one intermediate station at [[Rowfant railway station|Rowfant]] (built solely for a local landowner), latterly on [[2 April]] [[1860]] another station was opened at Crawley Down ([[Grange Road railway station|Grange Road station]]) <ref name=subbrit/>. The line was extended eastward under the "East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act" ([[7 August]] [[1862]]) to Tunbridge Wells via running over the [[Brighton, Uckfield and Tunbridge Wells Railway]]'s line <ref name=subbrit/>. In January [[1865]] both companies were acquired by LBSCR and the extension was opened [[1 October]] [[1866]] <ref name=subbrit/>. On [[1 February]] [[1876]] the single line Grove Tunnel was opened from [[Tunbridge Wells West railway station|Tunbridge Wells West]] to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]]'s (SER) Hastings Line and its [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells Central]] <ref name=subbrit/>.

The line was always lightly used and the later opening of several other lines, saw a significant drop in traffic <ref name=subbrit/>. The Beeching Axe saw the main section between the Three Bridges and Groombridge close. The section between Three Bridges and East Grinstead has been turned into the "Worth Way", a footpath and cycleway <ref name=worth>{{cite web|title=Worth Way Route Guide|publisher=[[West Sussex|West Sussex CC]]|url=http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/leisureandtourism/prow/pdfs/Worth_Way_Route_Guide.pdf|accessdate=[[12 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref>, while the East Grinstead to Groombridge section is now the Forest Way cycle and footpath <ref name=forest>{{cite web|title=Forest Way|publisher=[[East Sussex|East Sussex CC]]|url=http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/98CE20E4-44BB-488A-AAB8-F2B716AEFF5A/0/forest_way.pdf|accessdate=[[12 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref>.

The final section of the line between the Wealden Line / Oxted Line (at Eridge / Groombridge) and Tunbridge Wells Central remained open but starved of investment. In the early 1980s [[British Rail]] announced the closure of this last section citing expensive upgrades required to the track and signalling needed, exacerbated with the Hastings Line's [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]]<ref name=subbrit/>. The connection was severed on [[6 July]] [[1985]] and but the rest of the line remained until [[10 August]] [[1985]]<ref name=subbrit/>.

Preservation efforts followed shortly there after, with the '''Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society''' and the '''North Downs Steam Railway''' joining forces to reopen the '''[[Spa Valley Railway]]''' during the winter of [[1996]] <ref name=spa>{{cite web|title=Spa Valley Railway|publisher=Spa Valley Railway|url=http://www.spavalleyrailway.co.uk/|accessdate=[[12 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref>.
