=== Background ===

{{main|Arab-Israeli conflict|1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|1948 Arab-Israeli War}}

After about 30 years of nationalist conflict in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] between [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian Arabs]] and [[Zionism|Jewish Zionists]] and while no agreement could be found between parties, the British decided to terminate the Mandate in February 1947 and on 30 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted the [[Partition of Palestine]].

The vote was immediately followed by a [[1947<U+2013>1948 Civil War in Palestine|Civil War]] in which Palestinian Arabs (supported by the [[Arab Liberation Army]]) and [[Palestinian Jew]]s, fought against each other while the region was still fully under British rule. On 15 May 1948, a full-scale [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War|war]] started when Israel declared its independence and Transjordan, Egypt, Syria and Iraq sent expeditionary forces to Palestine to fight the Israelis.

The war caused the death of more than 20,000 people, around 1% of the population of both communities involved.<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

=== Scale ===

During this war, the Palestinian Arabs committed two (or three) large massacres: the [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre]] where 39 Jews were killed by rioters in the aftermath of an [[Irgun]] attack and the [[Kfar Etzion massacre]] where around 120-150 surrendering defenders were killed by Arab villagers, with the possible participation of a few [[Arab Legion|legionnaires]].<ref name = "Morris_2008"/><ref name="Morris_1999>Morris, 1999, p. 214: 'Villagers shouting "Deir Yassin, Deir Yassin" poured through the breach. The remaining defenders laid down their weapons and walked, hands in the air, into the center of the compound. There, according to one of the few survivors, the villagers Iand perhaps some legionnnaires as well) proceeded to mow them down. In all, about 120 defenders, 21 of them women, died that day. Of the 4 survivors, 3 were saved by Arabs."</ref> The [[Hadassah medical convoy massacre|Hadassah medical convoy]] is often reported as a third massacre of Jews but, according to [[Benny Morris]], it was the result of a battle even though it included the mass killing of unarmed medical personnel.<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> On 22 February 1948, supporters of [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] organised, with the help of British deserters, three attacks against the Jewish community. Using [[car bomb]]s aimed at the headquarters of the pro-Zionist ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', the Ben Yehuda St. market and the backyard of the Jewish Agency's offices, they killed 22, 53 and 13 Jewish people respectively.<ref>[[Yoav Gelber]] (2006), p.24 </ref><ref>[[Efra<U+00EF>m Karsh]], 2002, p.36.</ref>

On the other side, [[Benny Morris]] estimates that "[[Yishuv]] troops probably murdered some 800 civilians and prisoners of war".<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> Most of these killings and massacres occurred as villages were overrun and captured during the [[1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|Second phase of the Civil War]], [[Operation Dani]], [[Operation Hiram]] and [[Operation Yoav]].<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> According to Morris, the "worst cases" were the [[Saliha|Saliha massacre]] with 70 to 80 killed, the [[Deir Yassin massacre]] with around 100, [[Lydda massacre]] with around 250, the [[Al-Dawayima massacre]] with hundreds and the [[Abu Shusha massacre]] with 70.<ref name="haaretz.com">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=380986 Interview with Benny Morris by Ari Shavit in Ha'aretz on September 1st 2004.]</ref>

According to Morris the Israelis were responsible for 24 massacres during the war<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> but [[Saleh Abdel Jawad]] has listed 68 villages where acts of indiscriminate killing of prisoners, and civilians, where no threat was posed to Israeli soldiers, took place. He calculates that 455 people were killed at [[al-Dawayima massacre|al-Dawayima]] including 170 women and children.<ref>[[Saleh Abdel Jawad]] (2007), ''Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War'', in E. Benvenisti & al, ''Israel and the Palestinian Refugees'', Berlin, Heidelberg, New-York : Springer, pp. 59-127</ref>

Controversy surrounds the assertion that a massacre by Israelis took place at [[al-Tantura]].<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

=== Causes ===
[[Benny Morris]] considers that the killings and massacres occurred "[l]ike [in] most wars involving built-up areas."<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

During the first stage of the war, the [[1947<U+2013>1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]], [[Haganah]] operatives had been cautioned against harming women and children but [[Irgun]] [and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]] didn't practice this distinction, while "Palestinian Arab militias often deliberately targeted civilians."<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> Due to the fact the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]] was not yet over, both sides were not able to set up regular POW camps and therefore didn't take prisonners.<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

During the regular war, the fighting armies were more or less disciplined and "the killings of civilians and prisonners of war almost stopped, except for the series of atrocities committed by the IDF troops".<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

Despite their rhetoric, Arab armies committed few atrocities and no large-scale massacre of prisoners took place when circumstances might have allowed them to happen, as when they took the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] or the settlements of [[Atarot]], [[Neve Yaakov]], [[Battle of Nitzanim|Nitzarim]], [[Gezer, Israel|Gezer]] and [[Mishmar HaYarden, Palestine|Mishmar Hayarden]].<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> On the contrary, on 28 May, when the inhabitants and fighters of the Old City surrendered, in fear for their lives, the Transjordanian [[Arab Legion]] protected them from the mob and even wounded or shot dead other Arabs.<ref>[[Benny Morris]] (2008), pp.219-220.</ref>

With regard to massacres perpetrated by the IDF at the end of the war and particularly during [[Operation Hiram]], where around 10 massacres occurred, Morris and Gelber have claimed that lack of discipline cannot explain the events.<ref name = "Morris_2008"/><ref name = "gelber2006">[[Yoav Gelber]] (2006), pp.227-228.</ref> [[Yoav Gelber]] points out the "hard feelings [of the soldiers] towards the Palestinians" and the fact that the Palestinians had not fled like in former operations.<ref name = "gelber2006"/> [[Benny Morris]] thinks that they were related to a "general vengefulness and a desire by local commanders to precipitate a [[1948 Palestinian exodus|civilian exodus]]".<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

To explain the difference in the number of killings and massacres, Morris speculates that "[t]his was probably due to the circumstance that the victorious Israelis captured some four hundred Arab villages and towns during April-November 1948, whereas the Palestinian Arabs and the [[Arab Liberation Army]] failed to take any settlements and the Arab armies that invaded in mid-May overran fewer than a dozen Jewish settlements".<ref name = "Morris_2008"/> He considers too that belligerents behaved reasonably well and that the "1948 [war] is noteworthy for the relatively small number of civilian casualties both in the battles themselves and in the atrocities that accompanied them" in comparison, for example, "with the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s or the Sudanese civil wars of the past fifty years".<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

=== Consequences ===
{{main|Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus}}

According to historians, whether deliberate or otherwise, the massacres did have a strong impact on the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|exodus of the Palestinian Arab population]]. For exemple, the [[Deir Yassin massacre]] is considered to have generated more panic among the Arab population than all other previous operations together and to have caused a mass flight of Palestinians in numerous areas.<ref>Simha Flapan , 1987, <U+2018>The Palestinian Exodus of 1948<U+2019>, J. Palestine Studies 16 (4), p.3-26.</ref><ref>[[Benny Morris]] (2004), pp.239-240.</ref>

Additionally, the Deir Yassin massacre became a strong argument for the Arab states to intervene against Israel. Arab League chief Azzam Pasha is one record for starting that, 'The massacre of Deir Yassin was to a great extent the cause of the wrath of the Arab nations and the most important factor for sending [in] the Arab armies'.<ref>Tom Segev, ''1949: The First Israelis,'' 1986, p.89.</ref>

== Historiographical controversies ==
=== Arab warnings and threats of massacre ===

==== Against Jews of Palestine ====

After the Partition vote, Arab leaders threatened the Jewish population of Palestine. They spoke of "driving the Jews into the sea" and ridding Palestine "of the Zionist Plague".<ref>[[Benny Morris]] (2008), p.396.</ref> On the eve of the Arab armies invasion, [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam|Azzam Pasha]], the General Secretary of the Arab League, "describing the fate of the Jews" even declared: 'This will be a war of extermination and a momentous [[massacre]] which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.'<ref>[[Howard Sachar]] (2007), p.333.</ref>

According to the Israeli traditional historiography, these statements reflected the Arab intentions.<ref>[[Mitchell Bard]], ''[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/1948_War.html 1948 War]'', on the website of the Jewish Virtual Library.</ref><ref name = "morris2008_396">[[Benny Morris]] (2008), p.396.</ref> While [[Benny Morris]] considers the real picture of the Arab aims to be more complex, notably because they were well aware they could not defeat the Jews<ref name = "morris2008_396"/>, he argues that the [[Yishuv]] was indeed threatened with extinction and feared what would happen if the Arabs won.<ref>[[Benny Morris]] (2004), pp.589-590.</ref>  [[Yoav Gelber]], on the other hand, regards these public statements as  'meaningless' and judges that the 'actions [of their armies] imply that the aims of the Arab invasion were decidedly limited and focused mainly on saving Arab Palestine from total Jewish domination'<ref>[[Yoav Gelber]], ''[http://www.azure.org.il/article.php?id=475 The Jihad that wasn't]'', Autumn 2008, n<U+00B0>34.</ref>.

==== Against Jews outside Palestine ====

Jewish population centers in Arab countries outside Palestine also became threatened, in relation to the partition plan. On November 14, 1947, the Egyptian delegate at the United Nations stated that: 'The proposed solution might endanger a million Jews living in the Muslim countries. Partition of Palestine might create in those countries an anti-Semitism even more difficult to root out than the antisemitism which the Allies tried to eradicate in Germany'<ref>[[Malka Hillel Shulewitz]] (2000), p.84.</ref> Indeed, the UN declaration of partition, though it was generally met with by peaceful protests in Arab countries, provided the pretext for a pogrom in [[Aden]] soon after, on 2 December, 1947, in which 82 Jews were killed. <ref>Reuben Ahroni, ''The Jews of the British Crown Colony of Aden: history, culture, and ethnic relations,'' Brill, 1994 p.210</ref>

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported a memorandum of the [[World Jewish Congress]] expressing concerns about this situation in the edition of 16 May, 1948 in an article enitled : "Jews in grave danger in all Moslem lands: Nine hundred thousand in Africa and Asia face the wrath of their foes".<ref>[[New York Times]], 16 May 1948, retrievable [http://theoccupation.net/images/NYTimes_1948_Jews_in_Arab.jpg here]</ref> At Cairo in Egypt, between June and November 1948, several bombing attacks took place against Jews, killings several dozens of them.<ref>[[Joel Beinin]] (1998), pp.68-69.</ref>

=== "Purity of arms" ===
{{main|Purity of arms}}

During the conflit between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of "[[Purity of arms]]" was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to principle.<ref name = "shapira1"/> Generally speaking, this precept requires that "weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people".<ref name = "shlaimdebate">[[Avi Shlaim]], ''[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf The Debate About 1948]'', International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27:3, 1995, pp.287-304.</ref> But if it "remained a central value in education" it was "rather vague and intentionally blurred" at the practical level.<ref name = "shapira1">[[Anita Shapira]] (1992), p.252.</ref>.

In 1946, at a meeting hold between and the heads of the [[Haganah]], Ben Gurion prophetised the confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. For what concerns the "principle of purity of arms", he stressed that : "The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds"<ref name = "shapira2">[[Anita Shapira]] (1992), p.295.</ref> and during the 1948 War, the [[MAPAM]], the political party affiliated to [[Palmah]], asked "a strict observance of the Jewish [[Purity of arms]] to secure the moral character of [the] war".<ref name = "gelber1948">[[Yoav Gelber]] (2006), p.291.</ref>

When he was criticized by MAPAM members for his attitude concerning the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Arab refugee problem]], David Ben Gurion reminded them the events of Lydda and Ramle and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible of the "outrage that had encouraged the Arabs'flight made the party uncomfortable."<ref name ="gelber1948"/>

According to [[Avi Shlaim]], "purity of arms"  is one of the key features of 'the conventional Zionist account or old history' whose 'popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war' is 'taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad'.<ref name = "shlaimdebate"/> [[Benny Morris]] adds that 'after the war, the Israelis tended to hail the "purity of arms" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.' According to him, 'this reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them "sell" the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy'.<ref name = "Morris_2008"/>

=== Events of al-Tantura ===
{{main|al-Tantura}}

There is a controversy among historians for what concerns the events of al-Tantura. On the night between 22 and 23 May 1948, soldiers of the Alexandroni brigade attacked the village. The fightings caused the deaths of a few dozens of Arabs and 14 Israeli soldiers.<ref name = "Gelber_Tantura">''[http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/05-12-14gelber-palestine-1948-appendix-III-the-tantura-blood-libel-english.pdf Folklore versus History: The Tantura Blood Libel]'', Appendix III of Yoav Gelber (2006).''</ref>

According to the analysis of [[Yoav Gelber]], based on a counting of the unhabitants, the refugees, the POW's and the deaths, there is no people missing and therefore no massacre could have occurred.<ref name = "Gelber_Tantura"/> [[Benny Morris]]'s analysis concludes that the documentation and the interviews do not prove that a massacre occured but that the hypothesis cannot be simply dismissed.<ref>''<U+00AB> [http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/04-02-06morris-the-jerusalem-report-tantura.pdf The Tantura "Massacre"] <U+00BB>'', 9 February 2004, The ''[[Jerusalem report]]''.</ref> [[Ilan Papp<U+00E9>]] considers that the testimonies of former Alexandroni soldiers and Palestinian refugees prove, on the contrary, that at least 200 unarmed Tantura villagers were killed, whether in revenge for the death of Israeli soldiers due to sniper shots or later when they were unjustifiably accused of hiding weapons.<ref>Ilan Papp<U+00E9>, ''[http://ipsnewsite.mysite4now.com/enakba/history/Pappe,%20The%20Tantura%20Case%20in%20Israel.pdf The Tantura case in Israel]'', Journal of Palestine Studies, 2001, pp. 19-39.</ref>

=== Palestinian historiography ===

[[Nadine Picaudou]] studied the evolution of Palestinian historiography on the 1948 war. She argues that the [[Deir Yassin massacre]] long remained the only one discussed 'as if it sufficed to summarize the tragedy of Palestinian victims'. She thinks that during the period for which 'collective memory conflated with Palestinian nationalist mobilization, one exemplary event sufficed to express the tragedy'. Referring to the study performed in 2007 by [[Saleh Abdel Jawad]], ''Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War'', she writes that the massacres engaged Palestinian historians' concerns relatively late, but that when 'Palestinians began to write their history, the issue of massacres inevitably became one of the relevant factors in accounting for the mass exodus.'<ref name ="Picaudou">[[Nadine Picaudou]], ''[http://www.massviolence.org/The-Historiography-of-the-1948-Wars?artpage=5-6 The Historiography of the 1948 Wars]'', Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence, November 2008.</ref>

[[Nadine Picaudou]] also underlines that 'Palestinian historiography has retained the nakba paradigm, which reduces the Palestinians to the status of passive victims of Israeli policies, as [illustrated by] the limited attention accorded by researchers to the 1947-48 battles (...)' and she cites as an example her idea that 'the Deir Yassin massacre eclipsed the battle of Deir Yassin'.<ref name ="Picaudou"/>
