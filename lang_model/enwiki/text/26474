'''''Black Ice''''' is the sixteenth studio album by the Australian rock band [[AC/DC]]. It was produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and released internationally on 17 October 2008. Guitarists [[Angus Young]] and [[Malcolm Young]] got together in London in 2003 to start composing tracks. Delays to its development occurred due to an injury to bass guitarist Cliff Williams and a change of labels from [[Atlantic Records]] to [[Sony Music]]. Recording occurred on March and April 2008 at [[The Warehouse Studio]] in Canada, the same studio as the band's previous album ''[[Stiff Upper Lip]]'', the eight-year gap between them is their longest between successive studio albums. O'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of the band's early work, as opposed to the [[blues]] orientation of predecessors ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' and ''Stiff Upper Lip'', and made suggestions such as adding "[[soul music|soul]] [[Crooner|crooning]]" to [[Brian Johnson]]'s singing. ''Black Ice'' has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio effort.

''Black Ice'' was launched exclusively in physical formats, as the group does not sell its music digitally. [[Wal-Mart|Walmart]] got exclusive rights for the North American distribution, and was released along with an extensive marketing campaign which included displays focusing on AC/DC memorabilia. Three singles were issued, "[[Rock 'N Roll Train|Rock 'n' Roll Train]]", "[[Big Jack (song)|Big Jack]]" and "[[Anything Goes (AC/DC song)|Anything Goes]]". ''Black Ice'' went to number-one in 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was the second best selling record of 2008, behind [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', and had shipped 6&nbsp;million copies worldwide by December. Critical reviews were generally positive, praising the music and resemblance to the classic AC/DC sound, although some critics found the work overly long and inconsistent. ''Black Ice'' was nominated for many awards, including the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Brit Award|Brit]], [[Juno Award|Juno]] and [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Music Award]]s; and was supported by a [[Black Ice World Tour|world tour]] between 2008 and 2010.

==Production==
''Black Ice'' marks AC/DC's sixteenth Australian issued studio album, and fifteenth internationally released. The band decided to take a break after finishing the [[Stiff Upper Lip World Tour]] in 2001, and resumed performing in 2003, with eight presentations that included AC/DC's induction in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and opening three concerts for [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[A Bigger Bang Tour]].<ref>{{Cite book|pages=190-193|chapter=10: No Wuckin' Furries|title=AC/DC: High-Voltage Rock 'n' Roll: The Ultimate Illustrated History|first=Phil|last=Sutcliffe|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=2010|ISBN=0760338329}}</ref> During those two years, guitarists [[Angus Young]] and [[Malcolm Young]] wrote music separately, and then met in a London studio to work on new songs.<ref name=guitarworld>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/acdc_the_big_chill?page=0%2C1|page=2|title=AC/DC: The Big Chill|date=January 2009|first=Alan|last=di Perna|journal=[[Guitar World]]|publisher=[[Future US]]|ASIN=B001LNP3IO|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref>

With ''Black Ice'', Brendan O'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of their early work on albums such as ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' and ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]''.

Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit their style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive.<ref name="news.com.au"/> The highly demanding singing style led to Johnson only recording his vocals for one hour a day.<ref name=let/> The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records, with Cliff Williams playing [[bassline]]s of [[eighth note]]s,<ref name=rs/> and [[Phil Rudd]]'s drumming being a consistent [[Time signature|4/4 time]], mostly on his [[snare drum|snare]], [[kick drum]] and [[hi-hat|hi-hat cymbal]]. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd declared, "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added "[i]n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".<ref>{{Cite news|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090505231757/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/acdc_and_the_gospel_of_rock/page/3|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/acdc_and_the_gospel_of_rock/page/3|archivedate=5 May 2005|title=AC/DC and the Gospel of Rock & Roll|author=[[David Fricke|Fricke, David]]|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=13 November 2008|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>

==Packaging==
The cover of ''Black Ice'' was drawn by Joshua Marc Levy, art director for Columbia and a long time fan. In an interview with a fansite, Levy compared his enigmatic design to a road covered with [[black ice]], which is "not obvious to the driver" and takes a while to be understood.<ref name=highway/>There are four different covers, the standard edition with the red logo, the deluxe edition with a blue logo, and two variants to the regular design including using yellow or white-coloured logos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acdc.com/us/acdc-today/acdcs-black-ice-released-october-20th-2008|title=AC/DC's ''Black Ice'' Released October&nbsp;20th, 2008|publisher=AC/DC official website|accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> Many drawings were based on the working title ''Runaway Train'',<ref name=collector/> including the regular and the deluxe edition overall design resembling a train, "that travels around the world to spread the rock machine", according to Levy.<ref name=highway/> Levy worked on the cover while travelling with [[Pearl Jam]] on their [[Pearl Jam 2008 United States Tour|2008 tour]]. After doing the yellow version's artwork, Levy was requested to do two more in the same style, which became the red and white varieties. Then, during the promotional shoots, Levy made the deluxe edition art.<ref name=collector>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buoy.com/~bonfire/interviews.htm#levy|title=Interview with Joshua Levy|publisher=Highway to Hell|author=Voccia, Bill|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> 

The centre of the standard, red logo artwork, has a watch behind the lightning of the AC/DC logo, representing a "temporal explosion", with the [[Tribal art|tribal motifs]] representing a special tribe, the AC/DC fandom. Wings form clouds above the watch to represent "eternal time". Angus appears atop the watch "controlling time" and on the sides wearing a [[straitjacket]] to "represent the folly of the group and the strength of his sound, this mix of guitars that makes you lose your footing". To fit the title ''Black Ice'', the image was printed with [[lacquer]] and [[varnish]] to give an ice-like quality, and the AC/DC logo is filled with photographs of [[ice crystals]].<ref name=highway>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highwaytoacdc.com/index.php?articleid=659|title=Interview de Joshua Marc Levy, auteur de la pochette de Black Ice|publisher=Highway to AC/DC|language=French|date=December 2009|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> The booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer [[Guido Karp]] (who toured with AC/DC during their Stiff Upper Lip World Tour),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidokarp.com/files/Guido%20Karp%20Biography%20English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Biography|publisher=[[Guido Karp]]|accessdate=16 March 2011|quote=2001 tours: AC/DC Stiff Upper Lip world tour}}</ref> in August 2008 in London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guidokarp.blogspot.com/2009/11/guido-karp-photo-shoot-with-acdc-london.html|title=Guido Karp photo shoot with AC/DC - London Aug 2008 |date=6 November 2009|publisher=Guido Karp|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>
