'''John Hurst Edmondson''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (8 October 1914 &ndash; 14 April 1941) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Early life==
John Hurst Edmondson was born at [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales]]. His parents moved to the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] where he attended [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] and later became a farm worker.

==World War II==
On 20 May 1940 he enlisted in the [[2/17th Battalion (Australia)|2/17th Battalion]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&VeteranID=134606|title=World War II Nominal Roll - Edmondson, John Hurst|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> after serving with the 4th Militia Battalion. He was promoted to corporal. After training at Ingleburn and Bathurst, his battalion embarked for the [[Middle East]] on 19 October 1940 as reinforcements for the 9th Division. After desert training, his division relieved the 6th Australian Division at Marsa Brega in [[Cyrenaica]] on 9 March 1941. On 31 March, the German forces under the command of General [[Erwin Rommel]] mounted an attack on the Australian and British positions, forcing them to retreat. The 9th Division took up new positions outside the port of [[Tobruk]] and on 11 April, the now famous siege began.  

The passage in the [[London Gazette]] of 1 July 1941, gave the following details of Edmondson's deeds:<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35207|date=1 July 1941|startpage=3807|endpage=3808|supp=yes|accessdate= 2 August 2008}}</ref>

''"On the night of 13th-14th&nbsp;April, 1941, a party of German infantry broke through the wire defences at Tobruk, and established themselves with at least six machine guns, mortars and two small field pieces. It was decided to attack them with bayonets, and a party consisting of one officer, Corporal Edmondson and five privates, took part in the charge. During the counter-attack Corporal Edmondson was wounded in the neck and stomach but continued to advance under heavy fire and killed one enemy with his bayonet. Later, his officer had his bayonet in one of the enemy and was grasped about the legs by him, when another attacked him from behind. He called for help, and Corporal Edmondson, who was some yards away, immediately came to his assistance and in spite of his wounds, killed both of the enemy. This action undoubtedly saved his officer's life.''

''Shortly after returning from this successful counter-attack, Corporal Edmondson died of his wounds. His actions throughout the operations were outstanding for resolution, leadership and conspicuous bravery."''

An hour later, 200 German infantrymen attacked the post, forcing the Australians to withdraw, and established a bridgehead in the outer defensive line. However, the fierceness of the platoon's defence pressured Rommel into diverting troops from his main attack. The attack failed, with the German tanks being mauled and forced to retreat with heavy casualties. 

Corporal John Edmondson died of his wounds and is buried in the [[Tobruk]] war cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2225183|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission - Edmondson, John Hurst|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> He was the first Australian to receive the Victoria Cross in the war. Edmondson's VC was presented to his mother by the Governor-General on 27 September 1941. In 1969, she presented her son's medals and some of his personal belongings to the [[Australian War Memorial]], where they still are on display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/virtualtour/valour.asp|title=Hall of Valour - Victoria Crosses at the Memorial|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref>
