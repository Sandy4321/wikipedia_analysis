The [[Mount Adams Wilderness]] comprises the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is part of the [[Yakama Nation]].<ref name="GPNF"/>

Adams' asymmetrical and broad body rises {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. Air travelers flying the busy routes above the area sometimes confuse Mount Adams with nearby [[Mount Rainier]], which has a similar flat-topped shape.

The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] traverses the western flank of the mountain.<ref>

Although Adams has not erupted in over 1,400 years, it is not considered extinct.
== History ==
Native Americans in the area have composed many legends concerning the three "smoking mountains" that guard the [[Columbia River]]. According to the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] tale, Wy'east ([[Mount Hood]]) and Pahto (Mount Adams; also called Paddo or Klickitat by native peoples) were the sons of the [[Great Spirit]]. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough ([[Mount St. Helens]]). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy'east struck his brother hard so that Pahto's head was flattened and Wy'east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance). Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.<ref>

Between 1830 and 1834 [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. Mount Hood, in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President [[John Adams]] but a mistake by a mapmaker placed the ''Mount Adams'' name north of Mount Hood and about 40 miles (60&nbsp;km) east of Mount St. Helens. By sheer coincidence there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.<ref>

In 1929 and 1931 Wade Dean filed mining claims to the [[sulfur]] on Adams' {{convert|210|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} summit plateau. After building a horse and mule trail, he had a diamond-tipped drilling machine moved to the summit area and test pits were drilled. Although sulfur sludge was found, the amount and quality of the ore was never good enough to make the venture profitable and the project was abandoned in 1959. Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.<ref name="Vallance"/>

== Glaciers ==
[[Image:MountAdamsWashington.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mount Adams southeast side, showing the heavily glaciated cirque.]]

Ice, mostly in the form of glaciers, covers about {{convert|6.2|sqmi|km2|1}} of the mountain's upper cone. Water from melting ice and rain slowly percolates through the very porous interior of the main cone and flows out through springs near the base of the volcano. 

Glaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface but during the last [[ice age]] about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the Adams, Klickitat, Lyman, and White Salmon) originate from Adams' summit ice cap. On the northwest face of the mountain, [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] cascades down a steep channel in a series of [[icefall]]s before spreading out and terminating at around the {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}. [[Klickitat Glacier]] on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} wide [[cirque]] and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around {{convert|6000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}. In the Cascades, Adams Glacier is second in size only to [[Carbon Glacier]] on Mount Rainier.<ref name="Wood"/>

== Geology ==

Adams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an {{convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on}} diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of {{convert|250|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. The volcano has a volume of {{convert|85|cumi|km3|sigfig=2}} placing it second only to [[Mount Shasta]] in that category among the Cascade stratovolcanoes.<ref name="Scott"/>  Mount Adams was probably created by the subduction of the [[Juan de Fuca plate]], which is located just off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].

Mount Adams was born in the relatively late [[Pleistocene]] and grew in several pulses of mostly [[lava]]-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy during which glaciers eroded the mountain to below {{convert|9000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}. [[Potassium-argon dating]] has identified two such eruptive periods; the first occurring 275,000 to 200,000 years ago and the second 150,000 to 100,000 years ago. Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the volcano, consist of lava flows with little [[tephra]]. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of [[breccia]]ted lava.<ref name="Scott"/>

[[Image:Adams04 mount adams from st helens 12-28-04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mount Adams as seen from [[Mount St. Helens]]]]

[[Andesite]] and [[basalt]] flows formed a {{convert|20|to|200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of [[dacite]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last [[ice age]]. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily [[erosion|eroded]] andesite fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into [[clay]]s (mostly [[kaolinite]]), [[iron oxide]]s, [[sulfur]]-rich compounds and [[quartz]].<ref name="Hoblitt"/>

The present eruptive cone above {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=2}} was constructed sometime between 25,000 to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least seven times, all of which were above {{convert|6500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} on the summit. One of the most recent flows issued from South Butte and created the {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500 year old [[Mount St. Helens]] ash on it meaning it is at least that old. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams are the 2,500 to 3,500 year old Muddy Fork lava flows.<ref name="Wright"/>

The Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large [[debris flow]] from Adams and the only large one since the end of the last Ice Age. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} of the White Salmon River valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest [[avalanche]] on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} and its debris covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|1}} of the upper Salt Creek area. Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.<ref name="Hoblitt">

Since then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including [[hydrogen sulfide]]) have occurred especially on the summit plateau. This indicates that Adams is dormant, not extinct. It still has the potential to become active. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.<ref name="Hoblitt"/>

The [[Indian Heaven]] [[volcanic field]] is located between St. Helens and Adams. Its principal feature are an {{convert|18|mi|km|-1}} long linear zone of shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and flows with volumes of up to {{convert|23|cumi|km3|-1}}. The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.<ref name="Wood">

== Summit area ==

[[File:Mt Adams Cascades.jpg|thumb|left|Mt. Adams from approximately {{convert|20000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}]]

Contrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit rises {{convert|11500|ft|m|sigfig=3}} on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about {{convert|800|ft|m|sigfig=2}} higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress trending from the false summit down to an elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late [[Pleistocene]]. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from Adams and White Salmon glaciers. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.<ref name="Scott"/>

== Area around Adams ==

Mount Adams is surrounded by a variety of other volcanic features and [[volcano]]es. The largest flank volcano is a [[basalt]]ic [[shield volcano]] on Adams east base called Goat Butte. This structure is at least 150,000 years old.

Little Mount Adams is a symmetrical [[volcanic cone#Cinder cone|cinder cone]] on top of the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' southeast flank.<ref>

Lavas from its base flowed into the Cispus Valley where they were later modified by glaciers.  At the {{convert|7500|ft|m|sigfig=2}} level on Adams' south flank is South Butte. The lavas associated with this structure are all younger than Suksdorf Ridge but were emplaced before the end of the ice age.<ref name="MZ"/>

Located a few miles north of Adams is [[Goat Rocks Wilderness]] and the heavily eroded ruins of a stratovolcano that is much older than Adams. Unlike Adams, the [[Goat Rocks]] volcano was periodically explosive and deposited ash 2.5 million years ago that later solidified into {{convert|2100|ft|m|sigfig=2}} thick [[tuff]] layers.<ref>
