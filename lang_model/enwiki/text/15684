'''Charles Frederick Elsey''' [[CBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (1882{{spaced ndash}}1966) was a British [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse trainer]]. The son and father of successful trainers, Elsey was one of the dominant racing figures in the North of England for more than thirty years in a career which lasted from 1911 until 1960. He trained the winners of six [[British Classic Races|classics]] and numerous major [[handicap race|handicaps]] and was the [[British flat racing Champion Trainer|Champion Trainer]] in 1956.

==Background==
Charles Elsey was born in 1882 in [[Baumber]], [[Lincolnshire]], where his father, William Elsey ran a very successful racing stable. Elsey was a heavily-built man, with brown eyes, dark eyebrows and an [[aquiline nose]]. He began training in 1911 at the Glasgow House Stable at [[Middleham]], [[North Yorkshire]], but abandoned his career in 1914 on the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. He served in the [[Yorkshire Hussars]] and the [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]], attaining the rank of [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] and being awarded the [[Military Cross]]. After the end of the war, he did not return immediately to racing, spending two years farming in Lincolnshire.<ref name="Mortimer">{{cite book | last1 = Mortimer|first1=Roger |last2=Onslow|first2=Richard|last3=Willett|first3=Peter| title=Biographical Encyclopedia of British Flat Racing|publisher=Macdonald and Jane<U+2019>s| year=1978|isbn=0-354-08536-0}}</ref>

==Training career==
Elsey resumed his training career in 1921 at Clyde House Stable at [[Ayr]] in Scotland. He sent out Westmead to win the [[Ayr Gold Cup]] in 1924 before moving his base to Highfield Stable in [[Malton, North Yorkshire]] in 1926. In the following three decades he established himself as one of the leading trainers in the North of England, achieving particular success in major [[handicap races]], including the [[Wokingham Stakes]], [[Ebor Handicap]], [[Northumberland Plate]], [[Cesarewitch]], [[Chester Cup]] and [[Cambridgeshire Handicap]].<ref name="Mortimer"/>

After the Second World War, Elsey continued his success in handicaps, but began to also send out winners of major [[weight-for-age]] races. In 1949 he won both the [[1000 Guineas]] and the [[Epsom Oaks]] with the filly [[Musidora (horse)|Musidora]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/69361301|title=BRITT AGAIN IN CLOSE FINISH LONDON |publisher=The Advocate (Burnie) |date=3 Jun 1949 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> Three years later he won a second Oaks with [[Frieze (horse)|Frieze]] and the [[Middle Park Stakes]] with the colt [[Nearula]]. In the following year Nearula won the [[2000 Guineas]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/55801585? |title=Nearula's Win In Guineas |publisher=The West Australian |date=6 May 1953 |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> [[St James's Palace Stakes]] and [[Champion Stakes]]. At the end of the year the Highfield Stable was badly damaged in a fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/27191267? |title=Star Colt Saved From Fire |publisher=[[The Mercury (Hobart)]] |date=26 Oct 1953 |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> In 1954 he won the Chester Cup with his own horse Peperium a four-year-old who was chronically unsound and required the most gentle and careful training.  Elsey won a fifth classic in 1956 when the filly Honeylight recorded an upset victory in the 1000 Guineas. Elsey won the title of [[British flat racing Champion Trainer]] for the first and only time at the end of the 1956 season at the age of seventy-four. In the following year, the Highfield three-year-old Tenterhooks emerged as one of the year's best stayers, winning the [[Queen's Vase]], [[Ascot Stakes]] and [[Goodwood Cup]]. Elsey's last major winner was [[Cantelo]], a filly who won the [[Royal Lodge Stakes]] in 1958 before taking the [[Cheshire Oaks]] and [[Ribblesdale Stakes]] in 1959 and winning a controversial race for the [[St Leger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GoNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7uQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3288,3628260&dq=cantelo+leger&hl=en |title=Classic winner hooted |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=14 September 1959 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>

==Retirement==
Elsey suffered from [[arthritis]] in his later years and his mobility was restricted, leading him to depend on [[walking stick]]s from 1958. He retired from training in 1960 at the age of 78, leaving the Highfield Stable to his son [[Bill Elsey|Charles William Carlton "Bill" Elsey]] who had acted as his assistant trainer for several years. He continued to pursue an interest in [[field sports]], and was an expert [[shooting|shot]]. Elsey's right leg was amputated in October 1965 and he died at Highfield on 14 February 1966.<ref name="Mortimer"/>
