'''Peter''' ({{lang-bg|<U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+044A><U+0440>}}) ([[floruit|fl.]] 860s<U+2013>870s) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] noble and relative of ''[[knyaz]]'' ([[Khan (title)|khan]]) [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (r. 852<U+2013>889) who was in charge of diplomatic missions during the [[Christianization of Bulgaria]]. His position in the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] administrative hierarchy is unknown but it has been suggested that he had the title ''[[kavhan]]'', i. e. the second person in the state after the monarch.

==Historical background==
[[File:Bulgaria under rule of Boris I.png|thumb|200px|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the mid 9th century|Map of Bulgaria in the 860s.]]
When Boris I assumed the throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] elite being [[Tengriism|Tengriists]] while the Slavic population practised its [[Slavic mythology|own religion]]. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and seems to have been influential. Even one of the sons of Khan [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]] (r. 814<U+2013>831), [[Enravota]], converted to Christianity.<ref>Andreev, p. 67</ref> The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion&nbsp;<U+2014> Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and [[East Francia]]; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs.<ref>Andreev, pp. 73-74</ref><ref name="f118">Fine, p. 118</ref> The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the [[Catholic Church|Papacy in Rome]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] for influence in Central Europe.<ref>Runciman, pp. 99-101</ref> That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence.<ref>Andreev, p. 77</ref> When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael III]].<ref name="f118"/> That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families.<ref>Fine, p. 119</ref> When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an [[autocephalous]] Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.<ref>Fine, p. 120</ref>

==Missions to Rome==
According to the historical sources there were three Bulgarian missions to the [[Pope]] with the participation of Peter, the first one being in the summer of 866. The interest of Boris I in the Roman Church was caused by the reluctance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to accept his request to appoint an independent [[patriarch]] (or at least an [[archbishop]]) for the Bulgarian diocese in order to retain it subordinated to Constantinople. Boris I was determined to make Bulgaria Christian while keeping the country's religious and political independence.<ref>Beck, 1980, p. 104</ref> Since the end of the 850s the churches of Rome and Constantinople were in a period of a heated competition for influence over the [[Slavs]] and the Ecumenical Church power.<ref>Sabev, pp. 198-201</ref> This rivalry favoured Boris' plans, as it gave him the opportunity to play one side off against the other and choose. The new orientation of the Bulgarian policy also allowed Boris I to calm down the nobility of the [[boyars]], which was cautious and hostile to the increased [[Byzantine]] influence in the country after the Christianization.<ref>Fine, 1983, pp. 120-121</ref>

===First mission===
The first Bulgarian delegation arrived before [[Pope Nicholas I]] on 29 August 866<ref name="G197">Gyuzelev, 1969, pp. 197-199</ref>&nbsp;<U+2014> the very same year during which Boris quelled the rebellion of the boyars against Christianization. Among the gifts presented to the Pope by the delegation was the weapon of Boris "with which [he] was armed when in the name of Christ he celebrated over his enemies".<ref name="G197"/> The Bulgarians also brought a document with questions by their ruler to the Pope. The content of the questions is reproduced on paragraph 106 of the "Answers of Pope Nicolas to the questions of the Bulgarians".<ref>Zlatarski, p. 107</ref> The arrival of the Bulgarian envoys in [[Rome]] was a very important event. The Pope enthusiastically spread the news in a letter to [[Hincmar|Hincmar of Reims]] and the other archbishops of the [[Frankish Empire]].<ref name="G197"/><ref>LIBI, II., pp. 63-64</ref>
{{cquote|...When we were embarrassed from everywhere by those troubles and were troubled by great obstacles&nbsp;<U+2014> there, we were all of a sudden informed that envoys of the already mentioned Bulgarian prince have arrived. Therefore who is the one, who can tell with what joy and what infinite rejoice we were filled, when we understood for their salvaging baptism due to the generosity of God's goodness and when we understood that they have sought for explanation of the teachings of Christ from the venerable apostle Peter, i. e. from his Holy See: they, even though were far away, remained close through the faith but also because we saw that an easy land route was revealed through their lands for our envoys to the land of the Greeks.}}

[[File:Rom Lateran Kreuzgang 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A medieval cloister|The cloister of the [[Lateran Palace]].]]
That Bulgarian mission was mentioned thirteen years later (June 879) in a letter to Boris I, with which [[Pope John VIII]] tried to prevent Bulgaria from returning to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. That letter proves Peter's participation in the mission of 866:<ref>Zlatarski, p. 105, note 2</ref><ref>LIBI, II., pp. 164-165</ref><ref name="B189">Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 189</ref>
{{cquote|To our favourite and spiritual son Michael, the glorious Prince of the Bulgarians. ...you sent during the time of our predecessor, the venerable Pope Nicolas, your envoys, namely Peter, your relative, John and Martin, to the Cathedral of the venerable apostle Peter, which is a head and a teacher of all Churches of God... we advise your highness to humbly and voluntarily return to the holy Roman Church, your mother, so that, helped by the prayers of the holy apostles, you can easily conquer both your visible and invisible enemies.}}

The Bulgarian envoys received the answers of Pope Nicolas I at a ceremony in the [[Lateran Palace]] on 13 November 866.<ref name="G209">Gyuzelev, p. 209-210</ref> Soon after that Peter and the other envoys returned to their country along with the papal emissaries [[Pope Formosus|Formosus of Portus]] and Paul of Populona. Both bishops exercised educative activities in Bulgaria. Along with Peter departed other Papal envoys, the bishop of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] Donatus, the [[presbyter]] Leo and the deacon of the apostolic episcopacy [[Pope Marinus I|Marinus]], who had to continue to Constantinople and there clarify the policy of Rome to the Bulgarians.<ref name="G209"/><ref name="Zl125">Zlatarski, pp. 125-126</ref>

===Second mission===
[[File:CividaleGospel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A page of a medieval manuscript|A page of the Cividale gospel.]]
The abilities and the efforts of Formosus of Portus impressed Boris I.<ref name="Zl129">Zlatarski, p. 129</ref><ref name="G225">Gyuzelev, p. 225</ref><ref>Later the opponents of Formosus accused him that he took advantage of Boris' trust and forced him to swear that he would propose him to the Pope for archbishop of the Bulgarians (see Hergenr<U+00F6>ther, p. 616)</ref> No later than a year after his first mission in Rome, Peter was put in charge of a second one in order to arrange the ordination of Formosus as Bulgarian archbishop.<ref>Gyuzelev notes that the request of Boris I was put forward by the Bulgarian embassy in the second half of 867 (see Gyuzelev, p 226). According to Zlatarski the Pope was informed of the requests of the Bulgarian ruler in written from and the lack of an answer led to the new mission.</ref> The Bulgarian delegation arrived in Rome in the second half of 867.<ref name="G226">Gyuzelev p. 226</ref> Nicolas I declined the proposal concerning Formosus and accepted only the other request of Boris I&nbsp;<U+2014> to send more presbyters to Bulgaria. The [[Roman Curia|curia]] prepared a group of clerics led by Dominic of Trivena and Gromuald of Polymartis.<ref name="G228">Gyuzelev, pp. 228-230</ref> The unexpected death of Nicolas I on 13 November 867 postponed the papal response and the departure of the group.<ref name="G228"/> Peter and the other Bulgarian diplomats participated in the burial of the deceased Pope and waited in Rome until the election of a new pontiff.<ref name="G228"/> The new Pope [[Pope Hadrian II|Hadrian II]] confirmed the decisions of his predecessor.<ref name="G228"/> In the middle of December the delegation headed back for the Bulgarian capital [[Pliska]] by land, with letters to the Bulgarian prince written by Nicolas I. En route to Bulgaria the delegation stayed in the monastery of the town [[Aquileia]], an event noted in the Cividale gospel<ref name="G230">Gyuzelev, pp. 230-231</ref> in which an unknown monk wrote down the names of the Bulgarian envoys and the members of their families:<ref name="G230"/><ref>Ivanov, Y., ''The Bulgarian Names in the Cividale Gospel'' in ''Collection in honour of Professor [[Lyubomir Miletich|L. Miletich]]'', Macedonian Scientific Institute, 1933, p. 630</ref>
{{cquote|...From Bulgaria, who came first in that monastery, his name is Sondoka and his wife Anna, and his father John, and his mother Maria, and his son Michael, and his other son Velegnev, and his daughter Bogomila, and the other one Kalya, and the third Marta, and the forth Elena, and the fifth Maria, and his other wife Sobeslava. And the other noble man Peter... and George. Peter and his wife Sofia.}}

The delegation arrived in Pliska in the beginning of 868.<ref name="G233">Gyuzelev, pp. 233-235</ref> Boris I learned that the Pope had offered him to choose the archbishop of the Bulgarian Church from among the presbyters he had sent.<ref name="S210">Sabev p. 210</ref> By order Hadrian II, Formosus of Portus and Paul of Populona returned to Rome as early as February in the same year,<ref name="G233"/> accompanied by Peter.<ref name="G233"/><ref name="B183">Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 183</ref><ref>Zlatarski gives another chronology, pp. 141-142.

===Third mission===
The historical source for the positions of the Bulgarian ruler is the biography of Pope Hadrian II, written by the Vatican librarian [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius|Anastasius]]:<ref name="G234">Gyuzelev, p. 234</ref><ref>LIBI pp. 193-194</ref>
{{cquote|...That envoy [Peter] brought along with the kingly gifts a letter from the Prince [Boris I], who asked the high primate to send him either the well known Marinus, after ordaining him as an archbishop, or send one of the cardinals of his Church&nbsp;<U+2014> the most worthy man to be chosen by the Bulgarians for an archbishop because of his wisdom, character and life, and after being approved by them and returns to the Pope, to be awarded the title of archbishop.}}
[[File:PopeFormosusBW.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A portrait of a pope|[[Pope Formosus|Formosus of Portus]].]]
It is certain that the idea for the application of Marinus was suggested to Boris I by Formosus of Portus.<ref name="G234"/> Formosus and Marinus were friends and close associates.<ref name="G236">Gyuzelev, p. 236</ref><ref>After Marinus was elected Pope in 882, he revoked the oath of Formosus never to set foot in Rome and returned his holy orders taken during a synod in 876 by [[Pope John VIII]] (See Gregorovius F., R<U+00FC>hl F., ''[http://books.google.de/books?id=dy8QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA225 Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter]'', vol. 3, 1862, p. 225 and {{BBKL|f/formosus_p|band=2|autor=Friedrich Wilhelm Bautz|artikel=Formosus, Papst|spalten=70-71}}).</ref> Marinus was an influential diplomat who participated in many missions between Rome and Constantinople. However, Hadrian II did not approve of him and suggested for the office one of his trusted men&nbsp;<U+2014> the [[subdeacon]] Silvester.<ref name="S210"/><ref name="G236"/> With his decision the Pope underestimated the ambitions of Boris I for independent church policy,<ref>Gyuzelev pp. 234-236</ref> which led to the alienation of the Bulgarian ruler from Rome<ref>Fine, p. 123</ref> and indirectly helped the Patriarchate of Constantinople in its efforts to influence the events in Bulgaria.<ref>Beck, p. 109 and Schubert H. v., ''[http://books.google.de/books?id=p_dWV_nWkfAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Geschichte+der+christlichen+Kirche+im+Fr%C3%BChmittelalter&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=9w1rk6EX5JCUxDa6WfIMxnR1ghw#PPA517,M1 Geschichte der christlichen Kirche im Fr<U+00FC>hmittelalter. Ein Handbuch.]'', T<U+00FC>bingen, 1921, p. 517</ref>

When in the beginning of 868 Peter and Formosus arrived in Rome, the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] and their disciples were there on invitation by the Pope.<ref name="B205">Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 205</ref> Formosus and bishop Gauderig of Veletria ordained many of the brothers' disciples for priests, deacons and subdeacons.<ref name="B205"/> It has been suggested that Peter was among the first high-ranking Bulgarians who were acquainted with the ideas of Cyril and Methodius and brought the news to Bulgaria.<ref name="B205"/>

The refusal of Hadrian II to ordain a candidate approved by Boris exhausted the patience of the Bulgarian prince.<ref name="L53">Litavrin, p. 53</ref> After a three-month stay in Bulgaria Silvester returned to Rome with a letter to the Pope<ref name="B183"/> in which for the last time Boris I insisted that either Formosus or Marinus be ordained, but the Pope declined the proposal once again.<ref name="B183G144">See Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, p. 183. There is a hypothesis that Silvester was accompanied by Peter in his trip to Bulgaria and back to Rome and the refusal was delivered to Peter (i. e., he had at least four travels to Rome, see Gyuzelev, p 144)</ref> During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Ignatius]],<ref name="L53"/> who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual [[anathema]]s made in 863 by his predecessor [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] and Pope Nicolas I.<ref>In 863 Photios was anathematized by a Roman council and in the same year he pronounced anathema against the Pope (See Litavrin, p. 54).</ref> Just like Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a permanent establishment of the Roman Church in Bulgaria.<ref name="L52">Litavrin, p. 52</ref> In order to settle the differences between the two Churches, the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Eighth Ecumenical Council]] was planned to be held in Constantinople in 869.<ref>Gyuzelev, p. 246</ref> After a long stay in Rome (868<U+2013>869), Peter returned to Bulgaria and was immediately sent to participate in the council.<ref>Gyuzelev, p. 144</ref>

==Mission to Constantinople==
The Eighth Ecumenical Council was inaugurated on 5 October 869.<ref name="B184">Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, pp. 184-185</ref> Besides the representatives of Rome and Constantinople, the event was attended by envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs of [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]].<ref name="B184"/> The Papal legates were unaware of the secret negotiations between Bulgaria and Byzantium and did not expect to discuss the status of the Bulgarian Church on the council.<ref name="B184"/><ref>The Papal delegates were concentrated on the following issues&nbsp;<U+2014> recognition of the [[papal supremacy|Pope's supremacy]], condemnation of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], Photios and his supporters, recognition of the Roman decisions concerning Ignatius, rejection of all decisions against him in all councils organized by Photios and full recognition of Ignatius as a Patriarch. (See Zlatarski, p. 147)</ref> As a result they were very surprised too see high-ranking Bulgarian envoys attending the official closure of the Council on 28 February 870: the ''[[ichirgu-boil]]'' Stazis, ''khan-bagatur'' Sondoke, ''khan-tarkan'' Iliya, ''sampsis'' Persiyan and ''sampsis'' Alexius Hunol.<ref name="B184"/><ref>The historical source for the names of the Bulgarian envoys comes from Anastasius Bibliothecarius. He possessed a personal copy of the last session which he later translated into Latin (See Zlatarski, pp. 753-754). The translation reads ''"...similiter et gloriosissimi iudices Michaelis sublimissi principis Bulgariae Stasiszerco borlas nesundicus vgantus il vetrannabare, preastit zisunas campsis, et Alexios Sampsi..."'' (''"...on the same way [were seated] also the most glorious judges of the Bulgarian Prince Michael Stasiszerco borlas nesundicus vgantus il vetrannabare, preastit zisunas campsis, et Alexios Sampsi..."'', see LIBI, II, p. 208). According to Zlatarski the fact that Peter is not mentioned is due either to a deliberate or to an unintentional error of the translator. He suggests that Stasis is in fact Peter pointing out that the names ''Stasis'' and ''Petrus'' contain the same number of letters (see Zlatarski pp. 755-756).</ref>

On 4 March 870, three days after the Council's final session, Emperor [[Basil I]] invited the participants to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Imperial Palace]]: Patriarch Ignatius, the Papal legates Donatus of Ostia, Stephen of Nep and deacon Marinus, as well as the representatives of the Eastern Patriarchs archdeacon Joseph (from Alexandria), bishop Thomas of Tyre (from Antioch) and presbyter Elijah (from Jerusalem), telling them that Peter was bringing gifts from the Bulgarian Prince.<ref name="S213">Sabev, pp. 213-214</ref> After the exchange of greetings Peter, who had been instructed in advance, raised the issue of the jurisdiction over the Bulgarian Church<ref>Fine, p. 124</ref> and turned to the assembled men:<ref>Anastasius Bibliothecarius, ''Biography of Pope Hadrian II'', cited by Zlatarski, pp. 149-153 (see also LIBI, II, pp. 188-195)</ref>
{{cquote|Up to now we were pagans and not long ago we entered the blessing of Christianity; that is why, in order not to make mistakes, we want to known from you, who represent the supreme Patriarchs, to which Church are we to obey...}}
The Roman legates answered:<ref name="Zl149">Zlatarski, pp. 149-153</ref>
{{cquote|To the holy Roman Church, to which through you, Peter, your lord came to the venerable Prince of the apostle Peter along with the whole realm of his people...}}

In order to take decision the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question:<ref name="B184"/><ref name="Zl149"/> ''"When you took [your] Motherland, tell us under which authority it used to be and were there Latin or Greek priests?"''. They gave the prepared answer:<ref name="B184"/><ref name="Zl149"/> ''"We took [our] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks and there we found not Latin but Greek priests."'' In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision:<ref name="B184"/><ref name="Zl149"/> ''"If you have found Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, as we got to know, was previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, to be now returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism."'' The protests of the Roman legates were futile.<ref name="Be109">Beck, p. 109</ref> They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it.<ref name="Be109"/><ref>From indirect evidence it can be concluded that the Pope considered the non-interference of Constantinople in the issue on Bulgarian Church as a condition for the recognition of Ignatius as a Patriarch, a fact the latter had obviously ignored (Beck, p. 109).</ref> After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.<ref name="Be109"/><ref>Zlatarski, p. 159</ref>

==Title==
In the historical literature Peter is thought to have been: ''boyar'',<ref>Irechek, K., [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/ki/index.html History of the Bulgarians], p. 661; Zlatarski, p. 859; Kosev D. and Co., ''History of Bulgaria'', Edition of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, Sofia, 1981, vol. 2, p. 472</ref><ref>LIBI, II, pp. 281, 395</ref><ref name="Andr">Andreev, Y., Lazarov, Iv., Pavlov, Pl., ''Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria'', Izdatelska kashta "Petar Beron", Sofia, 1999, ISBN 954-402-047-0, pp. 311-312</ref> ''great boil'',<ref name="Gju155">Gyuzelev, p. 155</ref> ''comita'',<ref>LIBI, II, p. 395</ref> ''ichirgu-boil''<ref>Beshevliev, p. 176</ref>  and ''kavhan'' (conditional<ref>Gyuzelev, p. 317, note 48</ref> or unconditional<ref name="Andr"/><ref>Sabev, p. 213; Fine, p. 121</ref>). The discussion on the title (or office) of Peter is part of the scientific discussion on the place of the [[ichirgu-boil]] and the [[kavhan]] in the administration of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. The starting point of those discussions is that there were one kavhan and one ichirgu-boil at the same time and that the kavhan is the higher office.<ref>see Gyuzelev, p. 114; Besevliev V., ''Die protobulgarische Periode der bulgarischen Geschichte'', Verlag Adolf M. Hakkert, Amsterdam, 1980, p. 349; [http://www.nbu.bg/index.php?l=501 Cholova, Ts.], ''On the co-ruler of the monarch of the First Bulgarian State'' in the collection ''Bulgaria 1300. Institutions and state tradition'', Bulgarian Historical Society, Sofia, 1982, vol. II, pp. 209-214, and also: [[Presian Inscription]]</ref> The different views on the functions of Peter comes from the different interpretation of the historical sources (the letters of Pope John VIII, the notes of the Cividale gospel and the story of Anastasius Bibliothecarius about the Council of Constantinople).

In 879 Pope John VIII appealed not only to Boris I but also to his close associates, including Peter. The letter was addressed to ''"Petro Cerbule et Sundice ceterisque optimatibus et consiliariis dilecti filii nostri Michaelis regis Vulgarorum"'' (''"To Peter, Tserbula and Sundika, and the other boyars and advisers of our favourite son, the Bulgarian prince Michael"'').<ref name="LIBi161">LIBI, II, p. 161</ref> The idea that ''Cerbule'' is the personal name ''Tserbula'' (''Zergobula'') is supported by [[Vasil Zlatarski|Zlatarski]].<ref>Zlatarski, p. 754</ref><ref name="Gju152">Gyuzelev, p. 152</ref> [[Veselin Beshevliev]] interprets that as a title to the personal name of Peter ''Petro cerbulae'' (''Peter ichirgu-boil'').<ref name="Gju152"/><ref>Beshevliev, p. 81</ref> According to [[Ivan Venedikov]] in 879 Peter was ichirgu-boil, having replaced Stazis.<ref name="Ve1968">Venedikov, I., ''Preslav, before it became capital of Bulgaria'' in collection ''Preslav'', I., Izdatelstvo balgarski hudozhnik, Sofia, 1968, pp. 41-42</ref><ref>see also Gyuzelev, pp. 152-153</ref> The connection of ''Cerbule'' to ''Petro'' has been rejected by [[Vasil Gyuzelev]]. He suggests that ''Cerbule'' is related to Stazis. The omission of his personal name is explained with the fact that the Roman administration could not always cope with the Bulgarian [[anthroponymy]] and used titles instead of personal names.<ref>Gyuzelev, p. 153</ref>

The historians are also not unanimous about who led the missions to Rome and Constantinople. According to Yordan Ivanov the second mission was led by Sondoke,<ref>Ivanov, p. 632; Gyuzelev adds to Ivanov's arguments the fact that Sondoke is pointed as the first one who entered the monastery near Aquilea (Gyuzelev, p. 146).</ref> while Venedikov suggests it was Stazis.<ref>Venedikov highlights the fact that the name of Stazis in the Cividale gospel is written down immediately after the family of Boris I (see also Gyuzelev, p. 146).</ref> According to Gyuzelev the leading person in the Bulgarian delegation was Peter which was made clear during the Council of Constantinople.<ref>Gyuzelev, p. 149</ref> He emphasizes that according to the story of Anastasius Bibliothecarius the gifts to the Roman legates were sent through Peter.<ref>Gyuzelev. p. 150</ref><ref>''"...principes Bulgarorum eis litteras et dona per Petrum aliosque derexerubt..."'' (''"...they heard that the Bulgarian notables had sent them letters through Peter and the others..."'', LIBI, II, p. 188)</ref> Peter is the person of the Bulgarian delegation in Constantinople who spoke at the Council. Gyuzelev also pays attention to the letters of Pope John VIII. Letters were sent to Boris I (16 April 878<ref>LIBI, II, p. 147</ref> and May 879<ref>LIBI, II, p. 160</ref>), to Doks&nbsp;<U+2014> brother of Boris I (April <span style="white-space:nowrap;">878<ref>LIBI, II, p. 154</ref>), to Peter (16 April 878<ref name="LIBi157">LIBI, II, p. 157</ref>)</span> and to high ranking boils including Peter (in the letter of May 879<ref name="LIBi161" />).<ref>Gyuzelev, pp. 151-152</ref> In the letter of April 878 addressed personally to Peter the Pope called him ''comita'' (''Petrum comitem'').<ref name="Gju152"/><ref name="LIBi157"/> It has been suggested that under ''comita'' the Pope did not mean a regional governor but ''comes palatii'', i. e. the first person in the court of the ruler.<ref name="Guj154">Gyuzelev, p. 154</ref> Gyuzelev concludes that Peter's role in the events between 866 and 879 is more important than that of the ichirgu-boil Stazis and therefore Peter must have been ''kavhan'' at least during that period.<ref name="Gju155" />
