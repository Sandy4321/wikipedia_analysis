The '''Fresh Breeze Solo''' is an [[Germany|German]] [[paramotor]] that was designed and produced by [[Fresh Breeze]] of [[Wedemark]] for [[powered paragliding]].<ref name="Cliche">Cliche, Andre: ''Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide'' 8th Edition, page D-21.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed in the 1980s to comply with German rules which are very stringent regarding safety and noise. It features a [[paraglider]]-style [[high-wing]], single-place accommodation and a single {{convert|19|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Solo 210]] engine in [[pusher configuration]], with a hand throttle control. As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="WDLA04" /><ref name="FB" />

As the company's first product it was initially known as just the ''Fresh Breeze'', but as other models were added it was renamed the ''Solo'' for its fitted engine, the Solo 210.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="WDLA04" />

To comply with German safety requirements the Solo was initially designed with a harness that allowed jettisoning the engine package in flight. This was required to reduce the risk of the pilot drowning in the event of a water landing and also to deal with a possible engine fire in flight. This feature survives in the present day ''Solo Jettison'' model. To meet noise requirements the small [[two-stroke]] engine has a complex "wrap-around" style exhaust and extra-long muffler system that results in a low sound output. The engine cylinder head is modified to improve cooling and drives a two-bladed [[carbon fibre]] propeller.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="WDLA04" />
