It may also refer to:
*[[Extraterrestrial life]], in scientific context, hypothetical life that exists outside of Earth
*[[Extraterrestrials in fiction]], describes purported alien types recovered from UFO crashes<!-- (these are usually assumed to be non-human, although theoretically a transplanted culture of humans on another planet would also qualify as extraterrestrials, as with the character of [[Jonas Quinn]] on ''[[Stargate: SG-1]]''). -->
