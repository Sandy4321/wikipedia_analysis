'''''Magical Death''''' is a documentary film by anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] and [[visual anthropology|ethnographic filmmaker]] [[Tim Asch]] that explores the role of the [[Shamanism|shaman]] within the [[Ya<U+0327>nomam<U+00F6>|Yanomamo]] culture, as well as the close relationship shamanism shares with politics within their society.

The filmmakers allegedly disputed over the content of the film when Asch objected to Chagnon's inclusion of graphic depictions of the Yanomami engaging in symbolic death and cannibalism<ref>http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2000/09/28/yanomamo/index.html</ref>.

The film was awarded the American Film Festival Blue Ribbon.
